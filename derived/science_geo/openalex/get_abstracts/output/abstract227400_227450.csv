Here we demonstrate that ceramide controls macroautophagy, a major lysosomal catabolic pathway. Exogenous C2-ceramide stimulates macroautophagy (proteolysis and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles) in the human colon cancer HT-29 cells by increasing the endogenous pool of long chain ceramides as demonstrated by the use of the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1. Ceramide reverted the interleukin 13-dependent inhibition of macroautophagy by interfering with the activation of protein kinase B. In addition, C2-ceramide stimulated the expression of the autophagy gene product beclin 1. Ceramide is also the mediator of the tamoxifen-dependent accumulation of autophagic vacuoles in the human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Monodansylcadaverine staining and electron microscopy showed that this accumulation was abrogated by myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo synthesis ceramide. The tamoxifen-dependent accumulation of vacuoles was mimicked by 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. 1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, tamoxifen, and C2-ceramide stimulated the expression of beclin 1, whereas myriocin antagonized the tamoxifen-dependent up-regulation. Tamoxifen and C2-ceramide interfere with the activation of protein kinase B, whereas myriocin relieved the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen. In conclusion, the control of macroautophagy by ceramide provides a novel function for this lipid mediator in a cell process with major biological outcomes.

In conclusion, the control of macroautophagy by ceramide provides a novel function for this lipid mediator in a cell process with major biological outcomes. Macroautophagy or autophagy is an evolutionary conserved lysosomal pathway involved in the turnover of long lived proteins and organelles (1Seglen P.O. Bohley P.

Biol. 1999; 15: 1-32Google Scholar). Autophagy starts with the formation of a multilayer membrane-bound autophagosome that sequesters fractions of the cytoplasm (4Baba M. Takeshige K. Baba N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 903-913Google Scholar, 5Fengsrud M. Roos N. Berg T. Liou W.L. Slot J.W. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 504-519Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, most of autophagosomes receive inputs from endocytic compartments before fusing with lysosomes where the degradation of the sequestered material is completed (6Stromhaug P.E. Seglen P.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 115-121Google Scholar, 7Liou W. Geuze H.J. Geelen M.J.H. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 61-70Google Scholar).The physiological importance of autophagy during starvation has been primarily highlighted in rat liver (8Mortimore G.E. Schworer C.M. Nature. 1977; 270: 174-176Google Scholar) and then in different cell types (reviewed in Refs. 9Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems.

At the same time, the term autophagic cell death or type II programmed cell death (PCD II) has been introduced (11Schweichel J.U. Merker H.J. Teratology. 1973; 7: 253-266Google Scholar) to describe a cell death different from apoptosis or type I programmed cell death (PCD I) (reviewed in Refs. 12Clarke P.G.H. Anat.

The recent progress made in characterization of the molecular mechanism controlling autophagy has brought a renewal of interest for this process (14Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Google Scholar). There is now evidence for the role of autophagy during development (15Melendez A. Tallòczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B.

Two conjugation systems (Atg5p-Atg12p and Atg8p lipidation) are involved in the formation of the autophagosome (26Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

In this complex, the protein beclin 1 (the orthologue of the yeast Atg6, see Ref. 29Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Google Scholar) is a tumor suppressor gene product (30Qu X. Yu J. Bhagat G. Furuya N. Hibshoosh H. Troxel A. Rosen J. Eskelinen E.L. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Cattoretti G.

The drug 3-MA commonly used to inhibit the autophagic pathway (32Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Google Scholar) interferes with the activity of class III PI3K to interrupt autophagy at the sequestration step (33Blommaart E.F.C. Krause U. Schellens J.P.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Google Scholar). Alternatively, the stimulation of the class I PI3K/PKB signaling pathway by growth factors and cytokines has an inhibitory effect on autophagy in many cell types (15Melendez A. Tallòczy Z. Seaman M. Eskelinen E.L. Hall D.H. Levine B. Science. 2003; 301: 1387-1391Google Scholar, 34Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Taneike I. Akaishi R. Yoshizawa F. Furuya N. Fujimura S. Kadowaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8452-8459Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect is probably due to the class I PI3K/PKB-dependent activation of the kinase target of rapamycin which down-regulates autophagy (37Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P.

Cell. 2003; 14: 477-490Google Scholar).Ceramide is a sphingolipid mediator with an essential role in cell growth, cell death, proliferation, and stress response (41Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Google Scholar, 42Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Google Scholar, 43Levade T. Malagarie-Cazenave S. Gouazé V. Ségui B. Tardy C. Betito S. Andrieu-Abadie N. Cuvillier O. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 601-607Google Scholar). As all of these different situations are correlated with modulation of autophagy (14Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Google Scholar), we have investigated the potential role of ceramide in regulating autophagy.Ceramide can be generated and consumed by different metabolic routes (41Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Google Scholar, 42Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Google Scholar, 44Merrill A.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Google Scholar, 45Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamenti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Google Scholar). Ceramide is produced by de novo synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum or by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by acid sphingomyelinases, localized in acidic compartments and neutral sphingomyelinases, and localized in the plasma membrane and mitochondria. Ceramide is engaged the biosynthesis of glucosylceramide (and other complex glycosphingolipids) and of sphingomyelin. Ceramide can also generate ceramide 1-phosphate, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Sphingosine 1-phosphate is a second messenger that often has an opposite effect to ceramide on biological outcomes (46Maceyka M. Payne S.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 193-201Google Scholar).Here we show that, in two different cell lines, ceramide stimulates autophagy by two non-exclusive mechanisms. In human colon cancer HT-29 cells, C2-Cer, a cell-permeable ceramide analogue, stimulates autophagy by increasing the intracellular pool of long chain ceramides. Ceramide reverts the inhibition of the class I PI3K signaling pathway on autophagy by interfering with the IL-13-dependent activation of protein kinase B (PKB) (34Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Google Scholar) and stimulates the expression of beclin 1. Ceramide also mediates the TAM-dependent accumulation autophagic vacuoles observed in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (47Bursch W. Hochegger K. Torok L. Marian B. Ellinger A. Hermann R.S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1189-1198Google Scholar). The ceramide-dependent expression of beclin 1 in TAM-treated cells was impaired in the presence of Myrio, an inhibitor of the serine palmitoyltransferase, the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo synthesis of ceramide. By contrast, the expression of beclin 1 was stimulated when MCF-7 cells were treated with PDMP, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. In addition, tamoxifen and C2-Cer inhibit the activation of protein kinase B, whereas myriocin antagonizes the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen. These data suggest a novel function for ceramide in controlling a major lysosomal pathway and provide a novel molecular link between autophagy and cell response to stress.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—C2-Cer and C2-DHCer were from Calbiochem and were dissolved in ethanol before use. FB1, Myrio, TAM, 3-MA, MDC were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture medium and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll. Ceramide from porcine brain, used for internal standard, was from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). The radioisotopes l-[U-14C]valine (256 mCi/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3 Ci/μmol), the ECL™ Western blotting detection kit, and the donkey anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-PKB Ser473 was from Cell Signaling, and goat anti-PKB was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. IL-13 was kindly provided by Adrian Minty (Sanofi-SyntheLabo, France). The rabbit anti-beclin 1 was kindly provided by Tamotsu Yoshimori (National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan). The monoclonal mouse anti-actin was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Goat anti-mouse and swine anti-goat antibodies were obtained from Bio-Rad and Caltag (Burlingame, CA), respectively.Cell Culture and Viability—Human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in DMEM, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Human colon cancer cell line HT-29 was maintained at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin as reported previously (34Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test.Analysis of Protein Degradation—HT-29 cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 0.2 μCi/ml of l-[14C]valine. Three hours before the end of the radiolabeling period, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of C2-Cer or C2-DHCer, and when required 100 μm FB1 was added at the same time. At the end of radiolabeling period, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and then incubated in nutrient-free medium (HBSS plus 0.1% of bovine serum albumin and 10 mm cold valine). After 16 h of incubation, at which time short lived proteins were being degraded, the medium was replaced with fresh nutrient-free medium, and when required 10 mm 3-MA or 30 ng/ml of IL-13 was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 4-h period. Cells and radiolabeled proteins from the 4-h chase medium were precipitated in trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10% (v/v) at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated from the soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.2 n NaOH. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Protein degradation was calculated by dividing the acid-soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and medium by the radioactivity contained in precipitated proteins from both cells and medium (34Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Google Scholar).MDC Staining of Autophagic Vacuoles—MCF-7 cells were incubated for 4 days with 1 μm of TAM dissolved in Me2SO/EtOH (1:1, v/v). When required 100 nm Myrio dissolved in methanol was added together with TAM. Alternatively, cells were incubated for 4 days with 20 μm PDMP in the absence of TAM. MDC staining was carried out essentially as described previously (48Biederbick A. Kern H.F. Elsasser H.P. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 66: 3-14Google Scholar). An MDC stock solution (0.1 m in Me2SO) was diluted 1:1000 in DMEM and applied to the cells for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan, Zeiss).Electron Microscopy and Morphometry—Electron microscopy and morphometric analysis were performed as described previously (49Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Bauvy C. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 289-295Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 30 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, embedded in Epon, and processed for transmission electron microscopy by standard procedures. For morphometric analysis, 20 micrographs per condition were used.Quantification of Endogenous Ceramide—Total endogenous ceramide levels were measured using the DGK assay as described previously (50Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 226-227Google Scholar, 51Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Google Scholar). Cells were collected, and lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (52Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The organic phase was divided in 1/2 and 1/6 aliquots, dried, and used for ceramide measurement and total phospholipids measurement (53Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Google Scholar), respectively. Briefly, 30 nmol of extracted lipids were incubated at room temperature for 45 min in the presence of β-octyl glucoside/dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol micelles, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 6 μg of proteins of DGK containing membranes (Calbiochem), and 1 mm ATP mixed with [γ-32P]ATP (13 μCi/ml) in a final volume of 0.1 ml. At the end of the reaction, lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (52Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). [32P]Ceramide 1-phosphate was determined by TLC separation in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water, (10:4:3:2:1 by volume). The radioactivity associated with ceramide 1-phosphate spots was determined after scraping and counting in a scintillator counter. Ceramide levels were referred to the level of total phospholipids.Immunoblotting—Detection of total and phospho-PKB in HT-29 cells was performed as described previously (54Arico S. Pattingre S. Bauvy C. Gane P. Barbat A. Codogno P. Ogier-Denis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27613-27621Google Scholar). After being resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with appropriate primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-PKB Ser473 at 1:1000 and polyclonal goat anti-PKB 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% TBST. After three washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit at 1:5000 and swine anti-goat at 1:2000). Bound antibodies were detected by ECL.For beclin 1 detection, cells were solubilized in 2× Laemmli buffer as described in Ref. 29Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Google Scholar. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane as described above. Immunoblotting was performed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-beclin 1 (1:3000), and after stripping the membrane was reprobed with a mouse monoclonal anti-actin (1:5000). Primary antibodies were detected using an horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit (1:5000) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse (1:5000). Bound antibodies were detected by ECL. Fluorographs were quantitatively scanned using the NIH image software.Semi-quantitative RT-PCR of Beclin 1—RNA from 1.5 × 106 cells was extracted using the Tri-Reagent (Sigma) and then incubated with DNase I (Ambion) for 30 min at 37 °C. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 4 μg of RNA by using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System™ (Invitrogen). The following primers were used to amplify beclin 1 cDNA (5′-ccaggatggtgtctctcgca-3′/5′-ctgcgtctgggcataacgca-3′) and GAPDH cDNA (5′-cggagtcaacggatttggtcgtat-3′/5′-agccttctccatggtggtgaagac-3′). The thermal cycle conditions were 1 cycle for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 27 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and terminated by 1 cycle for 5 min at 72 °C. Under these conditions PCR products were amplified in the linear range. GAPDH primers were added to the amplification mixture after the beginning of the seventh cycle, during the denaturation phase. Aliquots of each PCR were subjected to electrophoresis at 100 mV on a 2% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The products of the amplification were revealed under UV light and photographed on Kodak paper. Photographs were quantified using the NIH Image software.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of the differences between the groups was performed using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSC2-Cer Has a Stimulatory Effect on Autophagy in HT-29 Cells—We have shown previously (55De Stefanis D. Reffo P. Bonelli G. Baccino F.M. Sala G. Ghidoni R. Codogno P. Isidoro C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2002; 383: 989-999Google Scholar) that hallmarks of apoptosis are detectable after 8 h of incubation of HT-29 cells in the presence of 100 μm C2-Cer. In order to investigate the effect of C2-Cer on the control of autophagy in viable cells, HT-29 were incubated with an increasing amount of C2-Cer (from 25 to 100 μm) for a limited time. Viability was minimally affected when cells were cultured for 3 h in complete medium with increasing concentrations of C2-Cer and then transferred to a nutrient-free medium in the presence or absence of 3-MA (Fig. 1A, upper panel). In addition, no signs of apoptosis were detectable (changes in nuclear morphology or activation of caspases, data not shown) under these conditions. A dose-dependent increase in the rate of protein degradation was observed in C2-Cer pre-treated cells (Fig. 1A, lower panel). In contrast, no significant change in proteolysis was detected when the same experiment was performed in cells pre-treated with the inactive analogue C2-DHCer. The increase in proteolysis induced by C2-Cer was essentially due to the augmentation in the fraction of protein degradation sensitive to 3-MA (Fig. 1A). This result suggested that C2-Cer stimulates autophagy in HT-29 cells. This conclusion was supported by morphometric analysis showing that the fractional volume occupied by autophagic vacuoles is significantly increased in cells treated with C2-Cer and then incubated either in nutrient-free medium or in complete medium (Fig. 1B).The Endogenous Ceramide Is Responsible for the Stimulatory Effect of C2-Cer on Autophagy in HT-29 Cells—Next we wanted to characterize the mechanism responsible for the effect of C2-Cer on autophagy. The first step toward this goal was to investigate whether the conversion of C2-Cer into endogenous long chain ceramides is critical to stimulate autophagy. It has been shown recently that short chain ceramides can be converted into long chain ceramides via the sequential deacylation of ceramide analogues into sphingosine and the subsequent reacylation with long chain fatty acids by ceramide synthase (56Ogretmen B. Pettus B. Rossi J. Wood R. Usta J. Szule Z. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12960-12969Google Scholar). In a first set of experiments we have analyzed changes in the endogenous pool of long chain ceramides in response to C2-Cer treatment. To this end, HT-29 cells were incubated for 3 h in complete medium with 100 μm C2-Cer or 100 μm C2-DHCer in the presence or absence of 100 μm fumonisin (FB1), an inhibitor of the activity of ceramide synthase (44Merrill A.H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Google Scholar). Thereafter, cells were incubated in nutrient-deprived medium with 10 mm 3-MA when required. Finally, the level of endogenous long chain ceramides was analyzed by the DGK assay. C2-Cer treatment induced a 1.5-fold increase in the endogenous pool of ceramide, whereas no change was observed in C2-DHCer-treated cells (Fig. 2A). The C2-Cer-dependent increase in endogenous long chain ceramides was totally blocked in the presence of FB1, whereas the autophagic inhibitor 3-MA has no effect on the accumulation of ceramide. From these results we concluded that C2-Cer induces an accumulation of endogenous long chain ceramides in HT-29 cells, and this accumulation is dependent on the recycling of the sphingosine moiety and the activity of ceramide synthase.Fig. 2The effect of C2-Cer on autophagy is mediated by an increase of the endogenous pool of long chain ceramides. A, endogenous long chain ceramides were quantified by the DGK assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of ceramide (6.2 pmol of Cer/nmol of Pi) in HT-29 cells cultured in complete medium was set to 1. HT-29 cells were cultured for 3 h in complete medium with 100 μm C2-Cer in the presence or absence of 100 μm FB1 or with 100 μMC2-DHCer. 3-MA (10 mm) was added during the chase period in nutrient-free medium. After 20 h of incubation in nutrient-free medium, cells were harvested, and the ceramide content was analyzed by the DGK assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. B, the rate of degradation of [14C]valine-labeled long lived proteins was measured in cells incubated in nutrient-free medium (HBSS) in the presence or absence of 10 mm 3-MA. C2-Cer (100 μm) or C2-DHCer (100 μm) was added during the last 3 h of incubation in complete medium. FB1 (100 μm) was added together with C2-Cer in complete medium. Values reported are the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 versus untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to investigate whether the accumulation of long chain ceramides is responsible for the C2-Cer-induced autophagy, we have evaluated the effect of FB1 on protein degradation in C2-Cer-treated cells. We observed that in cells exposed to 100 μm C2-Cer for 3 h, the rate of proteolysis was increased by 30–35% when compared with untreated cells or to cells treated with C2-DHCer (Fig. 2B). The increase of protein degradation was totally blocked by 100 μm FB1 in C2-Cer-treated cells (Fig. 2B). In fact, FB1 was as potent as 3-MA in inhibiting proteolysis. In contrast to FB1, the inhibitory effect of 3-MA on proteolysis was achieved independently of the accumulation of endogenous long chain ceramides (Fig. 2, A and B). Both drugs have no cumulative effect on the inhibition of proteolysis (data not shown), suggesting that 3-MA, which interferes with the activity of class III PI3K (34Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Google Scholar), acts downstream FB1 in the same pathway to inhibit autophagy.Ceramide Interferes with the Class I PI3K Signaling Pathway to Stimulate Autophagy in HT-29 Cells—C2-Cer is able to stimulate the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, whereas HT-29 cells were cultured in complete medium (Fig. 1B, b) suggesting that ceramide can relieve the inhibitory effect induced by growth factors. We have shown previously (34Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Google Scholar, 35Arico S. Petiot A. Bauvy C. Dubbelhuis P.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Ogier-Denis E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35243-35246Google Scholar) that the stimulation of the class I PI3K/PKB signaling pathway by IL-13 has a strong inhibitory effect on autophagy. In addition, ceramide is known to interfere with the activation of PKB in different cell types (57Zhou H. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Pittman R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1972476228,"Mgm1 is a member of the dynamin family of GTP-binding proteins. Mgm1 was first identified in yeast, where it affects mitochondrial morphology. The human homologue of Mgm1 is called OPA1. Mutations in the OPA1 gene are the prevailing cause of dominant optic atrophy, a hereditary disease in which progressive degeneration of the optic nerve can lead to blindness. Here we investigate the properties of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein in mammalian cells. We find that Mgm1/OPA1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it is tightly bound to the outer surface of the inner membrane. Overexpression of wild type or mutant forms of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein cause mitochondria to fragment and, in some cases, cluster near the nucleus, whereas the loss of protein caused by small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to dispersal of mitochondrial fragments throughout the cytosol. The cristae of these fragmented mitochondria are disorganized. At early time points after transfection with Mgm1/OPA1 siRNA, the mitochondria are not yet fragmented. Instead, the mitochondria swell and stretch, after which they form localized constrictions similar to the mitochondrial abnormalities observed during the early stages of apoptosis. These abnormalities might be the earliest effects of losing Mgm1/OPA1 protein. Mgm1 is a member of the dynamin family of GTP-binding proteins.

Dominant optic atrophy is a progressive eye disease caused by degeneration of the retinal ganglion cell layer with ascending atrophy of the optic nerve (1Kjer P. Jensen O.A. Klinken L. Acta Ophthalmol. (Copenh.). 1983; 61: 300-312Google Scholar). The onset of this disease usually occurs during the first decade of life, showing inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability. Mutations in the optic atrophy gene, OPA1, are the most prevalent causes of dominant optic atrophy (2Toomes C. Marchbank N.J. Mackey D.A. Craig J.E. Newbury-Ecob R.A. Bennett C.P. Vize C.J. Desai S.P. Black G.C. Patel N. Teimory M. Markham A.F. Inglehearn C.F. Churchill A.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1369-1378Google Scholar, 3Delettre C. Lenaers G. Pelloquin L. Belenguer P. Hamel C.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 97-107Google Scholar). All affected individuals examined to date were found to be heterozygous for mutations in the OPA1 gene, suggesting that these mutations are dominant. However, more recent molecular and genetic studies suggest that the apparent dominance of the OPA1 locus reflects haplo-insufficiency (4Pesch U.E. Leo-Kottler B. Mayer S. Jurklies B. Kellner U. Apfelstedt-Sylla E. Zrenner E. Alexander C. Wissinger B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1359-1368Google Scholar). It was also discovered recently that the OPA1 gene encodes the human homologue of yeast Mgm1, thereby opening new avenues for research into the physiological disruptions that lead to atrophy of the optic nerve (5Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie-Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat.

Genet. 2000; 26: 211-215Google Scholar). The Mgm1/OPA1 protein is a dynamin family member that was first discovered in yeast, where it affects mitochondrial genome maintenance (7Jones B.A. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 380-389Google Scholar). Members of the dynamin family are structurally similar but functionally diverse GTP-binding proteins that have a GTP binding domain, a middle domain, and a GTPase effector domain (GED or assembly domain) (8van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Google Scholar, 9Danino D. Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Google Scholar). These three domains bind to each other and are thereby capable of forming large multimeric assemblies (10Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Newman-Smith E.D. Pishvaee B. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14942-14947Google Scholar). Different members of the dynamin family also have divergent sequences that appear to be specific for their particular functions. Dynamin, for example, has a pleckstrin homology domain and a prolinerich domain that bind to other molecules in clathrin-coated pits. A second member of the dynamin family, named Drp1, Dlp1, or Dymple in mammals and Dnm1p in yeast, is also cytosolic, but this protein is required for division of the mitochondrial outer membrane and is therefore likely to bind to proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane (11Bleazard W.

Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 224-2256Google Scholar). In contrast, OPA1/Mgm1 has a mitochondrial leader sequence, suggesting that this protein is imported into mitochondria (15Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Google Scholar). The submitochondrial localization of Mgm1/OPA1 has been a matter of debate. Although early reports suggest localization to the matrix (16Pelloquin L. Belenguer P. Menon Y. Gas N. Ducommun B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4151-4161Google Scholar) or the outer membrane (15Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Google Scholar), more recent reports indicate that Mgm1 is an intermembrane space protein (17Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Google Scholar, 18Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Google Scholar, 19Sesaki H.

There is also, however, ambiguity about the precise localization within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It was reported that Mgm1 is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (17Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Google Scholar) or peripherally associated with both the outer and inner membranes (19Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Google Scholar), but it has also been reported that Mgm1 is an integral membrane protein (21Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that the exact function of Mgm1 has also been a matter of debate. As indicated by the name of the yeast mutant, Mgm1 was originally proposed to be required for mitochondrial genome maintenance. More recent data indicates that yeast with mutations in their Mgm1 gene lose mitochondrial DNA as a secondary consequence of altered mitochondrial morphology (17Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Google Scholar). Mitochondria are converted from elaborate branched structures in wild type yeast cells into an aggregate of smaller fragments in cells with mutations in the Mgm1 gene. This phenotype is similar to that of yeast with mutations in the fuzzy onions protein Fzo1p, which is thought to affect fusion between mitochondria (23Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Google Scholar). This possible role of Mgm1 in mitochondrial fusion was tested with a cell fusion assay in yeast. Results obtained with these assays indicate that mutations in Mgm1 are capable of disrupting fusion between mitochondria (18Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that Mgm1 contributes to mitochondrial fusion (18Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Google Scholar, 19Sesaki H. Southard S.M. Yaffe M.P. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2342-2356Google Scholar) in a manner similar to the proposed role of the fuzzy onions protein in yeast and Drosophila and that of the mitofusin proteins in mammals (24Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Google Scholar, 25Rojo M. Legros F. Chateau D. Lombes A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1663-1674Google Scholar, 26Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Google Scholar). There is, however, as yet no evidence for a direct role in mitochondrial fusion, leaving open the possibility that this protein affects other processes that indirectly affect the balance between mitochondrial fission and fusion. Here we report our characterization of human Mgm1 at the cellular level. Our results confirm that this protein is targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Data obtained with subcellular fractionation and cryo-immuno-electron microscopy are consistent with localization of Mgm1/OPA1 to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it is tightly bound to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane. Silencing of Mgm1/OPA1 expression results in fragmented mitochondria with aberrant inner membrane morphologies. At early time points, the only visible abnormalities are swelling and localized constrictions of the mitochondria. Cloning and Expression of the Human Mgm1 cDNA Expression Constructs—Human cDNA clone KIAA0567 was obtained from T. Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). Full-length Mgm1/OPA1 was recloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI (Promega, Madison, WI) by PCR amplification, adding KpnI and NotI sites to the ends of the PCR oligonucleotides. The K301A mutation was introduced by fusion PCR. The clones were sequenced to rule out errors introduced by PCR. For bacterial expression, the GTPase domains of Mgm1 and Mgm1(K301A) were PCR amplified and cloned into NheI- and XhoI-cut pet21D (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). These clones were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Novagen Inc.). Expression was induced with 40 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside added at an OD of 0.4–0.6. The cells were then grown for 2 h at 27 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 mm NaH2PO4 and 300 mm NaCl, followed by the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysis using a French press. Bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation (15 min at 12,000 × g), and the supernatant was passed through nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The GTPase fragments were subsequently eluted with 1 m imidazole, yielding >90% purity. Antibodies—A 705-bp fragment encoding the Mgm1/OPA1 C terminus was cloned in the pET21d expression vector (Novagen Inc.) using NcoI and XhoI sites that were added to the ends of the PCR oligonucleotides. The resulting 26-kDa recombinant protein was expressed in BL21 bacteria and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Rabbit antisera were generated by Robert Sargeant (Ramona, CA). The antibodies were blot-purified using recombinant protein. ATP synthase subunit α and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), glutamate dehydrogenase from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA), and HSP60 and TOM20 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Porin antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich, prohibitin from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Flanders, NJ), and TIM23 and cytochrome c antibodies from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and COS7 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% serum. Plasmid DNA was transfected using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The siRNA 1The abbreviation used is: siRNA, small interfering RNA. oligonucleotides were transfected using OligofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The effects of siRNA were observed by plating the cells in glass-bottomed dishes (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA). HeLa cells used for electron microscopy were seeded on Thermanox® plastic coverslips (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed for 4 min at -20 °C in methanol followed by permeabilization for 4 min at -20 °C in acetone. Untransfected cells were incubated overnight with Mgm1/OPA1 antibody, followed by a 20-min incubation with a secondary antibody. Transfected cells were incubated for 20 min with an Mgm1/OPA1 antibody. Where indicated, cells were stained for 30 min with 0.1 μm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) prior to fixation. Images were acquired with a 100× Neofluar/NA1.3 objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope, using a Hamamatsu ORCA ER camera controlled by Zeiss Axiovision software. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—Fractionation procedures were as described previously (14Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 224-2256Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 g of fresh bovine liver or brain was minced and homogenized in isolation buffer (70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, 2 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics) by three passes with a loose fitting pestle in a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer, followed by five passes with a tight fitting pestle. The homogenate was subjected to differential centrifugation as described previously (14Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 224-2256Google Scholar). Mitochondria in the P2 fractions were further purified with a Percoll gradient, except when used for protease sensitivity experiments and carbonate washes. The P2 fractions used for protease sensitivity experiments were washed in isolation buffer without protease inhibitors. Digitonin extraction was as described previously (27Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. Briefly, samples of the liver mitochondrial fraction P2 containing 1 mg of protein were mixed with equal volumes of digitonin solution to achieve the indicated concentrations of digitonin. The samples were then incubated for 30 min on ice with occasional mixing by inverting the tubes. The samples were then diluted with 3 volumes of isolation medium, and the mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 11000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 250 mm KCl and incubated for 5 min on ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 11 000 × g. This last pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Protease protection experiments were done by resuspending 0.5 mg of mitochondrial proteins in 0.8 ml of isolation buffer. Trypsin and digitonin were added in that order at the indicated concentrations. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the reaction was stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid. Upon precipitation of the proteins, the pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Alkaline extraction was performed by incubating the mitochondrial fraction for 30 min on ice with 0.2 m Na2CO3 adjusted to pH 13 with 1 n NaOH. The membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins that were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE were then transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. These blots were incubated with primary antibodies and developed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The protein bands were scanned with a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and the data were quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). RNA Interference—The silencing of the Mgm1 gene in HeLa cells was done essentially as described (28Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides, matching the sequence from positions 511 to 533, were made by Genset Oligos (La Jolla, CA). A control duplex was designed by inverting this sequence. The siRNA duplexes were transfected at a concentration of 20 nm into HeLa cells grown to 40% confluency. The effect of this treatment was followed during the course of 3 days, at which point the cells were stained with MitoTracker, and their mitochondrial morphology was observed by fluorescence microscopy. The mitochondrial thickness was measured using the line tool in NIH Image 1.62. The measurements were done at multiple randomly selected sites along the mitochondrial length. The results are expressed as mean values ± S.E. GTP Hydrolysis—To assay GTP hydrolysis, 1-μg samples of bacterially expressed wild type and mutant GTPase domains were incubated at 37 °C in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2 with 100 μm non-radioactive GTP and trace amounts of [α-32P]GTP. At the indicated times, samples of 2.5 μl were spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose F TLC plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). The reactions were stopped immediately with a hair drier. The plates were then developed with 1 m LiCl2 and 1 m acetic acid and air-dried. Radiolabeled spots were quantified with a Typhoon™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and Image-Quant™ software (Molecular Dynamics). Electron Microscopy—For negative staining, the cells were fixed for 30 min in 1% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA), washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with 1% osmium tetroxide. The samples were then dehydrated and embedded in Epon resin. 70-nm thick sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were viewed with a JEOL electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Cryo-immunogold Electron Microscopy—Subcellular localization of antigens using high resolution cryo-immunogold electron microscopy was performed as described (29Peters P.J. Hunziker W. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 210-225Google Scholar). Briefly, the mouse ileum was fixed by perfusion for 24 h with 2% paraformaldehyde or 2 h with 2% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde. Fixed tissue was embedded in gelatin, and ultrathin sections were made with a microtome and mounted on grids. The sections were immuno-labeled with primary antibody and then with protein A-gold. The cryosections were examined with Philips CM10 and Technia 12 electron microscopes at 80 kV. Localization of Human Mgm1/OPA1—A BLAST search of GenBank™ for clones sharing homology with dynamin revealed a cDNA sequence, designated KIAA0567, which encodes human Mgm1/OPA1. To determine the subcellular and submitochondrial localization of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein, we generated polyclonal antibodies against a 26-kDa C-terminal fragment of Mgm1/OPA1 spanning amino acid residues 616–850. This antibody recognizes ∼95- and ∼85-kDa bands by Western blotting of C2C12 and HeLa cell extracts fractionated with 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous observations in yeast, mouse, and humans. The 85-kDa band is often detectable as a closely spaced doublet. These bands may represent partial proteolytic products, mature processing products, or isoforms generated by alternative splicing. We then determined whether the proteins recognized by our antibodies were mitochondrial by differential centrifugation and further fractionation with a Percoll gradient. Our results were consistent with the mitochondrial localization of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence staining of fixed tissue culture cells shows that the Mgm1/OPA1 protein colocalizes with ATP synthase (Fig. 1C) and with MitoTracker (data not shown) on mitochondria. The pattern within mitochondria was punctate, but close inspection of enlarged images showed that these puncta were distinct from the staining patterns of other mitochondrial proteins (Drp1, COX, HSP60, prohibitin, and TIM23) viewed at high magnification. 2L. Griparic and A. M. van der Bliek, unpublished observations. We conclude that the Mgm1/OPA1 protein is mitochondrial but that the submitochondrial distribution, as detected by immunofluorescence, is distinct from that of known mitochondrial proteins. Submitochondrial Localization of Mgm1/OPA1—To determine the localization of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein within mitochondria, we analyzed mitochondrial fractions obtained from bovine liver by treating them with increasing concentrations of digitonin along with protease digestion and carbonate washes. The mitochondrial outer membrane is solubilized at a lower concentration of digitonin than the mitochondrial inner membrane, which makes it possible to selectively release intermembrane space proteins or make them accessible to protease digestion (27Greenawalt J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 310-323Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of digitonin first released cytochrome c, but only when these mitochondria were also incubated with 250 mm KCl, as expected for a peripheral membrane protein (Fig. 2A). Under these same conditions, Mgm1 was not released into the supernatant, suggesting that this protein is even more tightly bound to the membrane or enclosed in the mitochondrial matrix proteins. The Mgm1/OPA1 protein was released at higher digitonin concentrations along with mitochondrial matrix proteins and inner membrane proteins. These data suggest that Mgm1/OPA1 is not an outer membrane protein or a soluble intermembrane space protein. To determine whether Mgm1 is exposed to the intermembrane space or enclosed in the matrix, we combined the digitonin extractions with protease digestions (Fig. 2B). Relatively low concentrations of digitonin make holes in the outer membrane, making intermembrane space proteins accessible to cleavage by exogenously added proteases such as trypsin. Higher concentrations of digitonin also make holes in the inner membrane, thereby also exposing matrix proteins to protease digestion. Solubilization of the outer membrane is detectable by blotting for cytochrome c and TIM23, which shows protease digestion, even at the lowest digitonin concentration (Fig. 2B). The Mgm1/OPA1 protein is also digested at the lower digitonin concentrations, thereby indicating that Mgm1/OPA1 is exposed to the intermembrane space. The matrix proteins, glutamate dehydrogenase, HSP60, and the α-subunit of ATP synthase require relatively high digitonin concentrations before they become accessible to protease digestion (Fig. 2B). Because the antibody with which we detect the presence of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein was raised against the C-terminal half of this protein, we conclude that at least this half of the protein is exposed to the intermembrane space. There is no obvious transmembrane segment in the sequence of Mgm1/OPA1, suggesting that this protein is a peripheral membrane protein even though it could not be removed with 250 mm KCl. To verify that Mgm1/OPA1 is indeed a peripheral membrane protein, we subjected mitochondria to carbonate washes. This procedure extracts peripheral proteins from the membrane, whereas integral proteins remain insoluble (30Miller J.D. Tajima S. Lauffer L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 273-282Google Scholar). Upon extraction of mitochondrial membranes with sodium carbonate pH 13, Mgm1/OPA1 was successfully solubilized along with the peripheral α-subunit of the ATP synthase complex, whereas the integral membrane protein TIM23 remained in the pellet (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that Mgm1 is peripherally associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane but that it binds more tightly to the membrane than cytochrome c, which can be released by 250 mm KCl. We conclude that Mgm1/OPA1 is a peripheral membrane protein, tightly bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane on the side facing the intermembrane space. Cryo-immunogold electron microscopy was used to substantiate the submitochondrial localization of the Mgm1/OPA1 protein. Examples are shown in Fig. 3. Most gold particles label the interior of mitochondria, but some gold particles are on or near the rim (92 and 8%, respectively; n = 768), similar to a previously published report on Mgm1/OPA1 distribution (21Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Google Scholar). To further localize Mgm1, we counted the number of gold particles on either side of the inner membrane. We found that 39% of the gold particles that could be assigned to one side or the other of the inner membrane were in the intermembrane space, while 61% were on the matrix side of the inner membrane (n = 256). Those numbers were compared with numbers obtained with antibodies against proteins with known submitochondrial distributions. The intermembrane space protein cytochrome c gave 45 and 55%, respectively (n = 200), the mitochondrial matrix protein GDH gave 22 and 78%, respectively (n = 89), and a peripheral membrane subunit of ATP synthase gave 21 and 79%, respectively (n = 46). The apparent displacement of gold particles labeling proteins that are unquestionably localized to one side or the other of the cristae membranes may be due in part to the added lengths of the primary and secondary antibodies, which can displace the gold particles by as much as 20 nm, and it could be due in part to the strong curvature of cristae membranes, which would make them more difficult to detect in thin sections. We can, nevertheless, conclude that the Mgm1/OPA1 protein is distributed throughout the interior of mitochondria in close association with the inner membrane. The distribution of gold particles obtained with Mgm1 is most similar to that obtained with cytochrome c antibodies, suggesting that Mgm1/OPA1 and cytochrome c have similar submitochondrial distributions. Overexpression of Mgm1/OPA1 Protein in Mammalian Cell Lines—The effects of Mgm1 overexpression were investigated with a transient transfection construct encoding wild type Mgm1. When expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 4) or Vero and COS7 cells (data not shown), the protein encoded by this construct was targeted to mitochondria. Staining with MitoTracker showed that Mgm1 overexpression caused the mitochondria to form relatively small fragments that were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (76% of transfected cells; Fig. 4A) or clustered in the perinuclear region (24% of transfected cells; Fig. 4B). The formation of perinuclear clusters is likely caused by high levels of overexpression, as is also seen when certain other mitochondrial proteins are overexpressed (14Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 224-2256Google Scholar). Disruption of mitochondrial morphology was already detected at 10 h after transfection, suggesting that precise expression levels of Mgm1 are critical for normal mitochondrial function. To determine the effects of the mutant Mgm1/OPA1 protein on mitochondrial morphology, we introduced a point mutation in the G1 consensus motif of the GTPase domain (K301A) that is similar to the mutations used previously to analyze the functions of other dynamin family members. A construct encoding the Mgm1(K301A) mutant was transfected into HeLa cells, and its effect on mitochondrial morphology was detected with MitoTracker. Overexpression of the Mgm1(K301A) mutant caused mitochondria to fragment and aggregate (Fig. 4C), similar to the effects of overexpressing wild type protein. There were some subtle differences between mitochondria in cells that overexpress wild type or mutant protein. The fragmented mitochondria in cells with mutant protein had diameters larger than those obtained with the over"
https://openalex.org/W1989658063,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of protein translation. Signaling via mTOR is increased by growth factors but decreased during nutrient deprivation. Previous studies have identified Ser2448 as a nutrient-regulated phosphorylation site located in the mTOR catalytic domain, insulin stimulates Ser2448 phosphorylation via protein kinase B (PKB), while Ser2448 phosphorylation is attenuated with amino acid starvation. Here we have identified Thr2446 as a novel nutrient-regulated phosphorylation site on mTOR. Thr2446 becomes phosphorylated when CHO-IR cells are nutrient-deprived, but phosphorylation is reduced by insulin stimulation. Nutrient deprivation activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). To test whether this could be involved in regulating phoshorylation of mTOR, we treated cultured murine myotubes with 5'-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) or dinitrophenol (DNP). Both treatments activated AMPK and also caused a concomitant increase in phosphorylation of Thr2446 and a parallel decrease in insulin's ability to phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase. In vitro kinase assays using peptides based on the sequence in amino acids 2440-2551 of mTOR found that PKB and AMPK are capable of phosphorylating sites in this region. However, phosphorylation by PKB is restricted when Thr2446 is mutated to an acidic residue mimicking phosphorylation. Conversely, AMP-kinase-induced phosphorylation is reduced when Ser2448 is phosphorylated. These data suggest differential phosphorylation Thr2446 and Ser2448 could act as a switch mechanism to integrate signals from nutrient status and growth factors to control the regulation of protein translation."
https://openalex.org/W1991529393,"The toxicity of the metalloids arsenic and antimony is related to uptake, whereas detoxification requires efflux. In this report we show that uptake of the trivalent inorganic forms of arsenic and antimony into cells of Escherichia coli is facilitated by the aquaglyceroporin channel GlpF and that transport of Sb(III) is catalyzed by the ArsB carrier protein; everted membrane vesicles accumulated Sb(III) with energy supplied by NADH oxidation, reflecting efflux from intact cells. Dissipation of either the membrane potential or the pH gradient did not prevent Sb(III) uptake, whereas dissipation of both completely uncoupled the carrier protein, suggesting that transport is coupled to either the electrical or the chemical component of the electrochemical proton gradient. Reciprocally, Sb(III) transport via ArsB dissipated both the pH gradient and the membrane potential. These results strongly indicate that ArsB is an antiporter that catalyzes metalloid-proton exchange. Unexpectedly, As(III) inhibited ArsB-mediated Sb(III) uptake, whereas Sb(III) stimulated ArsB-mediated As(III) transport. We propose that the actual substrate of ArsB is a polymer of (AsO)n, (SbO)n, or a co-polymer of the two metalloids.

We propose that the actual substrate of ArsB is a polymer of (AsO)n, (SbO)n, or a co-polymer of the two metalloids. Arsenic, one of the most prevalent toxic metals in the environment, derives primarily from geochemical origins but also from man-made sources. Consequently, nearly every organism has intrinsic or acquired mechanisms for arsenic detoxification (1Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Google Scholar). The arsenical resistance operon (arsRDABC) of the conjugative R-factor R773 confers resistance to inorganic As(III) and Sb(III) in Escherichia coli. The arsenic transport system exhibits a dual mode of energy coupling depending on the subunit composition (2Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar). When both ArsA and ArsB are present, they form the As(III)-translocating ArsAB ATPase, which is independent of the electrochemical proton gradient (3Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Google Scholar). In contrast, in the absence of ArsA, ArsB catalyzes As(III) extrusion coupled to electrochemical energy, which suggests that ArsB is a uniporter that extrudes the arsenite anion in response to the positive exterior membrane potential (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar). This dual mode of energy coupling led us to propose that the ArsAB pump evolved by association of a secondary carrier with a soluble ATPase (5Rosen B.P. Dey S. Dou D. Ji G. Kaur P. Ksenzenko M. Silver S. Wu J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 257-272Google Scholar). Over a decade ago, we proposed that other primary ATP-coupled pumps such as ATP-binding cassette transporters evolved in similar ways (5Rosen B.P. Dey S. Dou D. Ji G. Kaur P. Ksenzenko M. Silver S. Wu J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 257-272Google Scholar, 6Driessen A.J. Rosen B.P. Konings W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 397-401Google Scholar). ArsB is the most widespread determinant of arsenic resistance in bacteria and archaea, yet its transport properties are not well characterized. It is a member of the ion transporter superfamily (7Prakash S. Cooper G. Singhi S. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1618: 79-92Google Scholar), with 12 membrane-spanning segments and a membrane topology that is similar to many carrier proteins (8Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Google Scholar). To date, it has been shown to transport only As(III) (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar). Here we report for the first time that ArsB transports inorganic Sb(III) in E. coli, and we describe the relationship with As(III) transport. Considering that the pKa of Sb(III) is 11.8 and As(III) is 9.2, at cytosolic pH the concentration of the oxyanion of either metalloid is negligible. Thus, it is unlikely that ArsB could be an electrophoretic anion uniporter. Instead, we demonstrate here that ArsB is a trivalent metalloid/H+ antiporter. ArsB-catalyzed uptake of Sb(III) into everted membrane vesicles coupled to either the pH gradient or membrane potential components of the electrochemical proton gradient. Sb(III)/H+ exchange was monitored using a fluorescent reporter, acridine orange, for the pH gradient and oxonal V for the membrane potential. The nature of the substrate of ArsB was explored by competition and co-transport experiments with Sb(III) and As(III). Given their pKa values, the physiologically relevant species of Sb(III) and As(III) in a solution of neutral pH are hydroxides, but the nature of the true substrate of ArsB is not clear. As(III) inhibits ArsB-mediated Sb(III) transport, yet Sb(III) stimulates ArsB-mediated As(III) transport. From these results and the results of As(III) and Sb(III) co-transport experiments, we propose that the true substrate of ArsB is a polymer of As(III) or Sb(III), or a co-polymer of As(III) and Sb(III). Materials—Restriction enzymes and nucleic acid-modifying enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs, Inc. Carrier-free 73AsO3−4 was obtained from Los Alamos National Laboratories. 125SbCl5 was produced by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The pentavalent forms of the isotopes were reduced to 73As(III) and 125Sb(III) by the method of Reay and Asher (9Reay P.F. Asher C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 557-560Google Scholar).

The cells were diluted 100-fold into fresh, prewarmed medium with the indicated concentrations of As(III) in the form of sodium arsenite or Sb(III) in the form of potassium antimonyl tartrate and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for an additional 6 h. Growth was estimated from the absorbance at 600 nm. Transport Assays—For uptake assays in intact cells, cultures were grown to A600 nm of 1 at 37 °C with aeration in Luria-Bertani medium. The cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in a buffer consisting of 75 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m KCl and 1 mm MgSO4, brought to a concentration of 80 mg of wet cells/ml at room temperature. To initial the transport assay, 0.1 ml of cells was diluted in 1 ml of the same buffer at room temperature containing 10 μm sodium arsenite and 0.4 μCi of 73As(III) or 10 μm potassium antimonyl tartrate and 0.4 μCi of 125Sb(III). Samples (0.1 ml) were withdrawn at the indicated times, filtered through 0.2-μm pore diameter nitrocellulose filters (Whatman), and washed with 15 ml of the same buffer, all at room temperature. The filters were dried and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Transport assays using everted membrane vesicles were performed as described (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar). Everted membrane vesicles were prepared essentially as described previously (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, the reaction mixture contained 0.3 mg of membrane protein in a final volume of 0.6 ml of a buffer consisting of 75 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m K2SO4, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1.25 μCi of either 73As(III) or 125Sb(III). Assays were initiated by the addition of 5 mm NADH, final concentration. The concentration of As(III) was adjusted by the addition of buffered sodium arsenite, and buffered potassium antimonyl tartrate was used to adjust the total Sb(III) concentration. Transport assays using inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) 1The abbreviations used are: ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; EXAFS, x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. were performed by the same procedure with a PerkinElmer ELAN 9000 except that nonradioactive metalloids were used, and the total volume was increased to 1.8 ml. At the indicated times, 0.3-ml samples were withdrawn and filtered through 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters (Whatman). After filtration, the filters were washed with 10 ml of the same buffer and air-dried. For radioactive assays, the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For ICP-MS measurements, the filters were digested with 0.3 ml of concentrated HNO3 (69–70%) (EM Science) overnight at room temperature. The dissolved filters were incubated for 10 min at 70 °C, allowed to cool to room temperature, and diluted with 5.25 ml of high pressure liquid chromatography grade water (Sigma) to produce a final concentration of HNO3 of approximately 4%. Standard solutions were made in the range of 0.5–150 ppb in 4% HNO3 using arsenic and antimony standards (Ultra Scientific). Initial rates were determined from a linear regression of time points at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 min. Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot version6.1. Protein content was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of pH Gradient Formation by Acridine Orange Fluorescence—Formation of ΔpH was estimated from the quenching of acridine orange fluorescence (11Perlin D.S. San Francisco M.J. Slayman C.W. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 53-61Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.2, containing 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 2 μm acridine orange, and 0.13 mg of membrane protein in a volume of 2 ml. Quenching was initiated at room temperature by addition of 5 mm NADH (final concentration). Fluorescence was measured in stirred cuvettes with an Aminco AB2 spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 492 nm and emission at 527 nm. Measurement of Membrane Potential Formation by Oxonol V Fluorescence—Formation of Δψ was estimated from the quenching of oxonol V fluorescence as described (12Perlin D.S. Kasamo K. Brooker R.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7884-7892Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.2, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 5 μm oxonol 595 (Aldrich), and 0.13 mg of membrane protein in a volume of 2 ml. Quenching was initiated at room temperature by addition of 5 mm NADH (final concentration). After 5–6 min, potassium tartrate or potassium antimonyl tartrate was added at the indicated concentrations. Fluorescence was measured in stirred cuvettes with an Aminco AB2 spectrofluorometer with excitation at 589 nm and emission at 616 nm. Uptake of As(III) and Sb(III) in E. coli—We have previously shown that disruption of the aquaglyceroporin GlpF confers resistance to Sb(III) (13Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Google Scholar). This disruption was interpreted as a loss of the uptake pathway for Sb(III); however, transport of Sb(III) has never been directly demonstrated in E. coli. Moreover, the GlpF disruption did not gain resistance to As(III), so it was unclear whether GlpF is an uptake pathway for As(III). Uptake of either 73As(III) or 125Sb(III) was measured in the E. coli strains AW3110 or AW10, in which the chromosomal arsRBC operon was deleted (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar, 14Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Google Scholar), and OSBR1, which was created from AW3110 by inserting TnphoA into glpF (13Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Google Scholar). Because AW3110 lacks arsB, it was unable to extrude metalloids and accumulated 125Sb(III) (Fig. 1A) or 73As(III) (Fig. 1B). Disruption of glpF greatly reduced the level of uptake of both metalloids. This clearly demonstrates that GlpF is the major uptake pathway for both As(III) and Sb(III). Aquaglyceroporins are channels that facilitate the movement of neutral substrates such as glycerol and other polyols but not ions (15Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Google Scholar). Considering that the pKa value of trivalent arsenic and antimony is 9.2 and 11.8, respectively, there is essentially no arsenite or antimonite anion at physiological pH levels. To be substrates of aquaglyceroporins, the metalloids would be expected to be the neutral hydroxides As(OH)3 or Sb(OH)3, which are the inorganic equivalents of polyols (13Sanders O.I. Rensing C. Kuroda M. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3365-3367Google Scholar, 16Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Google Scholar). However, as discussed in more detail below, other possibilities exist, so, for the purposes of this study they are designated As(III) and Sb(III). ArsB Confers Sb(III) and As(III) Resistance—Intracellular As(III) and Sb(III) are toxic to most cells, including E. coli (1Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Google Scholar). E. coli has a chromosomal arsB gene in the three-gene arsRBC operon that confers moderate levels of resistance to these metalloids (14Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Google Scholar). Plasmids such as R773 have five-gene arsRDABC operons that confer high levels of resistance (17Rosen B.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 207-212Google Scholar). The R773 and chromosomal ArsBs share 90% identity at the amino acid level, and the R773 arsB gene complemented both Sb(III) (Fig. 2A) and As(III) (Fig. 2B) hypersensitivity resulting from deletion of the chromosomal arsB gene. Expression of arsA in trans increased resistance. These results demonstrate that ArsB can function either alone or as a complex with ArsA to confer resistance to Sb(III), and importantly, they demonstrate the interchangeability of the chromosomal and plasmid ArsB carriers. ArsB Catalyzes 125Sb(III) Uptake in Everted Membrane Vesicles—ArsB has been shown to transport As(III) (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar), but Sb(III) transport has not been demonstrated. Uptake into everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells expressing the R773 ArsB is the equivalent of efflux from cells. Everted membrane vesicles from strain AW10 (Δars::cam) expressing arsB from plasmid pKMB1 accumulated 125Sb(III) when NADH was used as a respiratory substrate (Fig. 3). No uptake was observed without NADH or in vesicles from cells with vector only. Addition of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) produced a rapid loss of accumulated Sb(III). These results demonstrate that Sb(III) uptake is coupled to the electrochemical proton gradient. Similar results were obtained if 125Sb(III) was prepared with unlabeled potassium antimonyl tartrate or SbCl3 (data not shown), showing that only the oxidation state of antimony is relevant. The effects of oxyanions on ArsB-catalyzed 125Sb(III) uptake into everted membrane vesicles were examined (Fig. 4). Among the oxyanions tested, the sodium or potassium salts of AsO43-, Sb(OH)6-, PO43-, NO3-, NO2-, SO32-, SeO32-, and BO3-, or tartrate had little effect on 125Sb(III) transport. Only As(III) (added as sodium arsenite) inhibited transport; therefore ArsB appears to be specific for Sb(III) and As(III).Fig. 4Specificity of 125Sb(III) transport by ArsB 125Sb(III) uptake was assayed in everted membrane vesicles with 5 mm NADH as an energy source and 125Sb(III) adjusted to 10 μm with potassium antimonyl tartrate. Sodium arsenite was used at 100 μm and other salts at 1.0 mm (final concentration).

Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar). This idea is consistent with the uncoupling effect of FCCP on NADH-driven As(III) uptake in everted membrane vesicles that shows that ArsB-catalyzed As(III) uptake is driven by the electrochemical proton gradient, which is acid and positive interior in these vesicles (Fig. 3). However, as discussed above, the metalloid substrates of ArsB are not anions at physiological pH levels. An alternative for coupling transport of a neutral solute into the acid and positive interior of the everted vesicles is by exchange with a cation or proton, but dependence on a specific cation such as Na+, K+, Mg2+, or Ca2+ was not observed (data not shown). To examine the possibility that ArsB is an electrophoretic Sb(III)/H+ antiporter, the effects of a permeant anion (SCN–) and weak base (NH+4) on Sb(III) uptake into everted membrane vesicles were measured (Fig. 5). In an attempt to limit the use of exotic isotopes, the amount of antimony taken up in this and other assays, as noted, was determined by ICP-MS. When SCN– and NH+4 were added together, they uncoupled Sb(III) transport from NADH oxidation as well as did FCCP. However, neither SCN–, which dissipates the positive interior Δψ but does not dissipate ΔpH, nor NH+4, which dissipates the acid interior ΔpH but does not dissipate Δψ, by themselves had any effect on NADH-driven accumulation of Sb(III). These results indicate that either Δψ or ΔpH alone is sufficient to energize Sb(III) transport. Because dissipation of only Δψ does not inhibit transport, ArsB cannot be an electrophoretic anion uniporter. Instead, these results are consistent with metalloid-proton exchange. The effect of Sb(III) on ΔpH was examined. Solute/proton exchange can be assayed by the effect of the co-transported species on ΔpH using a fluorescent, weak base (18Beck J.C. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 208-214Google Scholar, 19Brey R.N. Beck J.C. Rosen B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 83: 1588-1594Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the weak base acridine orange is quenched on formation of a pH gradient in everted membrane vesicles (Fig. 6) (11Perlin D.S. San Francisco M.J. Slayman C.W. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 248: 53-61Google Scholar). Addition of 10 mm (NH4)2SO4 completely reversed fluorescence quenching, consistent with dissipation of ΔpH by a weak base (data not shown). Addition of Sb(III) in the form of potassium antimonyl tartrate reversed quenching in a concentration-dependent manner; potassium tartrate alone had no effect. Membranes from cells lacking an arsB gene showed no fluorescence enhancement, demonstrating that this assay measures ArsB activity. The effect of Sb(III) on Δψ was examined. Membrane potential formation in everted membrane vesicles can be visualized from the quenching of the permeant dye oxonol (12Perlin D.S. Kasamo K. Brooker R.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7884-7892Google Scholar). Addition of NADH quenched oxonol fluorescence (Fig. 7). Sb(III) rapidly reversed quenching in a concentration-dependent manner. There was no effect of Sb(III) on oxonol fluorescence in membranes from cells without arsB. Potassium tartrate slowly depolarized the membrane, but the same effect was observed in membranes from cells with or without arsB. Addition of 10 mm KSCN rapidly and completely reversed fluorescence quenching, showing that this permeant anion dissipates Δψ (data not shown). ArsB Catalyzes Co-transport of As(III) and Sb(III)—Everted membrane vesicles prepared from cells of E. coli strain AW10 expressing ArsB from plasmid pKMB1 exhibited NADH-coupled 73As(III) uptake compared with cells with vector plasmid pKK223-3 (Fig. 8). Comparing the rates of uptake at a metalloid concentration of 0.1 mm, the rate of 125Sb(III) uptake (31.3 nmol/min/mg protein) (Fig. 3) was approximately 35-fold higher than that of 73As(III) (0.9 nmol/min/mg protein) (Fig. 8). When Sb(III) was added together with 73As(III), the rate of uptake was stimulated 10-fold (9.1 nmol/min/mg protein) (Fig. 8). In contrast, As(III) inhibited the uptake of 125Sb(III) (Fig. 4). To examine this apparently paradoxical result in more detail, the rates of As(III) and Sb(III) uptake were determined simultaneously using ICP-MS (Fig. 9). In this experiment, the concentration of one metalloid was fixed at five different concentrations: 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μm. At each of these concentrations of one metalloid, the concentration of the other metalloid was varied between 0 and 1000 μm. At every concentration of As(III), Sb(III) stimulated uptake of As(III), and at every concentration of Sb(III), As(III) inhibited uptake of Sb(III). When the two metalloids were present at approximately equal concentrations, the rates of uptake of the two were approximately the same. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that ArsB catalyzes co-transport of the two metalloids. However, co-transport does not explain the converse effect of one metalloid on the rate of uptake of the other. If it were simply co-transport, with separate sites on ArsB for As(III) and Sb(III), then As(III) would be expected to stimulate Sb(III) transport as Sb(III) stimulates As(III) transport. If As(III) and Sb(III) were simply alternate substrates for the same site on ArsB, then Sb(III) would be expected to compete with the uptake of As(III) as As(III) competes for Sb(III) uptake. Moreover, the effect of As(III) on Sb(III) uptake does not appear to be simple competitive inhibition. When the concentration dependence of Sb(III) uptake was analyzed as a function of As(III), increasing sigmoidicity was observed (Fig. 10). In the absence of As(III), the data from two separate experiments could be reasonably fitted to the Michaelis-Menten relationship, generating apparent Km and Vmax values of 43 μm and 182 nmol/mg protein/min, respectively. When the data were analyzed using the Hill relationship, the apparent Km value was 44 μm, with a Vmax of 172 nmol/mg protein/min and a Hill coefficient of 1.6 (Table II). As the concentration of As(III) increased, the apparent Km increased, the Vmax decreased, and the Hill coefficient increased to a value of 2.5 at 1000 μm As(III). These results strongly suggest some sort of interaction of As(III) and Sb(III) associated with transport by ArsB.Table IIEffect of sodium arsenite on the kinetics of Sb(III) uptakeaAverage of two ICP-MS measurements.

FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 311-325Google Scholar), ArsB is a ubiquitous transport protein found in the genomes and plasmids of most bacteria and archaea (1Rosen B.P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 86-92Google Scholar). ArsB is unusual in that it is either a secondary carrier coupled to the electrochemical proton gradient or the translocation subunit of the As(III)/Sb(III)-translocating ArsAB ATPase (2Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 385-389Google Scholar, 3Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Google Scholar). Based on this novel dual mode of energy coupling, we had proposed that not only the ArsAB pump but other solute-translocating ATPases such as the F0 – F1 and ATP-binding cassette transporters evolved from the association of carriers or channels with soluble ATPases (5Rosen B.P. Dey S. Dou D. Ji G. Kaur P. Ksenzenko M. Silver S. Wu J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 257-272Google Scholar, 6Driessen A.J. Rosen B.P. Konings W.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 397-401Google Scholar). Yet, both the mechanism and substrate of ArsB are probably different from those that were previously conceived (4Kuroda M. Dey S. Sanders O.I. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 326-331Google Scholar). Based on a dependence on the electrochemical proton gradient, we had proposed that ArsB is a uniporter that catalyzes electrophoretic efflux of the arsenite anion out of cells in response to the outside positive membrane potential. In this report we demonstrate for the first time translocation of Sb(III) by ArsB. Because the pKa value of inorganic trivalent antimony is 11.8, the concentration of the antimonite anion at a cytosolic pH level of 7.5 (21Slonczewski J.L. Rosen B.P. Alger J.R. Macnab R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6271-6275Google Scholar) is 4 orders of magnitude lower than the total Sb(III) concentration. The paucity of the intracellular antimonite anion would make a uniport mechanism improbable; rather, As(III) and Sb(III) are protonated neutral molecules at cytosolic pH level, and mechanisms that couple efflux of a neutral substrate to the electrochemical proton gradient must be considered. Extrusion of a neutral molecule from cells into the acid and positive exterior could be accomplished by exchange with a cation. Because dependence on an inorganic cation was not observed, protons are a reasonable alternative. This hypothesis was tested in two ways. First, the electrochemical proton gradient was applied as only a membrane potential or only a pH gradient. Either was capable of supporting Sb(III) uptake into everted membrane vesicles. These results are inconsistent with either a uniporter for a neutral solute, which would catalyze only facilitated diffusion, or a uniporter for an anion, which would be able to couple only to the membrane potential and not the pH gradient. Second, Sb(III)/H+ exchange can be inferred by the dissipation of ΔpH concomitant with the addition of Sb(III). That exchange is electrophoretic is shown by the ability of Sb(III) to dissipate Δψ. The most reasonable explanation for these results is that ArsB is a metalloid-proton antiporter. From the reported topological determination of ArsB (8Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Google Scholar), two glutamate and four aspartate residues can be predicted to be located in transmembrane domains of ArsB, some of which may be involved in H+ translocation. What is the nature of the trivalent metalloid substrate of ArsB? We have recently shown by extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) that in solution at a neutral pH the predominant arsenic species is As(OH)3, 2A. Ramírez-Solís, R. Mukopadhyay, B. P. Rosen, and T. L. Stemmler, unpublished observations. and by analogy the antimony species would be Sb(OH)3. Indeed, we postulate that the trihydroxides are the forms of the metalloids that are translocated by GlpF and the eukaryotic aquaglyceroporin channels (16Liu Z. Shen J. Carbrey J.M. Mukhopadhyay R. Agre P. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6053-6058Google Scholar). On the other hand, As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 are not likely to be the substrates of ArsB because these forms cannot explain the interactions observed between As(III) and Sb(III): 1) As(III) inhibits uptake of Sb(III); 2) Sb(III) stimulates As(III) uptake; 3) the rates of uptake of the two metalloids are approximately equal when the two are present at roughly equivocal concentrations; and 4) the kinetics of Sb(III) uptake become increasingly sigmoidal in the presence of As(III). One possibility is that ArsB oligomerizes, with subunit-subunit interaction; another possibility is that ArsB has separate binding sites for As(III) and Sb(III). Neither possibility easily explains the stimulation of uptake of one substrate by the other and yet reciprocal inhibition of the first by the second. A third possibility is that the substrate polymerizes analogously to phosphate, pyrophosphate, and polyphosphate. In fact, trivalent As(III) is known to readily form oxo-bridged polymers. The crystal structure of arsenious oxide, As4O6, is a six-membered (As-O)3 ring with the fourth As(III) coordinated to the three axial oxygens (22Hamson G.C. Stosick A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1938; 60: 1814-1822Google Scholar). In addition, a search of the Cambridge Structural Database identifies 109 oxo-bridged As-O-As compounds, nearly all of which are cyclic, including 10 with hexose-like six-membered (AsO)3 rings. (Note that polymerization of (AsO)n creates even-numbered rings, and six- and eight-membered rings are the most common in the data base, whereas pentose-like five membered rings are not formed.) If these are physiologically relevant forms, why are they not visible in the EXAFS spectra? First, EXAFS is remarkably accurate in determining bond length, but it is quite insensitive to the presence of minor species. If the As(OH)3 equilibrium with polymeric forms favors the monomeric form, the polymeric forms would probably not be observed. Second, an EXAFS assay was not performed because Sb(III) requires higher energy x-rays than were available, so it is possible that oxobridged Sb(III) species would be observed. Admittedly, this proposition relies on the existence of solution structures that have not yet been identified. However, we have recently found that As(III) is transported by most of the hexose transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and have proposed that the substrate is a hexose-like six-membered (As-O)3 ring (24Liu Z. Eckhard B. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. February 14, 2004; (10.1074/jbc.M314006200)Google Scholar). In yeast transport of As(III) via hexose, permeases are inhibited by hexoses, and glucose transport is inhibited by As(III). In contrast, ArsB-mediated transport of either As(III) or Sb(III) is not inhibited by a 1000-fold excess of glucose, mannose, galactose, or fructose (data not shown). Thus, ArsB is a specific metalloid carrier and not a sugar carrier. A proposal for the substrate of ArsB that explains the present results similarly involves six-membered rings composed of As(III), Sb(III), and co-polymers of the two metalloids (Fig. 11). If the equilibrium favors rings containing Sb(III) over those containing As(III), the apparent preference for Sb(III) in ArsB catalysis may in actuality be simply the higher concentration of the (SbO)3 substrate compared with the (AsO)3 substrate at the same total amount of metalloid. The apparent stimulation of As(III) by Sb(III) is simply the mass action effect of Sb(III) in formation of the true substrate of ArsB. Similarly, the apparent inhibition of Sb(III) uptake by As(III) is also the result of mass action. The results of the co-transport experiment (Fig. 9) appear to require 1:1 co-transport, but these results could also be explained by formation of the two co-polymer forms (Fig. 11B) that would appear as an average of 1:1 co-transport. The most parsimonious explanation for the apparent cooperativity that As(III) imposes on Sb(III) uptake is that the rate-limiting step in uptake is formation of the substrate. As the concentration of As(III) increases, formation of the preferred (SbO)3 is impeded. The increase in the Hill coefficient with increasing concentration of As(III) to values approaching 3 is consistent with a progression of six-membered rings from (SbO)3 to (AsO)(SbO)2 to (AsO)2(SbO) to (AsO)3. Thus, rather than interactions of sites within the ArsB carrier, we propose that cooperativity is imparted by interaction of substrates."

The processing of APP involves proteolytic conversion by different secretases leading to α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ϵ-cleavages. Since modulation of these cleavages represents a rational therapeutic approach to control amyloid formation, its interference with the processing of the members of the APP gene family is of considerable importance.

Pharmacological manipulation with specific protease inhibitors revealed that both homologues are processed by α- and γ-secretase-like cleavages, and that their intracellular domains can be released by cleavage at ϵ-sites. APLP-2 processing appears to be the most elaborate and to involve alternative cleavage sites.

BACE cleavage releases the large ectodomain of APP (sAPPβ) and creates a membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (CTF) of 99 amino acids.

A subset of type I membrane proteins that includes Notch, the ErbB4 tyrosine kinase receptor for neuregulins, E-cadherin, LRP, CD44, Delta, Jagged, and Nectin-1-α (37De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Google Scholar) is also processed by a presenilin-dependent, γ-secretase-like activity. For Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, CD44, Delta, Jagged (37De Strooper B.

Cell Res. 1999; 251: 433-441Google Scholar), it has also been demonstrated that ectodomain cleavage by a metalloprotease precedes transmembrane processing by γ-secretase-like activity. Notch S3 and APP ϵ-cleavage liberate the Notch intracellular domain and APP intracellular domain (AICD), respectively, enabling their translocation to the nucleus where they can activate transcription (39Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Google Scholar, 40Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5663-5667Google Scholar, 41Cao X.

So far the processing of the APP-like proteins, APLP-1 and APLP-2, remains poorly understood. Large secretory fragments of APLP-1 (4Paliga K. Peraus G. Kreger S. Durrwang U. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Weidemann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 354-363Google Scholar) and APLP-2 (43Webster M.T. Groome N. Francis P.T. Pearce B.R. Sherriff F.E. Thinakaran G. Felsenstein K.M. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Bowen D.M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 95-99Google Scholar) corresponding to the size of α- and β-secretase-processed secretory fragments of APP have been detected in the media of transfected cell lines. In addition, the accumulation of an APLP-1 C-terminal fragment was observed in PS-1(–/–) neurons (44Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1213-1221Google Scholar). Presenilin-dependent processing of this fragment is consistent with our previous finding that PS-2 interacts with immature APLP-1 (45Weidemann A. Paliga K. Durrwang U. Czech C. Evin G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 328-332Google Scholar). To elucidate further the processing of APLP-1 and APLP-2, we developed a method to detect C-terminal fragments derived from APP, APLP-1, and APLP-2 cleavage within their transmembrane domains by stabilizing the cytosolic domains as chimeric fusion proteins with two z-domains of protein A fused in tandem (2z tag). This method previously enabled us to detect the soluble APP C-terminal fragment (ϵ-CTF or AICD) generated by proteolysis at the ϵ-site, distal to the γ-cleavage site (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). The analysis of APLP-1 and APLP-2 C-terminal fragments with the 2z tag system revealed a high similarity between the processing of APLPs and APP. Here we show that pharmacological studies with different inhibitors of α- and γ-secretases suggest for APLP-2 the production of several α- and ϵ-like C-terminal fragments, indicating therefore that the processing of this homologue is the most complex of all three APP gene family members. Furthermore, we could detect small secreted fragments in the conditioned media of APLP-2-transfected cell lines that very likely correspond to Aβ and p3-like peptides. For APLP-1, we have identified cellular α- and ϵ-like C-terminal fragments and secreted p3-like fragments using SH-SY5Y cells stably overexpressing APLP-1. In addition, we show that cleavage of APLP-1 can be regulated by N-glycosylation, leading to formation of alternative p3-like fragments. DNA Constructs—To generate the 2z-tagged APP derivatives, 2z-cDNA was amplified by PCR using pQE60–2z as template (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar), a sense primer encoding an XhoI restriction site, and a thrombin (LVPR GS) cleavage (5′-CCCCTCGAGCTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCGAAAGAGGAGAAATTAACC-3′) and an antisense primer encoding a stop codon and a ClaI restriction site. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) by using the XhoI and ClaI restriction sites. Generation of APP695–2z has been described previously (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). To generate APLP-1-2z, the human APLP-1 cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK+ (4Paliga K. Peraus G. Kreger S. Durrwang U. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Weidemann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 354-363Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with a T7 universal primer and an antisense primer that encoded a SalI restriction site just after the APLP-1 coding region (for the following 2z tag ligation). The corresponding 640-bp PCR product was digested with BamHI (coding region) and SalI (3′-end). The original cDNA (APLP-1 in pBluescript) was digested KpnI/BamHI and ligated with the PCR product in pBluescript SK+ (KpnI/SalI). The sequence of the 640-bp product was verified by sequencing. After digestion with KpnI/SalI, the full-length APLP-1 cDNA encoding the additional SalI-site at the 3′-end was ligated with the 2z-cDNA (XhoI/ClaI) into pBluescript SK+, digested with KpnI/ClaI. Subcloning of the APLP-1-2z construct in the expression vector pCEP4 cleaved with KpnI/NheI was performed by using the KpnI/XbaI sites. To generate the APLP-2-763-2z construct, the human APLP-2-763 cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK+ was amplified by PCR with T3 reverse primer and a 3′-antisense primer encoding a SalI restriction site (for the following 2z tag ligation). The PCR product was digested with AatII (in the coding region) and SalI (3′-coding region). The original APLP-2-763 pBluescript SK+ clone was digested with BamHI/AatII, and both fragments were cloned into pBluescript SK+ (cleaved with BamHI/SalI). The XbaI/SalI fragment encoding the full-length cDNA was cloned together with 2z-cDNA (XhoI/SalI cleaved) into pCEP4 (NheI/BamHI cleaved). APLP-1 Deletion Mutants—The human APLP-1 cDNA in pBluescript SK+ (4Paliga K. Peraus G. Kreger S. Durrwang U. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Weidemann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 354-363Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the following primer, APLP-1-2z sense primer (encoding a KpnI restriction site): D568-APLP-1-2z, 5′-GGGGGTACCCACCATGGATGAGCTGGCACCAGCTGGG-3′; R579-APLP-1-2z, 5′-GGGGGTACCCACCATGCGTGAGGCTGTATCGGCGTCTG-3′; M588-APLP-1-2z, 5′-GGGGGTACCCACCATGGGAGCGGGCGGAGGCTCCCTC-3′; M600-APLP-1-2z, 5′-GGGGGTACCCACCATGCTGCTCCTGCGCAGGAAGAAG-3′; and 3′-CGGACCTCCTTGCTGGGCAGCTGGGG-5′ for the antisense primer (encoding a SalI restriction site). The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned in pBluescript SK+, by using the KpnI and SalI restriction sites. The SalI site of the APLP-1 deletion constructs was ligated with the XhoI site of the 2z-DNA in pBluescript (XhoI/ClaI) and cloned into KpnI/ClaI-cleaved pBluescript SK+. The human APLP-2 cDNA in pBluescript SK+ was amplified by PCR using the following primer, APLP-2 deletion mutants, APLP-2 sense primer (encoding a KpnI restriction site): M664-APLP-2-2z, 5′-CCCGGTACCACCATGATTTTCAATGCCGAGAGAG-3′; S691-APLP-2-2z, 5′-CCCGGTACCACCATGAGTAGCAGTGCTCTCATTGG-3′; M715-APLP-2-2z, 5′-CCCGGTACCACCATGCTGAGGAAGAGGCAGTATGG-3′; and 3′-GGACCTCGTCTACGTCTAAACAGCTGGGG-5′ for the antisense primer (encoding a SalI restriction site). The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into pBluescript SK+, using the KpnI and SalI restriction sites. The SalI site of the APLP-2 deletion constructs was ligated with the XhoI site of the 2z-DNA in pBluescript (XhoI/ClaI) and cloned in the vector pBluescript SK+ KpnI/ClaI. The template APLP-2-2z in pCEP4 was amplified by PCR using the following primer: R678-APLP-2-2z, 5′-CCCGGTACCACCATGCGGGAATCCGTGGGCCCAC-3′(encoding a KpnI restriction site); antisense primer, 3′-CCCTCCTAGGTCTAGAACTTAGCTACCG-5′. The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned in pBluescript SK+, by using the KpnI and SalI restriction sites. The SalI site of the APLP-2 deletion constructs was ligated with the XhoI site of the 2z-DNA in pBluescript (XhoI/ClaI) and cloned into the vector pBluescript SK+KpnI/ClaI. Mutant N551Q APLP-1 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the human APLP-1 cDNA in pBluescript SK+ and subcloned into the vector pCEP4. Mutant R567E APLP-1 c-Myc was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the human APLP-1 cDNA with an C-terminal Myc tag in pBluescript SK+ and subcloned into the vector pCEP4. Antibodies—The human APLP-1-specific antiserum 150 was raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 553–592 of human APLP-1 (46Walsh D.M. Fadeeva J.V. LaVoie M.J. Paliga K. Eggert S. Kimberly W.T. Wasco W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6664-6673Google Scholar). The human APLP-2-specific antiserum 158 was raised in rabbits using the synthetic peptide sequence 672–696 of APLP-2-763, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The APLP-1-specific antiserum 57 was raised in rabbits using keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates of two peptides, corresponding to human APLP-1 residues 642–650 and residues 604–614 with an additional N-terminal cysteine. An antibody recognizing the APLP-2 C terminus was purchased from Calbiochem (residues 752–763). The polyclonal antibody CT13 against the APP C terminus was raised against a synthetic peptide comprising the C-terminal 13 residues of A4CT (Eurogenetech, Brussels, Belgium) (47Grziwa B. Grimm M.O. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Hartmann T. Lichtenthaler S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6803-6808Google Scholar). The human APLP-1-specific antiserum 42464 was raised in rabbits using a synthetic peptide raised to the ectodomain of APLP-1 (residues 499–557) (4Paliga K. Peraus G. Kreger S. Durrwang U. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Weidemann A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 354-363Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Inhibitor Treatment—Human SH-SY5Y cells were cultivated and transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). For inhibitor experiments cells were treated for 7 h with Me2SO or Me2SO solutions of the following compounds: L-685,458, batimastat (provided by Merck, Sharp & Dohne), TAPI-2 (Peptides International), MDL28170/calpain inhibitor III (benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Phe-CHO, carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalanyl, Calbiochem), γ-secretase inhibitor IX (DAPT) (Calbiochem), MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-LLL-CHO, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal, Calbiochem), ALLN (calpain inhibitor I, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal-CHO, Calbiochem), lactacystin (Calbiochem). Cells were pretreated for 1 h with tunicamycin (Sigma) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Calbiochem) and chased for 4 h. Control cells were treated with Me2SO. Immunoblotting—Lysis of cells and immunoprecipitation of APP, APLP-1, and APLP-2 was performed as described previously (48Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Google Scholar). 2z-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using human IgG immobilized to Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For the analysis of the 2z-tagged CTFs, samples were denatured in sample buffer in the absence of reducing agents and electrophoresed on 15% Tris/glycine gels. To investigate the full-length 2z-tagged proteins, samples were denatured in sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 8% Tris/glycine gels. After Western blotting, samples were incubated with a nonspecific rabbit antiserum as the primary antibody followed by anti-rabbit serum coupled to horseradish peroxidase and ECL detection. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells cultivated in 6-cm dishes were incubated for 7 h with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine/dish (Amersham Biosciences) in 1.5 ml of minimum essential medium lacking methionine (Sigma), and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Sigma). The conditioned media were harvested, centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris, subsequently transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes, and finally subjected to immunoprecipitation for 3 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science). The 10,000 × g supernatants were diluted 1:5 in buffer A (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with 0.05% SDS) and subjected to immunoprecipitation for 3 h at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with buffer A, twice with buffer B (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0,2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA), once with buffer A′ (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0,2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with 0,2% SDS), and once with buffer C (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5). The beads were resuspended in 40 μl 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. For analysis of the 2z-tagged CTFs, samples were denatured in sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed on 15% Tris/glycine gels. For analysis of the 2z-tagged full-length protein, samples were denatured in sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed on 8% Tris/glycine gels. To investigate the APLP-1 wt CTFs and the small secreted peptides, samples were denatured in sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed on 16.5% Tris/Tricine gels. The full-length protein was analyzed on 8% Tris/glycine gels. Detection of the C-terminal Fragments of APP695, APLP-1, and APLP-2-763—The investigation of the C-terminal proteolytic fragments of APLP-1 and APLP-2 was performed in analogy to our previous study on APP processing (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar), for which the APP cytosolic domain was stabilized as a chimeric fusion protein with a 2z tag. This tag corresponds to a tandem repeat of the z-domain of protein A that binds to the heavy chain of immunoglobulins. We have shown that the 2z tag does not alter the proteolytic processing of APP but stabilizes its C-terminal fragments and enhances their detection (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). This method has enabled the detection of a novel ϵ-cleavage site of APP at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane domain, between Leu49 and Val50 (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). Thus, the 2z tag was fused to the C termini of APLP-1 and APLP-2-763, and these constructs, which we termed APLP-1-2z and APLP-2-2z, respectively, were overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells. Cell lysates from SH-SY5Y cells, stably transfected with either APP-2z, APLP-1-2z, or APLP-2-2z, were incubated with IgG-coupled Sepharose to precipitate 2z-encoding full-length proteins and C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1). Cells transfected with an empty vector were used as a control. Classification of the C-terminal fragments of APLP-1-2z and APLP-2-2z in Fig. 1 is based on pharmacological studies, and the size of these fragments is compared with deletion mutants as shown below. For APP-2z cells, two major fragments of 27 and 23 kDa were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1A, lane 1) that represent the C-terminal cleavage products derived from APP processing at α- and ϵ-sites, respectively, as determined previously by N-terminal sequence analysis (23Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). The two upper bands at 29 and 28 kDa correspond to C-terminal"
https://openalex.org/W2082574748,"Thermotoga maritima invertase (β-fructosidase) hydrolyzes sucrose to release fructose and glucose, which are major carbon and energy sources for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The name “invertase” was given to this enzyme over a century ago, because the 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose that it produces was named “invert sugar.” Despite its name, the enzyme operates with a mechanism leading to the retention of the anomeric configuration at the site of cleavage. The enzyme belongs to family GH32 of the sequence-based classification of glycosidases. The crystal structure, determined at 2-Å resolution, reveals two modules, namely a five-bladed β-propeller with structural similarity to the β-propeller structures of glycosidase from families GH43 and GH68 connected to a β-sandwich module. Three carboxylates at the bottom of a deep, negatively charged funnel-shaped depression of the β-propeller are essential for catalysis and function as nucleophile, general acid, and transition state stabilizer, respectively. The catalytic machinery of invertase is perfectly superimposable to that of the enzymes of families GH43 and GH68. The variation in the position of the furanose ring at the site of cleavage explains the different mechanisms evident in families GH32 and GH68 (retaining) and GH43 (inverting) furanosidases.

The variation in the position of the furanose ring at the site of cleavage explains the different mechanisms evident in families GH32 and GH68 (retaining) and GH43 (inverting) furanosidases. Invertase, the β-d-fructofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.26) that cleaves sucrose into fructose and glucose is one of the earliest discovered enzymes. It was isolated in the second half of the 19th century, and its name was coined because the enzyme produces “invert” sugar, which is a 1:1 mixture of dextrorotatory d-glucose and levorotatory d-fructose (1O'Sullivan C. Tompson F.W. J. Chem. Soc. 1890; 57: 854-870Google Scholar). Because of its chemical structure, sucrose can be cleaved by either α-glucosidase or β-fructofuranosidase activity. Koshland and Stein established that invertase is a β-fructofuranosidase by performing the reaction in 18O-labeled water and determining the 18O content of the products (2Koshland Jr., D.E. Stein S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 208: 139-148Google Scholar). The transfructosylation activity of invertase indicated that the enzyme operates with a molecular mechanism leading to overall retention of the anomeric configuration (2Koshland Jr., D.E. Stein S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 208: 139-148Google Scholar). The breakdown of sucrose is widely used as a carbon or energy source by bacteria, fungi, and plants. In plants, both glucose and fructose are implicated in the signaling pathways by which sucrose concentration functions as a key sensor of the nutritional status of plants, and, thus, invertase plays a fundamental role in controlling cell differentiation and development (3Sturm A. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1-8Google Scholar, 4Sturm A. Tang G.Q. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 401-407Google Scholar). Commercially, invertase is mainly used in the confectionery industry, where fructose is preferred over sucrose because of a sweeter taste and a lower propensity to crystallize.Although animals, including man, display a strong preference for sucrose-containing diets, their genomes do not encode invertases. Instead, they use a different and unrelated enzyme, sucrose α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.48), to hydrolyze sucrose. The genomes of human gut microorganisms such as Bacteriodes thetaiotamicron (5Xu J. Bjursell M.K. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L.K. Chiang H.C. Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Google Scholar) and Bifidobacterium longum (6Schell M.A. Karmirantzou M. Snel B.

A. 2002; 99: 14422-14427Google Scholar) do possess invertase genes, demonstrating that these organisms benefit from the large intake of sucrose by humans.Invertases are found in family GH32 of the sequence-based classification of glycoside hydrolases (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY) (7Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Google Scholar). This family, which includes over 370 members (as of January 2004) from plant, fungal, and bacterial origin, contains not only invertases but also other fructofuranosidases such as inulinase (EC 3.2.1.7), levanase (EC 3.2.1.65), and exo-inulinase (EC 3.2.1.80), and transfructosidases such as sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.99) and fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.100).Glycoside hydrolases or glycosidases are a widespread group of enzymes displaying a great variety of protein folds and substrate specificities. They share a common defining feature in two critically located acidic residues, which make up the catalytic machinery responsible for the cleavage of glycosidic bonds. These two invariant residues have been identified experimentally in yeast invertase as an aspartate located close to the N terminus acting as the nucleophile (8Reddy V.A. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10817-10820Google Scholar) and a glutamate acting as the general acid/base (9Reddy A. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13953-13957Google Scholar). The enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds has two possible stereochemical outcomes, inversion or retention of the anomeric configuration. Invertase is a retaining enzyme (2Koshland Jr., D.E. Stein S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 208: 139-148Google Scholar). With no known exception to date, the molecular mechanism appears conserved among the members of a given sequence-based family (10Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar, 11Gebler J. Gilkes N.R. Claeyssens M. Wilson D.B. Beguin P. Wakarchuk W.W. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12559-12561Google Scholar). Sensitive sequence analyses coupled to structural comparisons have revealed significant similarities between representatives of different families, accompanied by a conservation of the catalytic machinery and of the stereochemical outcome of the reaction, reflecting ancient divergence from a common ancestor to acquire novel substrate specificities (12Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Google Scholar). The evolutionarily, structurally, and mechanistically related families were grouped together in higher hierarchical level termed “clans” (10Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Google Scholar).Threading analyses and homology modeling have led to the prediction that, as a member of glycosidase family GH32, invertase would display a six-bladed β-propeller fold related to that of influenza virus neuraminidase (13Pons T. Olmea O. Chinea G. Beldarrain A. Marquez G. Acosta N. Rodriguez L. Valencia A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 383-395Google Scholar). However, the recent report on the three-dimensional structure of the family GH68 levansucrase from Bacillus subtilis (14Meng G. Futterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Google Scholar) revealed that it had a novel five-bladed propeller fold, which has only been described previously for tachylectin (15Beisel H.G. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2313-2322Google Scholar) and for the family GH43 α-l-arabinanase from Cellvibrio japonicus (16Nurizzo D. Turkenburg J.P. Charnock S.J. Roberts S.M. Dodson E.J. McKie V.A. Taylor E.J. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 665-668Google Scholar). Recent detailed sequence analyses have revealed the existence of sequence motifs conserved in the glycosidase families GH32, GH43, GH62, and GH68, suggesting a possible structural relationship between these families (17Naumoff D.G. Proteins. 2001; 42: 66-76Google Scholar) despite the opposite mechanisms in GH32 and GH68 (retaining) and GH43 (inverting). It should be noted that, because of the rapid mutarotation of furanoses, it is very difficult to experimentally determine the stereochemical course of the reaction catalyzed by furanosidases such as the family GH43 α-l-arabinofuranosidases. Three independent reports have, however, concluded that family GH43 enzymes operate by an inverting mechanism (18Pitson S.M. Voragen A.G. Beldman G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 7-11Google Scholar, 19Braun C. Meinke A. Ziser L. Withers S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 259-262Google Scholar, 20Kersters-Hilderson H. Claeyssens M. van Doorslaer E. de Bruyne C.K. Carbohydr. Res. 1976; 47: 269-273Google Scholar). The mechanism prevailing in family GH62 is not known.After over a century of investigations and almost 40 years since the first crystal structure of a protein was solved, no three-dimensional structure of an invertase or of any member of glycosidase family GH32 has been reported. Here we report the three-dimensional crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima invertase. This thermostable enzyme has recently been biochemically characterized by Liebl et al. (21Liebl W. Brem D. Gotschlich A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 55-64Google Scholar), who have determined that it liberates fructose from various substrates such as sucrose, raffinose, and inulin. The structure not only provides a template for all members of family GH32 (including invertases, inulinases, levanases, exo-inulinases, sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferases, and fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferases), but it also allows dissection of the exquisite details that distinguish retaining and inverting furanosidases with a perfectly superimposable catalytic machinery.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Genomic DNA of T. maritima strain MSB8 (DSM 3109), kindly provided by Dr. Wolfgang Liebl (Georg-August-Universität, Göttingen, Germany), was used to amplify the invertase gene (GenBank™ accession number AAD36485). The Escherichia coli strains used were DH5α for cloning experiments and BL21pLysS for expression. Vector pDONR is from Invitrogen, whereas vector pDEST17O/I is the modified vector pDEST17 from Invitrogen by insertion of lacO and lacI, to prevent expression leakage.The invertase gene was amplified using INV-F (5′-TTCAAGCCGAATTATCACTT-3′) and INV-R (5′-TCACAACCATATGTTCTCGA-3′) primers containing recombination sequences for integration in Gateway™ vectors. PCR was performed using 500 ng of total genomic DNA of T. maritima, 300 nm each primer, 1.2 mm dNTP, 2.5 units of Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen), 1× Pfx buffer (Invitrogen), and 1 mm MgSO4. The amplification program was 94 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min. The amplification was completed with a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The amplification product was purified by precipitation in 30% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 30 mm MgCl2 and re-suspended in 50 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The PCR product was cloned in pDONR (Invitrogen) and then in pDEST17O/I vectors as described in the manual supplied by Invitrogen (22Invitrogen Gateway™ Technology, a Universal Technology to Clone DNA Sequences for Functional Analysis and Expression in Multiple Systems, Version C. Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA2002Google Scholar) to obtain the plasmid pINV.A single colony of BL21 pLysS containing the pINV plasmid was used to inoculate 40 ml of TBAC (Terrific broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol). The culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C with constant shaking. This culture was used to inoculate 3 liters of TBAC. Incubation was done at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (240 rpm), and 0.5 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added when A600 reached 0.8. This induction was followed by another incubation at 37 °C of 4 h. Cultures were pelleted and then re-suspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme. This cell suspension was kept overnight at -80 °C. After thawing, the lysate was supplemented with 10 μg/ml DNase I and 20 mm MgSO4 and then incubated at 37 °C until it became fluid. The supernatant containing soluble proteins was separated from the pellet by centrifugation (20,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C.The SeMet 1The abbreviations used are: SeMet, selenomethionine; SAD, single wavelength anomalous dispersion. protein was produced as follows. A single colony of BL21 pLysS containing the pINV plasmid was used to inoculate TBAC followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C. This culture was washed several times to remove the traces of TBAC medium and then used to inoculate 2 liters of M9 medium (medium from Difco supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 0.36% glucose, 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol). Incubation was performed at 37 °C under vigorous shaking (240 rpm). When the A600 reached 0.5, 1.5 mm l-lysine, 1.5 mm l-phenylalanine, 1.5 mm l-threonine, 0.8 mm of l-leucine, 0.8 mm l-isoleucine, 0.8 mm l-valine, and 0.5 mm seleno-l-methionine (final concentrations) were added. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture. After induction, expression was followed by measuring A600 until a value of 1.7 was reached. Culture lysis was done as described above.In all cases, the supernatant of the 20,000 × g centrifugation was filtered (Amicon, 0.2-μm pore-sized membrane), and the invertase was then purified in two steps. First, nickel affinity chromatography was performed using buffers containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, and 50 and 500 mm imidazole for the washing and elution steps, respectively. Subsequently, the protein was submitted to gel filtration on a Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated to 11 mg/ml for the native protein and 8 mg/ml for the SeMet protein over ultrafiltration styrene acrylonitrile membranes (Millipore; cut-off was 30 kDa).To verify that the N-terminal His-tag did not influence the enzymatic activity of invertase, the hydrolysis of sucrose by the purified protein was monitored. The method employed was adapted from Kidby and Davidson (23Kidby D.K. Davidson D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 55: 312-325Google Scholar) and consisted of the measurement of reducing sugars by ferricyanide. Invertase (200 μm) was incubated at 75 °C in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) and 120 mm sucrose, i.e. exactly the same conditions as those described by Liebl et al. (21Liebl W. Brem D. Gotschlich A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 55-64Google Scholar). One hundred-microliter samples were taken at different times of incubation. The enzymatic reaction was revealed by mixing samples with 1 ml of reagent (1 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 130 mm Ca2O3, and 5 mm NaOH) and by heating the samples for 7 min at 95 °C. The activity was monitored by the decrease of A420 as a function of time and led to values (data not shown) very similar to those published by Liebl et al. (21Liebl W. Brem D. Gotschlich A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 55-64Google Scholar).Crystallization of Native and SeMet-substituted Proteins—Crystallization conditions were first investigated using two sparse matrix sampling kits (Molecular Dimensions and Stura Footprint). Optimized crystals of a suitable size were obtained by mixing 15% polyethylene glycol 1000, 150 mm Li2SO4, and 100 mm sodium citrate at pH 4.2 with 11 mg ml-1 native protein. Crystals grew within 3 days at 20 °C by the vapor diffusion method. The conditions for the SeMet-substituted protein were 17% polyethylene glycol 1000, 50 mm Li2SO4, 1% isopropanol, and 100 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 4.2. Here the drops were composed of 2 μl of protein at a concentration of 8 mg ml-1 with 1 μl of reservoir solution. Both the crystals of native and SeMet-substituted protein belonged to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 94.2 Å, b = 113.2 Å, c = 129.6 Å, and β = 98.96°. The asymmetric unit contains six monomers giving a VM value of 2.2 Å Da-1 and 43% solvent content.Data Collection and Phasing—Crystals were soaked in mother liquor supplemented by 15% glycerol (w/v) before flash freezing in a cryogenic nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction data of native and SeMet-substituted protein crystals, both in space group P21, were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) on beam lines ID14-EH2 and ID29 respectively (Table I). The data on SeMet-substituted crystals were collected at the absorption peak (λ = 0.97904 Å) and phased using the SAD method. Forty of the 48 SeMet positions were determined by anomalous Patterson maps using the subroutine XPREP of the program package SHELX5.0 (24Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Google Scholar). The 40 sites were refined with SHARP (25de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Google Scholar), and the missing eight positions were found in the residual maps. The 48 selenium positions appeared to be arranged in a manner that suggested the presence of three dimers. Symmetry averaged initial phases (DMMULTI; Ref. 26Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Google Scholar), using two of the three dimer positions, were subsequently used as input for RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Google Scholar), which automatically constructed initial Cα tracing of all six monomers present in the asymmetric unit. The density modification step with RESOLVE also produced a σA-weighted 2Fo - Fc map of excellent quality into which side chains were built manually with TURBO (28Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory.Vol. 88. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B) for one monomer. The relative positioning of all molecules within the asymmetric unit was then performed by molecular replacement (AmoRe; Ref. 29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) using the first constructed monomer as search model.Table ISummary of data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsData setsNativeλ1 (Peak)Wavelength (Å)0.9790.97904High resolution (Å)2.02.2(Anomalous) completeness (%)99.9 (99.9)aNumbers in parentheses indicate values for the highest resolution bin99.3 (98.6)Redundancy3.1 (3.1)4.2 (4.2)I/σ(I)8.0 (2.1)6.8 (2.2)RsymbRsym=∑[It-〈I〉]/∑[〈I〉], where i is the ith measurement and 〈I〉 is the weighted mean of I0.077 (0.402)0.073 (0.211)Phasing statistics Anomalous difference (%)6.4 Figure of merit (overall)0.429 (0.853)cFigure of merit value in parentheses is calculated after density modification with the DM programRefinement statistics RcrystdRcryst=∑|Fobs|-|Fcalc|/∑|Fobs|.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) with intermittent manual rebuilding and refining of individual B-factors after applying a TLS correction. Water molecules were added with ARP/wARP (30Computational Collaborative Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The final model comprises 6× protein residues 1–432 (2,592 amino acids), 12 SO 42- ions, one buffer molecule (sodium citrate), and a total of 1,754 water molecules, which led to R and Rfree values of 17.6 and 22%, respectively. A few residues lacked electron density and were therefore refined with occupations of 0.5. One short surface loop (residues 96–100) was highly disordered and displayed only clear density in one of the six invertase molecules. Ramachandran statistics (PROCHECK) indicated that, for the overall structure of the six molecules present in the asymmetric unit, 87.1% of the atoms are in the most favored region, and 12.6% are in additionally allowed regions. Details of refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Fold—The crystal structure of the T. maritima invertase (residues 1–432) has been solved by SAD phasing of the SeMet-substituted protein at a maximal resolution of 2 Å. The SeMet-substituted as well as the native crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 94.2 Å, b = 113.2 Å, c = 129.6 Å, and β = 98.96°. The coordinates describing six copies of the invertase polypeptide chain and 1754 water molecules per asymmetric unit were refined to final R- and Rfree-factors of 17.6 and 22%. One molecule of invertase is composed of two individual modules, namely a five-bladed β-propeller (residues 1–295) catalytic module linked to a C-terminal β-sandwich module (residues 306 to 432) by a 10-residue linker (Fig. 1). The ensemble of six bi-modular molecules arrange into three individual dimers, displaying 2-fold symmetry each. The three dimers are not related by any point group symmetry but by non-symmetrical rotations and translations. The dimer arranges around a pseudo 2-fold axis, bringing the β-sandwich domain of monomer A in contact with the β-propeller domain of monomer B and vice versa. Upon purification, the enzyme had a profile corresponding to a size of ∼30 kDa. Nonspecific interaction of the enzyme with the Sephadex column may explain this elution behavior. The same behavior has already been observed previously (21Liebl W. Brem D. Gotschlich A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 55-64Google Scholar), and, therefore, the oligomeric state cannot be determined by this method. Preliminary investigations by dynamic light scattering indicated that the T. maritima invertase is a monomer in solution (data not shown). Several oligomeric states have been reported for invertases of various sources (31Lee H.S. Sturm A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1513-1522Google Scholar, 32Li Y. Ferenci T. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1651-1657Google Scholar). Yeast invertase displays a dimeric substructure that may form even larger oligomers upon mannose binding (33Reddy A.V. MacColl R. Maley F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2482-2487Google Scholar). The overall monomer structure of T. maritima invertase has an elliptical shape with approximate dimensions of 63 × 43 × 45 Å with a negatively charged surface depression at the center of the β-propeller.The clearly defined electron density revealed two amino acids in conflict with the GenBank™ sequence (A108 → V108 and V179 → A179). Therefore, the nucleotide sequence was checked twice (amplification from genomic DNA and the expression clone), and the two single base differences (C323 → T332 and T536 → C536) were only detected for the expression clone. As a consequence, these mismatches are attributed to misincorporation by the polymerase Pfx. Nevertheless, activity tests (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that these mutations do not affect the enzymatic activity.A five-bladed β-propeller structure has first been reported for tachylectin (15Beisel H.G. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2313-2322Google Scholar) and was found more recently for the enzymes α-l-arabinanase (16Nurizzo D. Turkenburg J.P. Charnock S.J. Roberts S.M. Dodson E.J. McKie V.A. Taylor E.J. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 665-668Google Scholar) and levansucrase (14Meng G. Futterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Google Scholar) of the glycoside hydrolase families GH43 and GH68, respectively. Highly similar to the families GH43 and GH68 structures, the five β-sheets of invertase, labeled I–V (Fig. 1), adopt the classical “W” topology of four antiparallel β-strands. The N-terminal second strand lines the central cavity, and the C-terminal last strand is at the periphery, to which the β-sandwich module is connected by a short linker. Interestingly, and in contrast to levansucrase and α-l-arabinanase, the five bladed β-propeller of invertase does possess the short “molecular Velcro” that is typical of six- and seven-bladed β-propellers (15Beisel H.G. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Huber R. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2313-2322Google Scholar, 34Burmeister W.P. Ruigrok R.W. Cusack S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 49-56Google Scholar, 35Jawad Z. Paoli M. Structure. 2002; 10: 447-454Google Scholar). The N-terminal first strand forms the outermost β-strand of the C-terminal blade V; however, only one hydrogen bond is formed across the sheet (Phe-8 O-Met-277 N, 2.88 Å). A similar short Velcro has also been observed in the six bladed β-propeller of Vibrio cholerae sialidase (36Crennell S. Garman E. Laver G. Vimr E. Taylor G. Structure. 1994; 2: 535-544Google Scholar). As in all β-propeller structures, the β-strands forming the blades are strongly twisted, giving an angle of ∼90° between the first and last β-strand of a blade. Insertions are common in this type of β-propellers, and, like-wise, short stretches of 310-helices are found inserted between several individual β-strands of the structure described here. They are, however, less extended than in the GH68 levansucrase, and from this perspective the β-propeller of invertase resembles more that of GH43 α-l-arabinanase.The Catalytic Active Site—The catalytic active site is positioned at one end of the cavity at the center of the β-propeller with a funnel-like opening toward the molecular surface. It clearly has a pocket topology, which is fully consistent with the strict exo mode of action of the enzyme on the fructose polymer inulin (21Liebl W. Brem D. Gotschlich A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 50: 55-64Google Scholar). The three carboxylate groups of two aspartate (Asp-17 and Asp-138) residues and one glutamate (Glu-190) residue point to the center of the depression and generate a high negative charge at the active site. Reddy and Maley have shown that Asp-23 in yeast invertase (Asp-17 in T. maritima invertase) is the catalytic nucleophile (8Reddy V.A. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10817-10820Google Scholar), whereas Glu-204 (here Glu-190) is the general acid/base (9Reddy A. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13953-13957Google Scholar). In addition to the two regions containing the catalytic machinery, multiple sequence alignments of the GH32 family (Fig. 2) have revealed a number of other highly conserved amino acid stretches (13Pons T. Olmea O. Chinea G. Beldarrain A. Marquez G. Acosta N. Rodriguez L. Valencia A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 383-395Google Scholar, 37Gunasekaran P. Karunakaran T. Cami B. Mukundan A.G. Preziosi L. Baratti J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6727-6735Google Scholar). The inspection of the three-dimensional structure allows us to define possible roles for these highly conserved residues. For the family GH68 levansucrase, the sucrose complex of an inactive mutant has also been reported (14Meng G. Futterer K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 935-941Google Scholar). Because the catalytic modules of invertase and levansucrase are structurally related, the superimposition of invertase with the sucrose-containing complex of levansucrase (PDB identification code 1PT2) allows us, by similarity, to infer the position of a sucrose molecule and model it in the active site of invertase (Fig. 3A). The crystal structure of invertase revealed a glycerol molecule, present in the substrate binding site, that mimicked the O4′ and O6′ hydroxyl groups of the substrate fructose moiety (Fig. 3B), and this helped define the precise position of the modeled sucrose molecule. This model shows that the second strictly conserved aspartate residue in motif D (for motif definitions see Ref. 13Pons T. Olmea O. Chinea G. Beldarrain A. Marquez G. Acosta N. Rodriguez L. Valencia A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 383-395Google Scholar and Fig. 2), Asp-138 in T. maritima invertase, forms hydrogen bonds to O3 and O4 of the fructose unit, whereas the neighboring Arg-139 is hydrogen-bonded to the glucose O4. Apparently, the pair"
https://openalex.org/W2002561949,"GEF-H1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho whose activity is regulated through a cycle of microtubule binding and release. Here we identify a region in the carboxyl terminus of GEF-H1 that is important for suppression of its guanine nucleotide exchange activity by microtubules. This portion of the protein includes a coiled-coil motif, a proline-rich motif that may interact with Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, and a potential binding site for 14-3-3 proteins. We identify GEF-H1 as a binding target and substrate for p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), an effector of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases, using an affinity-based screen and localize a PAK1 phosphorylation site to the inhibitory carboxylterminal region of GEF-H1. We show that phosphorylation of GEF-H1 at Ser885 by PAK1 induces 14-3-3 binding to the exchange factor and relocation of 14-3-3 to microtubules. Phosphorylation of GEF-H1 by PAK may be involved in regulation of GEF-H1 activity and may serve to coordinate Rho-, Rac-, and Cdc42-mediated signaling pathways.

We show that phosphorylation of GEF-H1 at Ser885 by PAK1 induces 14-3-3 binding to the exchange factor and relocation of 14-3-3 to microtubules. Phosphorylation of GEF-H1 by PAK may be involved in regulation of GEF-H1 activity and may serve to coordinate Rho-, Rac-, and Cdc42-mediated signaling pathways. Rho GTPases play an important role in regulation of many cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility; gene transcription; and cell growth, differentiation, and death. Their activity is controlled by regulatory proteins such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PAK, p21-activated kinase; SH3, Src homology 3; HA, hemagglutinin; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; SRE, serum response element. and GT-Pase-activating proteins. GEFs catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP, thereby switching the GTPase to an active conformation. GTPase-activating proteins enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPases, leading to GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of the GTPase. Cell migration is critical to development, wound healing, and the immune response. It is increasingly evident that coordinated action of the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons is required for persistent and directed cell motility. Protrusion of the leading edge depends upon actin polymerization into a dense cross-linked meshwork of actin fibers, while retraction of the rear involves contractile actin/myosin bundles in the cell body (1Condeelis J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 411-444Google Scholar, 2Small J.V. Stradal T. Vignal E. Rottner K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 112-120Google Scholar). The dynamics of these processes are controlled by the action of Rho GTPases (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar). Rac and Cdc42 are required for lamellipodial actin polymerization and filopodia formation, respectively, while RhoA regulates actin bundling into contractile stress fibers and modulates myosin-dependent tail retraction (4Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Google Scholar). Similarly, an intact microtubule system is required to maintain polarity and directed movement of tissue cells (5Liao G. Nagasaki T. Gundersen G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3473-3483Google Scholar, 6Wittmann T. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3795-3803Google Scholar). Microtubule growth at the leading edge promotes Rac activation (7Waterman-Storer C.M. Worthylake R.A. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Salmon E.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 45-50Google Scholar), which in turn acts through p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) and Op18 to enhance microtubule growth in a positive feedback cycle (8Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6196-6203Google Scholar). Physiological or drug-induced microtubule depolymerization in the cell body and tail leads to activation of RhoA (9Enomoto T. Cell Struct. Funct. 1996; 21: 317-326Google Scholar, 10Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Google Scholar). At least part of this microtubule-regulated RhoA activation is mediated through the Rho exchange factor GEF-H1. GEF-H1 was originally identified as a microtubule-associated GEF with activity toward Rho (11Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34960Google Scholar). We have characterized cellular regulation of GEF-H1 and determined that the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of full-length GEF-H1 is inhibited by interaction with microtubules (12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar). Release from microtubules results in increased GEF activity toward RhoA, and a dominant inhibitory version of GEF-H1 blocks nocodazole-induced RhoA activation. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of GEF-H1 are involved in co-localization of GEF-H1 with microtubules (12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar). Deletion and/or mutation of these regions results in the loss of microtubule co-localization and up-regulation of GEF-H1 Rho exchange activity. To further dissect the role of microtubules in regulation of the activity of GEF-H1, we produced fusion proteins consisting of the microtubule-binding region of MAP2c (13Ferralli J. Doll T. Matus A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3115-3125Google Scholar) and GEF-H1 mutants deficient in microtubule binding. The use of the MAP2c fragment enabled us to restore microtubule targeting of GEF-H1 mutants and to investigate the effect of such targeting on GEF-H1 activity. This approach led to identification of the carboxyl terminus of GEF-H1 as a region crucial for regulation of the activity of the microtubule-bound protein. PAKs are serine/threonine kinases whose activity is regulated by the binding of activated Rac or Cdc42 GTPases (14Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 857-862Google Scholar). PAKs have been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular activities, including dynamics of the actin and microtubular cytoskeletons (8Wittmann T. Bokoch G.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6196-6203Google Scholar, 15Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Google Scholar). In an independent biochemical screen for novel substrates of PAK1, we identified GEF-H1 as a phosphorylation target of PAK1. A PAK1 phosphorylation site in GEF-H1 was mapped to the carboxyl-terminal portion of the protein that is involved in regulation of its activity when bound to microtubules. The identified PAK phosphorylation site is embedded in a predicted 14-3-3 binding motif, and we demonstrate that phosphorylation of GEF-H1 at Ser885 by PAK1 regulates the docking of 14-3-3 to GEF-H1 and its recruitment to microtubules. These observations suggest that PAK and 14-3-3 are involved in regulation of GEF-H1 activity and that phosphorylation of GEF-H1 by PAK may act to coordinate Rac/Cdc42- and Rho-dependent signaling pathways. Plasmids—GEF-H1 and KIAA-0651 constructs in the mammalian expression vectors pCMV5-HA3 and pCMV5-EGFP have been described previously (12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar). These vectors are derivatives of pCMV5 that contain a triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitope or EGFP inserted between EcoRI and KpnI sites for amino-terminal fusion. GEF-H1 or 0651 subregions (indicated by the first and last amino acid position) were inserted into pCMV5-HA3 or -EGFP between the KpnI and ClaI sites or into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-KG between EcoRI and HindIII. Rat MAP2c fragment (amino acids 231–467), generously provided by Dr. Shelley Halpain, was subcloned into pCMV5-EGFP vector either using the KpnI site upstream of the GEF-H1 insert or using ClaI/HindIII sites downstream of GEF-H1. An inactive mutant of GST-PAK1 (D389A) was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. This mutant was inactive in in vitro kinase assay and did not bind GEF-H1 (data not shown). Plasmids encoding HA-tagged 14-3-3 ϵ and ζ were a generous gift of Dr. Michael Yaffe. Cell Culture and Transfections—Jurkat T lymphoblast cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). COS-1 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the same additives as for Jurkat cells. COS-1 and HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5 μg of expression plasmid and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE were generally used per 10-cm dish. For immunofluorescence labeling, HeLa cells were plated onto coverslips in 35-mm dishes and transfected using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE and 0.75 μg of each plasmid. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection by lysis in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitors for 5 min on ice followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants (=lysate) were used for immunoprecipitations, binding reactions, or Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence Staining and Image Analysis—Immunofluorescence staining and cell imaging were performed as described previously (12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar). The degree of cytoplasmic/cytoskeletal localization of EGFP-tagged GEF-H1 constructs was measured using quantitative image analysis as described by Ozer and Halpain (16Ozer R.S. Halpain S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3573-3587Google Scholar). Briefly standard deviation of fluorescence intensity was measured for all pixels within each cell expressing EGFP-tagged protein. Pixels within cells expressing microtubule-bound forms of GEF-H1 exhibited high variability in fluorescence intensity, while non-microtubule-bound constructs were more evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and exhibited lower variability in fluorescence intensity. The standard deviation value for each cell was divided by the average fluorescence intensity within the cell to eliminate differences due to the amount of protein expressed. Normalized fluorescence intensity variation values for each construct were averaged and compared using a t test. At least 40 cells were scored for each construct. Purification of PAK Substrates—5–20 μg of GST-PAK1-(233–544) attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1–5mgof total Jurkat cell lysate for 30 min–1 h in a volume up to 1.5 ml and subsequently washed four times with lysis buffer. The binding reaction was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 110-kDa PAK1 target protein was excised with a razor blade and washed three times with water and two times with 25 mm NH4HCO3. The gel pieces were gently crushed with a pestle, and 100 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 and 200–250 ng of trypsin per sample were added, and then the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the gel pieces were vortexed in 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile for 2 min and centrifuged briefly at full speed, and the supernatant was transferred into a new vial. The extraction procedure was repeated once. Acetonitrile was removed under bubbling nitrogen, and the cleaved peptides were dried under vacuum. Samples were resuspended in 10 μl of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and bound to ZipTips (Millipore, C18 resin material). The resin was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted in 2 μl of 50% acetonitrile. 1 μl of the eluted peptides was mixed with 1 μl of saturated 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1 μl of the peptide/2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid mixture was spotted onto a MALDI grid and co-crystallized by drying (dried droplet procedure). Bovine serum albumin as a control protein was purified and processed accordingly. A Dynamo MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer was used for peptide mass determination. For mass calibration we used control peptides (angiotensin I, 1296.685 Da; renin tetradecapeptide, 1759.853 Da; insulin, 5434.59 Da). The peptide masses determined were used to search a protein data base using the ProFound software (17Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Google Scholar). For in vitro phosphorylation by PAK, equivalent amounts of the binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 25 μm ATP and 10 μCi of radiolabeled ATP/reaction (specific activity, ∼10,000 dpm/pmol). [32P]GEF-H1 was quantified using a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphopeptide Mapping by Two-dimensional Chromatography— Phosphopeptide mapping was performed as described previously (18Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar) using recombinant GST-GEF-H1 (the full length or amino acids 571–985) phosphorylated with GST-PAK1-(233–544) in vitro or with full-length PAK1T423E,L107F in vivo. For the latter, HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with 0.4 mCi of [γ-32P]orthophosphoric acid for 6 h at 37 °C and washed twice, and GEF-H1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-EGFP antibody. The γ-32P-phosphorylated GEF-H1 was detected by autoradiography, excised from nitrocellulose, and digested with 1.5 μg of trypsin for 14 h at 37 °C. The digest (8000 cpm) was resolved in two dimensions on 100-μm × 20-cm × 20-cm thin layer cellulose plates (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) by electrophoresis followed by ascending chromatography. Electrophoresis was performed at pH 1.9 in 2.2% formic acid, 8% acetic acid for 40 min at 1300 V in a Multiphor II horizontal electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences) with water cooling, and ascending chromatography was carried out in 62.5% isobutyric acid, 1.9% n-butyl alcohol, 4.8% pyridine, and 2.9% glacial acetic acid. The plates were exposed to x-ray film overnight at –80 °C. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—GST-GEF-H1-(571–985) was phosphorylated as described above, the phosphorylated protein was localized by autoradiography, and the band was excised from the nitrocellulose. The sample was digested with 1.5 μg of trypsin and directly subjected to hydrolysis with 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1 h in a sealed tube (18Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar). The hydrolyzed sample was dried using a Speed-Vac (Savant) concentrator, resuspended in 10 μl of 2.2% formic acid, 8% acetic acid (pH 1.9), spotted onto a thin layer cellulose plate, and subjected to electrophoresis at 1500 V for 20 min. Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (1 mg/ml) were used as markers. The second electrophoretic separation was performed in 5% acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine (pH 3.5) at 1500 V for 20 min. The plate was then dried and sprayed with ninhydrin to visualize the phosphoamino acid standards. 32P-Labeled proteins on the dried plates were detected by autoradiography. In Vitro and in Vivo Measurements of GEF-H1 Activity—For in vitro measurement of nucleotide exchange activity of GEF-H1 toward Rho we utilized a method by Downward (19Downward J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 110-117Google Scholar) described for immunoprecipitated proteins with minor modifications as in Ref. 12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar. Immunoprecipitated exchange factor or purified binding reactions were equilibrated in exchange buffer and used to catalyze [35S]GTPγS binding to RhoA. In vivo activity of GEF-H1 was measured using an SRE-luciferase reporter gene assay as described previously (12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar). Briefly GEF-H1 constructs were transfected into COS-1 cells together with SRE-luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter plasmids. Expression of luciferase induced by activated Rho was measured using a luminometer and normalized by the amount of β-galactosidase expressed. Binding of 14-3-3 to GEF-H1—GST-GEF-H1-(571–985) was phosphorylated by recombinant GST-PAK1 in vitro for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP. Samples were washed, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with bovine brain lysate, and further washed to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. For co-immunoprecipitation of 14-3-3 with GEF-H1, COS-1 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged GEF-H1 and Myc-tagged PAK1, and GEF-H1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. 14-3-3 bound to GST-GEF-H1 or HA-GEF-H1 was detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-14-3-3 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Characterization of the Region of GEF-H1 Responsible for Microtubule-dependent Regulation of Its Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Activity—GEF-H1 contains a central tandem dbl and pleckstrin homology domain arrangement typical for Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Fig. 1A). In addition to the exchange factor domain, GEF-H1 contains an amino-terminal zinc finger and a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain. GEF-H1 localizes to microtubules, and this localization can be disrupted by removal or mutation of either amino- or carboxyl-terminal portions of the molecule, including the zinc finger domain. We have shown that the lack of microtubule localization of amino- or carboxyl-terminally modified GEF-H1 correlates with an increase in its activity toward Rho GTPase in vivo, indicating that microtubules negatively regulate GEF-H1 activity (12Krendel M. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 294-301Google Scholar). To further elucidate the mechanism of regulation of GEF-H1 activity, we attempted to restore microtubule localization of GEF-H1 mutants deficient in the ability to interact with microtubules and examine their activity in vivo. We have previously shown that a single amino acid substitution in the amino-terminal zinc finger domain of GEF-H1 (C53R) is sufficient to completely abolish microtubule localization. We produced an EGFP-tagged fusion protein consisting of the microtubule-binding region of MAP2c (from amino acid 231 to the end) and GEF-H1C53R (Fig. 1A). As expected, this fusion protein co-localized with microtubules (Fig. 1C). Comparison of the in vivo activity of GEF-H1C53R and MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R using the SRE-luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that while GEF-H1C53R was highly active, MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R exhibited virtually no activity (Fig. 1D). Thus, restoration of microtubule localization of GEF-H1C53R mutant was sufficient to fully inhibit its activity. This was not due to inhibitory effects resulting from addition of the MAP2c fragment itself since MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R protein exhibited normal guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward Rho in vitro (Fig. 1B). The observation that the activity of MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R toward Rho in vivo was slightly lower than that of GEF-H1 may reflect differences in microtubule binding sites between MAP2c and GEF-H1 and/or differences in the affinity of the two proteins for microtubules. We find it unlikely, however, that the exact reproduction of the inhibitory profile observed with untagged GEF-H1 by the MAP2c-tagged versions is a result of selective site interactions rather than microtubule localization per se. After confirming that the MAP2c fragment was capable of restoring microtubule localization and inhibition of the GEF-H1C53R mutant, we decided to utilize this microtubule-targeting strategy to identify regions of GEF-H1 that are important for microtubule-dependent regulation of its activity. To do so, we created fusion proteins containing a carboxyl-terminally truncated GEF-H1 construct (amino acids 1–572) fused to the MAP2c fragment at either the amino or carboxyl terminus. While these proteins appeared to localize on microtubules (Fig. 1C) and exhibited in vitro nucleotide exchange activity similar to that of full-length GEF-H1 (see Supplemental Fig. 1), they were more active in vivo than MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R (Fig. 1D). To determine whether the increased in vivo activity of carboxyl-terminally truncated MAP2c-GEF-H1 fusion proteins could be due to an increase in the amount of protein not bound to microtubules, we performed a quantitative analysis of intracellular distribution of various GEF-H1 constructs using a technique described by Ozer and Halpain (16Ozer R.S. Halpain S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3573-3587Google Scholar). This approach relies on the observation that proteins bound to cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules exhibit highly inhomogeneous distribution within a cell that is characterized by high variability in fluorescence intensity between pixels. To verify that this quantitative approach can be applied to GEF-H1, we compared the coefficient of fluorescence intensity variation for GEF-H1C53R and GEF-H1-(1–572) with those for microtubule-bound proteins GEF-H1 and MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R (see Table I). Coefficients of variation for GEF-H1-(1–572) and GEF-H1C53R, which do not co-localize with microtubules and are diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, were significantly lower than for the microtubule-interacting constructs (t test, p < 0.01). Most importantly, coefficients of variation for MAP2c-GEF-H1-(1–572), GEF-H1-(1–572)-MAP2c, and MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R were not significantly different from each other (t test, p > 0.05), suggesting that MAP2c-GEF-H1-(1–572) and GEF-H1-(1–572)-MAP2c constructs did not exhibit more pronounced cytoplasmic localization (Table I). Thus, while MAP2c-GEF-H1 fusion proteins lacking the carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues 573–985 were co-localized with microtubules, targeting these proteins to microtubules was no longer sufficient to fully inhibit their exchange activity.Table IQuantitative analysis of intracellular localization of GEF-H1 constructsConstructIntensity variation (mean ± S.D.)GEF-H10.26 ± 0.11GEF-H1-(1-572)0.16 ± 0.07GEF-H1C53R0.18 ± 0.06MAP2c-GEF-H1C53R0.23 ± 0.11MAP2c-GEF-H1-(1-572)0.23 ± 0.12GEF-H1-(1-572)-MAP2c0.27 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab Identification of GEF-H1 as a Substrate of PAK1—In an independent screen to isolate new substrates of p21-activated kinases, we produced a recombinant protein consisting of glutathione S-transferase fused to the PAK1 kinase domain (amino acids 233–544) and used this protein bait to affinity-purify binding proteins from total cell lysates. To differentiate between mere binding partners and substrate proteins, we also performed in vitro kinase assays with the bound proteins. Applying this affinity reagent to Jurkat cell lysates, we observed that a prominent band of ∼110 kDa (p110) was present in the purified fractions (Fig. 2A, lower panel, lanes 3 and 4). In binding reactions using GST alone (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) or a catalytically inactive version of PAK1 (PAK1D389A), p110 was not bound. Using the affinity-purified complex isolated from Jurkat lysates for an in vitro kinase assay, we observed that p110 was strongly phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was PAK1-dependent since the presence of the PAK-specific autoinhibitory domain (amino acids 83–149 of human PAK1) markedly reduced incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate (Fig. 2A, lane 3 versus lane 4). Interestingly the PAK-inhibitory peptide not only inhibited phosphorylation but also interaction with the GST-PAK1 fusion when added to the initial binding reactions (data not shown). The reduction in phosphorylation and binding were both dependent on an intact autoinhibitory domain since an inhibitory-deficient L107F mutant peptide (20Zenke F.T. King C.C. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32565-32573Google Scholar) was inactive. We determined a peptide mass fingerprint from a tryptic digest of gel-purified p110 using MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and searched a protein data base using the program ProFound (17Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Google Scholar). Nine of 17 peptide masses matched fragments from the human protein termed GEF-H1/KIAA-0651. We could confirm the identification in two more independent experiments using the peptide mass fingerprint approach (10 of 20 and 10 of 19 peptide masses matching, respectively). The predicted molecular weight of the GenBank™ entry for KIAA-0651 (GenBank™ accession number gi3327116) was 103 kDa, which is in good agreement with the apparent molecular weight of the affinity-purified protein estimated by SDS-gel electrophoresis. BLAST sequence comparison of the genomic locus of KIAA-0651/GEF-H1 (GenBank™ accession number gi11427616) with the corresponding cDNAs suggested that KIAA-0651 and GEF-H1 represent alternative splice isoforms. Sequence differences are only due to alternative use of a starting exon; all other exons in both isoforms are identical. Antibodies raised against GEF-H1 (11Ren Y. Li R. Zheng Y. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34954-34960Google Scholar) were used to confirm that p110 was indeed GEF-H1. The GEF-H1 antibodies recognized a 110-kDa band in Jurkat lysates and strongly reacted with the p110 protein in purified fractions. We additionally generated a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against amino acids 614–803 of GEF-H1 fused to glutathione S-transferase, affinity-purified the antiserum, and showed that p110 cross-reacted with our GEF-H1-specific antiserum as well. Epitope-tagged GEF-H1 and KIAA-0651 from COS-1 cell lysates also specifically interacted with GST-PAK1-(233–544), and the ectopically expressed GEF-H1 or KIAA-0651 were also phosphorylated to similar extents in in vitro kinase assays with either GST-PAK1-(233–544) or with Cdc42-activated full-length PAK1 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data confirmed that the isolated protein from Jurkat cell lysates is indeed GEF-H1/KIAA-0651. However, we did not further determine which isoform was purified from the Jurkat cells. Identification of the PAK1 Phosphorylation Sites on GEF-H1—Full-length GEF-H1 was co-expressed with full-length PAK1T423E,L107F constitutively active mutant in 32PO4 metabolically labeled HeLa cells, and the immunoprecipitated GEF-H1 was analyzed by two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping. As seen in Fig. 3A, GEF-H1 exhibited multiple spots in the two-dimensional separation, indicating that PAK1 induced phosphorylation of GEF-H1 on multiple sites in vivo. To identify sites of phosphorylation, we attempted an in vitro analysis of GEF-H1 phosphorylation by PAK1. Various regions of GEF-H1 were generated as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and used as substrates in in vitro kinase assays as described (Fig. 3B). Constitutively active GST-PAK1 only phosphorylated the fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 572–985 of GEF-H1. Further fine mapping of the carboxyl-terminal 572–985 region showed that carboxyl-terminal deletions down to amino acid 912 were tolerated, but further deletion abolished phosphate incorporation. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that only serine was phosphorylated by GST-PAK1 (not shown). In addition, only one radiolabeled spot with low electrophoretic, but high chromatographic, mobility appeared in a tryptic phosphopeptide map of this fragment (not shown). These results, when combined with sequence analysis, suggested Ser885 (per GEF-H1 numbering) as a candidate phosphorylation site. In confirmation of this, mutation of Ser885 to alanine totally abolished phosphate incorporation into GST-GEF-H1-(572–985) (Fig. 3C) and resulted in the loss of the single phosphopeptide spot observed on two-dimensional maps of GEF-H1 (572–985) (not shown). While Ser885 was present in GEF-H1 fragment containing amino acids 572–894, this fragment was not phosphorylated by PAK (Fig. 3B), possibly due to the removal of amino acids involved in substrate recognition or disruption of the secondary structure since this fragment terminates near the phosphorylation site. We verified that Ser885 was an actual PAK1 phosphorylation site in intact GEF-H1 in vivo by phosphopeptide analysis of GEF-H1S885A in metabolically labeled cells (Fig. 3A). We observed that the loss of serine at position 885 resulted in the clear loss of one of the phosphopeptide spots present in the wild-type GEF-H1. We have not identified the other phosphorylation sites observed in vivo at this time. To determine whether phosphorylation of GEF-H1 at Ser885 by PAK1 had any effect on GEF-H1 localization or activity, we analyzed the GEF-H1S885A mutant. GEF-H1S885A localized normally to microtubules when expressed in HeLa cells, and its in vivo GEF activity measured using the SRE-luciferase assay was similar to that of wild-type GEF-H1. Conversely expression of active versions of PAK1 also did not change the binding of wild-type GEF-H1 to microtubules (data not shown). Similarly the Rho GEF activity of GEF-H1 in in vitro exchange assays was not altered when the protein was co-expressed with constitutively active PAK1T423E. Expression of active PAK1 alone had an inhibitory effect on SRE-luciferase expression, therefore we were unable to use the SRE-luciferase assay to measure in vivo activity o"

In this report, we describe the capacity of myocardin to physically associate with megakaryoblastic leukemia factor-1 (MKL1) and characterize the function of MKL1 in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). The MKL1 gene is expressed in most human tissues and myocardin and MKL are co-expressed in SMCs. MKL1 and myocardin physically associate via conserved leucine zipper domains. Overexpression of MKL1 transactivates serum response factor (SRF)-dependent SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements including the SM22α promoter, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter/enhancer, and SM-α-actin promoter/enhancer in non-SMCs. Moreover, forced expression of MKL1 and SRF in undifferentiated SRF-/- embryonic stem cells activates multiple endogenous SMC-restricted genes at levels equivalent to, or exceeding, myocardin. Forced expression of a dominant-negative MKL1 mutant reduces myocardin-induced activation of the SMC-specific SM22α promoter. In NIH3T3 fibroblasts MKL1 localizes to the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus in response to serum stimulation, actin treadmilling, and RhoA signaling. In contrast, in SMCs MKL1 is observed exclusively in the nucleus regardless of serum conditions or RhoA signaling. However, when actin polymerization is disrupted MKL1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in SMCs. Together, these data were consistent with a model wherein MKL1 transduces signals from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus in SMCs and regulates SRF-dependent SMC differentiation autonomously or in concert with myocardin.

In contrast to striated muscle cells, SMCs retain the capacity to both proliferate and modulate their phenotype from contractile to synthetic during postnatal development. The plasticity and proliferative capacity of this muscle cell lineage plays a central role in physiological processes including wound healing and angiogenesis. However, modulation of SMC phenotype has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of disease processes including atherosclerosis, restenosis following coronary angioplasty/stent implantation, and asthma. Our group and others have reported that SMC differentiation and modulation of the SMC phenotype is regulated by a serum response factor (SRF)-dependent transcriptional regulatory program (for review see Refs. 1Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 51: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar)). SRF is a MADS box transcription factor that binds to a transcriptional regulatory element designated the CArG box or SRE. The functional properties of SRF and SRF binding sites were initially characterized in promoters regulating growth responsive genes including c-fos and egr-1 (3Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 4Treisman R. Nature. 1995; 376: 468-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 5Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). SRF-mediated activity of growth responsive genes is regulated via post-translational modifications of SRF and ternary complex factors (TCFs) in the ets family that physically associate with both SRF and specific DNA sequences (6Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). SRF activity is also modulated by intracellular signals including serum, RhoA, and actin treadmilling (7Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R.

Functionally important CArG boxes have been identified in all SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements (1Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top. Dev.

Mutation of these CArG boxes abolishes activity of these transcriptional elements. A multimerized copy of the SME-4 CArG box embedded in the SMC-restricted SM22α promoter is sufficient to restrict expression of a reporter gene to arterial SMCs in transgenic mice (11Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; : 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Until recently it was not clear how a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor such as SRF could regulate transcription of both growth responsive genes and muscle-restricted differentiation markers. Recent studies revealed that SRF regulates SMC differentiation via direct binding to the recently discovered cardiac- and SMC-restricted SAP (SAF-A/B, Acinus, PIAS) domain transcription factor myocardin (12Chen J.

Myocardin is a member of an ancient, and diverse, family of SAP domain-containing proteins that have been implicated in high order chromatin organization, apoptotic nuclear condensation and, most recently, RhoA-actin signal transduction (17Miralles F.

Forced expression of myocardin activates SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements in non-SMC cells including the SM22α promoter, the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) promoter/intragenic enhancer, and the SM-α-actin promoter/intragenic enhancer (12Chen J.

Moreover, forced expression of myocardin and SRF in SRF-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells activates endogenous SMC genes including SM22α, SM-MHC, calponin-h1, and SM-α-actin (13Du K.L. Ip H.S.

Mice harboring a mutation in the myocardin gene die at embryonic day (E)10.5 of gestation and differentiated vascular SMCs are not observed (14Li S. Wang D.Z. Wang Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9366-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Several important questions related to the role of SRF and myocardin in SMC differentiation remain unanswered. First, is there an alternative factor or pathway that regulates SMC differentiation in the absence of myocardin expression? Of note, in the mouse embryo at E9.5 myocardin is not expressed in the dorsal aorta (at the level of sensitivity afforded by in situ hybridization analyses), but vascular SMCs surrounding the aorta express differentiated markers including SM-α-actin and SM22α (13Du K.L.

Second, how do intracellular signals that regulate SMC differentiation, including actin treadmilling and RhoA, modulate activity of SRF and/or myocardin in SMCs? Finally, what role if any do the recently identified myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), MKL1/MAL/BSAC/MRTF-A (henceforth designated MKL1) (19Wang D.Z. Li S. Hockemeyer D. Sutherland L.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate activity of myocardin and SRF in SMCs, we performed a two-hybrid screen in yeast using the conserved N terminus of myocardin as bait. Surprisingly, three clones isolated in this screen encoded MKL1. MKL1 was first identified in the chromosomal translocation t (1Parmacek M.S. Curr. Top. Dev.

Recently, MKL1 has been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of SRF in fibroblasts, via nuclear translocation in response to serum, RhoA, and actin treadmilling (17Miralles F. Posern G. Zaromytidou A.I. Treisman R. Cell. 2003; 113: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 25Cen B. Selvaraj A. Burgess R.C. Hitzler J.K. Ma Z. Morris S.W. Prywes R.

In the studies described in this report, we show that myocardin and MKL1 physically associate via conserved leucine zipper domains. In addition, we demonstrate that MKL1 is expressed in SMCs and examine the signaling pathways regulating nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of MKL1 in SMCs. Finally, we demonstrated that, like myocardin, MKL1 activates transcriptional regulatory elements controlling SMC-restricted genes and activates endogenous SMC genes in undifferentiated ES cells via SRF-dependent mechanisms. Plasmids—The pcDNA3-MKL1 expression plasmid encoding human MKL1 was generated by subcloning the coding region of the human MKL1 cDNA into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3.1-myocardin and pcDNA3-SRF expression plasmids encoding human myocardin and SRF have been described previously (13Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2425-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The pcR3.1-HA-MKL1 and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MKL1 expression plasmids encoding HA and FLAG epitope-tagged human MKL1, respectively, were generated by subcloning the human MKL1 cDNA into pcR3.1 (Invitrogen) and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), respectively. pcR3.1-myc-myocardin and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-myocardin encoding myc and FLAG epitope-tagged myocardin, respectively, were generated by subcloning the human myocardin cDNA into pcR3.1 (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), respectively. The pcDNA-MyoCΔ585 and pcDNA-MyoCΔ381 expression plasmids encoding the N-terminal 585 and 381 amino acids of human myocardin were generated by subcloning each respective myocardin cDNA subfragment into pcDNA3. pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MyoΔLZ expression plasmid is identical to the pcDNA3.1-FLAG myocardin plasmid except the cDNA sequence encoding the myocardin leucine zipper (LZ) domain (amino acids 519–549) was deleted. The p-441.luc reporter plasmid contains the 441-bp mouse SM22α promoter (bp -441 to +41) subcloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega) as described (11Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; : 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The p-441μCArG. luc reporter is identical to the -441.luc reporter plasmid except that the underlined nucleotides in SME-1 (5′-TCCTGCCCATAGATCTTTTTTCC-3′) and SME-4 (5′-GCTCCAACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCGGATATGGAGCCT-3′) were mutated to abolish SRF binding (11Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell.

The pPI-Act.luc and pPI-MHC.luc luciferase reporter plasmids containing the SM-α-actin and SM-MHC promoter and intragenic enhancers, respectively, subcloned into pGL3-Basic, were the generous gift of Dr. Gary Owens (University of Virginia) and have been described previously (13Du K.L.

The pRK5-myc-RhoA N19 expression plasmid encodes a dominant-negative RhoA mutant and was a generous gift from Professor Alan Hall (University College London). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—pGBKT7-MyoCΔ585 was transformed into yeast strain AH109 to generate the bait strain. >5 × 109 of the bait strain cells were mated with >1.6 × 108 colony forming units of the pre-transformed Human Heart MATCHMAKER library (Clontech) and plated onto SD-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/+X-α-Gal agar plates. Positive clones were identified by growth on SD-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/+X-α-Gal agar plates. 5.1 × 105 transformants were screened based on colony size and intensity of X-Gal staining, and plasmid was recovered from the colonies and sequenced as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech). Three clones corresponding to the full-length open reading frame of MKL1 were isolated and characterized further. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—In vitro transcription reactions and translations were performed using pcDNA-MyoCΔ585, pcDNA-MyoCΔ381, pcDNA3.1-MyoΔLZ, and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MKL1, respectively, as templates and the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). Myocardin and each deletion mutant were labeled with biotinylated-lysyl-tRNA (Transcend tRNA, Promega). Unlabeled FLAG-MKL1, biotinylated myocardin, and 40 μl of EZview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) were incubated at 4 °C for 12–16 h. Protein bound to the anti-FLAG M2 antibody was isolated and the immunoprecipitated protein was electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and visualized with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and a chemiluminescent substrate (Promega). Northern Blot Analyses—Northern blot analyses were performed using the Human 12-lane MTN, Human Muscle MTN, and Human Cardiovascular MTN blots prepared by Clontech as described previously (28Parmacek M.S.

Quantification of the reaction product was performed using the MJ Research DNA Engine Opticon 2 real time detection system. PCR cycle conditions were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. All RT and PCR were performed in triplicate with and without RT as controls. Cycle threshold (C(t)) values were converted to relative gene expression levels using the 2-ΔΔC(t) method (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using the protocol described by Owens and colleagues (31Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SRF-/- ES cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Myo, pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MyoΔLZ, pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Myo plus pcDNA3-SRF, or pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MyoΔLZ plus pcDNA3-SRF, respectively. 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, lysed in 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, with mammalian proteinase inhibitors (Sigma) and sonicated. Each cell lysate was diluted 10-fold, incubated overnight with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), and 90 μg of Protein A-agarose was added to each sample. Immunoprecipitated, reverse cross-linked DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and in turn was subject to PCR analysis with primers flanking the SME-4 CArG box containing the nuclear protein binding site in the mouse SM22α promoter (5′-GGTCCTGCCCATAAAAGGTTT-3′ and 5′-TGCCCATGGAAGTCTGCTTGG-3′) designed to generate a 200-bp amplified DNA fragment. Immunohistochemistry—The intracellular location of myocardin and MKL1 was determined by transiently co-transfecting primary rat aortic SMCs, A7r5 SMCs, and NIH3T3 cells with 1 μg of pcR3.1-HA-MKL, pcR3.1-myc-myocardin, or the control pcDNA3 expression vector with FuGENE 6 (Roche). 24 h post-transfection cells were serum-starved for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, the cells were either maintained in 0.1% fetal bovine serum or serum-stimulated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum for 1 h. To determine the effect of actin polymerization on the intracellular localization of MKL1, cells were treated for 1 h with 0.5 × 10-6m latrunculin B (Alexis), which inhibits polymerization of actin filaments (32Zhang J.C. Helmke B.P. Shum A. Du K. Yu W.W. Lu M.M. Davies P.F. Parmacek M.S. Mech. Dev. 2002; 115: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To promote actin polymerization, cells were treated for 1 h with 0.5 × 10-6m jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes) (32Zhang J.C. Helmke B.P. Shum A. Du K. Yu W.W. Lu M.M. Davies P.F. Parmacek M.S. Mech.

To determine the effect of RhoA signaling on the intracellular localization of MKL1, cells were transfected with the pRK5-myc-RhoA N19 expression plasmid encoding a dominant-negative RhoA mutant protein. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and visualized on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope as described previously (32Zhang J.C. Helmke B.P. Shum A.

MKL1 Physically Associates with Myocardin—To examine the molecular mechanisms regulating myocardin activity, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA yeast expression library was performed using a yeast indicator strain expressing the N terminus (amino acids 1–585) of the human myocardin protein as bait. The N terminus of myocardin was utilized because this region of the protein includes the evolutionarily conserved and functionally important RPEL, glutamine-rich, basic and SAP domains that have been implicated in regulating activity of myocardin (Fig. 1A and Ref. 18Wang D.

Positive clones were identified by growth on SD-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp/+X-α-Gal agar plates. Three of the 58 isolates contained an ∼4-kb cDNA insert that corresponded to the full-length coding region (open reading frame) of human MKL1/MAL/MRTF-A protein (19Wang D.Z. Li S. Hockemeyer D.

The coding regions of these three clones were identical with differences observed only in the extent of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. A BLAST search of GenBank™ revealed that the human MKL1 gene contains 15 exons spanning 226 kb of sequence on chromosome 1. The 3,907-bp human MKL1 cDNA encodes a 98.9-kDa protein. Sequence analysis revealed that the deduced human MKL1 protein shares 33% homology with myocardin over the entire coding sequence and 70% homology with myocardin across its N-terminal region containing the RPEL, basic, glutamine-rich, SAP, and leucine zipper domains (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2095743880,"We describe herein the enzyme behavior of MmNEU3, the plasma membrane-associated sialidase from mouse (Mus musculus). MmNEU3 is localized at the plasma membrane as demonstrated directly by confocal microscopy analysis. In addition, administration of the radiolabeled ganglioside GD1a to MmNEU3-transfected cells, under conditions that prevent lysosomal activity, led to its hydrolysis into ganglioside GM1, further indicating the plasma membrane topology of MmNEU3. Metabolic labeling with [1-3H]sphingosine allowed the characterization of the ganglioside patterns of COS-7 cells. MmNEU3 expression in COS-7 cells led to an extensive modification of the cell ganglioside pattern, i.e. GM3 and GD1a content was decreased to about one-third compared with mock-transfected cells. At the same time, a 35% increase in ganglioside GM1 content was observed. Mixed culture of MmNEU3-transfected cells with [1-3H]sphingosine-labeled cells demonstrates that the enzyme present at the cell surface is able to recognize gangliosides exposed on the membrane of nearby cells. Under these experimental conditions, the extent of ganglioside pattern changes was a function of MmNEU3 transient expression. Overall, the variations in GM3, GD1a, and GM1 content were very similar to those observed in the case of [1-3H]sphingosine-labeled MmNEU3-transfected cells, indicating that the enzyme mainly exerted its activity toward ganglioside substrates present at the surface of neighboring cells. These results indicate that the plasma membrane-associated sialidase MmNEU3 is able to hydrolyze ganglioside substrates in intact living cells at a neutral pH, mainly through cell-to-cell interactions.

Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSL, glycosphingolipid; 4-MU-NeuAc, 4-methylumbelliferyl α-N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HPTLC, high performance silica gel-precoated thin-layer chromatography; SED, sphingolipid-enriched domain; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; ESI, electrospray ionization. expressed at the cell surface are well known as modulators of several aspects of signal transduction processes involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation (1Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSLs in the plasma membrane are able to interact laterally with other membrane molecules modulating their properties (cis-interactions). Lipid rafts or membrane microdomains result from dynamic clustering of sphingolipids and cholesterol to form the so-called sphingolipid-enriched domain (SED) or lipid rafts (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). These structures move within the fluid bilayer and function as platforms for the attachment of proteins when membranes are moved around the cell and during signal transduction (3Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5164) Google Scholar, 4Hakomori S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99 (S. I.): 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression pattern of GSLs in several cells and tissues undergoes deep changes during development and neoplastic transformation (5Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). These events are usually characterized by dramatic changes in cell recognition, suggesting that GSLs as cell surface antigens could play relevant roles as receptor sites in cell-cell recognition (trans-interaction). The receptor role of GSLs has been hypothesized in the case of microbial infections based on their ability to interact with bacterial toxins and microbial lectins (6Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 7Fantini J. Maresca M. Hammache D. Yahi N. Delezay O. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Conformational analysis confirms that the orientation of the oligosaccharide chains of glycolipids at the cell surface complies with the possibility to interact with extracellular molecules (8Nyholm P.G. Pascher I. Sundell S. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1990; 52: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Nyholm P.G. Pascher I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed, synthetic analogues of GSL oligosaccharides are able to block cell-cell recognition (10Fenderson B.A. Zehavi U. Hakomori S. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian cells, trans-GSL-GSL interactions are important in determining the motility and metastatic potential of tumor cells (11Hakomori S. Handa K. Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: xi-xixCrossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For example, in B16 melanoma cells, characterized by high levels of GM3, 2The ganglioside nomenclature proposed by Svennerholm was followed (see Ref. 61Svennerholm L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 125: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). the adhesion to endothelial cells is a GM3-dependent phenomenon. GM3 is closely associated with c-Src, Rho, and Ras within SED, and interactions with globoside Gg3 or the use of anti-GM3 antibody stimulate focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and c-Src activity. In these conditions, not only adhesion but also spreading and enhancement of cell motility occur (12Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similar results have been obtained in the case of globoside-dependent adhesion in human embryonal carcinoma 2102 cells (13Song Y. Withers D.A. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several different classes of cell surface proteins potentially can interact with specific carbohydrate sequences of GSLs, including animal lectins and receptors with lectin sequence homologies such as selectin family receptors and human lymphocyte IgE receptor (1Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18713-18716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that in the nervous system gangliosides represent functional ligands for the myelin-associated glycoprotein, a sialic acid binding lectin involved in myelin-axon interactions (14Vyas A.A. Schnaar R.L. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Other cell surface proteins that are natural candidates for the interaction with GSL oligosaccharides are glycosyltransferases and glycohydrolases. In the past, little attention was paid to these proteins concerning this aspect, because their main localization was believed to be restricted inside the cell. Today, increasing evidence of the presence of such proteins at the level of the plasma membrane suggests their possible role as a cell recognition site for GSLs. Sialidases or neuraminidases (EC 3.2.1.18) are hydrolytic enzymes that remove sialic acid residues from gangliosides and other natural substrates. Among these proteins, plasma membrane-associated sialidase has been described in different tissues (15Ohman R. Rosenberg A. Svennerholm L. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 3774-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Miyagi T. Sagawa J. Konno K. Handa S. Tsuiki S. J. Biochem.

Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2205-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and cell types (18Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Pitto M. Giglioni A. Tettamanti G. Neurochem.

Commun. 1994; 199: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and a form linked to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor has also been identified (21Chiarini A. Fiorilli A. Siniscalco C. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1576-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 22Chiarini A. Fiorilli A. Di Francesco L. Venerando B. Tettamanti G. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidence of a possible involvement of this enzyme in the regulation of the sialic acid levels of the cell surface has been produced. For example, in neuroblastoma cells the enzyme triggers selective ganglioside desialylation, and such surface glycolipid modulations are involved in cell growth control and differentiation (23Kopitz J. von Reitzenstein C. Sinz K. Cantz M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Kopitz J. Sinz K. Brossmer R. Cantz M. Eur. J.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane sialidase NEU3 3NEU is the official human gene symbol approved by HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee. To avoid misinterpretation, the NEU symbol indicates the gene product (that is, sialidase), NEU3 is the symbol for plasma membrane-associated sialidase, and the two-letter code preceding NEU3 indicates the species of origin (e.g. Mm indicates Mus musculus). The NEU3 mRNA sequence is available in the GenBank™ data base under accession number NM_016720. is characterized by high substrate specificity for ganglioside substrates in the acidic range of pH (26Monti E. Preti A. Venerando B. Borsani G. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, MmNEU3 has been demonstrated to be associated with SED in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC (27Kalka D. von Reitzenstein C. Kopitz J. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as in HeLa and COS-1 cells, where it is closely associated with caveolin (28Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Hata K. Zhao X. Fujimoto T. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26252-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Herein we report the first direct evidence that: (i) MmNEU3 has enzyme activity toward gangliosides in intact living cells; and (ii) the enzyme activity of MmNEU3 is able to modulate the expression of gangliosides at the surface of adjacent cells. Materials—Commercial chemicals were the purest available, common solvents were distilled before use, and deionized water obtained by a MilliQ system (Millipore) was distilled in a glass apparatus. High performance silica gel-precoated thin-layer plates (HPTLC Kieselgel 60, 20 × 10 cm) were purchased from Merck GmbH. Sphingosine was prepared from cerebroside (29Carter H.E. Rothfus J.A. Gigg R.H. J. Lipid Res. 1961; 228–34Google Scholar). [1-3H]Sphingosine (radiochemical purity >98%, specific radioactivity 2.08 Ci/mmol) was prepared by specific chemical oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group of sphingosine followed by reduction with sodium boro[3H]hydride (30Toyokuni T. Nisar M. Dean B. Hakomori S. J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 1991; 29: 567-574Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ganglioside GD1a was purified from the total ganglioside mixture extracted from bovine brains (31Tettamanti G. Bonali F. Marchesini S. Zambotti V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 296: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Radioactive GD1a containing erythro-C18-sphingosine, isotopically tritium-labeled at position 3, [3-3H(Sph18)]GD1a, was prepared by the dichloro-dicyano-benzoquinone/sodium boro[3H]hydride method followed by reversed phase HPLC purification (homogeneity >99%, specific radioactivity of 1.2 Ci/mmol) (32Sonnino S. Nicolini M. Chigorno V. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Sonnino S. Ghidoni R. Gazzotti G. Kirschner G. Galli G. Tettamanti G. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 620-629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive sphingolipids were extracted from cells fed with [1-3H]sphingosine, purified, characterized as described previously (34Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11658-11665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and used as chromatographic standards. Standard molecular biology techniques were carried out as described by Sambrook and Russell (35Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Tissue Culture and Expression of MmNEU3 in COS-7—COS-7 cells were grown in Petri dishes (100 mm diameter) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma). A sialidase expression plasmid coding for MmNEU3 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the C terminus was constructed as follows. The entire open reading frame of the enzyme was amplified with the HA epitope at the C terminus by PCR using MmNEU3 cDNA in pBluescript (Stratagene) as template and subcloned into pcDNA1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), giving rise to the construct pcDNA1-MmNEU3 (36Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27514778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Transfections were performed overnight with pcDNA1-MmNEU3 construct or with pcDNA1 vector and LipofectAMINE reagent in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines (Invitrogen) using 4–5 × 105 cells/dish. Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection by scraping, washed in PBS, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml apoprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Total cell extracts were prepared by sonication. Lipid extraction and analysis of sphingolipid component were performed on total cell extracts. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min corresponded to the crude cell extract and was subsequently centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min on an Optima TL 100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Aliquots of the crude cell extract, 200,000 × g supernatant and pellet, were used for assays for protein (Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent; Pierce) and sialidase activity, as well as for Western blot analysis. Cell vitality was determined by the trypan blue procedure. Treatment of Cell Cultures with [1-3H]Sphingosine—[1-3H]Sphingosine dissolved in methanol was transferred into a sterile glass tube and dried under a nitrogen stream. The residue was then dissolved in an appropriate volume of pre-warmed (37 °C) 10% fetal bovine serum DMEM medium to obtain a final concentration of 3 × 10–8m (corresponding to 0.4 μCi/100-mm dish). Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated for a 2-h pulse followed by a 40-h chase. In the case of co-culture experiments, 2 × 105 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with pcDNA1-MmNEU3 or pcDNA1 vector alone, and 3 × 105 COS-7 were separately subjected to a 2-h pulse with [1-3H]sphingosine. After labeling, cells were detached from dishes using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, resuspended in 10% fetal bovine serum DMEM, and finally added to plates containing just transfected COS-7 cells. Cells were then co-cultured for 48 h, resulting in 48 h of post-transfection time and 60 h of chase. A time course analysis of metabolically labeled [1-3H]sphingolipids was performed after adding freshly [1-3H]sphingosine-labeled COS-7 cells to MmNEU3-HA and mock-transfected cells after 48 h of post-transfection time. Cells were co-cultured for up to 30 h, corresponding to 78 h post-transfection time and 72 h of chase. Cells were harvested by scraping, washed in PBS, snap-frozen, lyophilized, and subjected to lipid extraction and sphingolipid analyses, together with the dialyzed medium collected from the cell cultures. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Analysis of MmNEU3— COS-7 cells were plated onto glass coverslips and grown for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected as previously described. After 16 h of incubation in DMEM in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 40 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and quenched for 10 min with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. For permeabilization, cells were incubated for 15 min in the presence of 0.5% saponin (w/v) in PBS. Cells were then incubated with anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (15 μg/ml) (Roche Applied Science) in 0.5% saponin in PBS for 1 h and, after extensive washes with the same buffer, incubated with donkey anti-mouse Cy2 (1:400) in the same buffer. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using an MRC-1024 confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Image processing was performed with Adobe Photoshop software. Treatment of Cell Cultures with [3-3H(Sph18)]GD1a—[3-3H(Sph18)]-GD1a dissolved in propanol/water, 4:1 (v/v), was transferred into a sterile glass tube and dried under a nitrogen stream. The residue was then dissolved in an appropriate volume of pre-warmed (37 °C) DMEM to obtain [3-3H(Sph18)]GD1a at a final molar concentration of 3 × 10–7m (corresponding to 2 nmol of GD1a/100-mm dish). Transfected COS-7 cells were incubated for up to 24 h in the presence of 10 mm NH4Cl. Cells were harvested by scraping and washed in PBS, and total lipids were extracted from the cells and media (data not shown) and analyzed. Lipid Extraction and Analyses—Total lipids from lyophilized cells and lyophilized cell media were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) and with chloroform/methanol/water 20:10:1 (v/v), respectively (37Prinetti A. Chigorno V. Prioni S. Loberto N. Marano N. Tettamanti G. Sonnino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21136-21145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The resulting lipid extracts were dried under a nitrogen stream and dissolved in chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v). In some experiments the lipid extracts were treated with 0.5 m NaOH in methanol to remove glycerophospholipids by selective hydrolysis (38Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts were analyzed by HPTLC carried out with the solvent system chloroform-methanol-0.2% aqueous CaCl2 50:42:11 (v/v). The total lipid extracts were subjected to a two-phase partitioning in chloroform-methanol-water, 2:1 (v/v), and 20% water (38Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); the aqueous and organic phases obtained were counted for radioactivity and analyzed by HPTLC. [3H]Sphingolipids of aqueous and organic phases, respectively, were separated by HPTLC using the solvent systems chloroform-methanol-0.2% aqueous CaCl2, 60:40:9 (v/v), and chloroform-methanol-water, 55:20:3 (v/v), respectively. [3H]Sphingolipids were identified by referring to radiolabeled standards and quantified by radiochromatoimaging (Beta-Imager 2000, Biospace, Paris, France). The structural characterization of the ganglioside mixture from COS-7 cells was determined by reversed phase HPLC-ESI mass spectrometry. ESI mass spectrometry of the ganglioside species was carried out in negative mode on a ThermoQuest Finnigan LCQdeca mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (39Zhu J. Li Y.T. Li S.C. Cole R.B. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Sialidase Assay—The enzymatic activity of MmNEU3 in total cell lysates and in cellular subfractions was determined as described previously using ganglioside [3-3H(Sph18)]GD1a and 4-MU-NeuAc as substrates (40Tringali C. Papini N. Fusi P. Croci G. Borsani G. Preti A. Tortora P. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Monti E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3169-3179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate with 25 μg of total protein in a final volume of 100 μl and in the presence of 12.5 mm sodium-citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 3.8. One unit of sialidase activity is defined as liberation of 1 μmol of Neu5Ac/min at 37 °C. Statistical Analyses—Values are presented as means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were made using unpaired Student's t test. Significance was attributed at the 95% level of confidence (p < 0.05). MmNEU3 Activity and Structure of Gangliosides in COS-7 Cells—Sialidase activity assay performed at pH 3.8 on GD1a ganglioside, without detergent in the reaction mixture, conclusively allows determination of the plasma membrane-associated sialidase activity with very minor or no contamination by lysosomal enzyme(s) activity (41Saito M.Y. K R. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York1995: 261-313Crossref Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, MmNEU3 activity on GD1a ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 milliunits/mg cell protein. The ganglioside mixture from COS-7 cells was analyzed by HPLC-ESI mass spectrometry, and the percentage of each species was determined by densitometry and radioimaging (see below) after HPTLC separation. GD1a, GM1, GM2, and GM3 were the main gangliosides and represented 41.8, 31.5, 15.8, and 10.9% of the total main ganglioside mixture, respectively. Each ganglioside species contained C18 sphingosine and by HPTLC analysis was split in two spots. The molecular species containing palmitic acid showed a lower mobility, whereas molecular species containing C24:0 and C24:1 fatty acids showed a slightly higher mobility in our solvent system. Transient Overexpression of Membrane-bound MmNEU3 in COS-7 Cells—In this study a tagged form of MmNEU3 was used (36Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27514778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Rodriguez J.A. Piddini E. Hasegawa T. Miyagi T. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8387-8395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant vector pcDNA1-MmNEU3 allowed the expression in mammalian cells of MmNEU3 as a chimera protein characterized by the HA epitope linked at the C terminus of the original open reading frame. This protein can be detected easily using antibodies against the HA epitope, and in addition, MmNEU3 retains its original enzyme activity. Upon transfection MmNEU3 activity increased in a time-dependent manner up to 48 h and remained quite stable until 60 h after transfection. Starting from this time point, the enzyme specific activity gradually decreased and disappeared almost completely at about 72 h post-transfection time (data not shown). Sixty hours after transfection, COS-7 cells showed an 11- and 35-fold increase in sialidase activity ex vivo toward 4-MUNeu5Ac and ganglioside GD1a, respectively, as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). The pH curve showed an optimal value in the acidic range corresponding to 3.8, the same value observed in the case of the endogenous plasma membrane-associate sialidase (Fig. 1B). More than 96% of the expressed sialidase activity in the crude homogenates was recovered in the rough particulate fraction obtained by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 1C). The membrane association of MmNEU3 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Fig. 1D shows the staining of a protein band with the expected molecular mass of 48 kDa in the transfected cells, the protein being associated to the 200,000 × g cell pellet. Additional protein bands of 80 and 44 kDa were detected by the monoclonal antibody. The presence of the same bands in the cell fractions obtained from mock-transfected cells indicated that they were unrelated to MmNEU3. To confirm the association with the plasma membrane, COS-7 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmid pcDNA1-MmNEU3 were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2 shows a cell surface staining in distinct confocal planes of the same cell expressing the enzyme, with negligible labeling in the intracellular membranous structures. Based on the ratios between MmNEU3-expressing cells and their total number, determined by fluorescence microscopy, the average yield of transfection corresponded to about 20–30%. Direct administration into the culture media of [3-3H(Sph18)]GD1a to mock- and pcDNA1-MmNEU3-transfected COS-7 cells led to its incorporation into the cell membranes. Under these conditions, because of the slow ganglioside turnover, only a minor portion of the radioactive GD1a reaches the lysosomes and is catabolized (43Chigorno V. Riva C. Valsecchi M. Nicolini M. Brocca P. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells expressing MmNEU3 showed the conversion of GD1a to the corresponding GM1 in the presence of NH4Cl, a condition in which the activity of the lysosomal compartment is strongly reduced (Fig. 3) (44Kopitz J. Muhl C. Ehemann V. Lehmann C. Cantz M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these results confirm the plasma membrane topology of MmNEU3. MmNEU3 Activity in Living Cells—Administration of [1-3H]sphingosine to cultured cells at 3 × 10–8m final concentration led to an extensive labeling of the sphingolipids, namely gangliosides, neutral glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and ceramide (43Chigorno V. Riva C. Valsecchi M. Nicolini M. Brocca P. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, a portion of the [1-3H]sphingosine was catabolized by the cells to radioactive ethanolamine and then recycled for the biosynthesis of radioactive phosphatidylethanolamine. After a 2-h pulse with [1-3H]sphingosine followed by a 24-h chase, free sphingosine was scarcely detectable within the radioactive lipid mixtures, and stable radioactive lipid patterns overlapping the endogenous one were observed in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 1). Instead, the sphingolipid pattern from MmNEU3-expressing cells showed a marked variation (Fig. 4A, lane 2). In fact, 60 h after transfection, a 34 and 35% decrease of ganglioside GD1a and GM3 relative contents, respectively, and a 36% increase of ganglioside GM1 content were detectable (Fig. 4C). No statistically significant differences were observed between the radioactive lipid patterns of organic phases from normal and transfected cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). To investigate the possible activity of MmNeu3 toward ganglioside substrates exposed on the cell surface of adjacent cells, a co-culture experiment was engineered by co-culturing MmNEU3-expressing COS-7 cells with previously [1-3H]sphingosine-labeled untransfected cells. As we envisioned, the modification of the ganglioside relative abundance followed the variations of MmNEU3 specific activity induced by transient expression of the enzyme. In fact, the ganglioside content modification reached a maximum at 60 h after transfection and than slowly returned to the endogenous value (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows the radioactive ganglioside distribution from co-culture experiments at 60 h after transfection. The ganglioside pattern is very similar to that observed in [1-3H]sphingosine-labeled MmNEU3-transfected cells. Overall, these results indicate that the plasma membrane sialidase activity is exerted mainly toward gangliosides inserted in the membrane of neighboring cells. Moreover, we found only small amounts of radioactivity in the cell media. In fact, the metabolically labeled lipids found in the media amounted to about 2% of the total radiolabeled ones detectable in the cell lipid extracts. By HPTLC analysis we found that about 90% of this negligible radioactivity was due to sphingomyelin. As already reported in the case of its human counterpart (45Monti E. Bassi M.T. Papini N. Riboni M. Manzoni M. Venerando B. Croci G. Preti A. Ballabio A. Tettamanti G. Borsani G. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), mouse MmNEU3 was demonstrated to be a membrane-associated enzyme with an optimum pH in the acid range (pH 3.8) when measured using classical ex vivo assays. Confocal microscopy of COS-7 cells expressing MmNEU3 showed an extensive labeling of the cell surface with a negligible intracellular content of the enzyme. To further confirm the plasma membrane association of MmNEU3 and its possible activity at the cell surface, we embedded the plasma membrane with GD1a and followed its hydrolysis to GM1. Conversion of GD1a to GM1 occurred without the involvement of the lysosomal compartment as demonstrated by the fact that the hydrolysis process was not affected by NH4Cl treatment, a condition that strongly reduces lysosomal activity. Moreover, MmNEU3 is an enzyme that is active toward gangliosides inserted in the plasma membrane of living cells. In fact, cells expressing MmNEU3 and metabolically labeled with [1-3H]sphingosine showed a marked decrease of GD1a and GM3 and an increase of GM1 in comparison with mock-transfected cells. Similar variations of ganglioside relative contents were detectable when sialidase substrates were represented by metabolic radiolabeled gangliosides at the cell surface of untransfected cells (see co-culture experiments). In addition, the modification of the ganglioside pattern was reversible and strictly dependent on MmNEU3 transient expression. Furthermore, the finding of a negligible amount of radiolabeled lipids in the culture media excludes significant ganglioside shedding (46Olshefski R. Ladisch S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) under our experimental conditions. Therefore, the discovery that MmNEU3 is able to modify the ganglioside content of neighboring cells supports MmNEU3 involvement in cell-to-cell interaction, implications that are still unclear but are worthy of further studies. The ability of plasma membrane-associated sialidase to recognize a substrate that is not part of the same cell plasma membrane in which it resides was suggested some time ago by studies done on cell adhesion (47Rauvala H. Carter W.G. Hakomori S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 48Carter W.G. Rauvala H. Hakomori S.I. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 138-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and, more recently, by studies on a GD1a ganglioside derivative covalently linked to bovine serum albumin (49Kopitz J. Oehler C. Cantz M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The capability of MmNEU3 to work through cell-to-cell interactions could be predicted by looking at the three-dimensional structures of the sialidase enzyme available thus far. Actually, mammalian sialidases show a high degree of amino acid sequence homology and share highly conserved amino acid motifs throughout the evolutionary scale from viral neuraminidase to bacterial enzymes (26Monti E. Preti A. Venerando B. Borsani G. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 50Achyuthan K.E. Achyuthan A.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B-Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 129: 29-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In addition, all of the microbic sialidases structures available thus far show a typical β-propeller (or barrel) structure, with the active site located in a shallow crevice on the top of the barrel containing roughly a dozen of highly conserved amino acids (51Taylor G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Most of these residues are present in topologically equivalent positions in all of the mammalian sialidases cloned thus far, strongly suggesting that the enzymes exist in a similar three-dimensional structure. In addition, MmNEU3 does not show either multiple stretches of hydrophobic amino acids or potential glycosylphosphatidylinositol modification or palmitoylation or myristoylation sites along the primary structure, thus rendering rather puzzling the issue of its anchorage to the plasma membrane. From this perspective, the presence of short hydrophobic amino acid stretches at the C terminus of the protein could suggest their involvement in the membrane association of MmNEU3 as a tail-anchored protein (52Kutai U. Hartmann E. Rapaport T.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 53Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The structures of HsNEU1 (54Lukong K.E. Landry K. Elsliger M.A. Chang Y. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Pshezhetsky A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17286-17290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and HsNEU2 (55Monti E. Preti A. Rossi E. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) carried out using computer modeling approaches, positioned the C-terminal portion of the molecule on the opposite site of the catalytic crevice. Thus, based on the assumption of a common three-dimensional structure of sialidases, the MmNEU3 barrel could stand on the lipid bilayer with the active site toward the extracellular space, far away from the oligosaccharide chains of the sphingolipids inserted in the outer leaflet of the membrane. For example, the terminal Gal-Neu5Ac linkage of GD1a, which is hydrolyzed by MmNEU3, should be about 20 Å away from the membrane surface (56Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Furst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1879-1887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 57Sonnino S. Cantu L. Corti M. Acquotti D. Venerando B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 71: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 58Brocca P. Sonnino S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 433-445Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme active site on the top of the barrel is located about 50 Å from the surface of the cell (55Monti E. Preti A. Rossi E. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Evidently, our results do not exclude the possibility that an enzyme activity can occur toward gangliosides of the same membrane, assuming that the barrel is able to lie down on the membrane surface, and/or in area of the cell surface where the plasma membrane is sharply bent, allowing the exposition of the substrate oligosaccharide chains directly to MmNEU3 active site. In fact, NEU3 activity toward self-membrane substrate has been suggested to occur in diluted cultures of neuroblastoma cell lines (36Hasegawa T. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 27514778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Proshin S. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Miyagi T. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as well as in hippocampal neurons (42Rodriguez J.A. Piddini E. Hasegawa T. Miyagi T. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8387-8395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that MmNEU3 is able to recognize and hydrolyze gangliosides belonging to neighboring cells is very attractive. In fact, both MmNEU3 (28Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Wada T. Hata K. Zhao X. Fujimoto T. Miyagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26252-26259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and gangliosides are segregated, together with cholesterol and the other sphingolipids, in SED or lipid rafts (2Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). From this perspective, MmNEU3 activity might modify the ganglioside relative content within SED and thus participate in important functional membrane events such as signal transmission, cell adhesion, and lipid/protein sorting (60Hakomori S.I. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Overall, MmNEU3 activity seems to be an important factor in the modulation of the cell surface ganglioside pattern directly in situ without the intervention of the lysosomal compartment. Such a surface plasticity could be very important for cell adaptation to altered environmental conditions. Experiments aimed at better characterizing the effects exerted by MmNEU3 on the ganglioside composition lipid raft could provide new insight into sialidase biology, leading toward a comprehensive picture of the ganglioside roles within the lipid rafts and, more generally, on the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W2071689617,"The role of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) in the local activation of the glucocorticoid receptor by converting inactive 11-ketoglucocorticoids to active 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids is well established. Currently, 11β-HSD1 is considered a promising target for treatment of obese and diabetic patients. Here, we demonstrate a role of 11β-HSD1 in the metabolism of 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), the major dietary oxysterol. Comparison of recombinant 11β-HSD1, transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, revealed the stereo-specific interconversion of 7KC and 7β-hydroxycholesterol by rat and human 11β-HSD1, whereas the hamster enzyme interconverted 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 7KC. In contrast to lysates, which efficiently catalyzed both oxidation and reduction, intact cells exclusively reduced 7KC. These findings were confirmed using rat and hamster liver homogenates, intact rat hepatocytes, and intact hamster liver tissue slices. Reduction of 7KC was abolished upon inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by carbenoxolone (CBX) or 2′-hydroxyflavanone. In vivo, after gavage feeding rats, 7KC rapidly appeared in the liver and was converted to 7β-hydroxycholesterol. CBX significantly decreased the ratio of 7β-hydroxycholesterol to 7KC, supporting the evidence from cell culture experiments for 11β-HSD1-dependent reduction of 7KC to 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Upon inhibition of 11β-HSD1 by CBX, 7KC tended to accumulate in the liver, and plasma 7KC concentration increased. Together, our results suggest that 11β-HSD1 efficiently catalyzes the first step in the rapid hepatic metabolism of dietary 7KC, which may explain why dietary 7KC has little or no effect on the development of atherosclerosis.

(1Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Google Scholar), including effects on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA-reductase and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activities (2Tamasawa N. Tamasawa A. Takebe K. Hayakari M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1214: 20-26Google Scholar), inhibition of cholesterol release from cells (3Gelissen I.C. Brown A.J. Mander E.L. Kritharides L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17852-17860Google Scholar), and down-regulation of low density lipoprotein receptor expression (4Peng S.K. Zhang X. Chai N.N. Wan Y. Morin R.J. Artery. 1996; 22: 61-79Google Scholar). In addition, 7KC exerts multiple effects by inhibiting nitric oxide release, decreasing glucose permeability, disrupting Ca2+-flux and inducing apoptosis in vascular cells (1Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Google Scholar).Oxidized cholesterol metabolites play a potential role in the development of atherosclerosis (1Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Google Scholar, 5Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Google Scholar, 6Lyons M.A. Brown A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 369-375Google Scholar). Among other oxysterols, 7KC is found at micromolar concentrations in human macrophage-foam cells and atherosclerotic lesions. In contrast, plasma 7KC concentrations are in the nanomolar range. The major oxysterols present in atherosclerotic plaques are 27-hydroxycholesterol and 7KC, although the direct role of 7KC in the development and progression of atherosclerosis is still unclear. 27-Hydroxycholesterol is produced by sterol 27-hydroxylase, the first enzyme of the alternative pathway from cholesterol to bile acids in the liver (7Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1308-1311Google Scholar). 7KC is believed to be formed non-enzymatically by free radical oxidation of cholesterol (8Hodis H.N. Crawford D.W. Sevanian A. Amartey J.K. Wickham E. Sharma R.C. Blankenhorn D.H. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 89: 117-126Google Scholar) or absorbed from dietary intake of processed cholesterol-rich food (9Nielsen J.H. Olsen C.E. Duedahl C. Skibsted L.H. J. Dairy Res. 1995; 62: 101-113Google Scholar, 10Vine D.F. Croft K.D. Beilin L.J. Mamo J.C. Lipids. 2002; 37: 455-462Google Scholar).It was reported that upon administration, 7KC was rapidly metabolized in the liver and only little 7KC reappeared in the circulation, thus questioning the contribution of diet to the high oxysterol concentrations in atherosclerotic lesions (11Lyons M.A. Samman S. Gatto L. Brown A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1846-1857Google Scholar, 12Lyons M.A. Brown A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 209-218Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggested that sterol 27-hydroxylase is involved in 7KC metabolism. Patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis have genetic defects in sterol 27-hydroxylase and develop atherosclerosis prematurely (13Fujiyama J. Kuriyama M. Arima S. Shibata Y. Nagata K. Takenaga S. Tanaka H. Osame M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 200: 1-11Google Scholar). They have normal circulating cholesterol levels but increased 7KC. Human monocyte-derived macrophages from healthy individuals but not from patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis converted 7KC to 27-hydroxy-7KC (14Brown A.J. Watts G.F. Burnett J.R. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27627-27633Google Scholar). These results indicate an essential role for sterol 27-hydroxylase in the metabolism of 7KC in macrophage-foam cells. However, a recent study in sterol 27-hydroxylase-deficient mice demonstrated efficient hepatic metabolism of 7KC (15Lyons M.A. Maeda N. Brown A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1581: 119-126Google Scholar), thus indicating that another enzyme must be involved in the initial step of 7KC metabolism in the liver.In addition to the formation of 7KC by auto-oxidation or its uptake from food, recent evidence from experiments with purified protein and liver microsomal fractions suggest that 7KC may be formed enzymatically from either 7β-hydroxycholesterol or 7α-hydroxycholesterol in various species (16Song W. Chen J. Dean W.L. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16223-16228Google Scholar, 17Maeda Y. Nagatomo H. Uchiyama F. Nagatomo J. Yamada M. Shiotsuki H. Ohta Y. Sato S. Kai M.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16223-16228Google Scholar) purified an enzyme from hamster liver microsomes, which efficiently converted both 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol to 7KC. This enzyme also catalyzed the oxidation of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and N-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme revealed high similarity to human and rat 11β-HSD1. However, unlike 11β-HSD1, the purified hamster liver enzyme did not catalyze the reduction of 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone, and immunochemical analysis with an antibody raised against the purified enzyme suggested the existence of two distinct 11β-HSD-like proteins in hamster liver. Moreover, Robinzon et al. (18Robinzon B. Michael K.K. Ripp S.L. Winters S.J. Prough R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 251-258Google Scholar) recently observed corticosterone inhibitable interconversion of the dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) metabolites 7α-DHEA, 7β-DHEA, and 7-keto-DHEA in liver microsomal fractions, further suggesting a potential role of 11β-HSD enzymes in the metabolism of 7-oxysterol compounds.The role of 11β-HSD1 in the local activation of glucocorticoid receptor by catalyzing the reduction of biologically inactive 11-ketoglucocorticoids (cortisone in humans, 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents) to active 11β-hydroxyglucocorticoids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rodents) is well characterized (19White P.C. Mune T. Agarwal A.K. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 135-156Google Scholar, 20Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Google Scholar). Enhanced glucocorticoid levels lead to increased gluconeogenesis and antagonize the metabolic actions of insulin. Transgenic mice overexpressing 11β-HSD1 selectively in adipose tissue have elevated adipose corticosterone concentrations, and they are susceptible to insulin-resistant diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and high arterial blood pressure due to an increased sensitivity to dietary salt and increased plasma levels of angiotensinogen, angiotensin II, and aldosterone (21Masuzaki H. Paterson J. Shinyama H. Morton N.M. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. Science. 2001; 294: 2166-2170Google Scholar, 22Masuzaki H. Yamamoto H. Kenyon C.J. Elmquist J.K. Morton N.M. Paterson J.M. Shinyama H. Sharp M.G. Fleming S. Mullins J.J. Seckl J.R. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 83-90Google Scholar). Because adipose 11β-HSD1 activity positively correlates to body mass index, percentage of body fat, and waist circumference as well as fasting glucose, insulin levels, and insulin resistance (23Paulmyer-Lacroix O. Boullu S. Oliver C. Alessi M.C. Grino M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2701-2705Google Scholar, 24Rask E. Walker B.R. Soderberg S. Livingstone D.E. Eliasson M. Johnson O. Andrew R. Olsson T.

Metab. 2003; 88: 2738-2744Google Scholar), 11β-HSD1 is currently considered a promising pharmaceutical target for the treatment of diabetes type 2. Indeed, recent animal studies showed that the administration of a selective 11β-HSD1 inhibitor to diabetic mice reduced blood glucose levels and increased insulin sensitivity (26Barf T. Vallgarda J. Emond R. Haggstrom C. Kurz G. Nygren A. Larwood V. Mosialou E. Axelsson K. Olsson R. Engblom L. Edling N. Ronquist-Nii Y. Ohman B. Alberts P. Abrahmsen L. J. Med.

Ohman B. Bjorkstrand E. Abrahmsen L.B. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4755-4762Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the activation of glucocorticoids, 11β-HSD1 might play a role in the detoxification of reactive ketocompounds such as the potent tobacco carcinogen nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) and the anti-cancer drug oracin (28Maser E. Friebertshauser J. Volker B. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 435-448Google Scholar, 29Wsol V. Szotakova B. Skalova L. Maser E. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 459-468Google Scholar).In the present study we tested the hypothesis of whether 11β-HSD1 plays a role in the interconversion of 7-hydroxycholesterol and 7KC. We compared recombinant rat, human and hamster 11β-HSD1 in lysates and intact HEK-293 cells and measured the activities in rat and hamster liver homogenates and in intact rat hepatocytes and hamster liver tissue slices. We also studied the effect of the 11β-HSD inhibitor CBX on 7KC metabolism in vivo in rats.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture media were purchased from Invitrogen, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 7KC were from Steraloids (Wilton, NH), and [1,2,6,7-3H]corticosterone was from Amersham Biosciences. 11-[1,2,6,7-3H]Dehydrocorticosterone was prepared from radiolabeled corticosterone as described earlier (30Schweizer R.A. Atanasov A.G. Frey B.M. Odermatt A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 212: 41-49Google Scholar). 27-Hydroxycholesterol was purchased from Medical Isotopes (Pelham, NH), and [1,2,6-3H]KC was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO. Reagents for derivatization were obtained from Pierce. All other chemicals were from Fluka AG (Buchs, Switzerland) and were of the highest grade available.Cloning of Hamster 11β-HSD1—The liver from a Golden Syrian Hamster (Charles River Laboratories) was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen followed by extraction of total RNA from 100 mg of tissue using Trizol reagent according to the instructions by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Hamster 11β-HSD1 was cloned by reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA with primer XRT20 (5′-TATTCTAGACACCTGAGCACGT20-3′) and subsequent PCR amplification using Taq polymerase:Pfu polymerase (10:1), primer XR (5′-TATTCTAGACACCTGAGCACG-3′), and a degenerate primer (5′-AAAGGATCCGCCTCCCTGTCTGATG(C/G)(A/C)(C/T)TT(T/C)ATG-3′) based on comparison with the sequences upstream of the initiation codon of 11β-HSD1 from other species. A single DNA product was obtained, cleaved with BamHI and XbaI, and cloned into Bluescript vector. The sequences of all 10 clones analyzed were identical. The cDNA insert with or without a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag that was attached by PCR, was inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector.Preparation of Liver Homogenates—The livers from male Sprague-Dawley rats or, alternatively, from Golden Syrian hamsters, were removed, immersed in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, cut in small pieces, and homogenized in buffer TG1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol) (5 ml/g) using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenates were subjected to a single centrifugation step at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were adjusted to a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and activities were determined immediately.Isolation of Rat Hepatocytes—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g body weight) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital. Heparin (liquemin), 1 ml/kg, was injected into the vena cava followed by perfusion for 15 min with 16 ml/min of prewarmed, oxycarbon-aerated buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 143 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, and 0.2 mm EGTA. The liver was then perfused for 20 min with 10 ml/min of a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 7 mm KCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum type IV, Sigma). The liver was removed and incubated in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.8 mm Na2HPO4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm CaSO4, and 5 mm glucose, the capsule was opened, and hepatocytes were harvested. Cells were incubated with slight shaking for 10 min at 37 °C. Hepatocytes were filtered through a 100-μm pore size nylon mesh to separate from biliocytes, washed twice in the same buffer, and centrifuged for 2 min at 50 × g. Cells were finally suspended in steroid-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and enzymatic activities were measured immediately.Preparation of Intact Hamster Liver Slices—Hamster livers were removed, rinsed thoroughly with Hanks' buffered salt solution, and cut in thin slices of ∼300 μm with parallel razor blades similar to the method for precision-cut liver slices described by Dogterom and Rothuizen (31Dogterom P. Rothuizen J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1993; 21: 705-709Google Scholar). Slices were rinsed with Hanks' buffer, and activities were measured immediately without adding NADPH. When the slices were lysed, no conversion of 7KC was detected unless NADPH was added to the reaction.Determination of Enzyme Activities—HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum followed by transient transfection with rat 11β-HSD1 expression plasmid (32Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times 24 h post-transfection with steroid-free (double charcoal-treated) medium and grown for another 24 h. Cells were then detached with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged for 3 min at 150 × g, and resuspended in the appropriate volume of TG1 buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication, and activities were determined immediately.11β-HSD1 activities were measured as described recently, with minor modifications (30Schweizer R.A. Atanasov A.G. Frey B.M. Odermatt A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 212: 41-49Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were incubated in TG1 buffer containing 500 μm NADP+ or NADPH, 30 nCi of [1,2,6,7-3H]corticosterone or 11-[1,2,6,7-3H]dehydrocorticosterone, and various concentrations of unlabeled steroids ranging from 20 nm to 2 μm. Samples in a final volume of 20 μl were incubated at 37 °C for 10–30 min, reactions were stopped, and steroids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and analyzed by scintillation counting. When measuring activities in intact cells, steroid-free medium was used and cofactor was omitted.7-Hydroxydehydrogenase and 7-oxoreductase activities in cell lysates or liver homogenates were measured in buffer TG1 in the presence of various concentrations of 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, or 7KC ranging from 50 nm to 2.5 μm and the corresponding cofactor in a final reaction volume of 1 ml. Reactions were incubated for 10–30 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 7 ml of dichloromethane. Intact transfected HEK-293 cells or rat hepatocytes were incubated in 1 ml of steroid-free medium containing the corresponding cholesterol metabolite and stopped as mentioned above. Samples were then subjected to derivatization and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Alternatively, the reduction of 7KC in intact rat hepatocytes or in intact hamster liver slices was measured by adding 50 nCi of radiolabeled 7KC as a tracer followed by determination of the conversion after separation of 7-oxycholesterols by TLC.Thin-layer Chromatography—Radiolabeled corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone were separated by TLC (SIL G-25 UV254, Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) using a solvent system of 9:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol. A solvent system 2:3 (v/v) hexane:ethyl acetate was used to separate radiolabeled 7KC, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. 7KC was detected under UV light, whereas 7α-hydroxycholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol were visualized using a molybdate spray (100 ml of 10% H2SO4,5gof(NH4)Mo7O24·6H2O, 0.1 g of Ce(SO4)2).Animal Experimentation—Written approval for the present experiments was obtained from the Ethical Committee for Animal Research of the University of Berne, Switzerland. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g body weight) obtained from Charles River Laboratories, were fed standard laboratory chow ad libitum. Groups of five animals each received 2 mg/kg of body weight of 7KC by gavage feeding. Animals were sacrificed after 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8 h, and plasma and tissues were harvested. To study the effect of the 11β-HSD inhibitor CBX, animals were intraperitoneally injected with 15 mg/kg of body weight of CBX 1 h before administration of 7KC and 2 and 5 h after 7KC administration, respectively. For analysis of plasma electrolytes and steroid hormones, groups of four animals were treated as above and sacrificed 6 h after 7KC administration. Plasma aldosterone and progesterone were measured by radioimmunoassay using the coat-a-count procedure as described by the manufacturer (Diagnostic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA). Other steroid metabolites were determined by GC-MS as described previously (33Audige A. Dick B. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. Corman B. Vogt B. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 32: 411-420Google Scholar).Analysis of 7-Oxycholesterols by GC-MS—After removal, tissues were washed from contaminating blood with phosphate-buffered saline, blotted on filter paper, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until analysis. 7-Oxycholesterols were analyzed according to the method described by Iuliano et al. (34Iuliano L. Micheletta F. Natoli S. Ginanni Corradini S. Iappelli M. Elisei W. Giovannelli L. Violi F. Diczfalusy U. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 312: 217-223Google Scholar) with modifications. Tissues (100–250 mg) were cut into small pieces and homogenized in a solution containing 10 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene (v/w) and transferred to a tube containing 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl (H2O), methanol (19:1) and 100 ng of 6α-hydroxycholestanol (5α-cholestan-3β,6α-diol) as the internal standard. Plasma samples (1 ml), obtained from EDTA anti-coagulated blood, were treated as above but without homogenization. After mixing, samples were centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The organic phase was washed twice with 4 ml of methanol, 0.9% NaCl (1:1, v/v) and centrifuged, and the organic phase was subjected to alkaline hydrolysis (saponification) with 0.35 m KOH under an argon atmosphere for 2 h at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 7.0 with phosphoric acid and centrifuged, and the organic phase was washed twice with 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl (H2O), methanol (19:1). The organic phase was transferred to a new tube containing 100 μl of 1% butylated hydroxytoluene in pyridine. For the external standard 125 ng of stigmasterol was added followed by evaporation of the solvent. Next, samples were loaded on a silica cartridge (Supelco), and cholesterol was removed with 0.5% 2-propanol in cyclohexane. Oxidized cholesterol metabolites were eluted with 30% 2-propanol in cyclohexane into a tube containing 100 μl of 1% butylated hydroxytoluene in pyridine, the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the sample was converted to trimethylsilyl ether by adding 100 μl of pyridine and 100 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. Samples were incubated under argon for 1 h at 60 °C. 200 μl of cyclohexane were added to the residue, and the sample was subjected to GC-MS analysis.Enzyme activities from cell lysates or intact cells were measured in 1-ml reaction volumes and stopped by the addition of 7 ml of dichloromethane. The internal standard medroxyprogesterone (0.5 μg) was added, and samples were mixed for 20 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 × g. The organic phase was transferred to new tubes, and dichloromethane was evaporated at 25 °C under argon. For the external standard 0.5 μg of stigmasterol was added. The solvent was evaporated, and 100 μl of 2% methoxamine-HCl in pyridine was added to protect keto groups followed by incubation for 1 h at 60 °C. After evaporation of the solvent, 100 μl of trimethylsilylimidazole was added to protect hydroxyl groups followed by incubation for 16 h at 100 °C. After cooling to 25 °C, 500 μl of cyclohexane:pyridine:hexamethyldisilazane (98:1:1) was added, and samples were purified on Lipidex-5000 columns. Another 2.5 ml of the above mixture were added, samples were collected, and the solvent was evaporated. Cholesterol metabolites were dissolved in 200 μl of cyclohexane, sonicated for 1 min, and subjected to GC-MS analysis on a Hewlett Packard gas chromatograph 6890 equipped with a mass-selective detector 5973 by selected ion monitoring).RESULTSCloning of Hamster Liver 11β-HSD1—To test whether 11β-HSD1 accepts both glucocorticoids and 7-oxycholesterols as substrates and whether the hamster 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase purified by Song et al. (16Song W. Chen J. Dean W.L. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16223-16228Google Scholar) is indeed 11β-HSD1, we compared the activities of rat, human, and hamster 11β-HSD1. The coding region of 11β-HSD1 was cloned from liver RNA of a Golden Syrian hamster. PCR amplification yielded a single fragment (accession number AY519498) encoding a protein of 292 amino acids. Fig. 1 shows ∼90% identity between hamster, rat, and human 11β-HSD1. The N-terminal sequence of hamster 11β-HSD1 is identical to the peptide sequence of the 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase purified by Song et al. (16Song W. Chen J. Dean W.L. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16223-16228Google Scholar), demonstrating that their purified protein is indeed 11β-HSD1 (16Song W. Chen J. Dean W.L. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16223-16228Google Scholar).Comparison of Recombinant Rat, Human, and Hamster 11β-HSD1 Activities—Recombinant rat, human, and hamster 11β-HSD1 were expressed in HEK-293 cells, and activities in cell lysates were determined. Untransfected cells neither interconverted glucocorticoids nor 7-oxycholesterols. 11β-HSD1 from all three species efficiently catalyzed both the oxidation of corticosterone and the reduction of 11-dehydrocorticosterone (Table I). The activities in the three species were comparable, except that human 11β-HSD1 catalyzed the oxidation of corticosterone with ∼3-fold lower apparent Km and 3-fold lower apparent Vmax. This was also observed when activities were measured in intact cells (Table II). The reduction of 11-dehydrocorticosterone in intact cells expressing recombinant 11β-HSD1 was comparable in all three species.Table IOxidation and reduction by lysates from HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant 11β-HSD1SpeciesKmaApparent Km (nm) and apparent Vmax (nmol × min-1 × mg of total protein-1) were calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee equation assuming first order rate kinetics.VmaxaApparent Km (nm) and apparent Vmax (nmol × min-1 × mg of total protein-1) were calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee equation assuming first order rate kinetics.,bFor calculation of apparent Vmax the amount of 11β-HSD1 protein was compared by densitometric analysis of Western blots.Vmax/Kmnmnmol × h-1 × mg-1h-1 × mg-1 × 10-3Oxidation of corticosterone Human305 ± 481.1 ± 0.33.6 Rat1170 ± 1363.2 ± 0.62.7 Hamster1296 ± 1273.0 ± 1.12.3Reduction of 11-dehydrocorticosterone Human314 ± 421.4 ± 0.24.5 Rat307 ± 311.4 ± 0.54.6 Hamster396 ± 821.5 ± 0.63.8Oxidation of 7α-hydroxycholesterol HumanNANDNA RatNANDNA Hamster486 ± 621.4 ± 0.32.9Oxidation of 7β-hydroxycholesterol Human739 ± 671.6 ± 0.32.2 Rat751 ± 1962.4 ± 0.83.2 Hamster729 ± 691.5 ± 0.42.1Reduction of 7-ketocholesterol Human487 ± 500.64 ± 0.061.3 Rat420 ± 670.61 ± 0.201.5 Hamster384 ± 440.63 ± 0.151.6a Apparent Km (nm) and apparent Vmax (nmol × min-1 × mg of total protein-1) were calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee equation assuming first order rate kinetics.b For calculation of apparent Vmax the amount of 11β-HSD1 protein was compared by densitometric analysis of Western blots.

https://openalex.org/W2056099910,"The TIM10 chaperone facilitates the insertion of hydrophobic proteins at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here we report the novel molecular mechanism of TIM10 assembly. This process crucially depends on oxidative folding in mitochondria and involves: (i) import of the subunits in a Cys-reduced and unfolded state; (ii) folding to an assembly-competent structure maintained by intramolecular disulfide bonding of their four conserved cysteines; and (iii) assembly of the oxidized zinc-devoid subunits to the functional complex. We show that intramolecular disulfide bonding occurs in vivo, whereas intermolecular disulfides observed in vitro are abortive intermediates in the assembly pathway. This novel mechanism of compartment-specific redox-regulated assembly is crucial for the formation of a functional TIM10 chaperone."

Proteins in the postsynaptic density, including synGAP, are part of a signaling complex attached to the cytoplasmic tail of the N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor. synGAP can be phosphorylated by a second prominent component of the complex, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Here we show that phosphorylation of synGAP by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II increases its Ras GTPase-activating activity by 70-95%. We identify four major sites of phosphorylation, serines 1123, 1058, 750/751/756, and 764/765. These sites together with other minor phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl tail of synGAP control stimulation of GTPase-activating activity. When three of these sites and four other serines in the carboxyl tail are mutated, stimulation of GAP activity after phosphorylation is reduced to 21 ± 5% compared with 70-95% for the wild type protein.

A complex containing many of these proteins can be isolated from brain homogenates and is called the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction (8Kennedy M.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 264-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). synGAP was identified as a prominent 140-kDa protein in the PSD fraction (9Chen H.-J.

Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Its message is detected only in brain (10Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). It is expressed only in neurons, including most excitatory neurons and a subset of inhibitory neurons (12Zhang W. Vazquez L. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 96-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it is highly localized to the postsynaptic density (10Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). It contains a PH domain, a C2 domain, and a Ras GAP domain that are 23%, 33%, and 47% similar, respectively, to those of the prototype Ras GAP protein p120 Ras GAP (13McCormick F. Martin G.A. Clark R. Bollag G. Polakis P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brain homogenates, synGAP is tightly bound to the particulate fraction and full-length synGAP has not yet been purified in soluble form; however, the GAP domain, expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli, has been shown to stimulate hydrolysis of bound GTP by Ras (11Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.-F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). synGAP plays a crucial role in early development of the brain and in control of synaptic plasticity in the adult brain, as demonstrated by the phenotypes of mouse synGAP mutants (14Komiyama N.H. Watabe A.M. Carlisle H.J. Porter K. Charlesworth P. Monti J. Strathdee D.J. O'Carroll C.M. Martin S.J. Morris R.G. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. J.

Newborn mice with a deletion of synGAP die a few days after birth; whereas adult mice heterozygous for the deletion have altered synaptic plasticity (14Komiyama N.H. Watabe A.M. Carlisle H.J. Porter K. Charlesworth P. Monti J. Strathdee D.J. O'Carroll C.M. Martin S.J. Morris R.G. O'Dell T.J. Grant S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9721-9732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our first report of the characterization of synGAP, we showed that it is a prominent substrate for CaMKII in the postsynaptic density fraction and presented evidence that phosphorylation by CaMKII reduced its GAP activity ∼50% (10Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We later reported that this inhibition was an artifact caused by the combined presence of residual ATP from the phosphorylation reaction and the phosphatase inhibitor pyrophosphate in our Ras GAP assay (16Oh J.S. Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 2002; 33: 151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here we have identified four of the principal phosphorylation sites for CaMKII in synGAP and re-examined the regulatory effect of their phosphorylation. We report that phosphorylation of these sites by CaMKII produces a 70-95% increase in the Ras GAP activity of synGAP. Because CaMKII is a major target of calcium influx through the NMDA receptor, this finding suggests that one result of activation of NMDA receptors at a synapse may be an increase in the rate of inactivation of Ras at that synapse. This mechanism might provide a means by which NMDA receptor activation modulates the action of receptor tyrosine kinases at excitatory synapses.

(Irvine, CA); modified sequencing grade trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI); C18 reversed-phase HPLC columns (4.6 × 250 mm) from Vydac (Hesperia, CA); cellulose-coated TLC sheets (20 × 20 mm) from EM Science; glutathione-agarose from Sigma; and PhosphorImager screens and scanner from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Calmodulin was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). CaMKII was purified from rat forebrain as previously described (17Miller S.G. Kennedy M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9039-9046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Postsynaptic Density Fraction from Rat Brain—The crude PSD fraction was prepared as described previously (6Cho K.-O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) by a modification of the method of Carlin et al. (18Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins Containing Portions of synGAP—A vector for expression of a fusion protein containing a portion of the carboxyl tail of synGAP (residues 946-1167) fused to the carboxyl terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST-ctsynGAP) was constructed in the pGEX plasmid, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein contained the sequence of synGAP encoded by positions 2836-3501 in the synGAP cDNA (accession number AF048976). E. coli cells transformed with the plasmids were grown in cultures containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. At mid-log phase, expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and continued until late log phase. Cells were harvested and frozen at -80 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3 (PBS), containing 1% Triton X-100, proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, lysate supernatants were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, or at 4 °C overnight with glutathione-agarose beads. In some cases, to recover more fusion protein, the pellets were also resuspended in PBS plus 1% n-lauroyl sarcosine, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm PMSF. The suspension was sonicated and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g. The supernatant from this spin was pooled with the lysate supernatants and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The bead suspension was transferred to a column, and the beads were washed with PBS. GST fusion proteins were eluted in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.1 mm PMSF at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by a modification of the method of Lowry (19Peterson G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 95-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar) and stored at -80 °C. Expression of synGAP in Insect Cells—The entire sequence encoding synGAP was inserted into plasmid pVL1392 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) at EcoR1 and BamH1 restriction sites, which added a FLAG tag to the amino terminus. The recombinant FLAG-tagged synGAP (rsynGAP) was expressed in Hi-5 insect cells by the Caltech Protein Expression Laboratory. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were frozen at -80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by homogenization at 4 °C. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 100 × g, and membranes were harvested at 100,000 × g. Like endogenous synGAP, rsynGAP is tightly bound to membranes. All attempts to extract it resulted in loss of GAP activity. Membrane fractions from control insect cells in which synGAP was not present had no detectable GAP activity (data not shown); thus, we are able to reliably measure synGAP activity in the membrane fractions. Recombinant synGAP in the membranes was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Phosphorylation of synGAP and GST-ctsynGAP by CaMKII—Phosphorylation by purified CaMKII was carried out in a reaction mix containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm EGTA, 30 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1000-3000 cpm/pmol) or 30 μm ATP, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 10 mm DTT, 3 μg of purified rat brain CaMKII and Hi-5 cell membranes containing 1.5-2 μg of rsynGAP, or 45 ng of purified CaMKII and 3 μg of GST-ctsynGAP. Phosphorylation was initiated by addition of CaMKII and ATP to a 30-μl reaction mix prewarmed to 30 °C for 2 min. The reaction was carried out for 2 min, or as indicated, and stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min then samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels for GST-ctsynGAP, and 7.5% gels for rsynGAP. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film to identify phosphorylated proteins. To quantify the amount of phosphate incorporated, the level of 32P in the bands was determined with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The relative densities measured by the Imager were converted to counts per minute by comparison to signals from standard amounts of [32P]phosphate spotted onto filter paper and imaged at the same time. Determination of Stoichiometry of Phosphorylation of synGAP by CaMKII—The moles of synGAP per milligram of protein in either the postsynaptic density or the membranes of Hi-5 insect cells was determined from immunoblots containing increasing amounts of protein from each sample, labeled with affinity-purified primary antibodies specific for synGAP (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), and secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa fluor-488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The labeling was quantified with the use of the Storm system and compared with the labeling of standard amounts of GST-ctsynGAP protein, which contains the epitopes of synGAP used to prepare the primary antibody. We then calculated the nanomoles of phosphate incorporated into the synGAP band (determined as described above) per nanomoles of total synGAP. Trypsinization of Phosphorylated GST Fusion Proteins and Recombinant synGAP—Proteins were phosphorylated as described above with the following modifications. The reaction was conducted in a volume of 500 μl containing 80-120 μg/ml GST fusion protein or 300-400 μg/ml Hi-5 membrane protein containing recombinant synGAP. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 30 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 2-4 μg/ml CaMKII for phosphorylation of GST fusion protein or 10-20 μg/ml CaMKII for phosphorylation of membrane-bound recombinant synGAP in the presence of 30 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1500-3000 cpm/pmol). The reaction was continued for 5, 15, or 30 min at 30 °C and stopped by addition of 3× SDS sample buffer. The mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min then fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the appropriate band of GST fusion protein or recombinant synGAP was identified by comparison to molecular weight markers. Bands were excised, chopped into small pieces, and transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. The pieces were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 2 mm tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 50% acetonitrile, 0.5 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH > 8) to reduce the protein and destain the gel piece. The protein was then alkylated by transferring the gel piece to 25 mm iodoacetamide, 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubating at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Gel pieces were rinsed with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were then trypsinized in the gel as previously described (20Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.-H. Analyt. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). HPLC Fractionation of Phosphopeptides—Trypsinized phosphopeptides were fractionated by HPLC on a C18 reversed-phase column developed at 1 ml/min with a gradient of 0-30% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Radioactivity in each 0.5-ml fraction was measured in a Beckman LS 7800 scintillation counter by detection of Cerenkov radiation. Mass Spectrometry and Sequencing of Phosphopeptides—Mass spectrometry was conducted by the Protein and Peptide Microanalytical Laboratory at Caltech with a PerSeptive Biosystems/Vestec Lasertech II reflector for matrix-assisted, laser desorption ionization, time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Data were collected in both linear and reflector modes. Serine phosphopeptides are reliably identified by appearance of a new peptide in reflector mode that is reduced in mass by ∼98 atomic mass units from the parent because of cleavage of a phosphate group from the parent. The identity of some of the phosphopeptides that we detected was confirmed by amino acid sequencing by Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Identification of Tryptic Peptides with Peptidesort Software—The Peptidesort software package (GCG, Accyleris, Inc.) permits identification of a peptide from its molecular mass and its relative retention time during HPLC. We used the program to predict all possible tryptic peptides, sorted by retention time and molecular mass, from the amino acid sequence of synGAP. We compared the retention times from HPLC and the molecular masses of each phosphopeptide that we detected by mass spectrometry with those predicted by the program. Mass spectrometry measures the mass of the peptide fragment plus a proton, whereas the program predicts the mass of the corresponding hydrolysis product. Therefore, for comparison, we subtracted 17 atomic mass units from the mass of each peptide predicted by the program. After this correction, unless noted, the differences between masses predicted by the program, and those of peptides determined by mass spectrometry and reported in Tables I and II (see below), were less than 1 atomic mass unit.Table IIdentification of phosphopeptides in HPLC fractions shown in Fig. 4HPLC fractionsIdentified sitesPeptide mass (MALDI-TOF)Predicted peptide massbThe mass of peptides predicted from tryptic hydrolysis in Peptidesort software were corrected by subtracting 17 atomic mass units to match the M + H+ mass measured by MALDI-TOF.Residues in synGAPLinearReflectedaMass of peptide after neutral loss of phosphate in reflector mode.atomic mass units77cIdentity of phosphopeptide was confirmed by sequencing by MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.”S10581678.781581.721580.871056-107095cIdentity of phosphopeptide was confirmed by sequencing by MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.”S10992054.101956.321957.101097-1120103cIdentity of phosphopeptide was confirmed by sequencing by MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.”S11232045.281947.831948.101121-1138202S1058 or 7 Ss, 3 Ts3770.063672.463674.06 or 3673.901056-1090 or 970-1004a Mass of peptide after neutral loss of phosphate in reflector mode.b The mass of peptides predicted from tryptic hydrolysis in Peptidesort software were corrected by subtracting 17 atomic mass units to match the M + H+ mass measured by MALDI-TOF.c Identity of phosphopeptide was confirmed by sequencing by MS/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Table IIIdentification of phosphopeptides in HPLC fractions shown in Fig. 6HPLC fractionsIdentified sitesPeptide mass (MALDI-TOF)Predicted peptide massbThe mass of peptides predicted from tryptic hydrolysis in Peptidesort software were corrected by subtracting 17 atomic mass units to match the M + H+ mass measured by MALDI-TOF.Residues in synGAPLinearReflectedaMass of peptide after neutral loss of phosphate in reflector mode.atomic mass units79S1093/10951023.6926.3926.11089-109688S764/7651161.61064.21064.2761-770214S750/751/7561676.81579.31579.7747-760a Mass of peptide after neutral loss of phosphate in reflector mode.b The mass of peptides predicted from tryptic hydrolysis in Peptidesort software were corrected by subtracting 17 atomic mass units to match the M + H+ mass measured by MALDI-TOF. Open table in a new tab Assay of Ras GTPase-activating Activity—GAP assays of 20-35 μg of PSD and 5-15 μg of recombinant synGAP were performed after phosphorylation as described above, in the absence or presence of 0.3 mm free Ca2+ and 10 μg/ml calmodulin for 2 min at 30 °C, but in a final volume of 30 μl. In some reactions, antibody 6G6 against PSD-95 or inhibiting antibodies 4A11 and 6E9 (21Molloy S.S. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4756-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) against CaMKII (20 μg each of IgG partially purified from Ascites fluid by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate) were included in the reaction. The phosphorylation reactions were stopped by addition of 60 μl of a mixture to bring the solution to 0.66 mm EGTA, 11.7 μm okadaic acid, 22 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 9.3 mm MgCl2, 111 mm NaCl, and 2.2 mm DTT. The GAP assay was then initiated by addition of 10 μl containing 2 pmol of [α-32P]GTP-bound GST-Ras fusion protein (10Chen H.-J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) for a total volume of 100 μl of GAP reaction mixture (22Bollag G. McCormick F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min, stopped by addition of 600 μl of ice-cold 5% glutathione-agarose beads and 80 μl of ice-cold 50 mm EDTA, and then incubated at 4 °C for 45 min on an end-over-end mixer. Beads were washed three times (23Smith D.B. Corcoran L.M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. K. S. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. Wiley Interscience, New York1995: 1671-1677Google Scholar), nucleotides were dissociated from the column-bound GST-Ras, and [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]GDP were separated by thin layer chromatography (22Bollag G. McCormick F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The separated nucleotides were visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with ImageQuaNT software to determine the percent GDP generated in the assay (GDP/[GDP + GTP] × 100), a measure of Ras GTPase activity. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Recombinant synGAP—We prepared various mutant constructs to study the effect of mutation of the identified phosphorylation sites to alanine (serines 764, 765, 1058, 1062, 1064, 1093, 1095, and 1123). Mutagenic oligonucleotides (18-to 25-mer) that contained alanine instead of the identified serine were synthesized at the Caltech Oligonucleotide Synthesis Laboratory. The oligonucleotides were phosphorylated at the 5′ end by T4 kinase then annealed to the denatured synGAP plasmid (pVL1392) at room temperature for 30 min. The oligonucleotides were extended with T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase in vitro to generate a hemi-methylated, double-stranded DNA molecule. A restriction digestion was performed with Dpn-1 to eliminate non-mutant plasmid DNA (those with two methylated strands). The DNA molecules were then transformed into the E. coli mutS strain (deficient in the methylation-specific repair system), and colonies were screened by DNA sequencing for plasmids containing the alanine mutations (24Kramer B. Kramer W. Fritz H.J. Cell. 1984; 38: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the desired mutations were transformed into E. coli DH5α for propagation, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Production of Phosphosite-specific Antibodies—Synthetic peptides with the sequence ITKQH-S(PO3)-QTPSTC (P-S1123) and RGLNSS(PO3)-MDMARC (P-S765) were purchased from SynPep (Dublin, CA). Purified peptides were conjugated via succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit antisera against the conjugated P-S1123 and P-S765 were raised by CoCalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) and Sigma Genosis (The Woodlands, TX), respectively. Specificity and optimum dilution were determined for each bleed by immunoblotting against 15-20 μg of PSD fraction phosphorylated by endogenous CaMKII, and of equivalent nonphosphorylated PSD fraction. Antibodies from sera that contained a high titer specific for phospho-synGAP were purified by peptide affinity chromatography. Five milligrams of P-S1123 or P-S765 peptide was conjugated to 5 ml of Sulfolink coupling resin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coupled resin was then mixed for 1 h with a blocker consisting of 0.1 m cysteine in TE85 (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA), then washed twice with 5 volumes each of TE85, TE85, 1 m NaCl, and finally with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA (TE75). Before each use, the resin was blocked for 1 h with 3 volumes of TE75, 20% non-immune rabbit serum, washed with TE75, G elution buffer (Pierce), and finally re-equilibrated with TE75 buffer. IgG from ∼25 ml of serum was concentrated by precipitation in 50% ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. The pellet was redissolved in 50 ml of TE75 and dialyzed against two changes of the same buffer. The dialyzed protein was stirred with the peptide resin for 2 h, poured into a column, and washed with 10 column volumes of TE75. Bound IgG was eluted in Gentle Elution Buffer (Pierce), collecting 1-ml fractions into tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Protein was detected in each fraction by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions containing high amounts of protein were further characterized by immunoblotting against both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated PSD protein. Fractions with the highest concentration of phosphosite-specific antibodies were pooled. Preparation of Cortical Neuronal Cultures—Cultures of cortical neurons with less than 1% astrocytes were prepared from fetal mice (15-16 days gestation) as previously described (25Rose K. Goldberg M. Choi D.W. Tyson C. Frazier J. In Vitro Biological Methods. Methods in Toxicology. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 46-60Google Scholar) in 24-well plates coated with 50 ng/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and 2 ng/ml laminin (BD Biosciences) and Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm Glutamax I (Invitrogen), 25 μm glutamate, and 25 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. After 3 days in vitro (DIV), cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was added (10 μm) to halt the growth of non-neuronal cells. Cells were used at 13-14 DIV. Cell Treatment and Protein Extraction —Cell cultures (13-14 days in vitro (DIV)) were washed three times in HEPES-control salt solution (HCSS) containing (in mm): 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 NaOH, 20 HEPES, and 5.5 glucose, pH 7.4, and then half were exposed to 25 μm N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) dissolved in HCSS or to an equal amount of additional HCSS for 15 s (2-4 wells for each condition). After treatment, cells were washed quickly with ice-cold PBS and extracted with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm orthovanadate, and complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Extracts were heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Western Blotting—To determine synGAP phosphorylation, 5 μg of protein samples was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) in transfer buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and were"

To define its critical cell interaction domains we used endostatin-derived synthetic peptides containing surface-exposed sequences. We observed that, when immobilized, an arginine-rich peptide of 11 amino acids from its N terminus efficiently promoted endothelial cell adhesion through β1 integrin- and heparin-dependent mechanisms. In addition, the peptide induced the formation of membrane ruffles and focal contacts. In the soluble form, the peptide inhibited basic fibroblast growth factor-induced directional migration and tubular morphogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells. Accordingly, the peptide induced the loss of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in these cells. Substitution of the arginine residues with alanines resulted in the loss of these properties. In the current study we describe a putative integrin-binding sequence with anti-migratory activity within endostatin.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, is a critical event in numerous physiological and pathological processes such as wound healing, fracture repair, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. The growth of solid tumors beyond a few millimeters in diameter requires the generation of tumor microvasculature (1Hanahan D. Folkman J. Cell. 1996; 86: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6091) Google Scholar). The onset of this angiogenic switch is regulated by a shift in the balance of negative and positive regulators of angiogenesis. The positive regulators are most commonly growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 1The abbreviations used are: bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; HDMEC, human dermal microvascular endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ES-1 through ES-5, synthetic endostatin peptides (see text); BSA, bovine serum albumin. which stimulate the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (2Risau W.

Recent findings suggest that interaction of endostatin with both of these putative receptors is needed for the endostatin-induced disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton (19Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37895-37901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mouse endostatin revealed a compact globular fold and a basic patch of 11 arginine residues, which have been suggested to act as binding sites for heparin (21Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, the roles of the arginine residues have remained unclear so far, because both decreased and unaltered anti-migratory potential has been reported in endostatin mutants, which are unable to bind heparin (22Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi N. Anand-Apte B. Lee M.

Both mouse and human endostatin lack RGD sequences, and specific integrin-binding sites have not been identified yet. The current work has been carried out to identify specific sequence motifs of human endostatin that would interact with endothelial cell surface integrins or heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We found that an arginine-rich endostatin-derived peptide, when immobilized, efficiently promoted endothelial cell adhesion via β1 integrin and heparin. The peptide was a potent inhibitor of endothelial cell migration and tubular morphogenesis, and induced the disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton when in soluble form. The activity was found to be lost in mutated peptides where arginine residues were substituted with alanines. We describe here a novel RGD-independent sequence motif within endostatin capable of promoting endothelial cell adhesion via integrins. Because this sequence is also an inhibitor of endothelial cell migration and tube formation, it is plausibly an important sequence motif for the anti-angiogenic activity of endostatin. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human endostatin was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). bFGF was from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibodies were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Monoclonal antibodies against integrins α5β1 (cloneJBS5), α5 (clone P1D6), β1 (clone P5D2), αv (clone M9), and polyclonal antibodies against integrin β3 (catalog no. 1932) were from Chemicon Inc. (Temecula, CA). Cell Culture—Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) were purchased from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany) and were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (Promocell), at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells used for the experiments were from passages 3–6. Unless indicated otherwise, the cells were washed twice and incubated in serum-free Medium 199 for at least 12 h prior to treatment with the various proteins or chemicals. All experiments were carried out under serum-free conditions. Immunofluorescence—Cells cultured on glass coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 170 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min. Nonspecific protein binding sites were then saturated with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 min. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with polyclonal antibodies against fibronectin or monoclonal antibodies against vinculin and paxillin. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) was used for the staining of the actin cytoskeleton. Unbound proteins were removed by washing, followed by incubation with Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. The coverslips were then washed and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The fluorescent images were obtained using an epifluorescence microscope. Cell Adhesion Assays—Plastic 96-well cell culture plates were coated with endostatin or endostatin-derived peptides at concentrations indicated (50 μl/well) at 4 °C for 16 h. Nonspecific adhesion sites were saturated by incubating the wells with 1% heat-inactivated BSA (70 °C for 1 h) at 22 °C for 1 h. After washing the wells with PBS, 0.5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of prewarmed serum-free medium were seeded into each well. Antibodies against integrins α5, β1, αv, and β3 or heparin (100 IU/ml) were added to the cells at a concentration of 30 μg/ml where indicated. After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C, nonattached cells were removed by washing with PBS. The cells were then fixed and stained in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, containing 0.1% Coomassie Blue. Subsequently, the cells were washed extensively with 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and once with PBS. The cells were then lysed in 1% SDS, after which the amount of lysed cells were quantified by measuring their absorbance at 620 nm using a Multiscan plate reader (Labsystems, Finland). Each experiment contained three independent wells per coated protein. Values presented represent at least three independent experiments. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays were performed in modified Boyden chambers containing polyethylene membranes (8-μm pore size; BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) coated with 50 μg/ml fibronectin at 4 °C for 16 h. After washing the membranes with PBS, nonspecific adhesion sites were saturated with 1% heat-inactivated BSA at 22 °C for 1 h. Cells (1 × 104) suspended in serum-free medium were placed in the upper compartment of the chambers. Medium containing 50 ng/ml bFGF was added to the lower compartment. The chambers were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the membranes were fixed and stained in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid containing 0.1% Coomassie Blue, and the cells migrated to the lower surface were counted at ×200 magnification. Three random fields from each two wells were counted. Values represent three independent experiments. Endothelial Cell Tube Formation Assay—24-well cell culture plates were coated with 200 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and allowed to polymerize at +37 °C for 45 min. The cells (4 × 105) were suspended in 600 μl of pre-warmed serum-free Medium 199 containing endostatin or endostatin-derived peptides at concentrations indicated. The cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated plates, treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF, and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were then fixed, and tube formation was assessed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. Tubular branches were counted from three random fields. Values represent three independent experiments. Construction of Synthetic Endostatin-derived Peptides Containing Surface-exposed Basic Amino Acid Residues—Using crystal structure analysis, an extensive basic patch of arginine and lysine residues has been identified on the surface of mouse and human endostatins (21Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To identify specific sequence motifs that interact with endothelial cell surface integrins, and to investigate the role of the basic amino acids in endostatin function, we constructed five synthetic peptides of 11–13 amino acids. These peptides, termed ES-1 to ES-5, contained 12 basic amino acids out of the total 18 as determined on the basis of the crystal structure. ES-1 consisted of the amino acids 23–34 and two surface exposed basic amino acids, Arg24 and Arg27. ES-2 contained the amino acids 60–70 and three surface exposed arginine residues, Arg62, Arg63, and Arg66. ES-3 contained the amino acids 99–111, and three surface-exposed basic amino acids, Arg99, Lys106, and Arg110. ES-4 contained the amino acids 127–139 and three surface-exposed arginines, Arg128, Arg129, and Arg139. ES-5 covered the C-terminal amino acids 171–183, containing C-terminal Lys183 (Fig. 1, upper panel). To characterize the role of the arginines for endostatin function, three mutant ES-2-peptides were constructed. In ES-2mut1, the first two arginine residues, Arg62 and Arg63, from ES-2 were substituted with alanines. In ES-2mut2 Arg66 was replaced by an alanine. Accordingly, in ES-2mut3 all three arginines, Arg62, Arg63, and Arg66, were replaced by alanines (Fig. 1, lower panel). Immobilized ES-2 Mediates Endothelial Cell Adhesion—Integrins have been implicated to serve as receptors for endostatin, and immobilized endostatin mediates cell adhesion in an α5β1 integrin-dependent manner (18Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 20Sudhakar A. Sugimoto H. Yang C. Lively J. Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the endostatin-derived peptides would serve as substrates for cell adhesion, the cells were plated under serum-free conditions on culture dishes coated with 5 μm endostatin or 50 μm endostatin-derived peptides. Cells were allowed to attach for 90 min after which cell adhesion was quantified. Cell adhesion was significantly increased when cells were plated on immobilized endostatin compared with the BSA-coated control wells. ES-2 was even more efficient than full-length endostatin in inducing cell attachment. ES-5 and ES-3 induced a less pronounced effect on cell adhesion but were as efficient as full-length endostatin. ES-4 was slightly less efficient, whereas ES-1 had no effect (Fig. 2A). To investigate which of the cell surface molecules might mediate endothelial cell adhesion to ES-2, antibodies inhibiting integrin ligation as well as heparin were applied to the cell suspension before allowing the cells to adhere. Both heparin and antibodies against β1 integrin efficiently inhibited HDMEC adhesion to ES-2. Antibodies against α1, α2, α5, αv, and β3 integrins displayed no dramatic effects on cell adhesion (Fig. 2B). To investigate the roles of the arginine residues in the adhesive effect of ES-2, cell adhesion assays were performed using mutated peptides (Fig. 1). Cells plated on ES-2 mutants ES-2mut1, ES-2mut2, or ES-2mut3 lacking one, two, or three arginines, respectively, displayed reduced levels of adhesion (Fig. 2C). Because peptides ES-3 and ES-5 also promoted cell adhesion, it was of interest to investigate whether α5β1 integrin or heparin would be involved in these interactions. Antibodies inhibiting α5 and β1 integrin ligation as well as heparin were applied to the cell suspension before allowing the cells to adhere. Antibodies against α5, and β3 integrins had no significant effects on cell adhesion, but heparin efficiently inhibited HDMEC adhesion to both ES-3 and ES-5 (Fig. 2D). Immobilized ES-2 Promotes a Limited Degree of Cell Spreading—Integrin-dependent cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix results in cell spreading, actin polymerization, and formation of focal adhesions (24Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To examine whether immobilized ES-2 promotes cell spreading, we performed immunofluorescence analysis on cells attached on glass coverslips coated with ES-2 under serum-free conditions. Control coverslips were coated with BSA. Cells were allowed to attach and spread for 2 h prior to fixation. Actin staining of cells attached onto ES-2 revealed the formation of membrane ruffles at the cell periphery. No formation of actin stress fibers was observed. The actin-rich membrane protrusions were also positive for vinculin staining. Integrin α5β1 was accordingly observed to localize to the membrane ruffles in the cell periphery. Cells plated on ES-2 displayed limited cell spreading when compared with cells plated on fibronectin, the major substrate for α5β1 integrin. Cells adhering on fibronectin formed actin stress fibers and displayed cytoplasmic focal adhesions visualized by vinculin staining. Cells attached on BSA remained rounded with no evidence of cell spreading (Fig. 3). Soluble ES-2 Inhibits Cell Adhesion on Endostatin—To investigate whether endostatin and the endostatin-derived peptides occupy the same cell surface receptors, soluble ES-2, ES-3, and ES-5 were used to compete with endostatin for endothelial cell adhesion. Cell culture dishes were coated with 5 μm endostatin (100 μg/ml). HDMECs in suspension containing the peptides (6 μm) were then added, and the cells were allowed to attach for 90 min. ES-2 effectively inhibited endothelial cell adhesion to immobilized endostatin. ES-5 had a moderate inhibitory effect on cell adhesion to endostatin, whereas ES-3 and ES-2mut3 displayed negligible effects (Fig. 4A). To further analyze the effect of ES-2 on endothelial cell adhesion to endostatin, HDMECs in suspension containing increasing concentrations of ES-2 were allowed to attach on cell culture dishes coated with 5 μm endostatin (100 μg/ml). Quantification of cell attachment after 90 min indicated that ES-2 inhibited HDMEC adhesion to endostatin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Soluble Endostatin-derived Peptides Induce Disassembly of Focal Adhesions and Actin Stress Fibers—We have previously observed that human endostatin induces the disassembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in cultured endothelial cells (13Wickström S.A. Veikkola T. Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6511-6516PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze whether endostatin-derived peptides would induce similar changes in cytoskeletal morphology, we carried out immunofluorescence analysis of peptide-treated HDMECs using antibodies against the focal adhesion protein vinculin and the actin fiber staining agent rhodamine-phalloidin. Cells were treated with 500 nm concentrations of ES-1 through ES-5 peptides, and after 1 h of incubation the cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. Untreated cells and cells treated with ES-1, ES-3, or ES-5 displayed distinct focal adhesion structures as visualized by vinculin staining, and multiple actin stress fibers. In cells treated with ES-2, the vinculin staining was restricted to the cell periphery with no cytoplasmic plaques visible. In addition, rhodamine-phalloidin staining of the actin cytoskeleton revealed the absence of a stress fiber network. In cells treated with ES-4, a fraction of the cells displayed intact focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, whereas in some cells these structures were absent (Fig. 5A, arrows). As the substitution of the arginine residues with alanines resulted in decreased adhesive activity of ES-2, we sought next to investigate the role of these basic amino acids in the ES-2-induced disruption of cytoskeletal structures. Cells were treated with 50 nm endostatin or 500 nm ES-2, ES-2mut1, ES-2mut2, or ES-2mut3, and immunofluorescence analysis of their cytoskeletons was carried out. We found that untreated control cells and cells treated with ES-2mut3 displayed multiple cytoplasmic focal adhesions (vinculin staining) and a distinct network of actin stress fibers. In contrast, endostatin-treated cells and cells treated with ES-2 completely lacked these structures, and vinculin staining was visible only in the cell periphery together with cortical actin bundles. In cells treated with ES-2mut1 or ES-2mut2 the effect was partial, as evidenced by the presence of cells with intact focal adhesions and clear stress fibers, as well as cells void of these structures (Fig. 5B). Effect of Soluble Endostatin-derived Peptides on Endothelial Cell Migration—Endostatin inhibits the migration of cultured endothelial cells (5O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R. Folkman J. Cell. 1997; 88: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4253) Google Scholar). The strength of cell adhesion to the ECM regulates the choice between adhesion and migration. If the adhesion is too strong, the cell remains stationary, and if the adhesion is too weak, sufficient traction cannot be generated for movement. Cell migration occurs thus at intermediate levels of adhesion (25Schwarzbauer J.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R292-R294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because endostatin and ES-2 induced changes in cell-matrix interactions, we explored next their effects on directional cell motility using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Endostatin or endostatin-derived peptides were added to both upper and lower compartments of the chamber. Cell migration through a fibronectin matrix toward bFGF was inhibited ∼50%, when the endothelial cells were treated with 50 nm recombinant endostatin. A comparable effect was observed in cells treated with 500 nm ES-2. ES-4 had a moderate effect cell migration, whereas ES-1, ES-3, and ES-5 had only negligible effects on endothelial cell migration (Fig. 6A). To investigate the role of the arginine residues of ES-2 for its anti-migratory effect, Boyden chamber migration assays were performed using the mutant peptides. Cells treated with 50 nm endostatin or 500 nm ES-2 displayed reduced ability to migrate toward the bFGF stimulus. ES-mut1 and ES-mut2 possessed moderate anti-migratory potential but were less effective than full-length endostatin or ES-2. When the cells were treated with ES-2mut3, the level of migration was not significantly reduced from that of untreated cells (Fig. 6B). Tubular Morphogenesis of HDMECs in Inhibited by Soluble ES-2—To assess the effect of the ES-2 peptide on the formation of vascular structures, HDMECs were seeded on growth factor-reduced Matrigel basement membrane matrix in the presence of bFGF. After 16 h of incubation the cultures were fixed and assayed for tube formation using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. In untreated control cells, bFGF induced the formation of organized tubular structures with branching sprouts and anastomoses (Fig. 7A). In cells treated with 50 nm endostatin or 500 nm ES-2, tube formation was significantly decreased, and the cells remained as an adherent monolayer with only a few tubular structures. ES-2mut3 had no inhibitory effect on the tubular morphogenesis of HDMECs (Fig. 7, A and B). Current knowledge of the effects of endostatin on endothelial cell cultures suggests that the anti-migratory and anti-proliferative properties of this molecule are the major mechanisms underlying its anti-angiogenic potential. Recent studies provide evidence that the binding of endostatin to α5β1 integrin on the endothelial cell surface in part modulates these effects (14Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5580-5589PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the basic patch formed on the surface of endostatin by clusters of arginine residues could play a role in the activity of this molecule (21Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Sasaki T. Fukai N. Mann K. Gohring W. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4249-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, no detailed structure-function analyses of human endostatin have been carried out. In the current study we designed peptides derived from areas of human endostatin containing multiple surface-exposed basic amino acid residues. We analyzed the effects of these peptides on endothelial cell adhesion and characterized the cytoskeletal alterations of cells treated with the peptides. We also analyzed the effects of these peptides on endothelial cell migration and tubular morphogenesis. The results indicated that an arginine-rich peptide was able to promote endothelial cell adhesion and spreading via heparin- and integrin β1-dependent interactions. In addition, the soluble peptide induced the disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and inhibited cell migration and tubular morphogenesis as described earlier for endostatin (5O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T.

Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engström A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The arginine residues of the peptide were found to be critical for its activity. Immobilized endostatin has previously been observed to promote cell adhesion via integrins (18Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The current studies on HDMEC adhesion onto endostatin-derived peptides identified a putative integrin-binding sequence motif of human endostatin. An arginine-rich, endostatin-derived peptide termed ES-2 most efficiently promoted endothelial cell adhesion. Our results imply that the adhesion is mediated by β1 integrin, which is the major fibronectin receptor in mammalian cells as a complex with the α5 subunit. This integrin has previously been observed to modulate endostatin-induced signal transduction and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton (19Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37895-37901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Sudhakar A. Sugimoto H. Yang C. Lively J. Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Function-neutralizing antibodies against integrins α1, α2, α5, and αv did not significantly decrease cell adhesion. In contrast, the function-neutralizing β3 integrin antibodies moderately enhanced cell adhesion to ES-2. The reason for this enhancement is unclear at present but might result from trans-regulation, a phenomenon by which specific integrins bound by agonists or antagonists regulate the function and activation status of other integrins (27Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In addition to integrins, cell adhesion is modulated by cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These two families of adhesion receptors act often in coordination to promote cell spreading and rearrangement of the cytoskeleton (28Woods A. Couchman J.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Adhesion of endothelial cells to ES-2 was strongly inhibited by heparin. This suggests that heparan sulfate proteoglycans could be involved in ES-2-mediated cell attachment. Fulllength endostatin binds with low affinity to glypican, a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on endothelial cells (17Karumanchi S.A. Jha V. Ramchandran R. Karihaloo A. Tsiokas L. Chan B. Dhanabal M. Hanai J.I. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Keiser N. Kalluri R. Zeng H. Mukhopadhyay D. Chen R.L. Lander A.D. Hagihara K. Yamaguchi Y. Sasisekharan R. Cantley L. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 811-822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, endostatin-induced disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton has been observed to require an interaction with an unidentified heparan sulfate proteoglycan (19Wickström S.A. Alitalo K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37895-37901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as co-receptors also for bFGF, but endostatin does not seem to compete for the same binding sites on the endothelial cell surface (29Chang Z. Choon A. Friedl A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 71-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The possibility that endothelial cell adhesion to ES-2 would be a nonspecific effect resulting from the basic residues of the peptide was excluded by the observations that peptide ES-4, which also contains three basic amino acid residues, did not efficiently promote cell adhesion. Peptides ES-5 and ES-3 were almost as efficient as full-length endostatin in promoting cell attachment, but they did not seem to act via α5 or β1 integrins. Interestingly, cell adhesion to both of the peptides was inhibited by heparin. ES-5 also inhibited endothelial cell adhesion to immobilized endostatin, but was less effective than ES-2. However, it did not induce disruption of the actin cytoskeleton or inhibit endothelial cell migration. Therefore, the effects of this peptide appear to be very different from those of ES-2. The corresponding sequence motif in endostatin might, however, be involved in the cell surface association of the protein. A mutant form of mouse endostatin lacking nine C-terminal amino acids and thus most of the amino acids included in the ES-5 peptide has been found to be as effective as full-length endostatin in inhibiting tumor growth in mice (30Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that this sequence motif might not be essential for endostatin function. The ligands of α5β1 integrins consist of ECM or cell surface proteins containing the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence (31Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar). This sequence motif is not present in endostatin or ES-2, which suggests that the binding of these two peptides to the integrin could occur at a site distinct from the ligand binding pocket. In support of this, ES-2 did not significantly inhibit endothelial cell adhesion on fibronectin. 2S. A. Wickström and J. Keshi-Oja, unpublished observations. In addition, in contrast to the integrin ligands containing the RGD-sequence, ES-2 promoted only a limited degree of cell spreading and did not induce the formation of actin stress fibers or abundant focal adhesions. Endothelial cell contact with an increased concentration of immobilized α5β1 integrin ligand is known to enhance cell migration in a haptotactic manner (32Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We observed that immobilized full-length endostatin or ES-2 were inefficient in promoting haptotactic cell migration.2 However, endostatin seems to exist as a monomer, and monovalent ligand occupancy of integrins is considered not to be sufficient for efficient accumulation of cytoskeletal proteins (33Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to define the nature of the interaction and possible co-receptors between α5β1 integrin and endostatin. Modified Boyden chamber migration assays using bFGF as a chemotactic stimulus revealed that the peptide ES-2, containing the surface-exposed arginine residues Arg62, Arg63, and Arg66 displayed anti-migratory potential comparable to full-length endostatin when used in a 10-fold molar excess. The functional role of these specific arginine residues has been assessed in full-length mouse endostatin. The arginine residues of ES-2 are essential for the heparin-binding properties of endostatin. In addition, endostatin mutants in which these arginines have been substituted with alanines lose their ability to inhibit endothelial cell migration in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo (22Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The subsequent observation of partial loss of function in ES-2 mutants lacking one or two out of the three arginines, and complete loss of function in the mutant lacking all three arginines, further emphasized the importance of the arginine residues in the anti-migratory potential of these peptides. ES-4 containing three surface-exposed arginines, Arg128, Arg129, and Arg139, was significantly less potent than ES-2 in inhibiting endothelial cell migration. Interestingly, whereas directed cell migration was inhibited by endostatin and ES-2, random cell migration was essentially unaffected or even modestly increased.2 This could be a consequence of alterations in cell-matrix interactions induced by these treatments. Both contractile and protrusive forces are required to move the cell body forward. These forces are generated by actin stress fiber contraction and traction from the focal adhesions (34Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar). The strength of cell adhesion to the ECM determines the speed of migration. If the adhesion is too strong, the cell remains stationary; if it is too weak, enough traction cannot be generated for movement. The direction of cell movement is controlled by growth factors such as bFGF, which engage in extensive cross-talk with integrins to enhance cell polarization and directed cell motility (35Eliceiri B.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Disruption of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions by endostatin or ES-2 would thus result in decreased adhesion and increased random migration. However, the loss of these structures at the leading edge could inhibit directional migration toward a chemotactic stimulus. Another possibility is that the disassembly of focal adhesions could lead to alterations in bFGF signaling, which occurs in a focal adhesion-dependent manner. Previous studies have, however, not provided evidence for endostatin-induced modulation of major growth factor signaling pathways (36Eriksson K. Magnusson P. Dixelius J. Claesson-Welsh L. Cross M.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Finally, the observed inhibition of tubular morphogenesis in endostatin- and ES-2-treated cells could reflect the loss of directed cell migration. In a recent study four endostatin-derived peptides spanning amino acids 6–178 were used to identify regions of the protein with anti-angiogenic potential (37Chillemi F. Francescato P. Ragg E. Cattaneo M.G. Pola S. Vicentini L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4165-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The study revealed a peptide containing amino acids 6–49 to be capable of inhibiting human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cell proliferation and migration and effective in inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo. No activity was observed for the 42-amino acid peptide covering amino acids 50–92, which contains the sequence for the ES-2 peptide (11 amino acids) used in the current study. Importantly, the study did not assess the ability of these peptides to bind to the endothelial cell surface. The reason for the differences between those results and the current study is unclear at present. However, the report (37Chillemi F. Francescato P. Ragg E. Cattaneo M.G. Pola S. Vicentini L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4165-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) describes aggregation of the relatively long endostatin-derived peptides and suggests that the differences in the secondary structures may result in differences in the activities of the peptides. The observed aggregation could significantly alter the biological properties of the peptides and mask putative intra-peptide cell-binding sites such as in peptide ES-2. In addition, studies using peptide fragments from another basement membrane-derived angiogenesis inhibitor, tumstatin, suggest that the length of the peptide is a critical determinant of biological activity. This is most likely due to differences in secondary structure of peptides of different lengths (38Floquet N. Pasco S. Ramont L. Derreumaux P. Laronze J.Y. Nuzillard J.M. Maquart F.X. Alix A.J. Monboisse J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 2091-2100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the peptides with anti-angiogenic activity (37Chillemi F. Francescato P. Ragg E. Cattaneo M.G. Pola S. Vicentini L. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4165-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) do not contain the specific arginine residues found to be important for the biological activity of endostatin, suggesting that additional novel domains could be involved in the activity of endostatin.

This study identifies tyrosine phosphorylation as an additional mechanism that regulates PKCδ actions in cardiomyocytes. Using immunoblot analysis with antibodies to total PKCδ and PKCδ-pY311, we demonstrate that PKCδ partitions between soluble and particulate fractions (with little Tyr311 phosphorylation) in resting cardiomyocytes.

Both PMA- and H2O2-dependent increases in PKCδ-pY311 are mediated by Src family kinases, but they occur via different mechanisms. The H2O2-dependent increase in PKCδ-pY311 results from Src activation and increased Src-PKCδ complex formation. The PMA-dependent increase in PKCδ-pY311 results from a lipid cofactor-induced conformational change that renders PKCδ a better substrate for phosphorylation by precomplexed Src kinases (without Src activation). PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation does not grossly alter the kinetics of PMA-dependent PKCδ down-regulation. Rather, tyrosine phosphorylation regulates PKCδ kinase activity. PKCδ is recovered from the soluble fraction of H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes as a tyrosine-phosphorylated, lipid-independent enzyme with altered substrate specificity. In vitro PKCδ phosphorylation by Src also increases lipid-independent kinase activity. The magnitude of this effect varies, depending upon the substrate, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation fine-tunes PKCδ substrate specificity.

Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Google Scholar, 2Sabri A. Steinberg S.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 251: 97-101Google Scholar). PKC isoforms are single polypeptide chains with structurally homologous C-terminal catalytic domains and more variable N-terminal regulatory domains. This diverse group of enzymes is subdivided into three distinct subfamilies based upon structural differences in their N-terminal regulatory domain that confer distinct patterns of cofactor activation. Conventional PKC isoforms (cPKCs; α, βI, βII, γ) contain an autoinhibitory pseudo-substrate domain followed by membrane-targeting C1 and C2 domains that are regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium, respectively. Novel PKCs (nPKCs; δ, ϵ, η, and θ) lack a calcium-binding C2 domain and are maximally activated by DAG and phorbol ester, in the absence of calcium. Atypical PKCs (aPKCs; ζ and ι/λ) are regulated by lipids, but are not activated by second messengers such as calcium and DAG. Current models of PKC isoform activation in the heart have focused largely on the conformational changes induced by cofactor interactions with N-terminal membrane-targeting modules that anchor the enzyme to membranes, expel the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain from the substrate-binding pocket, and thereby relieve autoinhibition. According to this model, individual PKC isoforms elicit distinct (and occasionally functionally opposing) cellular responses as a result of cofactor-induced compartmentation to distinct membrane subdomains, in close proximity to their unique sets of target protein substrates (1Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Google Scholar). Recent studies identify an additional mechanism for PKC regulation via sequential phosphorylations on a conserved threonine in the activation loop and two conserved serine/threonines in turn and hydrophobic motifs in the C terminus (3Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Google Scholar). For cPKCs, these phosphorylation events are completed during enzyme maturation (and are critical for the generation of an enzymatically active and conformationally stable protein in the cytosol). In contrast, our recent studies identify dynamically regulated nPKC isoform phosphorylation events that accompany agonist-induced nPKC activation/translocation (and contribute to the regulation of nPKC function) in cardiomyocytes (4Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Google Scholar). Agonist-induced phosphorylation of PKCδ at Thr505 in the activation loop regulates its kinase activity, whereas agonist-induced phosphorylation of PKCϵ at its C-terminal hydrophobic motif influences the kinetics of trafficking/down-regulation. PKC isoforms (in particular PKCδ) also serve as targets for regulatory phosphorylations on tyrosine residues in cells transformed with Src and Ras or acutely stimulated with PMA, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and H2O2 (5Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Google Scholar, 6Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, the precise biological consequences of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation have been difficult to decipher, at least in part because of the presence of multiple sites for independently regulated tyrosine phosphorylations in PKCδ's regulatory domain (Tyr52, Tyr155, and Tyr187), catalytic domain (Tyr512 and Tyr523), and hinge region (Tyr311 and Tyr332). Current literature suggests that there is no uniform pattern or consequence of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation. Rather, the precise configuration of tyrosine residues phosphorylated on PKCδ depends upon the nature of the inciting stimulus and dictates the functional properties of the enzyme in cells. Most studies have relied on in vitro kinase assays to resolve tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent changes in PKCδ function and variably describe the catalytic activity of tyrosine phosphorylated PKCδ as decreased, increased or even altered its substrate specificity and cofactor requirements (5Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Threadgill D.W. Magnuson T. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5325-5331Google Scholar, 6Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, a singular focus on phosphorylation-driven effects for PKCδ may be myopic (or even misplaced), given recent evidence that phosphotyrosines on PKCδ can also serve as docking sites for other signaling proteins (10Song J.S. Swann P.G. Szallasi Z. Blank U. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Google Scholar, 11Leitges M. Gimborn K. Elis W. Kalesnikoff J. Hughes M.R. Krystal G. Huber M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3970-3980Google Scholar) and that the PKCδ role as a signal-regulated scaffold (rather than as an active serine/threonine kinase) may underlie certain of its effector functions (12Goerke A. Sakai N. Gutjahr E. Schlapkohl W.A. Mushinski J.F. Haller H. Kolch W. Saito N. Mischak H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32054-32062Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is a common feature of many cardiovascular risks (including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking) and contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure syndromes (13Sawyer D.B. Siwik D.A. Xiao L. Pimentel D.R. Singh K. Colucci W.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2002; 34: 379-388Google Scholar). There is ample evidence that intracellularly generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exogenously administered hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activate both mitogenic and apoptotic signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes (14von Harsdorf R. Li P.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Google Scholar, 15Kwon S.H. Pimentel D.R. Remondino A. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 615-621Google Scholar). PKCδ is one of several signaling molecules typically activated in this context. However, the precise mechanisms whereby oxidant stress activates PKCδ and the role of PKCδ in ROS triggered structural and functional remodeling of the ventricle has not been examined. This study demonstrates that H2O2 treatment releases PKCδ from membranes and generates a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of PKCδ that exhibits lipid-independent catalytic function (and is poised to phosphorylate distinct PKCδ target proteins throughout the cell, not just on lipid membranes). These results suggest that there are two independent signaling modes for PKCδ, with PKCδ actions/phosphorylations resulting from GPCR activation and the generation of DAG in membranes functionally distinct from the events induced by the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of PKCδ in the soluble fraction of cells exposed to oxidant stress. Materials—Antibodies were from the following sources: PKCδ-pY311 (BioSource); PKCδ-pT505 and Src-pY416 (Cell Signaling Technology); PKCα and PKCϵ (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.); PKCδ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Src (Oncogene), Fyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BD Transduction Laboratories); Lyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Yes (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BD Transduction Laboratories), Phosphotyrosine (Clone 4G10, UBI). Recombinant human PKCδ (rPKCδ) and histone III-S were from Sigma. Active Src kinase was from Panvera. The PKCδ substrate peptide (δ-peptide) and the PKCϵ substrate peptide (ϵ-peptide) were purchased from Calbiochem and UBI, respectively. PMA was from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Cardiomyocyte Culture and Transfection—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure using a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiomyocytes followed by irradiation as described previously (4Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Google Scholar). The yield of cardiomyocytes typically is 2.5-3 × 106 cells per neonatal ventricle. Cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Experiments were performed on cultures grown for 5 days in MEM (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then serum-deprived for the subsequent 24 h. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed on whole cell extracts or soluble and particulate fractions prepared according to methods described previously (16Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Google Scholar, 17Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline and then immediately transferred to ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 48 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm NaF). Cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was saved as the soluble fraction. PKC isoforms were extracted from the pellets by incubation on ice for 10 min in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Electrophoretic separation was performed using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with a panel of antibodies that recognize total PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCϵ protein expression (previously identified as the phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms expressed by cardiomyocyte cultures (16Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Google Scholar, 18Rybin V.O. Buttrick P.M. Steinberg S.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1636-H1642Google Scholar)), PKCδ phosphorylated at the activation loop (anti-PKCδ-pT505), or PKCδ tyrosine-phosphorylated at the hinge region (anti-PKCδ-pY311). The specificity of the anti-PKC antibodies was established previously (4Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Google Scholar, 19Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 388-398Google Scholar); the specificity of all anti-phospho-PKC antibodies was validated in control experiments showing that anti-phospho-PKC immunoreactivity is stripped by treatment of samples with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown) and is down-regulated along with PMA-dependent down-regulation of the cognate protein (4Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Google Scholar). Bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, with each panel in each figure from a single gel exposed for a uniform duration. Immunoprecipitation and Immune Complex PKCδ Kinase Assays— Following incubation with compounds indicated in the figures, cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 5.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2% Triton X-100). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 1,500 × g. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant from five 100-mm dishes was incubated with 5 μg of anti-PKCδ antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by addition of 200 μl of protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed two times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 150 mm NaCl) and suspended in 1.15 ml of storage buffer (18 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1.8 mm EDTA, 1.8 mm EGTA, 0.45 mm DTT, 225 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitates (equivalent to the amount of protein extracted from 0.3 × 100-mm dish per assay) were used in immunocomplex kinase assays carried out in 200 μl of a reaction mixture containing buffer (26 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm EGTA, 0.6 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm PKI, 10 μm PP1, and 0.25 mm DTT) in the absence and presence of 80 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS) plus 160 ng/ml PMA with histone III-S (0.5 mg/ml), PKC-ϵ-peptide (50 μm) or PKC-δ-peptide (50 μm) as substrate. PKC-ϵ-peptide is a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the pseudosubstrate domain of PKCϵ, with a phosphorylatable serine for alanine substitution (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV); this peptide can serve as a good substrate for all PKCs except PKCμ (20Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Google Scholar). PKC-δ-peptide (which corresponds to amino acids 422-443 of murine eEF-1α, RFAVRDMRQTVAVGVIKAVDKK) is a relatively specific substrate for PKCδ (and not other PKC isoforms, Ref. 20Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Google Scholar). Of note, we previously established that the phosphorylation of δ- and ϵ-peptide (which do not contain tyrosines) or histone is mediated by PKC (rather than another co-immunoprecipitating kinase); all phosphorylations are completely inhibited by the addition of 5 μm GF109203X to the in vitro kinase assay buffer (4Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition [γ-32P]ATP (13 μCi, 66 μm) and were performed in quadruplicate at 30 °C for 16 min. Assays were terminated by placing samples on ice followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 40 μl of each supernatant was spotted onto phosphocellulose filter papers (P-81). Each P-81 disc was immediately dropped into water, washed (five times for 5 min), and counted for radioactivity. Pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for PKCδ, to normalize for minor differences in the amount of immunoprecipitated enzyme. In Vitro Phosphorylation of PKCδ by Src—0.1 μg of recombinant human PKCδ (rPKCδ) was preincubated in the absence or presence of Src kinase (0.66 units) in 160 μl of a reaction buffer containing 43 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.75 mm EDTA, 0.77 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm DTT, 125 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.006% Brij-35, 0.04 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, and [γ-32P]ATP (13 μCi, 83 μm). Incubations were for 15 min at 30 °C and were stopped by placing samples on ice. PKC substrates were then added, and kinase assays were carried out (in a final volume of 200 μl) in the absence or presence of PS/PMA as described above. Triplicate 10-μl aliquots of each sample were spotted onto phosphocellulose filter paper (P-81), dropped into water, washed (5× for 5 min), and counted for radioactivity. The remainder of the sample (0.07 μg of PKCδ) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for P-Y or PKCδ-pY311. Distinct Effects of H2O2, PMA, and Norepinephrine on PKCδ Translocation and Phosphorylation in Cardiomyocytes—Immunoprecipitation of PKCδ followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-YP was used as a screen for PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation by the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist norepinephrine (NE), PMA, and H2O2. Fig. 1A shows that there is a low level of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in quiescent cultures and that PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation is increased in cultures treated with NE, PMA, and H2O2. The magnitude of the NE-dependent increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation is relatively modest. In contrast, PMA and H2O2 induce substantial increases in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, with the effect of H2O2 considerably greater than the effect of PMA. To begin to resolve an agonist-dependent difference in the level of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation at a single site from stimulus-specific differences in the number/identity of sites on PKCδ that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation, immunoblot analysis was performed with an antibody that selectively recognizes PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr311. We focused on this tyrosine (in the hinge region, between the cysteine-rich and kinase domains) because it has been identified as a major site for tyrosine phosphorylation in cells treated with H2O2, it is flanked by sequence that conforms to an optimal Src substrate (and is reported to be a target for Src-dependent phosphorylation), and it represents a modification that reportedly alters PKCδ kinase activity and accelerates its down-regulation kinetics (6Konishi H.

Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 231-241Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation is increased by PMA and (to a somewhat greater extent) by H2O2, but not by NE. Cardiomyocyte cultures were partitioned into soluble and particulate fractions prior to immunoblot analysis to determine whether PKC isoforms (including the Tyr311-phosphorylated form of PKCδ) reside in distinct subcellular locations following stimulation with PMA and H2O2. Fig. 1B shows that PKCδ protein partitions between the soluble and particulate fractions of resting cardiomyocytes. Stimulation with PMA leads to the translocation of PKCδ to the particulate fraction and a decline in its mobility in SDS-PAGE, characteristic of a phosphorylation-induced change in electrophoretic mobility. In contrast, H2O2 promotes a marked redistribution of PKCδ from the particulate to the soluble fraction without changing its electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE. PKCϵ also partitions between the soluble and particulate fractions of resting cardiomyocytes and translocates to the particulate fraction upon activation with PMA. Whereas H2O2 promotes the redistribution of PKCϵ to the soluble fraction, the magnitude of this effect is relatively modest compared with the H2O2 effect on PKCδ. In contrast, PKCα resides mainly in the soluble fraction of resting cardiomyocytes and is recovered in the particulate fraction of PMA-treated cardiomyocytes; PKCα partitioning between soluble and particulate fractions is not appreciably altered by H2O2. PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation is detected at very low levels (and only in the particulate fraction) in resting cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1B). Stimulation with PMA leads to a large increase in particulate PKCδ-pY311 (in association with the PMA-induced translocation of PKCδ to membranes). PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation also is markedly increased in cells treated with H2O2. However, under this condition PKCδ-pY311 is detected in both soluble and particulate fractions. This and subsequent experiments in this study report the cellular response to 5 mm H2O2; increased amounts of Tyr311-phosphorylated PKCδ also are recovered from cardiomyocytes subjected to lower levels of oxidant stress (100-500 μm, data not shown). Interestingly, both H2O2 and PMA promote PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation, but only PMA slows the mobility of PKCδ in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B; also see Figs. 2 and 4). This result suggests that the electrophoretic mobility of PKCδ is not influenced by phosphorylation at Tyr311; rather the PMA-induced mobility shift must derive from a phosphorylation at a site distinct from Tyr311. We recently demonstrated that PKCδ is phosphorylated at the turn motif (Ser643) and hydrophobic motif (Ser662) sites, but not at the activation loop (Thr505) site, in resting cultures and that phosphorylation at Thr505 (but not Ser643 or Ser662) increases during stimulation with PMA (4Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Google Scholar). Similarly, Fig. 1B shows that PKCδ is not detectably phosphorylated at Thr505 in resting cultures. PMA (which slows PKCδ mobility in SDS-PAGE) promotes PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505, whereas H2O2 (which does not alter the mobility of PKCδ) does not. H2O2 also does not induce any change in PKCδ phosphorylation at Ser643 or Ser662 in the C terminus (data not shown). These results suggest that PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505 (or another site that becomes phosphorylated in parallel in cells treated with PMA, but not H2O2) slows the mobility of PKCδ in SDS-PAGE; the mobility of PKCδ is not appreciably altered by tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, Fig. 1C shows that NE does not promote PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation at any time point, under conditions where an effect of NE to induce PKCδ-T505 phosphorylation is readily detected. Collectively, these results identify distinct phosphorylation profiles for PKCδ in cardiomyocytes stimulated with PMA, H2O2, and NE. All three agonists promote PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation, but only PMA and H2O2 promote tyrosine phosphorylation at Tyr311. PKCδ is localized to the particulate fraction, and phosphorylated at both Tyr311 and Thr505, in cardiomyocytes treated with PMA. In contrast, PKCδ distributes between the soluble and particulate fractions and is phosphorylated at Tyr311 (but not Thr505) in cardiomyocytes treated with H2O2. Whereas immunoreactivity for PKCδ-pY311 is slightly greater in H2O2-treated cardiomyocyte cultures, than in the PMA-treated cultures studied in parallel, this difference can not account for the considerably higher overall level of PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-treated cultures. This result suggests that PKCδ phosphorylation in H2O2-treated cultures is at Tyr311 as well as at other tyrosine residues.Fig. 4PMA- and H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation requires intact Src kinase activity. Cardiomyocytes were pretreated for 45 min with vehicle, PP1 (10 μm, panels A and C), AG1478 (2 μm, panel B), or GF109203X (5 μm, panel B) and then incubated for an additional 10 min with vehicle, 100 nm PMA, or 5 mm H2O2; H2O2 incubation for 5 min also is included in panel A. Panels A and B, extracts were partitioned into soluble and particulate fractions and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ-pY311 and anti-PKCδ (to normalize for total PKCδ protein). Panel C, whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCδ followed by immunoblot analysis for PKCδ-pY and total PKCδ protein. All results are representative of data obtained in 3-5 separate experiments on separate culture preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To better understand agonist-induced compartmentation of PKCδ, we studied the kinetics of agonist-induced PKCδ translocation and Tyr311 phosphorylation in greater detail (Fig. 2). The H2O2-induced release of PKCδ from membranes (and translocation to the soluble fraction) is quite rapid (detectable within the first min, and maximal by 2 min); PKCδ recovery in the soluble fractions remains increased for at least 30 min of H2O2 stimulation. PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation accompanies the translocation to the soluble fraction. PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation is detected within the first 1-2 min and increases progressively (in both the soluble and particulate fractions) during the first 30 min of H2O2 treatment. Of note, PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation increases progressively in the particulate fraction, despite a dwindling amount of PKCδ protein recovery. PMA-induced PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation also follows rapid kinetics (Fig. 2B), with both PKCδ translocation to the particulate fraction and PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation being maximal at 5 min (the first time point sampled). PMA-induced PKCδ-Y311 phosphorylation is sustained for up to 5 h, declining in parallel with the PMA-induced down-regulation of the protein. Most cardiac disorders are characterized by the simultaneous activation of hormone/neurotransmitter receptors coupled to lipid signaling (and the generation of cofactors that anchor PKC to membranes) as well as variable amounts of oxidant stress. To determine whether the H2O2-dependent release of PKCδ from membranes competes with the PMA-dependent translocation of PKCδ to membranes, PKCδ localization and phosphorylation were compared in cardiomyocytes exposed to H2O2 or PMA alone, versus PMA in the presence of H2O2. Fig. 3 shows that H2O2 alone promotes the release of PKCδ from membranes, whereas PMA alone effectively clears PKCδ from the soluble fraction. However, PMA-dependent translocation of PKCδ to the particulate fraction is attenuated by H2O2, illustrating the dynamic convergence of these signals. Although PMA-dependent phosphorylation of PKCδ at Thr505 proceeds unhindered in the membrane f"

Recently, it was demonstrated that complex I from Klebsiella pneumoniae translocates sodium ions instead of protons. Experimental evidence suggested that complex I from the close relative Escherichia coli works as a primary sodium pump as well. However, data obtained with whole cells showed the presence of an NADH-induced electrochemical proton gradient. In addition, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy demonstrated that the redox reaction of the E. coli complex I is coupled to a protonation of amino acids. To resolve this contradiction we measured the properties of isolated E. coli complex I reconstituted in phospholipids. We found that the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity did not depend on the sodium concentration. The redox reaction of the complex in proteoliposomes caused a membrane potential due to an electrochemical proton gradient as measured with fluorescent probes. The signals were sensitive to the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), the inhibitors piericidin A, dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide (DCCD), and amiloride derivatives, but were insensitive to the sodium ionophore ETH-157. Furthermore, monensin acting as a Na+/H+ exchanger prevented the generation of a proton gradient. Thus, our data demonstrated that the E. coli complex I is a primary electrogenic proton pump. However, the magnitude of the pH gradient depended on the sodium concentration. The capability of complex I for secondary Na+/H+ antiport is discussed.

Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Google Scholar). The bacterial complex consists, in general, of 14 different subunits named NuoA to NuoN. Seven peripheral subunits bear all known redox groups of the complex, namely one FMN and up to nine iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters. The remaining seven subunits are mostly hydrophobic proteins predicted to fold into 54 α-helices across the membrane (4Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Google Scholar). These hydrophobic subunits do not contain a conserved sequence motif for the binding of a cofactor, nor has a cofactor been identified in these subunits as yet. However, because of their location within the membrane, they should be involved in proton translocation. The 14 subunits present in bacteria are called the minimal subunits because their homologues are found in the complex I of all species investigated as yet (2Walker J.E. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1992; 25: 253-324Google Scholar, 4Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Google Scholar, 5Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Theoret. Biol. 1997; 187: 529-541Google Scholar). They comprise the minimal structural and functional framework for redox-driven proton translocation in complex I. In addition to the homologues of the 14 minimal subunits the mitochondrial complex I of eukaryotes contains at least 32 extra proteins but no additional redox groups (6Hirst J. Carroll J. Fearnley I.M. Shannon R.J. Walker J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 135-150Google Scholar). It has been shown that both the bacterial and the mitochondrial complex I have a proton to electron stoichiometry of 4H+/2e– (7Wikström M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 300-304Google Scholar, 8Brown C.G.

Until recently it was believed that complex I works exclusively as a proton pump. It has been elegantly demonstrated that the Klebsiella pneumoniae complex I acts as a Na+ pump, with a stoichiometry of 2Na+/2e– (12Krebs W. Steuber J. Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 590-598Google Scholar, 13Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Google Scholar, 14Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 839-844Google Scholar). It was also shown that the K. pneumoniae complex I is not capable of proton translocation (14Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 839-844Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence disclosed that complex I from Escherichia coli, a close relative of K. pneumoniae, acts as a sodium pump as well (15Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 428-434Google Scholar, 16Steuber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1505: 45-56Google Scholar). This proposal is based on experiments with the E. coli strain EP432 lacking the antiporter genes nhaA and nhaB, which leads to an inability to grow under elevated Na+ concentrations (17Harel-Brönstein M. Dibrov P. Olami Y. Pinner E. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3816-3822Google Scholar). However, growth on glycerol and fumarate enabled growth of strain EP432 at about 450 mm NaCl (15Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 428-434Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the expression of the nuo genes coding for the subunits of complex I is 2-fold increased (18Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Google Scholar, 19Bongaerts J. Zoske S. Weidner U. Unden G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 521-534Google Scholar). Inverted membrane vesicles catalyzed NADH-driven Na+ uptake, which was not cancelled by addition of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, Sigma) but by the addition of rotenone, a specific complex I inhibitor (15Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 428-434Google Scholar). It was also shown that the overproduced subunit NuoL of the E. coli complex I mediates Na+ uptake when reconstituted into proteoliposomes (20Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26817-26822Google Scholar). This transport was inhibited by the addition of EIPA, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiporters (21Young-Mog K. Tachibana Y. Shimamoto T. Shimamoto T. Tsuchiya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 147-149Google Scholar). However, data obtained with E. coli wild-type cells and membrane vesicles indicated the presence of an NADH-induced proton gradient (10Bogachev A.V. Murtazina R.A. Skulachev V.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6233-6237Google Scholar, 22Reenstra W.W. Patel L. Rottenberg H. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1-9Google Scholar, 23Matsushita K. Ohnishi T. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Google Scholar). In addition, FT-IR spectroscopy has shown that the redox reaction of the E. coli complex I is associated with the protonation of tyrosines and acidic amino acids (24Hellwig P. Scheide D. Bungert S. Mäntele W. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10884-10891Google Scholar, 25Flemming D. Hellwig P. Friedrich T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3055-3062Google Scholar). As activity measured in whole cells and membrane vesicles are sometimes hard to assign, we reconstituted the isolated E. coli complex I in proteoliposomes, measured the effect of Na+ ions on enzyme activity, and determined the type of cation responsible for the electrochemical gradient generated by the redox reaction of complex I. Our data showed that the E. coli complex I is a primary proton pump but may be capable of secondary H+/Na+ antiport. Isolation of Complex I—E. coli complex I was isolated from the overproducing strain ANN003/pAR1219 similar to the procedure described (26Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Google Scholar) but treatment of the membranes with NaBr was omitted. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. 55 g of cells were resuspended in the 5-fold volume 50 mm MES/NaOH, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.0, with 10 μg/ml DNase I and 50 μg/ml lysozyme and disrupted by a single pass through a French Pressure cell (SLM Aminco) at 110 mega Pascal units. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 36,000 × g, and cytoplasmic membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 250,000 × g for 1 h. The membranes were resuspended in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.0 at a concentration of 80 mg/ml. Dodecyl maltoside (Glycon) was added to a final concentration of 3%, and the solution was gently homogenized and centrifuged for 20 min at 250,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to an 80-ml Source 15Q (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0. The column was eluted with a 700-ml linear gradient of 50–350 mm NaCl in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0 at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions containing NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were combined, concentrated by precipitation with 9% (w/v; final concentration) polyethylene glycol 4,000, and dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0. The proteins were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a 450-ml Sephacryl S-300HR (Amersham Biosciences) column in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0, at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. Peak fractions of NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity were pooled and stored at –80 °C. Reconstitution of Complex I—To determine the most suitable lipid for reconstitution experiments we examined the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I in the presence of soybean l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma), egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid), E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti), and total lipid extract (Avanti). Lipids (30 mg/ml) were dissolved in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, pH 6.0 by sonication in five intervals of 20 s at 80% output level with a microtip (Branson sonifier). The suspensions were diluted to 3 mg/ml in the same buffer and either directly added to the assay or mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with complex I (1 mg/ml) and incubated for 20 min on ice before addition to the assay. Complex I was reconstituted in proteoliposomes by the BioBeads (Bio-Rad) method (27Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Google Scholar). 80 mg of E. coli polar lipid extract (Avanti) were suspended in 4 ml of 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, and 800 μl of 20% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside were added. The lipids were dissolved by sonication of the suspension in five intervals of 20 s at 80% output level with a microtip (Branson sonifier). Complex I (2 mg/ml) and the lipid solution were mixed in a 1:4 (w/w) ratio. BioBeads with a capacity of absorbing 105 mg of dodecyl maltoside per g of beads (28Rigaud J.L. Mosser G. Lacapere J.J. Olofsson A. Levy D. Ranck J.L. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 118: 226-235Google Scholar) were added at an 8-fold excess. The mixture was stirred for 3 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 × g (Beckmann Airfuge) after separation of the beads. The sediment was resuspended in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. Various Na+ concentrations in the assay were obtained by dialyzing complex I overnight against the desired buffer at 4 °C. In these cases the lipids and the proteoliposomes were resuspended in the corresponding buffer. Determination of Complex I Activity—The NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of complex I was measured with a Perkin Elmer 156 dual-wavelength spectrophotometer at 340 and 400 nm using an ϵ of 6.3 mm–1 cm–1 in a final volume of 1 ml (29Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G Reichenbach H. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Google Scholar). To obtain various Na+ concentrations in the assay, the E. coli polar lipid extract (30 mg/ml) was suspended in the desired buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside. The enzyme (20 mg/ml) was dialyzed for 16 h against 50 mm MES/LiOH, 100 mm LiCl, pH 6.0 at 4 °C, mixed in 1:1 (v/v) ratio with the lipid and incubated for 20 min on ice. 3 μl of this mixture were incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the assay buffer (50 mm MES/LiOH, 100 mm LiCl, pH 6.0). The Na+ concentration of the buffer was varied from 25 μm to 100 mm by adding the corresponding amount of 50 mm MES/LiOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. 50 μm decyl-ubiquinone was added to the assay, and the reaction was started by addition of 50 μm NADH (potassium salt, Sigma). The sodium content of the assay buffer was determined by Christine Höher, Institut für Mineralogie, Petrologie und Geochemie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg by atomic absorption spectroscopy. For inhibitor titrations of the isolated and reconstituted E. coli complex I an ethanolic solution of 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) and an aqueous solution of benzamil (both from Sigma) was added to the assay. The samples were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with inhibitors in the enzyme assay. Measurements were performed either in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0 or 50 mm MES/KOH, 100 mm KCl, pH 6.0. The final ethanol concentration was kept constant in each enzyme assay and did not exceed 2%. Determination of a Membrane Potential (Δψ)—The generation of Δψ by complex I was monitored with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid (ANS, Sigma; Ref. 30Ahmed I. Krishnamoorthy G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 131-138Google Scholar) at various NaCl concentrations. The ionic strength of the assay buffer was kept constant by adding the corresponding amount of tetramethylammonium chloride (TMA). The respective ion concentrations are given in the figure legends. 3 μl of proteoliposomes, 1 μm ANS, and 50 μm decyl-ubiquinone were added to the assay buffer (5 mm MES/KOH, 80–x mm NaCl, x mm TMA, pH 6.0) and preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction was started by addition of 50 μm NADH (Gerbu) in a final volume of 1 ml. The increase of ANS fluorescence caused by the generation of Δψ was followed with an SFM 25 spectrofluorometer (Kontron), using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. When desired, the proton ionophore CCCP, the Na+-specific ionophore N,N′-dibenzyl-N,N′-diphenyl-1,2-phenylene diacetamide (ETH-157, Fluka; Ref. 31Simon W. Carafoli E. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 439-448Google Scholar), and the specific complex I inhibitor piericidin A were added to a final concentration of 10 μm, respectively. Determination of a Proton Gradient (ΔpH)—The generation of a proton gradient caused by the redox reaction of complex I was determined by quenching of the fluorescence of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA, Sigma; Ref. 32Kaim G. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 937-944Google Scholar). 3 μl of proteoliposomes, 1 μm ACMA, and 50 μm decyl-ubiquinone were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in the assay buffer (5 mm MES/KOH, 80–x mm NaCl, x mm TMA, pH 6.0) in 1 ml final volume. The respective ion concentrations are given in the figure legends. The fluorescence was detected with a SFM 25 spectrofluorometer (Kontron), using an excitation wavelength of 410 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. The reaction was started by addition of 50 μm NADH (Gerbu). When desired CCCP, piericidin A, and the Na+/H+ exchanger monensin (Sigma, Ref. 33Pressman B.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 501-530Google Scholar) were added at a final concentration of 10 μm, respectively. The proton specificity of ACMA was determined using liposomes without enzyme in 5 mm MES/NaOH, 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. 1 μm ACMA was added to the liposomes, and the fluorescence change was detected after addition of either 20 mm NaCl or 20 mm HCl. Effect of Dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide (DCCD)—The effect of DCCD on the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of complex I and its ability to generate a membrane potential and a proton gradient was measured as described above. Complex I reconstituted in phospholipids was incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with various amounts from a 0.1 m DCCD (Sigma) stock solution in ethanol. The final ethanol concentration was kept constant and did not exceed 1% (v/v). After incubation the enzyme was immediately used for NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity measurement in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. Addition of 10 μm CCCP had no effect on the measurement. Complex I reconstituted into proteoliposomes was incubated for 10 min with 0.3 mm DCCD final concentration at room temperature and immediately used for measurements in 5 mm MES/KOH, 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. Prolongation of the incubation time had no effect. Other Analytical Assays—NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity was measured at room temperature with an Ultrospec 1000 (Amersham Biosciences) spectrophotometer at 410 nm in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.0 using an ϵ of 1 mm–1 cm–1 (34Friedrich T. Hofhaus G. Ise W. Nehls U Schmitz B. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 173-180Google Scholar). The reaction was started with 0.1 mm NADH. Protein concentrations were determined according to the biuret method. Purification of Complex I—Our standard purification method was modified to circumvent the washing of the membranes with NaBr, which led to an incubation of complex I with 1.4 m Na+ (26Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Google Scholar). Complex I was extracted from the membranes with 3% dodecyl maltoside and eluted by anion exchange chromatography on Source 15Q at 280 mm NaCl. The final size-exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 showed a homogenous peak coeluting with the complex I activity (Fig. 1). Residual traces of ATP synthase were present in the late fractions of the peak. These fractions were discarded. The molecular mass of the preparation was estimated by comparison of the elution volume with standards of known molecular mass to 600,000 Da. Upon SDS/PAGE the preparation was resolved into 12 subunits corresponding to the proteins encoded by the nuo operon (Fig. 1; Refs. 26Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Google Scholar, 35Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar, and 36Sazanov L.A. Carroll J. Holt P. Toime L. Fearnley I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19483-19491Google Scholar). The subunits NuoE and J were not separated by SDS-PAGE as reported previously (26Spehr V. Schlitt A. Scheide D. Guénebaut V. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16261-16267Google Scholar, 35Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Google Scholar). Approximately 25 mg of complex I were obtained from 55 g of cells (Table I).Table IIsolation of E. coli complex I from 55 g of wet cells of strain ANN003/pAR1219VolumeProteinNADH/ferricyanide reductase activityYieldTotalSpecificmlmgμmol min-1μmol min-1 mg-1%Membranes64260082003.2100Extract57150065004.379Source 15Q267823003028Sephacryl S-300182512004815 Open table in a new tab Effect of Phospholipids on Enzymatic Activity—To choose a convenient lipid for the reconstitution of the E. coli complex I, the effect of soybean l-α-phosphatidylcholine, egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine, and E. coli polar and total lipid extracts on the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone reductase activity was examined (Table II). Addition of soybean l-α-phosphatidylcholine and E. coli polar lipid extract to the enzyme assay doubled the enzymatic activity, whereas addition of the other lipids had only a minor effect. However, the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity was increased 7–8-fold after a 20-min incubation of the enzyme with the lipids (Table II). Again, soybean l-α-phosphatidylcholine and E. coli polar lipid extract showed the strongest activation of the complex. Further experiments were therefore performed with E. coli polar lipid extract, and activity of the isolated complex was measured after 20 min of incubation with lipids.Table IISpecific NADH:decyl-ubiquinone reductase activity of complex I in the presence of various phospholipidsPhospholipidDirect applicationIncubation with phospholipidsSpecific activityActivationSpecific activityActivationμmol/(min·mg)%μmol/(min·mg)%Without0.30-0.30-Phosphatidylcholine (soybean)0.661192.77824Polar lipid extract (E. coli)0.611032.81837Total lipid extract (E. coli)0.45562.31670Phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk)0.38272.64780 Open table in a new tab Effect of the Sodium Concentration on the Enzymatic Activity—The electron transfer activity of the Na+-translocating complex I from K. pneumoniae and the Na+-translocating NQR from Vibrio cholerae strongly depend on the Na+ concentration (13Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Google Scholar, 37Barquera B. Hellwig P. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Hase C.C. Gosink K.K. Nilges M. Bruesehoff P.J. Roth A. Lancaster C.R. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3781-3789Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the influence of Na+ concentration on the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of the E. coli complex I. The activity was measured with complex I reconstituted in E. coli polar lipids in 50 mm MES/LiOH, 100 mm LiCl, pH 6.0 as described above. The Na+ concentration of the buffer was varied from 25 μm to 100 mm by adding the corresponding amount of 50 mm MES/LiOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. Under the chosen conditions, the average activity of ∼5.4 μmol of NADH/min·mg was determined. The highest activity was measured around 80 μm Na+ (Fig. 2). Unlike Na+-dependent enzymes, the average activity of complex I did not increase by raising the Na+ concentration from 100 μm to 100 mm. The NADH:decyl-ubiquinone reductase activity was 95% inhibited by 10 μm piericidin A, showing that the physiological activity of the complex was measured. Reconstitution of Complex I in Proteoliposomes—Isolated complex I was reconstituted in proteoliposomes by the BioBeads method (27Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Google Scholar). The best results were achieved with E. coli polar lipid extract in a 4:1 (w/w) ratio with complex I. BioBeads were added at an 8-fold excess, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The vesicles were sedimented by ultracentrifugation and carefully resuspended in 50 mm MES/NaOH, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. The tightness of the proteoliposomes was confirmed by application of a potassium/valinomycin diffusion potential (data not shown). The orientation of complex I in the liposomes was determined by measuring the NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity before and after addition of 0.05% (w/v, final concentration) dodecyl maltoside. Addition of detergent led to a 50% increase of the NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity indicating that two-thirds of the complex was incorporated in the proteoliposomes so that the NADH binding site was accessible. Approximately 80–90% of complex I was found to be incorporated judging by the total NADH/ferricyanide reductase activity. The complex reconstituted in vesicles showed a specific NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of 5.5 μmol/min·mg in the presence of 50 μm NADH, 50 μm decyl-ubiquinone, and 10 μm CCCP. Determination of Δψ—The membrane potential arising from the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity of complex I reconstituted in proteoliposomes was monitored with ANS in 5 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.0, and 80 mm NaCl. Addition of NADH to the proteoliposomes incubated with decyl-ubiquinone and ANS showed a 90% enhanced fluorescence signal (Fig. 3). Thus, complex I reconstituted in proteoliposomes generated a membrane potential. This membrane potential was due to the redox reaction of complex I as the signal was completely cancelled by addition of piericidin A, a specific complex I inhibitor (Fig. 3). Addition of an equal volume of ethanol had no effect on the signal. The ANS fluorescence signal was completely sensitive to the protonophore CCCP indicating that the membrane potential is established as an electrochemical proton gradient (Fig. 3). In contrast, the Na+-specific ionophore ETH-157 had no effect on the fluorescence signal, indicating that there was no contribution to the membrane potential from a primary NADH-induced Na+ gradient (Fig. 3). Determination of ΔpH—The sensitivity of the membrane potential generated by the E. coli complex I to the protonophore CCCP indicated the presence of a proton gradient. We determined the presence of a pH gradient directly by using the fluorophore ACMA. The specificity of ACMA to protons was determined by addition of either HCl or NaCl to liposomes without enzyme. While HCl caused a 70% rise in fluorescence, NaCl had no effect on the fluorescent signal (data not shown). Addition of NADH to the proteoliposomes incubated with decylubiquinone and ACMA showed a 40% quenched fluorescence signal (Fig. 4). The ACMA fluorescence signal was completely sensitive both to the preincubation and the addition of the protonophore CCCP demonstrating that it was generated by a proton gradient (Fig. 4). The ACMA signal was also sensitive to the Na+/H+ exchanger monensin again showing the presence of a proton gradient. The ACMA signal was completely cancelled by adding piericidin A. Addition of an equal volume ethanol had no effect on the signal. This demonstrated that the E. coli complex I is a primary proton pump. Effect of DCCD on E. coli Complex I—It is well known that DCCD simultaneously inhibits electron transfer and proton translocation of the mitochondrial complex I (38Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2822-2828Google Scholar, 39Hassinen I.E. Vuokila P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 107-124Google Scholar). To examine whether the same holds true for the bacterial complex I, we titrated the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone reductase activity of the isolated complex I with DCCD (Fig. 5). DCCD inhibited 90% of the enzyme acitivity with an apparent IC50 of 0.25 mm, which was comparable to the value reported for the mitochondrial enzyme (38Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2822-2828Google Scholar, 39Hassinen I.E. Vuokila P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 107-124Google Scholar). Incubation of complex I proteoliposomes with DCCD completely prohibited the generation of a membrane potential and a pH gradient (Fig. 5). Effect of Sodium Concentration on the ΔpH—It has been reported that the overproduced and isolated subunit NuoL facilitates Na+ transport across the membrane (20Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26817-26822Google Scholar, 40Mathiesen C. On the Antiporter-like Subunits of Respiratory Chain Complex I. University of Lund, Sweden2003Google Scholar). 2C. Hägerhall, personal communication. Devoid of the residual complex I subunits, NuoL is capable of mediating a passive Na+ uptake along a concentration gradient, which coincides with an increased proton permeability of the vesicles. This is interpreted in terms of an H+/Na+ antiport (20Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26817-26822Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the question, whether this is an intrinsic property of NuoL assembled in the complex I as well. Complex I was reconstituted in proteoliposomes in 80 mm NaCl and was added to an ACMA assay in 5 mm MES/KOH, 1 mm NaCl, 79 mm TMA, pH 6.0 without addition of decyl-ubiquinone and NADH. If NuoL assembled in complex I was capable of a Na+ gradient-driven Na+/H+ antiport,"

Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Google Scholar). The ECM provides a substrate for cell migration during embryonic development and wound healing, regulating tissue architecture and morphogenesis (2Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Google Scholar), and is also signaling variations in the cell microenvironment affecting cell proliferation, differentiation, and death (3McDonald J.A. Annu. Rev.

Collagens (COLLs) and fibronectin (FN) are major ECM protein components (1Aumailley M. Gayraud B. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 253-265Google Scholar, 8Mosher D.F. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Physiol. 2001; 189: 1-13Google Scholar). COLLs, the most abundant proteins of connective tissues, are formed by three polypeptide chains, synthesized as propeptide (pro-α chains), coiled into triple helices, and encoded by the same or different genes (11Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Google Scholar). Types I, III, V, and XI COLLs are organized in fibrillar structures and are therefore referred to as fibrillar COLLs. In particular, COLLIII is an α1(III)3 homotrimer encoded by the COL3A1 gene and is mainly distributed in skin, tendon, aorta, and cornea (12Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders: Molecular Genetics and Medical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar), whereas COLLV is a quantitatively minor fibrillar COLL with a broad tissue distribution that regulates COLLI fibrillogenesis (13Birk D.E. Micron. 2001; 32: 223-237Google Scholar). COLLV molecules may contain α1(V), α2(V) and α3(V) or α1(V)2α2(V) chains (13Birk D.E. Micron. 2001; 32: 223-237Google Scholar). Mutations in COLLs are related to a variety of hereditary connective tissue disorders one of which is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a group of heterogeneous diseases (at least 11 types) caused by alterations in different COLL genes, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, and COL5A2 (14Steinmann B.

Many data indicate the interdependence of FN and COLL network assembly; in particular, in several cell systems, the assembly of COLLs has been shown to depend on FN organization (3McDonald J.A. Annu.

The αvβ3 integrin, highly expressed by dermal fibroblasts in cutaneous wound repair, supports their migration in the provisional matrix (36Gailit J. Clark R.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 102-108Google Scholar, 37Feng X. Clark R.A.F. Galanakis D. Tonnesen M.G. J. Investig.

Another receptor binding either to FN or VN in cultured fibroblasts is the αvβ5 integrin (39Wayner E.A. Orlando R.A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 919-929Google Scholar, 40Retta S.F.

We have previously demonstrated that all types of EDS fibroblasts (EDSI to EDSVII) do not organize the FN-ECM in vitro and express low levels of FN and of α5β1 FNR integrin, compared with control fibroblasts (41Barlati S. Moro L. Gardella R. Colombi M. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 1183-1194Google Scholar, 42Moro L. Colombi M. Zoppi N. Ghinelli A. Barlati S. Cell Biol. Int. 1994; 18: 29-37Google Scholar, 43Zoppi N. Ghinelli A. Gardella R. Barlati S. Colombi M. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 499-508Google Scholar). We report that EDSI and EDSIV skin fibroblasts, which carry mutations in COL5A1 and COL3A1 genes, respectively, do not organize the altered COLL molecules they encode in the ECM and show a reduced organization of α2β1 integrin. This event is associated with the lack of the FN-ECM, the high reduction of α5β1 FNR, and the prevalent organization of αvβ3 integrin. Treatment with purified COLLV or COLLIII, but not with FN, induces a control phenotype in both EDS fibroblasts, whereas perturbation experiments of COLLV and COLLIII or of the α2β1 integrin receptor with specific antibodies induces an EDS phenotype in control fibroblasts. This evidence shows that perturbation of specific COLLs, either by mutation or by their functional blocking, leads to a cascade of alterations involving through their receptor other ECM components such as FN and its receptors. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Human control skin fibroblasts were established in our laboratory from an arm biopsy from an 18-year-old healthy donor. Types I and IV EDS fibroblasts strains were established and characterized for missense dominant mutations in the gene coding for the α1 chain of COLLV (44De Paepe A. Nuytinck L. Hausser I. Anton-Lamprecht I. Naeyaert J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 547-554Google Scholar) and in the gene for the α1 chain of COLLIII (22Colvin R.B. Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1989: 213-254Google Scholar), respectively. Two other EDS fibroblast strains were also analyzed: type I EDS (ATCC CRL 1215 JS) (43Zoppi N. Ghinelli A. Gardella R. Barlati S. Colombi M. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 499-508Google Scholar), type IV EDS (ATCC CRL 1243 CP). All cell strains, used at similar in vitro passages (4Giancotti F.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Google Scholar, 5Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Google Scholar, 6Streuli C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 634-640Google Scholar), were grown in vitro at 37 °C in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Polyclonal anti-FN Ab was provided by Sigma Aldrich; anti-α5β1 (clones JBS5 and HA5), anti-αvβ3 (clone LM609), anti-α2β1 (clone BHA.2) integrin mAbs, polyclonal anti-COLLI, anti-COLLIII, and anti-COLLV Abs, purified human COLLIII and COLLV were from Chemicon Int. Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-α2 integrin subunit serum was kindly donated by F. S. Retta (Turin). FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary Abs were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem INTL. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG, BSA, and purified mouse IgG were from Sigma Chemical Co. Cell Adhesion, Migration, and Proliferation—To study the adhesive properties of control and EDS fibroblasts, the cells were seeded on tissue culture wells not coated or coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml human pFN (New York Blood Center Inc.), VN, or polylysine (Sigma Chemical Co.) and blocked for 60 min at 37 °C by the addition of 1% BSA in PBS. 2 × 103 cells were detached using 500 μg/ml trypsin and 200 μg/ml EDTA. Trypsin activity was inhibited by washing the cells with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells in the presence of serum-free medium were allowed to adhere in the absence and in the presence of FN for 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C. Adhered cells were stained with crystal violet in 20% methanol and counted with a light microscope. The reported values are means ± S.D. of three independent measurements. The in vitro migration potential of control and EDS cells was analyzed in Transwell 8-μm filters (Corning Costar Corp. Cambridge, MA) as follows: 5 × 104 fibroblasts, resuspended in serum-free medium, were plated onto the upper chambers and allowed to migrate for 6 h through the polycarbonate filter into the bottom wells filled with complete medium. The cells that migrated into the lower chambers were collected and counted. Each assay was performed in triplicate. To study EDS cell proliferation, DNA synthesis was evaluated by immunofluorescence detection of BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science), according to De Petro et al. (45De Petro G. Copeta A. Barlati S. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 286-294Google Scholar). 4 × 103 cells were seeded on coverslips and grown to semiconfluence in complete medium. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 48 h to induce the non-proliferating G0 phase. The cells were stimulated with 10% FBS-supplemented medium for 20 and 40 h at 37 °C and treated with 10 μm BrdUrd. After washing three times in PBS, the cells were fixed in methanol for 20 min at –20 °C, blocked with 0.3% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd Ab (1:10 v/v in 66 mm Tris buffer, 0.66 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing three times in PBS, a sheep FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab (1:10 v/v in PBS) was added for 30 min at 37 °C, and the coverslips were analyzed at a ×20 magnification. The number of fluorescent nuclei over all the cells was determined, and the data were expressed as percentage of labeled nuclei. IF and FACS Analysis—The study of COLLs, FN, and their integrin receptors was performed by IF on control and EDS fibroblasts grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For this purpose, 1.5 × 105 cells of each strain were seeded on 22 × 22-mm glass coverslides and grown at 37 °Cina5%CO2 incubator for 48 h. The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 60 mm sucrose for 5 min, permeabilized in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 90 s, washed twice in PBS and 0.15 m glycine for 3 min, and immunoreacted with anti-FN, anti-COLLV, anti-COLLIII, or anti-COLLI polyclonal Abs (1:100 in diluting buffer containing 0.3% BSA and 0.1% NaN3 in PBS). In parallel, the cells were reacted with mouse anti-α5β1 (clone JBS5), anti-αvβ3, anti-α2β1 integrin mAbs diluted in 1% BSA at a concentration of 4 μg/ml, for 30 min at room temperature. All cells were washed 3× 5 min in PBS and reacted with anti-rabbit IgG or anti-goat IgG and anti-mouse IgG, (10 μg/ml), as secondary Abs, for 45 min at room temperature. The coverslides were mounted on glass slides in 1:1 PBS/glycerol solution; the IF signals were acquired by a CCD black and white TV camera (SensiCam-PCO Computer Optics GmbH, Germany) mounted on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope and acquired by Image Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Quantitative evaluation of fluorescence associated with the FN- and COLL-ECM organized by control and EDS cells, was performed as previously reported (25Colombi M. Zoppi N. De Petro G. Marchina E. Gardella R. Tavian D. Ferraboli S. Barlati S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14346-14355Google Scholar). The fluorescent images, with the same spatial resolution and comparable light intensity, were captured by a CCD black and white TV camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 10S/H fluorescence microscope. Using the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), a task list file was developed that could be executed in semi-automatic mode on different images. Each image was processed by applying Sharpen and Rank nonlinear filters to optimize the image contrast and to remove the background noise. A binary image, visualized as a red overlay, corresponding to the fluorescence signal, was obtained by setting two thresholds in the fluorescence peak corresponding to the image gray tones visualized, with the lighter tones at the highest value of the peak and the darker ones below the slice background. The sequence of options in the task list was repeated on five images captured on each slide. The integrated optical density (IOD) related to the field area containing the signal was measured, and the cell number present in each image was counted. The levels of integrin receptors distributed on the control, EDSI and EDSIV cell surfaces were evaluated by FACS analysis. For each strain, 5 × 105 fibroblasts were washed twice in 0.1% BSA/PBS, centrifuged at 1500 rpm at +4 °C, and immunoreacted for 30 min on ice with saturating levels of anti-α5β1 (clone HA5, 10 μg/ml), anti-αvβ3 (5 μg/ml), and anti-α2β1 (10 μg/ml) integrin mAbs diluted in 1% BSA/PBS. After washing in cold 0.5% BSA/PBS, the cells were reacted with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and washed in 0.5% BSA/PBS. The cells were acquired with FACScan (BD PharMingen) and analyzed by CellQuest software (BD PharMingen) equipped with a 480-nm argon laser. The same cell strains that immunoreacted only with anti-mouse IgG were used as negative controls. To study the role of FN integrin receptors in cell adhesion, control and EDS fibroblasts allowed to adhere in the absence and in the presence of 10 μg/ml FN, VN, or polylysine coating, for 30, 60, and 120 min, were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 60 mm sucrose for 7 min, permeabilized in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 90 s, washed twice with 0.15 m glycine/PBS, and immunoreacted with mouse anti-α5β1 and anti-αvβ3 integrin mAbs as reported above. In Vitro Treatment of Skin Fibroblasts with COLLs, Antibody Perturbation of COLLs, and α2β1 Integrin Function—To test the role of COLLs on ECM assembly and on FN and COLL integrin receptor clustering, control and EDS fibroblasts were cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium in the presence of 5 μg/ml human purified COLLV or COLLIII. After treatment with COLLs and immunoreaction with anti-COLLV, anti-COLLIII, and anti-FN serum, anti-α5β1, αvβ3, and α2β1 integrin mAbs, the cells were analyzed by IF for the organization of COLLs and FN into the ECM and for α5β1, αvβ3, and α2β1 integrin distribution. The levels of integrin receptors organized after COLL treatment were evaluated by FACS analysis, as reported above. The effect of human purified pFN on COLL- and FN-ECM and on COLLs and FN integrin receptor organization was tested by culturing control and EDS cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml pFN for 48 h. To study the effect of COLL inhibition on ECM assembly, human control fibroblasts were cultured on glass coverslips in complete medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml goat anti-COLLV and anti-COLLIII polyclonal antibodies for 4 days. Confluent cell cultures were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and 60 mm sucrose for 7 min, permeabilized in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 90 s, immunoreacted with rabbit anti-FN, goat anti-COLLV, goat anti-COLLIII polyclonal antibodies, mouse anti-α5β1, anti-α2β1, and anti-αvβ3 integrin mAbs, and analyzed by epifluorescence as reported above. In parallel, human control fibroblasts were treated for 4 h with 10 μg/ml anti-human α2β1 integrin mAb recognizing the collagen binding site of the receptor and competing with the specific integrin ligand (46Hangan D. Uniyal S. Morris V.L. MacDonald I.C. von Ballestrem C. Chau T. Schmidt E.E. Chambers A.F. Groom A.C. Chan B.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3142-3149Google Scholar) and with a polyclonal anti-human-α2 cytoplasmic tail subunit Ab. Western Blot Analysis—The evaluation of FN in control and EDS cells was performed either in the culture medium or in deoxycholate-soluble and deoxycholate-insoluble fraction of each cell strain as follows: 3 × 105 control, EDSI, and EDSIV cells were seeded for 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h in complete medium. At each time complete medium was collected in the presence of protease inhibitors (25 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aminobenzamidine). The cell layers were rinsed three times in cold PBS and treated for 10 min at 4 °C in the sodium deoxycholate lysis buffer (0.5% deoxycholate in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA) to collect the FN cytoplasmic soluble fraction. The pericellular matrices attached to the culture dishes (insoluble FN fraction) were scraped into a mixture of 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 0.002% bromphenol blue (47Hedman K. Kurkinen M. Alitalo K. Vaheri A. Johansson S. Höök M. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 83-91Google Scholar). Alternatively, the FN-ECM was washed in PBS, fixed in methanol, and immunoreacted with the polyclonal anti-FN Ab, as reported above. The analysis of FN synthesized and secreted by control and EDS fibroblasts cultured with and without 5 μg/ml COLLV and COLLIII was performed as follows: control, EDSI and EDIV cells were washed with PBS twice and collected 24 h after seeding, sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. Cell extracts and complete medium were collected in the presence of protease inhibitors (25 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aminobenzamidine); 20 μg of total proteins were diluted in Laemmli's buffer and separated by electrophoresis in 8% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. After nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) transfer, the membranes were blocked overnight at 37 °C with 3% nonfat milk (w/v in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), immunoreacted for 2 h at 37 °C with anti-FN f33 (25Colombi M. Zoppi N. De Petro G. Marchina E. Gardella R. Tavian D. Ferraboli S. Barlati S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14346-14355Google Scholar) mAb (final concentration 1 μg/ml in 0.3% BSA, 0.01% NaN3 in PBS), washed 3 × 10 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS), 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) (TBS-T) at room temperature, and reacted for 2 h at 37 °C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The analysis of integrins synthesized by control and EDS fibroblasts was performed on cell cultures grown for 48 h in complete medium. The cells were kept at 4 °C overnight in 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 KIU/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 14 000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were recovered, 3 mg of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-α5β1 and anti-αvβ3 mAbs (10 μg of Ab/1 mg of protein) at +4 °C for 3 h in the presence of protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) diluted 1:1 in TBS and the immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation. After washing, the bound proteins were recovered by boiling in 1% SDS. Equal amounts of extracts were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and reacted for 2 h at room temperature with anti-α5β1 and anti-αvβ3 mAbs (1 μg/ml) diluted in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). The detection was performed incubating 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab diluted in TBS-T. Detection of FN and integrin subunits was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Pierce). The bands obtained were evaluated as IOD by the Gel-Pro 3.1 Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) or by Analytical Imaging Station (AIS) software (Imaging Research INC., St. Catherine, Ontario, Canada). Mutations in COL5A1 and COL3A1 Genes Affect the Organization of COLLs into the ECM and Clustering of α2β1 Integrin Receptor in Cultured Fibroblasts—We analyzed the assembly of COLLV and COLLIII in the ECM in EDSI and EDSIV fibroblasts, which carry mutations in COL5A1 and COL3A1, respectively, as compared with control fibroblasts. IF analysis on control fibroblasts shows that these cells organize COLLV and COLLIII in large fibrils (Fig. 1A, a and d) distributed in the intercellular spaces. On the contrary, EDSI-COL5A1 mutated cells do not organize COLLV in the ECM and retain this protein in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, b). These cells also show a large amount of COLLIII in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, e). EDSIV-COL3A1-mutated cells lack a COLLIII-ECM (Fig. 1A, f) but organize COLLV fibrils, as well as control fibroblasts (Fig. 1A, c). Fig. 1B shows the quantitative evaluation by image analysis of COLLV and COLLIII signals detected by IF in control and EDS fibroblasts and shows that reduced amounts of each COLL molecules are present in EDS mutants and are mainly localized inside the cells. These results show that both mutations present in the EDS strains analyzed lead to the defective organization of the abnormal protein into the ECM of each cell type and to the intracellular storage of the abnormal proteins. The IF analysis of COLLI, the main collagen synthesized by skin fibroblasts, shows that in control and EDS fibroblasts this protein is not organized in the ECM and is mainly detectable in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, g–i). In particular, in EDS cells the amount of intracellular COLLI is higher, compared with control fibroblasts. Furthermore, we analyzed by IF the distribution in EDS cells of the major fibroblast COLL receptor, the α2β1 integrin. This receptor, which is widely distributed in the plasma membrane of control cells (Fig. 1A, l), is strongly reduced in both EDS cell strains (Fig. 1A, m and n). FACS analysis shows that 91% of control fibroblasts are α2β1 integrin-positive and their fluorescence intensity (FL1), ranging between 101 and 103, is higher than that measured in negative controls (minus primary antibody) (<101) (Fig. 2).

We show that each of the four Dus proteins has a distinct position specificity: Dus1p for U16 and U17, Dus2p for U20, Dus3p for U47, and Dus4p for U20a and U20b. A ubiquitous feature of tRNAs is the presence of numerous base and ribose modifications (1Hopper A.K. Phizicky E.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 162-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). More than 80 different RNA modifications have been described (2Rozenski J. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), 25 of which are found in cytoplasmic tRNAs of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; these occur at 35 positions, leading to about 11 modifications in an average yeast tRNA (3Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Dihydrouridine is among the most abundant modified nucleosides found in tRNA (3Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar); the 905 dihydrouridines found in the 561 curated tRNAs are second in number only to the 1,234 pseudouridines. Consistent with its abundance, dihydrouridine is found widely in tRNAs of eubacteria and eukaryotes (3Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), although it is less common in archaebacteria (4Noon K.R. Guymon R. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Thomm M. Lim J. Cavicchioli R. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dihydrouridines are found at one or more of multiple different positions in tRNA, the vast majority of which are in the D loop at positions 16, 17, 20, 20a, and 20b and at the base of the variable arm at position 47. Only in six exceptional cases is dihydrouridine found elsewhere, and in these cases it occurs at one of four other positions in the D loop (15Giaever G. Chu A.M. Ni L. Connelly C. Riles L.

Commun. 1967; 26: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, and 21Hani J. Feldman H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and at position 48 in the variable arm. The persistent occurrence of dihydrouridine in these positions in so many different organisms underscores the evolutionary importance of the modification and of the sites of modification. To begin to address the roles of dihydrouridine modifications, an important first step is to decipher the substrate specificity rules for the various modified dihydrouridine residues of tRNA. The yeast S. cerevisiae is highly suitable for this analysis for three reasons. First, yeast tRNAs are modified with dihydrouridine at most of the sites of modification that have been found in characterized tRNAs. Thus, each of the six most common dihydrouridine modification sites are found in multiple yeast cytoplasmic tRNAs (Table I), and two of the five minor dihydrouridine modification sites are found in its sequenced mitochondrial tRNAs, at positions 15 and 17a. Second, formation of most dihydrouridines in yeast cytoplasmic tRNA requires primarily that a uridine is encoded at the appropriate site. Thus, all 83 encoded uridine residues at positions 16, 17, 20, 20a, and 20b of characterized yeast cytoplasmic tRNAs are modified to dihydrouridine, and 17 of the 20 U47 residues in the variable arm are modified (Table I). In contrast, for many other modifications, only certain tRNA species with the corresponding residue are modified. Thus, m1G9 modification occurs at only 10 of the 22 G9 residues of characterized yeast tRNAs (5Jackman J.E. Montange R.K. Malik H.S. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2003; 9: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), ψ 1The abbreviations used are: ψ, pseudouridine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; D, dihydrouridine; m1G, 1-methylguanonsine; m2G, N2-methylguanosine; m22G, N2,N2-dimethylguanosine; m1A, 1-methyladenosine. modification of yeast cytoplasmic tRNAs occurs only rarely at encoded uridines at 6 of the 15 positions at which ψ is found (6Motorin Y. Keith G. Simon C. Foiret D. Simos G. Hurt E. Grosjean H. RNA. 1998; 4: 856-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and dihydrouridine modifications in tRNA of other organisms are much more sporadic at uridine residues (Table I). Third, the genes encoding dihydrouridine synthases have recently been identified. We previously identified two yeast dihydrouridine synthases (Dus1p and Dus2p) that were responsible for some of the dihydrouridine modification of yeast bulk tRNA in vivo and of certain tRNAs in vitro (7Xing F.

By quantification of the dihydrouridine levels of purified tRNA species, we developed a preliminary map to describe the specificity of the Dus proteins. Microarray analysis of individual dus deletion strains provided an independent map of the specificities that showed good agreement with the one generated from calculating total dihydrouridine content. The specificity model was confirmed and extended by the development and use of a new dihydrouridine mapping method suitable for analysis of individual tRNAs in bulk RNA. Our results indicate that each the four yeast Dus proteins is specific for dihydrouridine modification at one or two distinct positions in cytoplasmic tRNAs. Strains—Strains used in this study are summarized in Table II. All dus-Δ strains that were not purchased were made by PCR-based recombination (9Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), using primers containing ∼35 nucleotides homologous to the ends of individual DUS genes and ∼15 nucleotides homologous to marker genes (10Langle-Rouault F. Jacobs E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3079-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The dus2-Δ::LEU2 strains were made by amplification of LEU2 DNA from YEplac181 (11Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) with ends containing DUS2 sequence, using primers DUS2-5′-LEU2 (5′-AGCGCAGTCACACAGAGATCCCTCAACATAACGAGAACAC) and 3′-LU2-DS2 (5′-GTGTCACTGCCTATGCTACCCTATGAACATATTCC), followed by amplification with primers 5′-DUS2 (5′-CCATCCAAGCCACACCAAATAGCGCAGTCACACAG) and 3′-DS2 (5′-GGTACAACCTTTTGCTTTTTAGTGTCACTGCCTATG) to add more DUS2 flanking sequences to the ends of the fragment.

Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) with ends containing DUS4 sequence, except that the DUS4 sequences at the ends were engineered to allow subsequent homologous recombination after transformation, to excise URA3. If the sequence around DUS4 in the chromosome is A-DUS4-B-C (where A, B, and C represent sequence blocks), then the amplified DNA that was constructed is A-C-URA3-B, so that after transformation, the chromosomal sequence is A-C-URA3-B-C. This was accomplished with three rounds of amplification using primers 5′-URA3 (5′-GCTTTTCAATTCAATTCATC) and 3′-URA3 (5′-CCGATGATAAGCTGTCAAAC), followed by amplification with forward primers DUS4C-5′-URA3 (5′-CAAGCGTTACGGCGAGGATGGATTTGGCATGGGCGGCTTTTCAATTCAATTC) and 5′-DUS4-AC (5′-CATTCTGCTTCTTCGCCCTGAATAAAAAAAAGATGCAAGCGTTACGGC), both with reverse primer 3′-URA3-DUS4B (5′-CAGATGGTGCTGAGCCAATTGAAAAGGCAAGCCACCCCGATGATAAGCTGTC). After transformation, selection with 5-fluoroorotic acid allows homologous recombination to excise URA3 and leave the dus4 deletion. Strains lacking YLR-401c (dus3-Δ::URA3) were made in the same way as the dus4-Δ::URA3 strains, using forward primers DUS3C-5′-URA3 (5′-CGACGAATACGGCATTTCTCAATGTCGTAGATTCTTCGCTTTTCAATTCAATTC) and 5′-DUS3-AC (5′-GAGCAGTAATGAAACATTAATGAACTCAGAATAGGCGACGAATACGGCATTTC) with reverse primer 3′-URA3-DUS3B (5′-GCCCCAGTGTTCCATAGAGAACTGCGCATAATCCCCCG). All deletion strains were confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA prepared from mutant strains, using primers homologous to the region outside the integrated area in chromosome. Preparation of Low Molecular Weight RNA from Yeast—Low molecular weight RNA was extracted by phenol at 55-60 °C essentially as described (13Rubin G.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 12: 45-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), from yeast cells grown in 125 ml of medium to an A600 of 3-4. RNA was precipitated twice with ethanol, resuspended in 1 ml of H2O, and stored at -80 °C. Purification of Individual tRNAs from Yeast—tRNAPhe, tRNALeuCAA, and tRNATyr were purified as previously described (5Jackman J.E. Montange R.K. Malik H.S. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2003; 9: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) from low molecular weight RNA of wild type and various dus-Δ strains, using the following 5′-biotinylated DNA oligomers complementary to the 3′ side of corresponding tRNAs: 5Bio-F1 for tRNAPhe (5′/Biotin/GTGGATCGAACACAGGACCT); 5Bio-Y2 for tRNATyr (5′/Biotin/TGGTCTCCCGGGGGCGAGTCGAACG); and 5Bio-L2 for tRNALeuCAA (5′/biotin/GAGATTCGAACTCTTGCATCTTACG). Purity of the tRNA was examined by both quantitative primer extension (using a 50-fold excess of primer to tRNA input) and by HPLC, as described below. HPLC Analysis of Dihydrouridine—Bulk RNA (∼20 μg/injection) and purified tRNA (∼1 μg/injection) from different yeast strains were digested with 5 μg of P1 nuclease in buffer containing 30 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 0.2 mm ZnCl2 at 37 °C overnight and then with 5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) in 1× alkaline phosphatase reaction buffer at 37 °C for 3 h. The resulting nucleosides were resolved by HPLC (Waters Alliance model 2690, equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector) on a reverse phase C18 column (Supelco LC-18; 30 cm × 4.0 mm; 5 μm, 120 Å; Supelco, Inc.) essentially as described (14Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Individual spectra of the nucleosides retrieved by the photodiode array detector were used to assign the peaks. The number of moles of dihydrouridine and other modified nucleosides per tRNA were calculated as described (5Jackman J.E. Montange R.K. Malik H.S. Phizicky E.M.

Contaminating DNA was removed by treatment with DNase I (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions followed by phenol extraction and precipitation. Ten micrograms of total RNA was directly labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 or 647 (Molecular Probes “Ulysis” kit), ethanol-precipitated, and hybridized to a commercially produced microarray (Agilent Technologies) as previously described (17Hughes T.R.

Biotech. 2001; 19: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), except that the formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer was reduced to 25%. Arrays were scanned on an Axon 4000B instrument and quantitated with GenePix software. The raw log ratios for each oligonucleotide were calculated from the median intensity at each spot, and the data were normalized by applying a Lowess smoother to the ratios of each experiment over intensity. All microarray data are compiled in the Supplemental Table S1. Detailed probe sequences and other data are compiled on the World Wide Web at hugheslab.med.utoronto.ca/Xing. Dihydrouridine Mapping—∼20 μg of bulk cellular RNA was incubated in 8-μl reaction mixtures with 0.1 n KOH at 37 °C for 5 min or longer as indicated, and the pH was neutralized by the addition of 7 μl of 5× annealing buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm dithiothreitol). Then RNA was subject to a primer extension assay as described (5Jackman J.E. Montange R.K. Malik H.S. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2003; 9: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), except that ∼8 μg of RNA (containing ∼8 pmol of individual tRNA) and 25 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled primer were used in an annealing reaction of 9 μl. Primers used for dihydrouridine mapping the 5′ side of tRNAPhe, tRNATyr, and tRNALeuCAA and for the 3′ side of tRNATyr are illustrated in Fig. 5. Other primers used in dihydrouridine mapping are 5V-1 for tRNAVal (5′-GCGTGTTAAGCAGATG), 5E-1 for tRNAGlu (5′-GGTCTCCACGGTGAAAGCG), and 5F-1b for the 3′ side of tRNAPhe (5′-GGTGCGAATTCTGTGGATC). Primer extension products were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide (19:1), 4 m urea gels and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Dihydrouridine Is Undetectable in Bulk RNA from a Yeast Strain Lacking All Four Dus Protein Family Members—We previously found that dus1-Δ and dus2-Δ strains each had substantially less dihydrouridine than did control wild type strains, whereas strains lacking the conserved family members encoded by open reading frames YLR401c (now named DUS3) and YLR405w (now named DUS4) had marginally reduced dihydrouridine (7Xing F. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2002; 8: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate this more fully, we have improved the resolution of our initial HPLC methods with longer columns and have quantified the dihydrouridine contribution of each of the four Dus proteins. To this end, we have constructed a series of haploid deletion strains with every possible combination of deletions of the four DUS family members (Table II) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each of the 15 dus-Δ strains is viable in rich medium (YPD) and, surprisingly, grows at comparable rates in this medium at different temperatures. To evaluate the contribution of the four Dus protein family members to dihydrouridine modification, we extracted RNA from a wild type control strain and several of the dus mutant strains and then compared their nucleoside content by HPLC analysis of appropriately digested RNA. Fig. 1A shows a comparison of the nucleosides in RNA from a wild type strain with those from a dus1-Δ, dus2-Δ, dus3-Δ, dus4-Δ quadruple mutant strain. The position of dihydrouridine in the HPLC elution profile is indicated by the arrow and verified according to its spectrophotometric profile (14Gehrke C.W. Kuo K.C. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 471: 3-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); as shown in Fig. 1B, and described previously (7Xing F. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2002; 8: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), dihydrouridine absorbs at 210 nm but not at 263 nm, whereas the adjacent nucleoside pseudouridine has absorption peaks at both of these wavelengths. It is clear from Fig. 1B that RNA from the dus1-Δ, dus2-Δ, dus3-Δ, dus4-Δ quadruple mutant strain lacks any detectable dihydrouridine. To quantify the contributions of individual Dus proteins to bulk dihydrouridine modification, RNA from a series of strains with different combinations of dus mutants was analyzed for its dihydrouridine content. As shown in Fig. 1C and calculated from the areas of the peaks, a dus1-Δ, dus2-Δ strain retains ∼35% of the normal dihydrouridine content, and further removal of either DUS4 or DUS3 drops the dihydrouridine level to ∼20%. Finally, deletion of the fourth and last DUS homolog (dus1-Δ, dus2-Δ, dus3-Δ, dus4-Δ) generates the quadruple knockout, resulting in no detectable dihydrouridine. These results suggest that all four DUS genes contribute to dihydrouridine modification of RNA in vivo. Analysis of Purified tRNAs from dus Mutant Strains Yields a Preliminary Model for Specificities of the Dus Protein Members in S. cerevisiae—To begin to determine the specificities of the Dus proteins for the six dihydrouridine positions that are modified in yeast cytoplasmic tRNAs, we analyzed three individual tRNAs purified from different dus mutant strains for their dihydrouridine content. As shown in Fig. 2, these tRNAs (tRNAPhe, tRNALeuCAA, and tRNATyr) represent different dihydrouridine distributions. Each tRNA was purified by hybridization of bulk RNA to a 5′ biotin-labeled DNA oligomer specific for the target tRNA, followed by binding of the hybridized tRNA to streptavidin beads and elution of the bound tRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). This purification method yielded tRNA that was judged to be more than 95% pure, based on quantitative primer extension with specific probes, lack of detectable primer extension products with two other probes specific for other tRNAs, and comparison of the yield calculated from primer extension data with the known amount of RNA input (data not shown). To quantify the modified nucleosides in the purified tRNAs, tRNAs were digested to nucleosides and subjected to HPLC analysis, and the relative molarities of dihydrouridine and other modified nucleosides were calculated from the elution profile and the known extinction coefficients (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of tRNAPhe suggests that its two dihydrouridines at positions 16 and 17 are modified by Dus1p. From the chromatograms shown in Fig. 2A, it is clear that tRNAPhe from a dus1-Δ strain has little detectable dihydrouridine, whereas tRNAPhe from a wild type or a dus2-Δ strain has comparable amounts of dihydrouridine. The quantification shown in Table III confirms this result. tRNAPhe from the wild type and the dus2-Δ strain contains 1.4 and 1.5 mol of dihydrouridine/mol of tRNA, and tRNAPhe from dus1-Δ strains has no detectable dihydrouridine. By contrast, quantification of most of the other modified nucleosides present in this tRNA (ψ, m2G, m22G, m5C, and m1A) shows that they are all close to their expected values and are unchanged in tRNAPhe from all three strains. This close correspondence of expected nucleoside composition to observed composition independently validates our claim that these tRNAs are highly pure. This result demonstrates that Dus1p is responsible for modifying positions 16 and 17 of this tRNA, consistent with our previous observation that Dus1p modifies U17 of tRNAPhe in vitro (7Xing F. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2002; 8: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Table IIIMoles of dihydrouridines in 1 mol of a cytoplasmic tRNA from wild type (WT) and dus-Δ strains, as determined by HPLC analysis of nucleosides from purified tRNA speciestRNAPhe nucleosideExpectedWTdus1dus2molD21.40.01.5Ψ21.71.71.7m2G10.80.80.8m2G10.70.70.7m5C21.71.71.7m1A10.60.50.6tRNALeuCAA nucleosideExpectedWTdus1dus2dus3dus4dus2, dus4aCorresponding multiple dus-Δ mutant strains.molD22.22.21.02.11.20.0Ψ32.92.92.92.92.92.9m2G10.90.90.90.90.90.9m5C21.81.81.81.81.71.8tRNATyr nucleosideExpectedWTdus1, dus2, dus3aCorresponding multiple dus-Δ mutant strains.dus1, dus2, dus4aCorresponding multiple dus-Δ mutant strains.dus1, dus2, dus3, dus4aCorresponding multiple dus-Δ mutant strains.molD65.21.80.90.0Ψ32.92.82.92.9m2G10.90.90.90.9m5C10.70.70.80.9m1A10.60.50.50.5a Corresponding multiple dus-Δ mutant strains. Open table in a new tab tRNALeuCAA contains two dihydrouridines, D20 and D20b, which appear to be modified by Dus2p and Dus4p. Fig. 2B and Table III show that tRNALeuCAA from a dus1-Δ strain (2.2 D/tRNALeu) and a dus3-Δ strain (2.1 D/tRNALeu) retains full levels of dihydrouridine in tRNALeuCAA compared with the wild type strain (2.2 D/tRNALeu). However, deletion of either DUS2 (1.0 D/tRNALeu) or DUS4 (1.2 D/tRNALeu) causes loss of one dihydrouridine residue from this tRNA, and deletion of both DUS2 and DUS4 completely eliminated dihydrouridine from this tRNA species. Thus, we conclude that Dus2p and Dus4p each modify one position of tRNALeuCAA, although neither protein can be assigned to a specific residue based on this analysis. These results are also consistent with our previous in vitro results, which demonstrated that Dus2p and Dus4p each had activity with a tRNALeuCAA substrate, although only marginal activity was detected with Dus4p (Ylr405p) (7Xing F. Martzen M.R. Phizicky E.M. RNA. 2002; 8: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). tRNATyr is of particular interest, because dihydrouridine is present at all six known positions of the modification that are found in yeast cytoplasmic tRNA (Table I). As shown in Fig. 2C and Table III, tRNATyr from the wild type strain has 5.2 D/tRNATyr, whereas tRNATyr from a dus1-Δ, dus2-Δ, dus3-Δ strain has nearly 2 dihydrouridine residues (1.8 D/tRNATyr). This suggests that Dus4p activity accounts for formation of two of the six dihydrouridine residues in tRNATyr. These sites could be D20 and D20A or could be D20A and D20B but not D20 and D20B, since our analysis of tRNALeuCAA suggests that Dus2p acts at either D20 or D20B in this tRNA species (assuming that site specificity is conserved in different tRNA species). tRNATyr also has a dihydrouridine at position 47 in the extra loop. As shown in Fig. 2C and Table III, one dihydrouridine residue (0.9 D/tRNATyr) is present in tRNATyr from a dus1-Δ, dus2-Δ, dus4-Δ strain. Thus, we tentatively assign Dus3p to formation of D47. Microarray Analysis Largely Confirms the Preliminary Model of Dus Protein Specificity—It was previously observed that the absence of dihydrouridine in tRNAs from a dus1 mutant strain could be detected by microarray, using a protocol in which the fluors are coupled directly to the cellular RNA and hybridized to an array of oligonucleotides (16Peng W.T. Robinson M.D. Mnaimneh S. Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Morris Q. Davierwala A.P. Grigull J. Yang X. Zhang W. Mitsakakis N. Ryan O.W. Datta N. Jojic V. Pal C. Canadien V. Richards D. Beattie B. Wu L.F.

It was noted that only oligonucleotides covering tRNA positions 16 and 17 reported significant preferential hybridization to RNA from a dus1 mutant relative to RNA from a wild type strain (positive ratios), and it was concluded that the loss of dihydrouridine modification in the dus1 mutant results in higher binding affinity. We have extended this analysis by examining RNAs from all four dus deletion strains on a microarray with oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to multiple different portions of 70 genomic tRNA sequences in S. cerevisiae, comp"

Therefore, we compared the effects of infusing either 6 mm oleic acid (OA) bound to albumin, 0.5-20% Intralipid, or saline for 3 or 6 h into male C57BL/6J mice. Infusions were followed by studies of triglyceride (TG) and apoB secretion. Although plasma FA levels increased similarly after either 20% Intralipid or 6 mm OA, TG secretion increased only after infusion of 4-20% Intralipid; TG secretion was unchanged by 6 mm OA. By contrast, 6-h infusions of either 6 mm OA or 4-20% Intralipid increased apoB secretion. 6 mm OA and 20% Intralipid each increased secretion of apoB from primary hepatocytes ex vivo. Importantly, 0.5-2% Intralipid, which delivered more FA to the liver than 6 mm OA, did not stimulate apoB secretion. Hepatic apoB mRNA levels were unaffected by either 6 mm OA or 20% Intralipid, but microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA was significantly lower after 6-h infusions with 6 mm OA versus either saline or 20% Intralipid. Lower microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mRNA levels were associated with reduced hepatic TG mass after 6-h infusions of 6 mm OA. We conclude that 1) increased FA delivery to the liver in vivo increases secretion of apoB-lipoproteins via post-transcriptional mechanisms, 2) OA-induced apoB-lipoprotein secretion occurred at least in part via mechanisms other than by providing substrate for TG synthesis, and 3) the route of delivery of FA is important for its effects on apoB secretion.

Many laboratories have also conducted in vivo studies of apoB-lipoprotein secretion in humans and animal models (5Ginsberg H.N. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 571-589Google Scholar, 6Marsh J.B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3542-3556Google Scholar). However, despite the presence of a large body of work, several questions remain incompletely answered. First and foremost is the question of whether increased flux of plasma fatty acids (FA) to the liver can stimulate VLDL secretion. Studies in cultured liver cell lines, primary hepatocytes, and perfused livers have provided conflicting results relative to the role of FA delivery in VLDL secretion. Thus, several (8White A.L.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 499-513Google Scholar) have failed to show that exogenous FA stimulate secretion of apoB. However, we were able recently to demonstrate oleic acid (OA)-induced apoB secretion in primary hepatocytes from fasted mice (21Liang J.-S. Distler O. Cooper D.A. Jamil H. Deckelbaum R.J. Ginsberg H.N. Sturley S.L. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1327-1331Google Scholar). Results from perfused rat livers have also been mixed; OA had no effect on apoB secretion in chow-fed rats (22Salam W.H. Wilcox H.G. Heimberg M. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 809-816Google Scholar) but increased apoB secretion in fasted (22Salam W.H. Wilcox H.G. Heimberg M. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 809-816Google Scholar) or high carbohydrate diet-fed (23Patsch W. Schonfeld G. Diabetes. 1981; 30: 530-534Google Scholar) rats. In vivo studies in humans have also been inconclusive. Lewis et al. (24Lewis G.F. Uffelman K.D. Szeto L.W. Weller B. Steiner G. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 158-166Google Scholar, 25Lewis G.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 475-477Google Scholar) demonstrate that, when they increased the plasma levels of FA by infusing Intralipid and heparin intravenously into normal humans, they were able to stimulate VLDL production. By contrast, Malmstrom et al. (26Malmstrom R. Packard C.J. Caslake M. Bedford D. Stewart P. Shepherd J. Taskinen M.R. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 146: 381-390Google Scholar) were unable to increase VLDL apoB secretion when they raised plasma levels of FA by giving subjects only heparin by intravenous infusion for 8 h. Defining the role of FA in stimulating apoB secretion is critical because of the potential link between insulin resistance at the level of adipose tissues, increased release of adipocyte-derived FA into the circulation, and increased TG accumulation in non-adipose organs, including the liver (27Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 453-458Google Scholar, 28Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Google Scholar). Increased FA flux, as observed in insulin-resistant states, has been linked to increased secretion of VLDL particles in humans (5Ginsberg H.N. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1987; 3: 571-589Google Scholar, 29Kissebah A.H. Adams P.W. Wynn V. Clin. Sci. Mol. Med. 1974; 47: 259-278Google Scholar, 30Kissebah A.H. Alfarsi S. Adams P.W. Seed M. Folkard J. Wynn V.

Metabolism. 1973; 22: 779-783Google Scholar). Among other questions remaining unanswered are the following. 1) Is metabolic channeling of FA into VLDL TGs dependent on the origin of the FA? This is an issue that is just beginning to be addressed (34Gibbons G.F. Islam K. Pease R.J. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 2001; 1483: 37-57Google Scholar, 35Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Van Horn C.G. Gonzalez-Baro M.R. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2123-2126Google Scholar). Thus, will FA delivered by albumin have the same fate as FA delivered in lipoproteins or FA generated by de novo lipogenesis? More specifically, are FA from each of these sources equally available for assembly into lipoproteins? 2) Do FA only act as a substrate for core and surface lipids of apoB-lipoproteins, or can they act as signaling molecules, stimulating specific steps in the transport of apoB through the secretory pathway? Our recent work in cultured liver cell lines supports a signaling role for FA (36Pan M. Liang J.-S. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Google Scholar). 3) What are the mechanisms whereby the liver maintains lipid homeostasis in the face of increasing or decreasing demands related to the secretion of TG-rich apoB-lipoproteins? Will increased FA availability always lead to increased assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins, and will decreased FA availability provide signals leading to decreased secretion of apoB-lipoproteins? These unanswered questions inspired us to develop an experimental approach that would allow us to study in more detail the in vivo effects of increased hepatic FA availability on both the secretion of apoB-lipoproteins from the liver and the response of the liver to changes in apoB secretion. In our first studies we addressed the following two hypotheses; first, that in vivo FA flux to the liver is an important determinant of the assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins, and second, that the in vivo effects of FA on secretion of apoB, like those in cultured liver cells, are post-transcriptional. By infusing either 6 mm OA bound to albumin or varying concentrations of the lipid emulsion, Intralipid, via chronic jugular vein catheterization, we found that increasing plasma FA levels by either 6 mm OA or 4-20% Intralipid infusion increased the secretion of newly synthesized apoB through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Unexpectedly, 4-20% Intralipid increased the concomitant secretion of TGs, whereas the effect of 6 mm OA was only on apoB secretion. Importantly, 0.5-2% Intralipid, which delivered more TG-FA to the liver than 6 mm OA, did not stimulate apoB secretion. Although Intralipid is composed of TGs carrying several different FA as well as phospholipid and glycerol, the disparate results we observed suggest that the effect of albumin-bound OA on apoB secretion was related to its route of delivery. Furthermore, Intralipid at concentrations less than 4% did not stimulate either apoB or TG secretion despite the fact that those concentrations would have delivered more FA to the liver than would the infusion of 6 mm OA. These results have provided us with several new insights regarding the assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins. Chemicals—The animals studies were male C57BL/6J mice, age 12-14 weeks, purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME. All mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (light cycle was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and on a regular rodent chow diet. Surgical Procedures—Mice were anesthetized with 3.3 μl/g body weight of ketamine (15 mg/ml) and xylazine (3 mg/ml). The incision, location of the jugular vein, insertion of the cannula, and closing of the wound were carried out with a dissection microscope after the operative procedure developed for rats (37Smith S.G. Davis W.M. Ehrenpreis S. Neidle A. Methods in Narcotics Research. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1974: 3-32Google Scholar). In brief, silicone rubber tubing (catalog number 11-189-15A, 0.51-mm inner diameter × 0.94-mm outer diameter, Fisher) filled with saline was inserted into the jugular vein, and the outer portion of the tubing was tunneled subcutaneously, exiting at the nape of the neck. The length of tubing inserted into the jugular vein was 5 mm (38Barr J.E. Holmes D.B. Ryan L.J. Sharpless S.K. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1979; 11: 115-118Google Scholar). Once the tubing was in place, it was filled with saline to maintain patency and was closed at the end with a metal stopper. The mice were allowed to recover for 2-3 days before the experiment was performed. The tubing was flushed several times during that period. Lipid, Glucose, and Insulin Determinations—Total plasma TG concentrations were measured using commercial kits (INFINITY™ Triglyceride Reagent, Sigma). Plasma-free FA levels were measured by a colorimetric method using a commercial kit (number 994-75409) from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA). Plasma insulin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a commercial kit (Mercodia, ultrasensitive rat insulin ELISA, American Laboratory Products Co., Windham, NH). Glucose levels were measured using an enzymatic kit (number 315-100; Sigma-Aldrich). Infusion Study—The mice were randomly assigned to receive intravenous infusions of 6 mm OA (Sigma) bound to fatty acid-free albumin (the ratio of OA to bovine serum albumin was 5:1), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, or 20% Intralipid (Abbott), or saline. Albumin-bound OA was prepared as previously described (9Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Google Scholar). Intralipid was composed of (by weight) 20% soybean oil, 1.2% phospholipid, 2.25% glycerol, 76.55% water. The fatty acid composition of the soybean oil was: C16:0, 10.4%; C18:0, 4.0%; C18:1, 23.5%; C18:2, 53.5%; C18:3, 8.3%. On the morning of the experiment, food was removed, and the silicone tubing was flushed with saline and connected through polyethylene tubing to a Harvard Compact Infusion Pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston MA). The infusion line ran inside a tether and through a swivel, which was suspended from the top of the cage. This procedure protected the infusion tubing and allowed the mice complete freedom of movement. The infusions were carried out at the rate of 2.5 μl/min for either 3 or 6 h. Blood samples were obtained from the retro-orbital plexus before and at various time points during the infusions for measurement of plasma TG, free fatty acids, glucose, and insulin. Determination of in Vivo TG and ApoB Secretion Rates (Turnover Study)—After each 3- or 6-h infusion, in vivo secretion rates of TG and apoB were determined as described previously (39Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Google Scholar). Mice were injected intravenously with 500 mg/kg Triton WR1339 (25301-02-4, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.9% NaCl. Plasma VLDL clearance is completely inhibited in mice under these conditions (40Scanu A.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1965; 3: 63-138Google Scholar), and the accumulation of VLDL lipids and apolipoproteins in plasma after injection of Triton can be used to estimate rates of secretion of VLDL into the plasma compartment. Blood samples were collected at the end of infusion (0 min, preinjection) and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after injection of Triton for determination of TG levels, with the rate of rise of TG in plasma over time indicative of the rate at which TG was secreted from the liver (41Otway S. J. Physiol. 1967; 190: 321-332Google Scholar). ApoB secretion rates were measured by injecting each mouse with 200 μCi of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) together with Triton. Blood samples were taken at 60 and 120 min after injection, and the accumulation of [35S]methionine-labeled apoB was used to determine the rates of VLDL apoB secretion. In these experiments, 5 μl of whole plasma samples were subjected to 4% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray films to visualize labeled apoB. The apoB bands on the film were scanned for densitometry measurements. In prior studies we demonstrated that the direct application of plasma to the gel provided results that were equivalent to results obtained by first isolating VLDL by ultracentrifugation before gel electrophoresis (39Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Google Scholar). ApoB Secretion from Primary Hepatocytes—In three separate experiments hepatocytes were prepared after 6-h infusions (without Triton WR 1339 or [35S]methionine) according to the method of Berry and Friend (42Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Google Scholar). Livers were perfused through the portal vein with oxygenated Hanks’ solution (Hanks’ balanced saline solution, Invitrogen, catalog number 14175-095) buffered with 10 mm Hepes (Invitrogen, catalog number 15630106) and 5 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C, pH 7.4, containing 30 mg of collagenase (Type I, 245 units/mg, Worthington). Protease inhibitor mixture (No. 18h580, Roche Diagnostics) was added as well. Hepatocytes were plated into collagen-coated, 6-well plates at a cell density of 2.5 × 106 hepatocytes/9.6 cm2 in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Grand Island Biological Co, Santa Clara, CA) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Prior studies in our laboratory showed that apoB secretion was linear for 2 h. After a 2-h incubation cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of fresh Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium of the same composition supplemented with 1.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin was added into each well. [35S]Methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added (100 μCi/ml) to medium, and cells were stably labeled for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After labeling, medium was transferred to a tube containing a protease inhibitor mixture (final concentrations: 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 0.86 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml of aprotinin, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0), and cells were lysed by adding ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.0625 m sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 50 μg/ml leupeptin and 50 μg/ml pepstatin A (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc, Belmont, CA) in addition to the protease inhibitor mixture. ApoB in medium and cell lysate was immunoprecipitated according to our previously described method (9Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Google Scholar), and precipitates were analyzed by 4% SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 35S into apoB48 and apoB100 was assessed by autoradiography (X-AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). The final results were normalized using the protein mass and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated counts of cell lysate and relevant medium used for apoB immunoprecipitation. Protein masses of samples were determined with a BCA kit (Pierce). Determination of Liver TG Levels—At the end of either 3- or 6-h infusions (without Triton WR 1339), livers from the mice were collected for the measurement of hepatic TG content. Total liver lipids were extracted by a modification of the Folch extraction (43Folch J. Lees M. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 224: 497-509Google Scholar). Briefly, snapfrozen liver tissues (∼150 mg) were homogenized and extracted twice with a chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) solution. The organic layer was dried under nitrogen gas and resolubilized in chloroform. An aliquot of this Folch extraction was resuspended in an aqueous solution containing 2% Triton X-100 (44Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Google Scholar) for the determination of TG mass. [14C]Triolein (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each sample before lipid extraction to estimate the percent of recovery, and final TG concentrations were adjusted accordingly. Total liver protein was extracted using T-PER™ tissue protein extraction reagent (78510, Pierce). Protease inhibitor mixture (1873580, Roche Diagnostics) was added into the liver protein extraction to prevent protein degradation. Liver TG levels were expressed as μg of TG per mg of liver protein. Determination of the Amount of Fatty Acids Delivered to the Liver by Intralipid and OA Infusion—To investigate the relative delivery of FA to liver during infusions of Intralipid or OA, 0.5% Intralipid labeled with [14C]triolein or 0.15 mm albumin-bound OA labeled with [3H] OA were injected rapidly through the jugular vein after 4.5-h of infusion with unlabeled 20% Intralipid or 6 mm OA, respectively. The choice of 0.5% Intralipid and 0.15 mm OA was based on our goal of introducing quantities of each source of FA into the circulation by bolus injection that would approximate the quantities delivered during 1 min of the infusion of 20% Intralipid and 0.5% OA. The choice of 4.5 h as the time for injection of the tracers was based on our preliminary studies showing steady state levels of plasma TG and FA at that time. The 0.5% Intralipid labeled with [14C]triolein and 0.15 mm OA labeled with [3H]OA were prepared as described previously (45van Bennekum A.M. Kako Y. Weinstock P.H. Harrison E.H. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. Blaner W.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 565-574Google Scholar). In brief, to label Intralipid, 0.15 μCi of [14C]triolein (Amersham Biosciences) was added to a small glass vial and dried with N2 gas. One ml of 0.5% Intralipid was added to the vial and mixed thoroughly, the emulsion was sonicated three times on ice for 20 s each at the power setting of 40 W using a Branson Sonifier Cell Disruptor (model W185) (Branson Scientific, Inc., Plainview, NY) to incorporate the [14C]triolein into the core of the emulsion particle, and the resulting emulsion was stored at 4 °C before use in the experiment. To label OA, 60 μCi of [3H]oleic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a small vial and dried under N2 gas. One ml of OA bound to albumin was added to the vial and mixed thoroughly, and the resulting solution was rocked overnight at 4 °C. Before injection the solution was diluted with saline to reach the final concentration of 0.15 mm oleic acid. At the end of the 4.5-h infusions of either 20% Intralipid or 6 mm OA, the appropriate tracer was injected through jugular tubing. Five minutes after injection mice were sacrificed and cleared of blood by flushing with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline through the left ventricle. The organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney) and tissues (muscle and fat) were collected and homogenized in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline using a Polytron Tissue Disruptor (Kinematica AG, Littau-Lucerne, Switzerland). Muscle was collected from the gastrocnemius and femoris sites, and adipose tissue was collected from the epididymis. One-ml aliquots of the homogenates were added to 3.5 ml of scintillation fluids, and radioactivity was counted to determine tissue uptake. Tissue uptake was expressed as the percentage of total recovered radioactivity, including from blood, at the end of experiment. Fat and muscle mass were calculated as 15 and 42% of body weight, respectively. RNA Probe Preparation and RNase Protection Assays—Total cellular RNA was isolated from livers using TRIzol reagent following the protocol provided by the company (Invitrogen). The RNA probe for mouse apoB (46Ludwig E.H. Levy-Wilson B. Knott T. Blackhart B.D. McCarthy B.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 329-338Google Scholar) was generated by amplification of the target gene from liver RNA (male C57 BL/6J mice) by reverse transcription-PCR. The probe for MTP was described previously (39Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Google Scholar). PCR primers used and the size of amplified products for each probe are shown in Table I. PCR products were cloned into a PCRII vector using a TA cloning kit obtained from Invitrogen. DNA sequences of these clones were verified by DNA sequencing using a PerkinElmer ABI 377 automatic DNA sequencer.Table IPrimer sequences for mouse RNA probesGenePrimerPrimer sequencePCR sizeReferencebpApoBSense5′-AGT GCC TGC AGT GGA TCA AGT ACC TGC-3′22346Antisense5′-TGG ACA GCT GAA GCT TAA GTT TTC CAG GAC-3′MTPSense5′-TGT TTG GAA TTC AGC TTA GGC CTG TCA CAT-3′21939Antisense5′-AGA CTG AAT TCC ATT GAA CCA GAA ATA TCA-3′ Open table in a new tab Antisense probes were synthesized using an in vitro transcription kit obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and [α-32P]CTP (800Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse cyclophilin (Ambion Co., Austin, TX) was used as reference RNA to normalize for variation in RNA loading in RNase protection assays. RNase protection assays were carried out as described previously (39Siri P. Candela N. Ko C. Zhang Y. Eusufzai S. Ginsberg H.N. Huang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46064-46072Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA (10 μg) was hybridized to a test riboprobe and a reference riboprobe in a hybridization buffer (30 μl) and incubated at 48 °C overnight. After overnight hybridization, 20 units of RNase T2 (Invitrogen) was added to the mix. Control incubations with probe plus yeast mRNA with or without RNase T2 were performed as controls. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, RNase was removed by phenol extraction, and protected RNA fragments were ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (95% formamide, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA) and separated on 5% PAGE, 8 m urea gels. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray films overnight at -80 °C. For quantification, protected RNA fragments were cut out and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—The mean and S.D. are presented. Statistically significant differences (i.e. p < 0.05; two-tailed) in mean values among more than two groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance. Differences in the mean values between two groups were assessed by Student’s t test. We conducted preliminary studies to determine the optimal concentration of Intralipid as well as the time course of changes in plasma FA and TG in response to infusions of OA and Intralipid. Our goal was to increase plasma FA levels to high physiological levels, about three times above base line, for several hours. We infused Intralipid at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 20% for 6 h through a cannulated jugular vein. The results, depicted in Fig. 1A, demonstrate that concentrations of Intralipid between 0.5 and 10% did not increase plasma FA levels significantly; infusion of 20% Intralipid, which delivered 172 mg of TG-FA into the circulation over 6 h, raised plasma FA levels more than 2-fold compared with saline (0.80 ± 0.16 versus 0.30 ± 0.12 mmol/liter; p < 0.01) (n = 3 per group for 0.5-10% Intralipid; n = 8 for 20% Intralipid; n = 13 for saline). 6 mm OA was the highest concentration we could use without adversely affecting the mice, and that concentrations satisfied our need in terms of raising plasma FA levels. Indeed, a 6-h infusion of 6 mm OA raised plasma FA levels to 1.08 ± 0.32 mmol/liter (n = 9) (Fig. 1), and this was significantly greater than the FA level achieved by saline. Plasma FA concentrations tended to be higher after 6 mm OA versus 20% Intralipid infusions, but the levels were not significantly different from each other (p = 0.07). The finding that infusion of 0.5-10% Intralipid over 6 h, which delivered between 4.3 and 86 mg of TGFA into circulation (compared with the 1.5 mg of FA delivered by infusion of 6 mm OA), did not increase plasma FA levels suggested that 1) much of the FA generated by peripheral lipolysis of Intralipid TG was internalized in the adipose and muscle beds, where lipoprotein lipase was active, and/or 2) most of the Intralipid TG was taken up by tissues together with the whole Intralipid particle. After choosing 20% Intralipid, we determined plasma FA and TG changes during 6-h infusions of 6 mm OA, 20% Intralipid, and saline. Plasma FA and TG levels were measured at base line and 1, 2, 3 and 6 h after the start of each infusion (n = 3/each group). Plasma FA levels increased in all three groups of mice during the first hour of study, suggesting both effects of stress as well as FA delivery (Fig. 1B). In the saline-infused mice, FA levels fell rapidly back toward base line, reaching base-line concentrations by 3 h. In mice infused with OA or 20% Intralipid, FA levels drifted down between 1 and 2 h of infusion but then maintained relatively constant levels thereafter. Of note, only 20% Intralipid infusion induced a significant increase in plasma TG levels over time (Fig. 1C). Based on the above studies we chose to carry out most of our infusions for 6 h. We also conducted some studies with 3-h infusions. There were no differences in the base-line (pre-infusion) concentrations of TG, FA, glucose, or insulin among the 6 mm OA-, 20% Intralipid-, and saline infusion-treated mice (Table II). In particular, base-"

We propose that arginine regeneration, that is the recycling of citrulline back to arginine, defines the essential source of arginine for NO production. To support this proposal, RNA interference analysis was used to selectively reduce the expression of argininosuccinate synthase (AS), because the only known metabolic role for AS in endothelial cells is in the regeneration of l-arginine from l-citrulline. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant and dose-dependent reduction of AS protein as a result of AS small interfering RNA treatment with a corresponding diminished capacity to produce basal or stimulated levels of NO, despite saturating levels of arginine in the medium. Unanticipated, however, was the finding that the viability of AS small interfering RNA-treated endothelial cells was significantly decreased when compared with control cells. Trypan blue exclusion analysis suggested that the loss of viability was not because of necrosis. Two indicators, reduced expression of Bcl-2 and an increase in caspase activity, which correlated directly with reduced expression of AS, suggested that the loss of viability was because of apoptosis. The exposure of cells to an NO donor prevented apoptosis associated with reduced AS expression. Overall, these results demonstrate the essential role of AS for endothelial NO production and cell viability.

Physiol. 2001; 187: 277-282Google Scholar). Moreover, NO has a dual role in cell viability depending on the tissue type and concentration. Either very high or very low concentrations of NO may induce cell death, whereas basal concentrations may inhibit apoptosis (4Melino G. Catani M.V. Corazzari M. Guerrieri P. Bernassola F. Cell. Mol.

Argininosuccinate synthase (AS), the rate-limiting step (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Google Scholar) in the regeneration of arginine from citrulline, catalyzes the synthesis of argininosuccinate, AMP, and inorganic pyrophosphate from citrulline, ATP, and aspartate. Argininosuccinate is then cleaved by argininosuccinate lyase (AL) to produce l-arginine and fumarate. In the liver, AS and AL function together as components of the urea cycle, ultimately to form arginine from citrulline. Although the expression of AS and AL in the liver is high, both enzymes are found in most mammalian tissues, although at significantly lower levels. The discovery of arginine-derived NO, catalyzed by nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs), revealed a second role for AS and AL (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Google Scholar, 2Vallance P. Chan N. Heart. 2001; 85: 342-350Google Scholar, 3Gow A.J. Ischiropoulos H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 277-282Google Scholar). Together with NOS, they function as part of a citrulline-NO cycle where AS and AL convert citrulline to arginine, which is then oxidized to form NO and citrulline by NOS. Although both extracellular and intracellular concentrations of arginine are much higher than the reported Km of arginine for endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), NO production still appears to be limited by the availability of arginine (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Google Scholar, 14Xie L. Hattori Y. Tume N. Gross S.S. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 42-45Google Scholar, 15Sessa W.C. Hecker M. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R.

Biol. 2003; 206: 2083-2087Google Scholar). Recently, a DNA microarray analysis of shear stress-induced NO production demonstrated that up-regulation of AS was coordinated with an increase in NO production (21McCormick S.M. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Teng C.L. Lu C.M. Russell C.G. Chittur K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8955-8960Google Scholar), supporting an important role for AS in endothelial NO production. If AS is essential for endothelial NO production then even in the presence of excess arginine, depletion of AS should decrease the capacity of endothelial cells to produce NO. To test this hypothesis, RNA interference analysis was carried out using AS-specific RNA duplexes in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). In this report, we demonstrate a significant and dose-dependent reduction of AS protein following siRNA transfection. We also show a concomitant decrease in enzyme activity corresponding to a decrease in stimulated and unstimulated NO production in endothelial cells with reduced AS expression, despite excess arginine in the media. In addition, we demonstrate that the viability of endothelial cells grown in excess arginine and treated with AS siRNA was significantly diminished compared with control cells. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter glucose, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 units ml–1 penicillin, and 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin (Mediatech) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection, BAEC were seeded in a 24-well plate at 5 × 104 cells/well. Transfection of siRNA was carried out with TransIT-TKO (Mirus) as described by the manufacturer. For each well, 0.1–10 nm siRNA duplex was combined with 3 μl of liposome in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and applied to cells at 50–70% confluency. Cells were assayed after a 24–48-h transfection. RNA Duplex Preparation—A Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion) was used to synthesize the 21-nucleotide RNA duplexes. Target sequences were chosen following the guidelines described by Tuschl and colleagues (22Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Google Scholar). 2T. Tuschl, S. Elbashir, J. Harborth, and K. Weber (2002) mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html. The siRNA sequence specific to AS corresponded to bp 73–93 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon GGAGCAAGGCUAUGACGUCtt. A control siRNA, UAGAUGGAGAGGCACUCGCtt, was designed by scrambling the bases of the AS siRNA. Both sequences were subjected to a BLAST search to rule out homology to known proteins. Cell Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting—BAEC were trypsinized and then washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitors in phosphate-buffered saline) by vigorous pipetting followed by brief vortexing. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Equal amounts (5–10 μg) of protein were resolved on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and blotted onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 and subsequently washed. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody (1:2500 anti-AS (BD Transduction Laboratories), 1:1000 Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz), and 1:7500 anti-actin (Sigma)) in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Following washing, membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody in 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. The signal was visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and then exposed to film. Band intensities were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). RNA Isolation and Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR— Total RNA was isolated from transfected BAEC using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion, DNase-free) and quantitated prior to reverse transcription, which was performed as described previously (24Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Google Scholar). Real time quantitative PCR was performed using AS-specific primers ASL228 and ASR278 (24Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Google Scholar). Results were normalized to 18 S rRNA. Argininosuccinate Synthase Activity Assay—To assay AS activity in intact cells, BAEC were transfected with AS and control siRNA as described above. After incubation for 24 h, cells were depleted of arginine by incubation in synthetic Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 500 μm citrulline and no arginine. Cells were incubated for 30 min in this medium and then stimulated with sodium orthovanadate (50 μm) and A23187 calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) (25Hellermann G.R. Flam B.R. Eichler D.C. Solomonson L.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2045-2050Google Scholar) for 30 min. Nitric oxide production was measured as described below. Cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion following assay completion, and data were normalized as nitrite produced/h/1 × 106 cells. In a separate experiment, in vitro AS activity was assayed by measuring conversion of [3H]aspartate to [3H]argininosuccinate in cell lysates as described by O'Brien (26O'Brien W.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5353-5356Google Scholar) with the exception that [3H]aspartate (500 μm, 39 Ci/mmol) was used. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing protease inhibitors, 0.5 mm citrulline, and 0.5 mm aspartate followed by three cycles of freeze-thaw in a dry ice ethanol bath. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) for AS siRNA and control siRNA samples were added to each reaction, which contained citrulline (5 mm), Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.5), ATP (0.1 mm), MgCl2 (6 mm), KCl (920 mm), phosphoenolpyruvate (1.5 mm), pyruvate kinase (4.5 units), myokinase (4 units), and pyrophosphatase (0.2 units) in a final volume of 150 μl. Reactions were run for 90 min at 37 °C. At the end of the reaction period, 50 μl of 1 m acetic acid was added, and the tubes were heated to 90 °C for 30 min. Samples were brought up to 1 ml with water and applied to AG 1-X8 resin (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) in 0.05 m acetic acid. An additional 2 × 1 ml of 0.05 m acetic acid was applied to the columns. Radioactivity in the 3 ml of column flow-through ([3H]argininosuccinate) was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in CytoScint (MP Biomedical). Cell Viability—Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and counted by trypan blue exclusion. Briefly, 20 μl of the cell suspension was combined with 180 μl of trypan blue (Invitrogen), and cell counts were performed using a hemacytometer. Cell number was determined by averaging the cells in four squares, multiplying by the dilution factor (10Estrada C. Gomez C. Martin C. Moncada S. Gonzalez C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 475-482Google Scholar), multiplying by 10,000, and adjusting for cell volume to determine cells/well. Viability was also detected using a colorimetric assay that measures tetrazolium dye reduction as follows (27Martin A. Clynes M. Cytotechnology. 1993; 11: 49-58Google Scholar). siRNA transfections were carried out in 96-well plate format. AS knockdown and control BAEC were incubated with 20 μl/well (5 mg/ml stock) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) for 4 h under normal culture conditions. The medium was removed without disturbing the formazan crystals, and 100 μl/well Me2SO (Sigma) was used to resuspend the product. The plate was read on a μQuant spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments) at 570 nm. Necrotic cell death was measured using a commercially available cytotoxicity kit (Promega). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured in cell culture supernatants from AS knockdown and control cells using a FLUOstar Galaxy spectrofluorometer (BMB Labtechnologies) with 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission. Results were presented as the percent of the maximum LDH release, which was determined by complete lysis of cells. Apoptosis Detection—Caspase-3/7 activity was measured using Apo-ONE™ homogenous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega). Cells were transfected in 96-well plates with AS and control siRNA as described above. Cells were lysed, and caspase-3/7 activity was measured by cleavage of the caspase-3/7 substrate rhodamine 110 (bis-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid amide)), (Z-DEVD-R110). Samples were measured on a FLUOstar Galaxy spectrofluorometer with 492 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. For analysis of the effect an NO donor had on AS siRNA-induced apoptosis, BAEC were transfected with siRNA as described above. Four hours after transfection, the media were replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glyco-SNAP-2 (Calbiochem) and incubated for 48 h prior to caspase 3/7 detection. Nitric Oxide Assay—Twenty-four hours after transfection with siRNA, BAEC were stimulated with sodium orthovanadate (50 μm) and A23187 calcium ionophore (0.25 μm) (25Hellermann G.R. Flam B.R. Eichler D.C. Solomonson L.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2045-2050Google Scholar). Nitrite was measured in the medium as an indicator of cellular NO using a fluorometric method (28Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Google Scholar). Samples were read on a Jasco spectrofluorometer exciting at 365 nm and detecting emission at 409 nm. Following stimulation, cells were counted by trypan blue exclusion, and data are presented as nitrite produced/1 × 106 cells. Statistical Analyses—Experimental data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Each experiment was performed independently at least three times. Silencing of AS by siRNA Transfection—AS is known to catalyze the rate-limiting step (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Google Scholar) in arginine synthesis from citrulline and aspartate. Argininosuccinate lyase (AL) is also required for this conversion (29Hecker M. Sessa W.C. Harris H.J. Anggard E.E. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8612-8616Google Scholar). To further elucidate the function of AS in endothelial cells, particularly with respect to its role in NO production, we utilized the recently developed technique of siRNA to selectively reduce AS expression. A 21-nucleotide RNA duplex specific to the AS sequence was identified as outlined by Tuschl and colleagues (30Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar) 2T. Tuschl, S. Elbashir, J. Harborth, and K. Weber (2002) mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html. and compared with known sequences using BLAST search to eliminate any sequences homologous to other genes. The AS siRNA was transcribed in vitro using the Silencer siRNA construction kit. A control siRNA was synthesized containing the same base composition as the AS siRNA but in a scrambled sequence. BAEC were transfected with 10 nm AS or control siRNA (except where indicated in the figures) for 24 h. AS protein levels were monitored by immunoblot analysis, and as shown in Fig. 1A, AS siRNA treatment specifically reduced cellular AS protein levels to less than 50% of control levels. To determine whether reduction of AS protein correlated to the reduction of AS mRNA, total RNA was isolated, and AS message was quantitated by real time reverse transcriptase-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, AS siRNA treatment resulted in a reduction of AS mRNA that correlated with the reduction of AS protein. Argininosuccinate Synthase Activity Is Reduced in AS siRNA-treated Cells—Previously we have demonstrated that citrulline was sufficient to sustain NO production in the absence of arginine, based on the presence of the recycling enzymes AS and AL. To confirm that the functional activity of AS was decreased in intact cells, corresponding to the observed decrease in protein expression, cells were equilibrated in arginine-free medium containing 500 μm citrulline for 30 min and then stimulated with sodium orthovanadate and A23187 to give maximal NO production (25Hellermann G.R. Flam B.R. Eichler D.C. Solomonson L.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2045-2050Google Scholar). Nitric oxide production was measured as nitrite using the 2,3-diaminonaphthalene assay (28Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Google Scholar). In the endothelial cells with reduced AS expression, nitric oxide production/cell was decreased by more than 80%, indicating a significant reduction in activity of the enzyme (Table I). For a direct measure of in vitro AS activity, conversion of [3H]aspartate to [3H]argininosuccinate in lysates from siRNA-treated cells was assayed (26O'Brien W.E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5353-5356Google Scholar). Activity in control cells was 2.9 pmol/min/mg, whereas activity in AS siRNA-treated cells was only 0.8 pmol/min/mg confirming that expression and activity of AS protein was reduced as a result of AS siRNA treatment-(Table II).Table IEffect of AS siRNA transfection on endothelial NO productionConditionControl siRNAAS siRNARatio AS siRNA/control siRNAnmol nitrite/h/1 × 106 cellsStimulated, + citrulline0.98 ± 0.200.14 ± 0.090.14Stimulated, + arginine5.40 ± 0.962.38 ± 0.370.44Basal, + arginine0.35 ± 0.080.12 ± 0.010.34 Open table in a new tab Table IIEffect of AS siRNA transfection on AS activityConditionAS activityRatio AS siRNA/control siRNApmol/min/mgAS siRNA0.81 ± 0.170.28Control siRNA2.89 ± 0.58 Open table in a new tab Reduction of Stimulated NO Production in AS-depleted BAEC—If the production of arginine from citrulline, catalyzed by the enzymes AS and AL, provided an essential source of arginine for NO production in endothelial cells, a reduction of AS protein expression should result in a decrease in the amount of NO produced upon stimulation (13Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Google Scholar, 14Xie L. Hattori Y. Tume N. Gross S.S. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 42-45Google Scholar, 15Sessa W.C. Hecker M. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R.

Physiol. 1995; 269: L581-L587Google Scholar) despite saturating levels of extracellular arginine. To test whether AS is essential for endothelial NO production, AS siRNA-treated BAEC were stimulated with sodium orthovanadate and calcium ionophore in the presence of excess extracellular arginine (∼500 μm), and NO release was determined. As shown in Table I, reduction in AS expression resulted in a 56% decrease in stimulated NO produced as compared with control. Because nitrite levels were normalized to the number of cells counted by trypan blue exclusion, the decrease in NO detected could be attributed to a decrease in production for each viable cell as opposed to any effect on cell viability. These results demonstrate that sufficient levels of AS must be expressed to maintain NO production and that arginine regeneration plays an essential role in stimulated NO production in endothelial cells even in the presence of excess arginine. AS Silencing Results in a Reduced Basal Level of NO Production—The significant effect of AS silencing on stimulated NO production in endothelial cells led us to investigate whether basal (unstimulated) levels of NO production in BAEC were also reduced by AS siRNA treatment. Twenty-four hours after transfection with AS and control siRNAs, the media were replaced with fresh media (containing excess arginine and no phenol red indicator), and samples were collected after 24 h for nitrite determination. Cell number was assessed by trypan blue exclusion analysis, and results are presented as nitrite produced/h/1 × 106 cells. As shown in Table I, a significant reduction (70%) in basal production of NO was observed in BAEC, whereas AS expression had been decreased by siRNA transfection. Thus, AS expression is also required to sustain unstimulated levels of NO produced by endothelial cells even in the presence of excess levels of extracellular arginine. Decrease in Cell Survival in AS-depleted BAEC—Interestingly, AS siRNA treatment of endothelial cells resulted in a noticeable and unexpected decrease in cell viability over control cells. To confirm this observation, AS siRNA-treated cells were evaluated for viability by trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Fig. 2A, a 46% decrease in cell survival was observed compared with control. To further substantiate this observation, cellular respiration was measured as a marker of viability using the MTT assay 24 h after AS siRNA transfection. MTT assay also showed a 40% decrease in cell survival in AS-depleted endothelial cells (Fig. 2B). A reduction of AS protein beyond the levels achieved in this study was not possible because of extensive cell death associated with further increased concentrations of the AS siRNA. LDH Release in AS-transfected BAEC—During necrosis, cells become permeable allowing the leakage of proteins into the media. A marker used to detect this phenomenon is the release of LDH into the culture medium (31Korzeniewski C. Callewaert D.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 64: 313-320Google Scholar). After treatment with AS and control siRNA, cell cultures were assayed for LDH activity in the media. Although treatment with AS siRNA resulted in a loss of cell viability, there was no significant difference in LDH activity detected in the media in AS siRNA-transfected cells as compared with the control (Fig. 3). These results suggested that the loss of cell viability resulting from partial AS depletion was not necrosis. Reduction in Bcl-2 Levels in Cells with Reduced AS Expression—Because trypan blue exclusion analysis, as well as the absence of LDH release, suggested that necrosis was not the pathway directing cell death in cells with reduced AS expression, the possible involvement of apoptosis was investigated. Bcl-2 is known to be an important protein expressed in many cell types, including endothelial cells, that protects against apoptosis (32Borner C. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 615-647Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis accounted for the loss of viability in AS knockdown cells, lysates from cells transfected with AS and control siRNAs were prepared, and Bcl-2 expression was determined by standard Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, a significant decrease in Bcl-2 protein was detected in AS-depleted cells as compared with control consistent with the suggestion that the observed loss of cell viability results from the induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis-inducing Factor Is Unaffected by Depletion of AS—In a recently described pathway in endothelial cells, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was identified as an important regulator of apoptosis that circumvents the requirement for caspase-3 activation in the induction of apoptosis (33Zhang W. Shokeen M. Li D. Mehta J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 147-151Google Scholar). To examine whether increased levels of AIF result from AS siRNA treatment, cell lysates from AS and control siRNA-treated cells were subjected to Western blot analysis to monitor changes in AIF protein expression. As shown in Fig. 5A, there was no significant effect on AIF levels resulting from AS siRNA treatment that would account for the loss of cell viability induced by an apoptotic response. Increase in Caspase-3/7 Activation in BAEC Depleted of AS—Because of the observed degradation of Bcl-2 protein and the lack of effect on AIF protein, the effect of AS silencing on caspase activation was investigated. Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease that on activation of the apoptotic cascade is proteolytically cleaved from an inactive procaspase form to an active caspase. Following partial AS depletion, there was an over 3-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity compared with control cells (Fig. 5B). This finding strongly supports the proposal that the reduction of AS expression results in induction of apoptosis. Treatment of AS siRNA-transfected BAEC with an NO Donor Prevents Apoptosis—Basal NO production in endothelial cells has been suggested to prevent the induction of apoptosis (34Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 601-607Google Scholar) first by decreasing the mRNA stability of MAP kinase phosphatase-3 (35Rossig L. Haendeler J. Hermann C. Malchow P. Urbich C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25502-25507Google Scholar) and second, by directly inactivating caspase-3 via S-nitrosylation of its active site thiol (36Rossig L. Fichtlscherer B. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. Mulsch A. Dimmeler S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6823-6826Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7). To determine whether a reduction in basal NO production caused by AS knockdown correlated with the observed increase in apoptosis, BAEC were treated with Glyco-SNAP-2 (Calbiochem), an NO donor with a half-life of 27.4 h. Glyco-SNAP-2 (25–400 μm) was added to the media immediately following the transfection with AS siRNA. Forty-eight hours after transfection, caspase 3/7 activity was determined to quantitate the level of the apoptotic response. As shown in Fig. 6, AS siRNA-induced apoptosis in treated endothelial cells was decreased proportionately by the concentration of exogenous NO donor added. This correlation suggests that induction of apoptosis may be due, in part, to the reduction in basal NO production that results from AS knockdown, although a more direct effect of AS protein on apoptosis cannot be excluded.Fig. 6Prevention of AS siRNA-induced apoptosis with an NO donor. BAEC were transfected with AS siRNA in 96-well plates. Immediately following transfection increasing concentrations of the NO donor, Glyco-SNAP"
https://openalex.org/W2164348385,"Mutation of the ALS2 gene encoding alsin is linked to the onset of autosomal recessive motor neuron diseases, including juvenile-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Alsin long form (LF) belongs to the family of the guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (GEF) for small GTPases. Expression of alsin LF, but not alsin short form, protected motor neuronal cells from toxicity induced by mutants of the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, which cause autosomal dominant ALS. In contrast, expression of alsin did not suppress neurotoxicity by other neurodegenerative insults such as Alzheimer's disease-related genes. Deletion analysis of alsin LF demonstrated that the RhoGEF domain is essential for alsin-mediated neuroprotection. Furthermore, we found that alsin LF bound to SOD1 mutants, but not to wtSOD1, via the RhoGEF domain. Such functional and physical interaction between two ALS-related genes will become a promising clue to clarify the pathogenesis of ALS and other motor neuron diseases.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common MND and is characterized by progressive loss of both upper and lower motor neurons (see Ref. 1Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Google Scholar for review). Primary lateral sclerosis is a rare MND with selective loss of upper motor neurons. Typical ALS occurs sporadically for middle-aged persons and is fatal within 1-5 years of the onset of the disease. In 90-95% of instances, there is no obvious genetic linkage, but the remaining 5-10% of cases show familial inheritance. The hereditary pattern is mostly autosomal dominant, but there are rare patient groups suffering from autosomal recessive ALS.Genetic analysis clarified that point mutations in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that removes oxidative stress by scavenging superoxides, are one cause of dominantly inherited ALS (2Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. Rahmani Z. Krizus A. McKennna-Yasek D. Cayabyab A. Gaston S.M. Berger R. Tanzi R.E.

Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Google Scholar). Multiple groups have reported that SOD1 mutants cause death in primary neurons and neuronal cell lines (3Ghadge G.D. Lee J.P. Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Ma L. Miller R.J. Roos R.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8756-8766Google Scholar, 4Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Tajima H. Yasukawa T. Sudo H. Ito Y. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Doyu M. Sobue G. Koide T. Tsuji S.

Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Google Scholar). Currently, SOD1 mutants are considered to cause ALS by gain of toxic function, and various hypotheses have been proposed regarding SOD1 mutant-mediated neurotoxicity. Expression of SOD1 mutants increased oxidative stress; the production of the reactive oxygen species is elevated by expression of SOD1 mutants (6Wiedau-Pazos M. Goto J.J. Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Roe J.A. Lee M.K. Valentine J.S. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1996; 271: 515-518Google Scholar), and hydroxyl radical generation is elevated in G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice (7Bogdanov M.B. Ramos L.E. Xu Z. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1321-1324Google Scholar). SOD1 mutants inhibit slow axonal transport; axonal transport is reduced in G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice (8Zhang B. Tu P. Abtahian F. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1307-1315Google Scholar), and slowing axonal transport occurs as a very early manifestation of toxicity by SOD1 mutants (9Williamson T.L. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 50-56Google Scholar). Also, expression of SOD1 mutants causes vacuolar degeneration of mitochondria (10Wong P.C. Pardo C.A. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1105-1116Google Scholar) and dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria (11Mattiazzi M. D'Aurelio M. Gajewski C.D. Martushova K. Kiaei M. Beal M.F. Manfredi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29626-29633Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of SOD1 mutants results in neurotoxic aggregation, irrespective of the presence of wt-SOD1, supporting the notion that SOD1 mutants cause neurotoxicity by gain of function (12Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Google Scholar, 13Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7021-7026Google Scholar). Despite such vigorous studies, the key molecular mechanisms for SOD1 mutant-induced motor neuronal death still remain unclear.Most recently, two groups have discovered the ALS2 gene on chromosome 2q33, which is linked to autosomal recessive ALS, from inbred families in the Middle East and North Africa (14Hadano S. Hand C.K. Osuga H. Yanagisawa Y. Otomo A. Devon R.S. Miyamoto N. Showguchi-Miyata J. Okada Y. Singaraja R. Figlewicz D.A. Kwiatkowski T. Hosler B.A. Sagie T. Skaug J. Nasir J. Brown Jr., R.H. Scherer S.W. Rouleau G.A. Hayden M.R. Ikeda J.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 166-173Google Scholar, 15Yang Y. Hentati A. Deng H.X. Dabbagh O. Sasaki T. Hirano M. Hung W.Y. Ouahchi K. Yan J. Azim A.C. Cole N. Gascon G. Yagmour A. Ben-Hamida M. Pericak-Vance M. Hentati F. Siddique T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 160-165Google Scholar). The protein encoded by the ALS2 gene has been named alsin (15Yang Y. Hentati A. Deng H.X. Dabbagh O. Sasaki T. Hirano M. Hung W.Y. Ouahchi K. Yan J. Azim A.C. Cole N. Gascon G. Yagmour A. Ben-Hamida M. Pericak-Vance M. Hentati F. Siddique T. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 160-165Google Scholar). The ALS2 gene has two splicing variants; the longer variant encodes alsin long form (LF) consisting of 1657 amino acids, and the shorter encodes alsin short form (SF) consisting of 396 amino acids (Fig. 1). Although the function of alsin has been little understood, it has been noted that alsin LF has three small GTPase regulator-homologous domains as follows: the regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) domain, the Rho guanine nucleotide exchanging factor (RhoGEF) domain, and the vacuolar protein sorting 9 (VPS9) domain, each of which is considered to act as a GTPase regulator (14Hadano S. Hand C.K. Osuga H. Yanagisawa Y. Otomo A. Devon R.S. Miyamoto N. Showguchi-Miyata J. Okada Y. Singaraja R. Figlewicz D.A. Kwiatkowski T. Hosler B.A. Sagie T. Skaug J. Nasir J. Brown Jr., R.H. Scherer S.W. Rouleau G.A. Hayden M.R. Ikeda J.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 166-173Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that Otomo et al. (16Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Google Scholar) found that the VPS9 domain of alsin acts as a GEF for the small GTPase Rab5 and is involved in endosomal dynamics (16Otomo A. Hadano S. Okada T. Mizumura H. Kunita R. Nishijima H. Showguchi-Miyata J. Yanagisawa Y. Kohiki E. Suga E. Yasuda M. Osuga H. Nishimoto T. Narumiya S. Ikeda J.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1671-1687Google Scholar), suggesting that alsin plays a role in a certain intracellular signal transduction pathway and/or a cytoplasmic transport system. However, the functions and roles of the other domains of alsin LF remain totally unclear.From families suffering from MNDs on the Arabian Peninsula and in North Africa, three ALS2 mutations were identified. All ALS2 mutations give rise to C-terminally truncated alsin proteins due to frameshifts caused by nucleotide deletions (Fig. 1). All affected individuals harbor a homozygous alsin mutation. The Tunisian mutation (138delA), affecting both alsin LF and SF, causes juvenile-onset ALS, a severe MND with progressive disturbance of both upper and lower motor neurons, in the first or second decade of life. In contrast, both Kuwaiti (1425-1426delAG) and Saudi (1867-1868delCT) mutants affect alsin LF exclusively, and patients exhibit primary lateral sclerosis phenotype with impairment of upper motor neurons. Recently, it is reported that other alsin truncations also lead to another MND, infantile onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (17Eymard-Pierre E. Lesca G. Dollet S. Santorelli F.M. di Capua M. Bertini E. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 518-527Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized from these observations that loss of some functions of alsin results in MND.In this study, we examined functions of alsin by using alsin LF, alsin SF, alsin native mutants (alsin-Tunisian, alsin-Kuwaiti, and alsin-Saudi), and some other artificial alsin mutants (Fig. 1). First, we found that alsin LF, but not alsin SF, protected NSC34 cells, the model cell line for motor neurons (18Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Google Scholar), from SOD1 mutant-induced neurotoxicity. The RhoGEF domain is involved in alsin LF-mediated neuroprotection. Second, we found that alsin LF physically binds to SOD1 mutants. The site responsible for alsin LF binding to SOD1 mutants is located in the alsin RhoGEF domain. This novel interaction, both functional and physical, between independently identified ALS-causative genes would provide an essential clue to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying ALS and other MNDs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—The mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody were purchased from Sigma. The mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody, the mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody, and HRP-conjugated anti-HisG antibody which recognizes His6Gly tag were purchased from Invitrogen. The mouse monoclonal anti-human SOD1 antibody was purchased from MBL International Corp. (Nagoya, Japan). The goat polyclonal anti-SOD1 antibody recognizing both mouse and human SOD1, the rabbit polyclonal anti-His6 antibody, and the HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody and the HRP-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit antibody were purchased from Bio-Rad.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Death Assay—NSC34 cells were provided by Dr. Neil Cashman of the University of Toronto and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. NSC34 cell is a hybrid cell line of motor neurons, derived from embryonic mouse spinal cord cells and mouse neuroblastoma (18Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Google Scholar, 19Durham H.D. Dahrouge S. Cashman N.R. Neurotoxicology. 1993; 14: 387-395Google Scholar). These cells are one of the best models for primary cultured motor neurons exhibiting a number of characteristics for primary cultured motor neurons, including generation of action potential, acetylcholine synthesis, storage, and release.For transient transfection of ALS2 and other genes, NSC34 cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate, cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS for 12-16 h, and then transfected with ALS2 or other genes by lipofection (DNA:LipofectAMINE:PLUS Reagent = 1 μg, 2 μl, 4 μl) in the absence of serum for 3 h. LipofectAMINE and PLUS Reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. The transfected NSC34 cells were incubated with DMEM plus 10% FBS. Twenty-four hours after the onset of transfection, the culture medium was changed to DMEM plus N2 supplement (Invitrogen), and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. In specified experiments, cells were cultured in the presence of 2 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) for 24 h just before the harvest. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cell mortality was measured by the trypan blue exclusion assay performed as follows. Cells were suspended by pipetting gently, and 50 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma) was mixed with 200 μl of the cell suspension (final concentration 0.08%) at room temperature. Stained cells were counted within 3 min after the mixture with trypan blue solution. The mortality of cells was then determined as a percentage of trypan blue-stained cells in total cells. Cell mortality assessed by this method thus represents the population of dead cells in total cells, including both adhesive and floating cells at the termination of experiments. It has been established by our reported experiments that our cell mortality assay by the trypan blue exclusion test gives precisely reciprocal results of WST-8 assay, the most established cell viability assay (20Hashimoto Y. Jiang H. Niikura T. Ito Y. Hagiwara A. Umezawa K. Abe Y. Murayama Y. Nishimoto I. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8401-8409Google Scholar). WST-8 assay was performed with 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8), using Cell Counting kit-8 (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Tokyo, Japan). After transfection, cells were incubated for 72 h and then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and 1/10 volume (100 μl) of the cell suspension was incubated with 10 μl of WST-8 solution in a 96-well plate for 2 h at 37 °C. Absorbance of the samples at 450 nm wavelength was measured by Wallac 1420 ARVOsx Multi Label Counter.DNA Construction—Full-length alsin SF cDNA was obtained from human heart cDNA (BioChain) by PCR using a sense primer (ACTAGTACCATGGACCAAAGAAGAGAAGCTC) and an antisense primer (GCGGCCGCGCTACCAAGCCTTACCCCTTTTAAAG). Full-length alsin LF cDNA was generated by fusing three DNA fragments. We used the alsin SF cDNA as the first fragment. The second fragment, corresponding to the region from the first EcoRI site to the NheI site of alsin LF, was obtained from human thalamus cDNA (BioChain) by PCR using a sense primer (GCTTCCATAGTGGAGCAGTGACAGAC) and an antisense primer (GCGGCCGCCTCAATGAGGCTCCATGCTGACC). The third fragment, corresponding to the region from the NheI site to the last amino acid, was obtained from human heart cDNA by PCR using a sense primer (GCCACTACAGGAAGACCCAG) and an antisense primer (GCGGCCGCGTTAAGCTTCTCACGCTGAATCTGG). The structure of the reconstituted alsin LF cDNA was examined by sequencing. Alsin cDNAs were subcloned into the pEF1/Myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen). Mouse alsin cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR. Total RNA extracted from murine cerebrum using ISOGEN kit (Nippon Gene) was used for RT-PCR with a High Fidelity RNA PCR kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Before generating the full-length mouse alsin cDNA, we amplified two cDNA fragments by RT-PCR. The first fragment, spanning from the start codon to the EcoRV site, was obtained by RT-PCR using a sense primer (ACTAGTACCATGGACTCAAAGAAGAAAAGCTCAAC) and an antisense primer (TTGGCACACATCATCCTGCC). The second fragment, spanning from the EcoRV site to the last amino acid, was obtained by RT-PCR using a sense primer (GCATGTTCATTGGCCAGTGG) and an antisense primer (GCGGCCGCGTTAAGCTTCTCCCGCTGAATC). The reconstituted mouse ALS2 gene was subcloned into the pEF1/Myc-His plasmid. We used alsin LF as the template for cDNA synthesis of the alsin Tunisian mutant and performed site-directed mutagenesis to delete a nucleotide (138delA) with a sense primer (GTTTTGCAGGCGCCCTCGGAGGCGGCCGCATGGAGTTCTTCTGACTGAAG) and an antisense primer (CTTCAGTCAGAAGAACTCCATGCGGCCGCCTCCGAGGGCGCCTGCAAAAC). We used alsin LF as the template for cDNA synthesis of the alsin-Kuwaiti mutant and performed site-directed mutagenesis to delete two nucleotides (1425-1426delAG) with a sense primer (GGATATCAGAGAAGAAGAAACAGGGAGGCAGTCGAAG) and an antisense primer (CTTCGACTGCCTCCCTGTTTCTTCTTCTCTGATATCC). We used alsin LF as the template for the alsin-Saudi mutant and performed site-directed mutagenesis to delete two nucleotides (1867-1868delCT) using a sense primer (GCTGCAGGCAGGGATTATTCCGTTTTTAGTGGATACAGAAG) and an antisense primer (CTTCTGTATCCACTAAAAACGGAATAATCCCTGCCTGCAGC). The alsin-Tunisian mutant cDNA, the alsin-Kuwaiti mutant cDNA, and the alsin-Saudi mutant cDNA were subcloned into pEF1/Myc-His vector. cDNA for alsin-(1-756) was derived from alsin LF. For synthesis of alsin-(1-1048) cDNA, we performed PCR with a sense primer (ACTAGTACCATGGACCAAAGAAGAGAAGCTC) and an antisense primer (GCGGCCGCGGTGGCATCCTTTAGGCGAGG), and we subcloned its product into pEF1/Myc-His vector. For cDNA synthesis of alsin DH-PH, alsin DH, and alsin PH, we used alsin LF as the template. We performed PCR with a sense primer (GGGTACCATGCTCCACGAGTTAGCTACTAC) for alsin DH-PH and alsin DH, or another sense primer (CGGGATCCGGGAGGTTTTCCGTGAATTGG) for alsin PH, together with an antisense primer (GGAATTCAGCAAGACACTCATAACAAGAACTGG) for alsin DH-PH, and alsin PH or another antisense primer (GGAATTCAGCCTGATCTACGGCTTGGC) for alsin DH. Alsin DH-PH, alsin DH, and alsin PH were subcloned into the pEF4/His vector (Invitrogen). Alsin cDNA fragments with amino acids deletion from 86th to 371st were constructed as follows. In order to delete the region common to alsin LF and SF, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to create another XbaI site using a sense primer (GCATGGTGAAAAGCCAATGCCATCTAGAACCTCTTTTAGAAGAAGCAATTCC) and an antisense primer (GGAATTGCTTCTTCTAAAAGAGGTTCTAGATGGCATTGGCTTTTCACCATGC). After digestion with XbaI, the plasmids were self-ligated. cDNAs encoding wtSOD1, A4T-SOD1, G85R-SOD1, and G93R-SOD1, kindly provided by Dr. Shoji Tsuji of the University of Tokyo, were subcloned into pFLAGCMV-5a (pFLAG; Eastman Kodak Co.).Immunoprecipitation—NSC34 cells were seeded on a 6-well plate and transiently co-transfected with pEF1/Myc-His-alsin LF, alsin SF, or one of alsin mutants together with pFLAG-wtSOD1 or pFLAG-SOD1 mutants. After 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested and solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) for 8 h at 4 °C, washed three times with the lysis buffer, and finally eluted by boiling in 4% SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Only when vectors encoding SOD1 mutants without the FLAG tag were used for co-transfection, the immunoprecipitation was performed with the goat polyclonal anti-SOD1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences).Immunoblotting—Cell lysates (20 μg/lane) or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection of various alsin derivatives, membranes were probed with the primary anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:2000, Invitrogen) and the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000, Bio-Rad), followed by visualization of the immunoreactive bands by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Alsin DH-PH and alsin DH were detected by the anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) and the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000, Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting of various SOD1 constructs was similarly performed with the primary mouse monoclonal anti-SOD1 antibody (MBL International Corp.) and the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad). Alsin and its derivatives were probed with the anti-His6 antibody or the HRP-conjugated anti-HisG antibody, and SOD1 was probed with the anti-SOD1 polyclonal antibody or the HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody in some experiments. Immunoblotting of presenilin1 (PS1), presenilin2 (PS2), and amyloid-β precurser protein (AβPP) was performed as described previously (4Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Tajima H. Yasukawa T. Sudo H. Ito Y. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Doyu M. Sobue G. Koide T. Tsuji S. Lang J. Kurokawa K. Nishimoto I. Proc..Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98 (Correction (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kita Y. Terashita K. Nishimoto I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 736-745Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments of alsin LF, derivatives of alsin LF and SOD1, we chose the antibody for immunoblotting to minimize the background staining derived from the immunoglobulin. Consequently, the antibody used for immunoblotting of inputs was sometimes different from the one used for immunoblotting of co-immunoprecipitates.Immunostaining—NSC34 cells were seeded on a 6-well plate and transiently transfected with indicated constructs. After 48 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and labeled with anti-His6 antibody. Secondary antibody was rhodamine-swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako). Fluorescence signals were detected with a laser scanning confocal microscope LSM (Carl Zeiss, Germany).RESULTSExpression of SOD1 Mutants Induces Death of Motor Neuronal Cells, NSC34 Cells—Multiple groups have reported that overexpression of SOD1 mutants induces cell death for neuronal cell lines and primary neurons (3Ghadge G.D. Lee J.P. Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Ma L. Miller R.J. Roos R.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8756-8766Google Scholar, 23Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Google Scholar). In agreement, we have observed that mutant SOD1 expression causes cell death in F11 neurohybrid cells (hybrid cells of rat primary dorsal root ganglion neurons and mouse neuroblastoma cells) (4Hashimoto Y. Niikura T. Tajima H. Yasukawa T. Sudo H. Ito Y. Kita Y. Kawasumi M. Kouyama K. Doyu M. Sobue G. Koide T. Tsuji S. Lang J. Kurokawa K. Nishimoto I. Proc..Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98 (Correction (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.98, 12854): 6336-6341Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SOD1 mutants have the potential to induce cell death for at least certain types of neuronal cells. To confirm that neurotoxicity induced by overexpression of SOD1 mutants involves the motoneuronal cells, we performed a cell death assay using NSC34 cells as an established model for motor neurons. NSC34 is a hybrid cell line generated by fusing embryonic mouse spinal cord cells, in which motor neurons are highly enriched with mouse neuroblastoma cells (18Cashman N.R. Durham H.D. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Google Scholar, 19Durham H.D. Dahrouge S. Cashman N.R. Neurotoxicology. 1993; 14: 387-395Google Scholar). It is used worldwide as a model for primary cultured motor neurons with a number of motoneuronal characteristics, including occurrence of action potentials as well as synthesis, storage, and release of acetylcholine. We transiently transfected NSC34 cells with wild-type SOD1 (wtSOD1) or SOD1 mutants (A4T-, G85R-, and G93R-SOD1). Seventy-two hours after the transfection, the trypan blue exclusion assay was performed to calculate cell mortality (Fig. 2A). Transient expression of A4TSOD1 mutant resulted in ∼50% decrease in viable cells. Similar results were obtained from expression of G85R-SOD1 and G93R-SOD1. In contrast, expression of wtSOD1 did not induce cell death in NSC34 cells.Fig. 2Alsin effects on cell viability of the NSC34 cells treated with SOD1 mutants. Cell mortality was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay 72 h after transfection. Immunoblot analysis was performed with the anti-Myc antibody for alsin or the anti-SOD1 antibody for SOD1. A, expression of SOD1 mutants, but not wtSOD1, induces cell death in the motor neuronal cells, NSC34. NSC34 cells were transfected with the pEF-BOS vector (vec), pEF-BOS-wtSOD1 (wtSOD1), or one of SOD1 mutants as indicated. As a negative control, cell mortality without transfection (no) was measured. B, alsin LF, but not alsin SF, protects neuronal cells form toxicity by SOD1 mutants. NSC34 cells were co-transfected with the pEF-BOS vector (Vec), A4T-SOD1, G85R-SOD1, or G93R-SOD1 together with pEF1/Myc-His vector, pEF1/Myc-His-alsin LF (LF), or pEF1/Myc-His-alsin SF (SF). C, mouse alsin protects neuronal cells from toxicity by SOD1 mutant. NSC34 cells were co-transfected with the pEF-BOS vector (vector), or A4T-SOD1 together with pEF1/Myc-His vector, mouse alsin, or alsin LF. D, alsin-(1-1048), but not alsin-(1-756) or alsin MND mutants, protects neuronal cells from toxicity by SOD1 mutants. NSC34 cells were co-transfected with the pEF-BOS vector or A4T-SOD1 together with pEF1/Myc-His vector (vec), alsin LF (LF), alsin SF (SF), alsin-Kuwaiti (Kuwaiti), alsin-Saudi (Saudi), alsin-(1-756) (756), or alsin-(1-1048) (1048).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Alsin LF Protects Neuronal Cells from Toxicity by SOD1 Mutants—All known mutants of alsin in MNDs are C-terminally truncated due to nucleotide frameshifts (alsin LF is selectively truncated in most cases). Considering that this type of MND is recessively inherited, truncation-specific loss of function of alsin is assumed to contribute to selective disappearance of motor neurons in ALS. On the contrary, almost all SOD1 mutants have amino acid substitutions, and furthermore, some mutants maintain their original function as a scavenger of free radicals (24Radunovic A. Leigh P.N. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1996; 61: 565-572Google Scholar). They are therefore considered to cause ALS by gain of toxic function. Based on these assumptions, we further hypothesized that alsin plays an essential role in survival of motor neurons and that overexpression of alsin, especially alsin LF, may antagonize and suppress neurotoxicity induced by SOD1 mutants.When NSC34 cells were transfected with A4T-SOD1 alone, cell mortality was drastically increased (Fig. 2B). When these cells were co-transfected with A4T-SOD1 and alsin LF, cell mortality was kept almost completely to the mortality level of cells transfected with the pEF-BOS backbone vector alone. Similar results were obtained from cell death assays using G85R-SOD1 and G93R-SOD1 (Fig. 2B), and these results indicate that alsin protected cells from SOD1 mutant-induced neurotoxicity. Note that alsin LF did not inhibit expression of SOD1 mutants (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The murine alsin ortholog, termed mouse alsin, has neuroprotective activity similar to alsin LF (Fig. 2C). In contrast, alsin SF did not have neuroprotective activity. The MND mutants of alsin, alsin-Kuwaiti and alsin-Saudi, lost neuroprotective activity against SOD1 mutant-induced neurotoxicity (Fig. 2D).The RhoGEF Domain Is Essential for Alsin-mediated Neuroprotection—To specify the domain for alsin-mediated neuroprotection, we constructed two alsin deletion mutants, alsin-(1-756) (the N-terminal 756 amino acids residues of alsin) and alsin-(1-1048) (Fig. 1), and we then examined their rescue function. Alsin-(1-756) could not protect neuronal cells from A4T-SOD1-induced neurotoxicity, whereas alsin-(1-1048), which contains the entire RhoGEF domain, elicited full neuroprotective activity (Fig. 2D). The RhoGEF domain was therefore considered to be essential for alsin LF to exert neuroprotection from SOD1 mutant-induced"

Here, we show that in the distal region the NR1 promoter has an active NF-κB site sharing the consensus with the immunoglobulin (Ig)/human immunodeficiency virus NF-κB site. Mutation of this site significantly reduced NR1 promoter up-regulation during neuronal differentiation of P19 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that P19 nuclei constitutively contained p50 and that neuronal differentiation not only increased nuclear p50 but also induced p65 nuclear translocation. Responding to this change was an up-regulation of NF-κB-dependent promoter activity. However, inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation by an IκBα super-repressor or decoy DNA only moderately inhibited NR1 promoter up-regulation. Interestingly, the NR1 NF-κB site strongly interacted with Sp3/Sp1, instead of NF-κB factors, in P19 nuclear extracts. This interaction was reduced for Sp3 following neuronal differentiation, accompanied by dynamic expression of Sp factors. Cotransfection of Sp factors (Sp1, 3, or 4) upregulated the NR1 NF-κB site dramatically in differentiated neurons, but only moderately in undifferentiated P19 cells. This up-regulation was strong for Sp1 in differentiated cells and for Sp3 in undifferentiated cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays further demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 interacted with the NR1 NF-κB site in situ, and Sp3 lost its interaction after neuronal differentiation. We conclude that the NF-κB site positively regulates the NR1 promoter during neuronal differentiation via interacting mainly with Sp factors and neuronal differentiation reduces the effect of Sp3 factor on this site.

The essential component of the NMDA receptor complexes is encoded by the NR1 gene (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar, 2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). This gene is induced during neurogenesis and up-regulated in neurons undergoing differentiation (3Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2819) Google Scholar, 4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In studies of NR1 gene upregulation, a negative mechanism has been proposed: repressor element 1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor (REST)/neuron-restriction silencer factor (NRSF) acts on the RE1 site in the NR1 promoter and suppresses transcription in neural progenitors. After neurogenesis, REST/NRSF is down-regulated, and the suppression of the NR1 gene is removed to let de-repression occur (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In studies of neuronal differentiation of P19 cells, we observed that there was a time gap between the down-regulation of the REST/NRSF protein and the gradually robust upregulation of the NR1 mRNA/promoter activity during neuronal differentiation (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that a positive mechanism is required for NR1 gene transcription after de-repression. The NR1 promoter contains in the proximal region GC-boxes and MEF2 sites that interact with transcription activators sensitive to neuronal differentiation and thus could contribute to this positive mechanism (5Krainc D.

Brain Res. 2002; 107: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, our recent observation suggests that the distal region of this promoter is required for fully up-regulated transcription (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and very likely contains one or more important enhancers that positively respond to the signals of neuronal differentiation. Sequence analysis of the NR1 promoter uncovered a putative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) site in the region distal to the transcription start points (TSPs) (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). NF-κB sites interact with dimerized NF-κB factors and positively regulates cis-promoter. Five different NF-κB factors have been found in mammalian tissues, p65 (Rel-A), p50, p52, C-Rel, and RelB. Homo- or heterodimers of NF-κB factors are associated with IκB factor in the cytoplasm and remain inactive. Activating signals triggered by environmental cues induce IκB dissociation, thus releasing NF-κB dimers that then become activated and nuclearly translocated to regulate transcription of target genes (8Lipton S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Mattson M.P. Culmsee C. Yu Z. Camandola S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 10Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). In the nervous system, NF-κB activity is differentially distributed in the developing brain at different stages (11O'Neill L.A. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). For example, p50 appears in the early gastrula stage followed by the appearance of p65/c-Rel in neurons during the postnatal period (12Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Terenius L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 20: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mature neurons p65 and p50 NF-κB factors are constitutively expressed, and other NF-κB factors may be induced by selective stimuli, such as neuronal differentiation (11O'Neill L.A. Kaltschmidt C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 252-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 13Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 9077-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although putative NF-κB sites were found in several neuronal genes (15Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Terenius L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Farina A.R. Tacconelli A. Vacca A. Maroder M. Gulino A. Mackay A.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1999; 10: 353-367PubMed Google Scholar, 17Miyasaka N. Hatanaka Y. Jin M. Arimatsu Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), their impact on promoter activation during neuronal differentiation is largely undefined. NMDA receptors are also involved in brain development (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of NMDA receptors provides the major neuronal signal for activation of the NF-κB factors (13Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9618-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 14Guerrini L. Blasi F. Denis-Donini S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9077-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, whether NF-κB factors are able to regulate the NMDA receptor genes and thus promote their maturation may be important for retaining long term activation of NF-κB factors in neurons undergoing differentiation or in mature neurons. Recent studies revealed that the Sp1 transcription factor that usually binds GC-box (GGGGCGGGC) or GT (GGGTGTGGC) motifs (18Black A.R. Black J.D. Azizkhan-Clifford J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 143-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) exhibits a high affinity to a subset of NF-κB sites. For example, Sp1 activates NF-κB sites from the immunoglobulin κ-chain and P-selectin promoters (19Hirano F. Tanaka H. Hirano Y. Hiramoto M. Handa H. Makino I. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). NF-κB factors do not, however, share binding affinity to GC-box sequences. Most recently, it was reported that in the nervous system there is a neuronal κB-binding factor that binds the NF-κB consensus but is distinct from all identified NF-κB factors. This factor was found to be a complex consisting of Sp1, 3, and 4 (20Mao X. Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44911-44919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These factors are activators to most genes except that Sp3 may activate genes having a single GC-box (21Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16503-16508Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 22Prowse D.M. Bolgan L. Molnar A. Dotto G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) but repress Sp1-mediated transactivation of genes having multiple GC-boxes, possibly via competition for DNA binding sites (23Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 24Yu B. Datta P.K. Bagchi S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5368-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein modification studies also indicated that repressive Sp3 could become an activator after acetylation (25Ammanamanchi S. Freeman J.W. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35775-35780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that Sp factors (Sp1, 3, and 4) are activators to the NR1 promoter via an interaction with the tandem GC-boxes proximal to the TSPs (26Liu A. Prenger M.S. Norton D.D. Mei L. Kusiak J.W. Bai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45372-45379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Whether Sp factors also act on cis-element(s) existing in the distal region of the NR1 promoter remains unknown. In the present study, to search for positive mechanisms underlying the up-regulation of the NR1 gene during neuronal differentiation, we functionally analyzed the putative NR1 NF-κB site in P19 cells and cultured cerebrocortical neurons. We collected evidence to show that this putative site activated the NR1 promoter in cells undergoing neuronal differentiation. Additional studies demonstrated that, instead of NF-κB factors, this site mainly interacted with the Sp factors to up-regulate the promoter. Furthermore, interaction of this site with Sp factors in situ was demonstrated and, finally, Sp3 binding was shown to be lost following neuronal differentiation, while Sp1 binding became enhanced. Materials—Antibodies were obtained from following resources (followed by their catalogue numbers): Sp1 (07-124) from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Waltham, MA); Sp3 (sc13018x and sc644x), Sp4 (sc13019x and sc645x), p65 (sc-109x), p50 (sc-114x), p52 (sc-298x), and c-Rel (sc-272x) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant proteins of p50 and p49 were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). Construction of Reporter Genes and Expression Constructs—All plasmids used in this study have been described previously (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J.

Mutation of the NF-κB site in the rat NR1 promoter was conducted with a Quick Exchange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with primers GB402, 5′-TTAATGTCCTGGtaccTCCTGTCTAC, and GB403, 5′-GTAGACAGGAggtaCCAGGACATTAA (lowercased letters represent replaced bases) to form the construct pNRL5.4mtNFκB. Plasmid pNRL5.4mtGC carrying mutation of the tandem GC-boxes was generated by exchange of the KpnI-XbaI fragment between pNRL3029mtSp1 × 2 (27Liu A. Zhuang Z. Hoffman P.W. Bai G. J. Biol.

Preparation of Recombinant Adenovirus—Shuttle plasmid pAdTrack containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene driven by the early gene promoter of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and adenoviral backbone vector pAdEasy2 were obtained from Dr. Tong-Chuan He (Johns Hopkins University). Recombinant adenovirus rAdGFP expressing GFP was prepared using pAdTrack and AdEasy2 following the protocol described by He et al. (28He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Recombinant adenovirus rAdLacZ expressing the bacterial LacZ gene was provided generously by Dr. Christine L. Wilcox (Colorado State University). Recombinant adenovirus Ad5IκB encoding an IκBα super-repressor was a kind gift from Dr. David Brenner (University of Columbia). Amplification and titration of these viruses were accomplished by infecting HEK293 cells with virus following standard protocols (28He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). Infected HEK293 cells were lysed by a freeze-and-thaw protocol. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were saved at -80 °C until use. Cell Culture, Neuronal Differentiation, Transfection, Infection, and Reporter Assay—Previously described methods were used for culture of P19 cells (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J.

Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was accomplished with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instruction for cells growing in 12-well plates. Expression constructs were cotransfected with promoter-luciferase genes at a 4:1 ratio in the presence of pCMVβgal in an amount one-tenth that of the luciferase construct. Reporter gene assays and normalization of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase were carried out as reported previously (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For infection, selective rAd was added to cells by 100 plaque-forming units per cell for 24 h. Infection efficiency of differentiated P19 cells by rAd was tested with rAdGFP, and more than 80% of cells showed GFP green fluorescence 24 h after infection (data not shown). The stable cell line of P19 cells harboring the 5.4-kb NR1 promoter (P19NR1–5.4) has been described previously (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Establishment of the P19 cell line carrying the mutated 5.4-kb NR1 promoter or the NF-κB-luciferase gene was accomplished by cotransfection of pcDNA3 with pNRL5.4mtNFκB or κB-luc as described previously (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to form P19NR1–5.4mtNFκB and P19-NF-κB-luc cell lines, respectively. The κB-luc DNA was a gift from Dr. D. D. Billadeau (Mayor Clinic) and contains three NF-κB sites upstream of the concanavalin-A minimal promoter-luciferase gene (29Trushin S.A. Pennington K.N.

Inactivation of NF-κB by decoy DNA was performed following a protocol and utilizing DNA sequences described in the literature for cultured neurons (30Yu Z. Zhou D. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8856-8865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 150 pmol of DNA was transfected by LipofectAMINE 2000 into P19 cells cultured in a 3.5-cm dish. In some experiments, decoy DNA was transfected into P19-NF-κB-luc cells for 12 h, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 0.1 μm was used to stimulate the cells for an additional 5 h before reporter gene activity was measured. DNA with a sequence scrambled from the NF-κB decoy sequence served as a control to correct for the effect of transfection on the inhibition (30Yu Z. Zhou D. Bruce-Keller A.J. Kindy M.S. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8856-8865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same decoy and control DNAs were transfected into P19NR1–5.4 cells differentiated for 6 days, and 12 h later cells were harvested for luciferase assay. The luciferase assay and its normalization to cellular protein contents were accomplished for stable transfectants as described previously (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J.

A probe for the rat NR1 NF-κB site (rNR1-NFκB) was formed by annealing DNA GB424 (upper strand, 5′-TTAATGTCCTGGGACTTTCCTGT) and GB425 (lower strand, 5′-AGTGTAGACAGGAAAGTCCCAGG) with uneven ends. A probe for the mouse NR1 NF-κB site (mNR1-NFκB) was produced as above with DNA GB469 (upper strand, 5′-TCTGAGGAGTGGGACTGGCCAGCAT) and GB460 (lower strand, 5′-GCCTAATGCTGGCCAGTCCCACTCC). Both rNR1-NFκB and mNR1-NFκB were labeled by Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (>3000 mCi/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J.

The NF-κB consensus probe of the Ig/HIV promoter was obtained from Promega and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (>6000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals) by T4 DNA kinase (6Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP experiments were performed following the methods described by Baek (32Baek S.J. Horowitz J.M. Eling T.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, P19 cells were grown to more than 80% confluence and fixed with 1% formaldehyde in media for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link DNA with proteins. Reaction was terminated by addition of 0.15 m glycine. Nuclei were prepared by incubation of cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 10 min, and then centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were dissolved in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors (27Liu A. Zhuang Z. Hoffman P.W. Bai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26423-26434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and DNAs in lysates were sonicated into fragments between 200 and 1000 bp. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were diluted five times with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 167 mm NaCl). After clean up with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) saturated with 50 μg/ml sheared lambda DNA and 1 mg/ml BSA in TE buffer, the diluted supernatants underwent immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of Sp1 or Sp3 antibody for every 1.5-ml volume at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies were recovered with protein A/G-agarose saturated with sheared lambda DNA/BSA and washed with 1 ml of the following buffers in order: once with low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl); once with high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl); once with LiCl wash buffer (250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0); twice with TE buffer, pH 8.0. DNA-protein complexes were eluted from beads twice with 100-μl elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3). The eluted samples were combined and each was treated with 1 μg of RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C. Protein-DNA cross-link was reversed by 300 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h. Eluants were then deproteinized by 10 μg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 2 h. Free DNAs were extracted by the conventional phenol/chloroform method. Purified DNA was dissolved in 50 μl of dH2O. One-tenth of each DNA was amplified for 40 cycles in PCR by employing Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa/PanVera, Madison, WI) and primers GB580 (5′-ATATACTGGCCCCATGGTCA) and GB581 (5′-TGGTGACTGGCTGTTCTCTG) to detect the fragment overlapping the mouse NR1 NF-κB site. As a positive control (input), sonicated nuclear lysates underwent reverse cross-link and phenol/chloroform extraction and were subject to PCR. For negative control, an antibody against goat IgG was used in immunoprecipitation. PCR products were fractionated and visualized on 1% agarose plus 1% low melt agarose-TAE gel containing ethidium bromide (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J.

The NR1 Gene Has a Putative NF-κB Site in the Distal 5′ Flanking Region—Our previous observations suggest that the distal region of the rat NR1 promoter contains positive regulatory elements (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A motif search of this region revealed a sequence matching perfectly the 10-bp consensus of the Ig/HIV NF-κB site, the most common NF-κB site identified previously (10Baeuerle P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 63-80PubMed Google Scholar). Its homology to the NF-κB consensus, position in the NR1 promoter, and 10 bp of flanking sequences at both ends are presented in Fig. 1. A similar putative site was also found in the distal 5′ flanking sequences of the mouse NR1 gene from clone RP23–47P18 on chromosome 2 deposited in the GenBank™ mouse genome data base (www.ncbi.nlm.gov/gene-bank/mousegenom) (Fig. 1). The Putative NF-κB Site Is an Enhancer for the NR1 Promoter during Neuronal Differentiation—Previously we have demonstrated that the distal 5′ flanking sequence, which contains the putative NF-κB site, increases NR1 promoter activity in either undifferentiated or neuronally differentiated P19 cells and that the promoter (5.4-kb) undergoes up-regulation following neuronal differentiation (4Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of this putative NF-κB site, we examined its impact on the upregulation of the NR1 promoter during neuronal differentiation. Initially we mutated this site in the 5.4-kb promoter by changing its sequence in length and order. The promoter containing this mutant was fused to the firefly luciferase gene, stably transfected into P19 cells, and compared in activity with the wild-type promoter during neuronal differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, the wild-type promoter started increasing its activity 5 days after RA treatment, a point when neuronal differentiation is ongoing, and this increase peaked by more than 75-fold promoter activity over that in undifferentiated cells. In contrast, the promoter activity of the mutant began to increase 6 days after RA treatment and reached a level less than 20-fold of promot"

We identified the light chain subunit (KLC1) of kinesin-I as an interacting partner for torsinA, with binding occurring between the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of KLC1 and the carboxyl-terminal region of torsinA. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that wild-type torsinA and kinesin-I form a complex in vivo. In cultured cortical neurons, both proteins co-localized along processes with enrichment at growth cones. Wild-type torsinA expressed in CAD cells co-localized with endogenous KLC1 at the distal end of processes, whereas mutant torsinA remained confined to the cell body. Subcellular fractionation of adult rat brain revealed torsinA and KLC associated with cofractionating membranes, and both proteins were co-immunoprecipitated after cross-linking cytoplasmically oriented proteins on isolated rat brain membranes. These studies suggest that wild-type torsinA undergoes anterograde transport along microtubules mediated by kinesin and may act as a molecular chaperone regulating kinesin activity and/or cargo binding.

The dystonias represent a varied group of movement disorders characterized by twisted and contracted movements and postures throughout the body (1Klein C. Ozelius L.J. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2002; 15: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with early onset dystonia being the most common and severe form of the inherited dystonias. Onset of symptoms occurs in a limb between 5 and 20 years of age, and symptoms generalize by spreading to other limbs, physically incapacitating most patients within approximately 5 years (2Bressman S.B. de Leon D.

Most cases of early onset dystonia are caused by the deletion of 3 base pairs (ΔGAG) in the DYT1 gene that encode a single glutamic acid residue, Glu302 or Glu303, near the C-terminal region of torsinA (7Ozelius L.J.

This protein, which shares conserved domains with the AAA+ (HSP/Clp-ATPase-AAA) superfamily of chaperone-like proteins (8Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is expressed in a broad range of tissues in mammals. Within the human brain, expression levels are highest in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (9Augood S.J. Martin D.M. Ozelius L.J. Breakefield X.O. Penney Jr., J.B. Standaert D.G. Ann.

The DYT1 gene is a member of a gene family that includes three other related genes: TOR1B, adjacent to DYT1 on chromosome 9q34, encoding torsinB (70% identity); and TOR2A and TOR3A on chromosomes 9q34 and 1q24, respectively, encoding TORP1 and TORP2 (ADIR) (10Dron M.

In general, AAA+ proteins are critical to the assembly, disassembly, and operation of protein complexes and often form homo-oligomeric ring structures with substrate proteins or nucleic acids “threaded” through the hole in the ring (17Ogura T. Wilkinson A.J. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). They participate in a wide variety of cellular processes, including membrane fusion, organelle biogenesis, movement along microtubule tracks, proteolysis and DNA replication. The C-terminal helical subdomain of AAA+ proteins in particular has been shown to be important for substrate interaction, and the contacts that this region forms in crystal structures of these proteins suggest a role in oligomerization (18Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For some AAA+ proteases, mutations in this domain disrupt interaction with partner proteins in a dominant negative manner (19Missiakas D. Schwager F. Betton J.M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6899-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 20Akiyama Y. Ogura T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both dystonia-associated mutations identified in the DYT1 gene are in-frame deletions within the C-terminal region, including the common GAG deletion and an 18-bp deletion (Phe323–Tyr328del) in one patient with early onset dystonia with myoclonic and tic-like features (21Leung J.C. Klein C. Friedman J. Vieregge P. Jacobs H. Doheny D. Kamm C. DeLeon D. Pramstaller P.P. Penney J.B. Eisengart M. Jankovic J. Gasser T. Bressman S.B. Corey D.P. Kramer P. Brin M.F. Ozelius L.J. Breakefield X.O. Neurogenetics. 2001; 3: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These deletions could have dominant negative effects on the function of a torsin AAA+ oligomer (22Breakefield X.O. Kamm C. Hanson P.I. Neuron. 2001; 31: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that interact with torsinA, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen using the predicted C-terminal α-helical subdomain of human wild-type torsinA as a bait. Two isoforms of kinesin light chain (KLC) 1, KLC1-B and KLC1-C, were identified as specifically interacting proteins, and their interaction was confirmed by affinity precipitation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and cross-linking experiments. KLC1 is part of the heterotetrameric motor protein kinesin-I (23Goldstein L.S. Philp A.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 141-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and is thought to be involved in cargo binding and/or regulation of kinesin-I activity (24Kamal A. Goldstein L.S. Curr. Opin.

We show that KLC1 is a physiologically relevant binding partner for torsinA, with both proteins co-localizing in cultured primary cortical neurons and both concentrated in neuronal growth cones.

Other polyclonal antibodies used include SPA-860 against the C terminus of calnexin (StressGen) and SPA-826 against binding protein/glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (BiP/Grp78) (StressGen). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and β-Galactosidase Assays—The yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using a LexA-based system (26Brent R. Finley Jr., R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Library screening was performed by transforming a conditionally expressed human adult whole brain cDNA library (MoBiTec), constructed in the vector pJG4-5 (26Brent R. Finley Jr., R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), into the yeast strain EGY48, containing the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 and the pEG202-torAwt-(251–332) bait construct. Positive interacting clones were selected for growth on Ura-/His-/Trp-/Leu-/gal plates and tested for β-galactosidase activity on Ura-/His-/Trp-/X-gal/glu and Ura-/His-/Trp-/X-gal/gal plates. 15 clones were found to have a consistent galactose-dependent phenotype. To confirm the specificity of the interactions, cDNA clones in pJG4-5 were rescued and transformed into EGY48 cells containing either pEG202-torAwt-(251–332), pEG202-torAΔGAG-(251–332), or one of the following bait plasmids as negative controls: 1) pEG202, 2) pEG202-cdc2, 3) pEG202-bicoid, 4) pEG202-fus3, or 5) pEG202-TubSH3 (32Murthy V.

The pEG202-cdc2, pEG202-bicoid, and pEG202-fus3 interactor control plasmids (33Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Brent (The Molecular Sciences Institute, Berkeley, CA). Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed following a standard protocol (34Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keaveney M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.16.12-13.17.15Google Scholar). The same untransformed yeast strain used for subsequent transformation with bait and library constructs, EGY48, containing the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18–34, was used as a negative control. One unit of β-galactosidase is defined as the amount that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) to O-nitrophenol and d-galactose per min per cell (35Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 74Google Scholar). GST in Vitro Pull-down Assays—HEK 293T/17 cells, transiently transfected with mammalian expression constructs encoding full-length wild-type or ΔGAG torsinA, were lysed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) or RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) including Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), as indicated. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Cell extracts were then incubated overnight with 600 pmol of either the indicated GST-KLC1 fusion protein or GST bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed five times with PBS. After an additional wash with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, bound proteins were eluted from the beads by resuspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using standard methods. For pull-downs of endogenous torsinA, PC12 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Transfection and Immunofluorescence of CAD Cells—CAD and HEK293T/17 cells were transiently transfected as described (15Hewett J. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Slater D. Ziefer P. Li S. Bergeron D. Jacoby D.J. Ozelius L.J. Ramesh V. Breakefield X.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 12 h after transfection, cells were replated onto glass coverslips and switched to differentiation medium (serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12). 48–72 h later, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Immunofluorescence of fixed CAD cells was carried out as described (15Hewett J. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Slater D. Ziefer P. Li S. Bergeron D. Jacoby D.J. Ozelius L.J. Ramesh V. Breakefield X.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), except that Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit were used as secondary antibodies. Confocal images were captured using LSM 5 Pascal software coupled to a Zeiss LSM Pascal Vario 2 RGB confocal system. For quantification of co-localization of endogenous KLC to torsinA immunoreactive inclusions in CAD cells transiently transfected with ΔGAG torsinA, 192 transfected cells from two independent experiments showing aggregates were scored visually for co-localization of both proteins by overlapping fluorescence. Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitations (IPs), PC12 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, or primary cortical neurons were lysed by resuspension in ice-cold RIPA buffer, as above. Lysates were subjected to IP overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated by the addition of Protein A-agarose (for polyclonal antibodies) or Protein G-agarose (for monoclonal antibodies; Roche Applied Science) for 1 h. Beads were washed four times with PBS and resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Control human brain (hippocampus) tissue (anonymous donor, no diagnostic abnormality reported) was obtained with IRB approval from Dr. Jean-Paul Vonsattel (Massachusetts General Hospital). Human and embryonic (E16) or adult rat brain tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer and sonicated twice for 45 s at a pulse intensity of 6 using a 550 sonic dismembrator (Fisher), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. IPs were carried out as above. Fractionation of Rat Brain—For each fractionation, whole fresh brain from one adult rat (>12 weeks) was homogenized in HB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 40 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm magnesium chloride with protease inhibitors). Vesicle-enriched membrane fractions (P3) were prepared by sequential centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min (P1), 9,000 × g for 10 min (P2), and 120,000 × gavg for 90 min (P3), slightly modified from Ref. 36Kamal A. Almenar-Queralt A. LeBlanc J.F. Roberts E.A. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 2001; 414: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar. The P3 pellet was resuspended in HB buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose and loaded on top of 11 ml of a 0.32–1.9 m continuous sucrose gradient in HB buffer. Gradients were centrifuged at 100,000 × gavg in a SW41 rotor for 16–18 h, and 24 × 0.5-ml fractions were obtained from the top down. Proteins were precipitated with chloroform-methanol (37Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar) and resuspended in equal volumes of 1× SDS sample buffer before resolution by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Cross-linking of Rat Brain Membrane Surface Proteins Followed by Immunoprecipitation—For cross-linking of cytoplasmically oriented proteins on P3 vesicle-enriched rat brain membranes, the P3 fraction was resuspended in HB buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose. The water-soluble cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce) was added to 5 mm final concentration, samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, NaCl, Nonidet P-40, deoxycholate, SDS, and protease inhibitors were added to the same concentrations as in RIPA buffer (see above), the indicated antibodies were added, and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described above, except that beads were washed three times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Biotinylation of Rat Brain Membrane Surface Proteins Followed by Precipitation with Immobilized Streptavidin—Total rat brain was homogenized in HB buffer, as above, including 0.32 m sucrose. Membranes were fractionated by sequential centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min (P1), 9,000 × g for 10 min (P2), and 120,000 × gavg for 90 min (P3), as above. Pellets were resuspended in HB buffer including 0.32 m sucrose, and biotinylation with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature was carried out essentially as described (38Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 9.0, and incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, NaCl, Nonidet P-40, deoxycholate, SDS, and protease inhibitors were added to the same concentrations as in RIPA buffer (see above), and samples were incubated with immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) for 1 h. Except for incubation periods during biotinylation and quenching reactions, samples were kept at 4 °C throughout. Beads were washed three times in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. To evaluate glycosylation, endoglycosidase H or peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl) asparagine amidase F digestion of rat brain samples was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs) prior to SDS-PAGE. Primary Culture of Rat Cortical Neurons—Brains were obtained from day 17–18 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos, and primary cultures were prepared essentially as described (39Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: coverslips were coated overnight in 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma); embryonic cortices were minced and dissociated in 2.5 units/ml dispase (Sigma); and dissociated neurons were plated in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. After 8 days in culture, coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and subsequently processed for immunocytochemistry. Immunofluorescence of Rat Cortical Neurons—For double labeling with two mAbs, fixed neurons were permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 30 min, blocked for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum, and incubated with the first mAb in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS. Cells were then incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) for 1 h, washed as above, incubated with the second mAb in bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed as above, followed by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:2500) for 45 min, and again washed as above. Coverslips were mounted as above, and confocal images were captured using either a Nikon TE 300 microscope and a Bio-Rad MRC 100 laser confocal imaging system (see Fig. 4, A–O) or a Zeiss confocal imaging system, as above (see Fig. 4, P–R). The KLC1 TPR Domain Binds Directly to the C Terminus of TorsinA—To identify proteins that interact directly with wild-type human torsinA, amino acids 251–332 of the protein were used as a bait (Fig. 1A) to screen an adult human brain cDNA library using the LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system (26Brent R. Finley Jr., R.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 663-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This sequence contains the site of the GAG deletion and is predicted by alignment to comprise the small C-terminal helical subdomain of the AAA-fold (18Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In a screen of 1 × 106 independent transformants, 15 positive clones were identified, representing three groups. The 10 clones of one group all encoded overlapping fragments of human kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1), including two differentially spliced isoforms, KLC1-B and KLC1-C (Fig. 1, B and C). The three clones of another group encoded the nonmotor domain of an unconventional myosin, whereas a third group encoded two overlapping cDNA fragments of an uncharacterized protein. 3C. Kamm, unpublished data. The two human KLC1 isoforms were identical to the alternatively spliced KLC1 isoforms B and C recently identified in a human keratinocyte cDNA library (40McCart A.E. Mahony D. Rothnagel J.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Compared with isoform B, isoform C contains an additional nine amino acids (VSMS-VEWNG) close to the C terminus (Fig. 1C). Of the 10 KLC1 clones, one encoded KLC1-B-(229–547), and nine clones encoded KLC1-C-(112–256). Neither interacted with any of four different control bait plasmids (Table I), demonstrating a specific interaction between torsinA-(251–332) and both KLC isoforms. Since the KLC1-B cDNA fragment encoded only the major part of the TPR domain, but not the N-terminal heptad repeat (Fig. 1B), we conclude that the TPR domain and C-terminal region of KLC1 (amino acids 209–547) are sufficient to mediate the interaction with the C-terminal part of torsinA (amino acids 251–332).Table IInteractions of human wild-type (WT) and mutant (ΔGAG) torsinA, kinesin light chain isoforms, and control baits assessed by yeast two-hybrid assay Galactose-dependent transcriptional activation of the reporter gene lacZ was observed only after co-transformation of KLC1 constructs, and not of control plasmids, with the torsinA C-terminal domain.Binding domainActivation domainlacZ reporter gene activationaSymbols indicate degree of lacZ reporter gene activation, as judged by intensity of blue color in yeast colony filter assays. -, white; (+), weak blue; +, moderately intense blue; ++, inten"
https://openalex.org/W1989307500,"Bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15) and growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) are oocyte-secreted factors that are critical local regulators of ovarian physiology. Recent studies have identified a number of mutations in these genes that cause increased fertility and infertility in heterozygous or homozygous ewes carrying the mutations, respectively. Interestingly, heterozygous ewes with a mutation in both BMP-15 and GDF-9 exhibit higher fertility than those having mutation in only one of the genes. Here, we have produced recombinant human BMP-15 and GDF-9 that carry the mutations identified in those sheep, i.e. I31D and S99I in BMP-15 and S77F in GDF-9. We found that when individually expressed, both BMP-15 mutations had no effect on the processing, secretion, and dimerization of the mature proteins or on the biological activity of the molecules. However, when mutant BMP-15 was co-expressed with wild-type GDF-9, the secretion of BMP-15 and GDF-9 was significantly reduced, suggesting that the mechanisms by which the BMP-15 mutations affect sheep fertility occurs at the level of protein secretion rather than dimerization and biological activity. Moreover, when mutant GDF-9 was co-expressed with mutant BMP-15, the secretion levels of both proteins were significantly lower than those of cells co-expressing wildtype GDF-9 and mutant BMP-15, suggesting a possible mechanism for the extreme fertility observed in the compound heterozygous mutant sheep.

Rapidly advancing recent research demonstrating the importance of the oocyte-secreted factors, BMP-15 1The abbreviations used are: BMP-15, bone morphogenetic protein-15; GDF-9, growth and differentiation factor-9; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; GC, granulosa cell; Ab, antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: BMP-15, bone morphogenetic protein-15; GDF-9, growth and differentiation factor-9; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; GC, granulosa cell; Ab, antibody. and GDF-9, in the regulation of ovarian function has had an immediate impact on our understanding of female fertility (1Shimasaki S.

Rev. 2004; 25: 72-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). These growth factors exhibit a high degree of structural homology with a notable similarity that they both lack the fourth of seven conserved cystine residues that are characteristic features of the TGF-β superfamily (3McPherron A.C.

Our recent studies have shown that, although not covalently bound, both BMP-15 and GDF-9 do indeed exist as homodimers (6Liao W.X. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Additionally, when BMP-15 and GDF-9 are co-expressed, BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimers are formed; however, the physiological role of the heterodimer has yet to be established. The sheep model has proven to be a particularly valuable tool in elucidating the role of these factors in determining the quota of oocytes ovulated in a given ovarian cycle, primarily because of the identification of naturally occurring mutations in the bmp15 and gdf9 genes that have profound effects on sheep fertility (7Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat.

Reprod. 2004; 70: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Direct implication of the role of BMP-15 in sheep reproduction was provided when it was shown that two strains of highly prolific sheep, Inverdale and Hanna, carried causal point mutations in the bmp15 gene (7Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Interestingly, female sheep that are heterozygous carriers of the mutations exhibit increased fertility because of an increase in their ovulation quota, whereas female sheep that are homozygous carriers of the mutations are infertile with an ovarian phenotype that resembles that of GDF-9 knock-out mice (10Dong J. Albertini D.F. Nishimori K. Kumar T.R. Lu N. Matzuk M. Nature. 1996; 383: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), i.e. a block in the primary stage of folliculogenesis. Because the Hanna mutation (called FecXH), which induces a premature stop codon, results in a severely truncated mature protein, it has been postulated that the lack of BMP-15 bioactivity is responsible for causing the Hanna phenotypes. The mechanism by which the BMP-15 mutation found in Inverdale ewes (FecXI) affects ovarian function is less clear. This mutation is a single point mutation that causes a substitution of valine with aspartic acid at residue 31 of the mature protein, a region that is highly conserved among TGF-β superfamily members. Our previous experiments have shown that when human BMP-15 with a mutation that mimics the Inverdale mutation (BMP-15I31D) is co-expressed with GDF-9 in vitro, the cleavage and secretion of BMP-15 is abolished, and the secretion of GDF-9 is impaired (6Liao W.X. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, new distinct mutations in the BMP-15 gene that are associated with reproductive phenotypes resembling those of the Inverdale and Hanna mutations have been identified in other strains of sheep (9Hanrahan J.P. Gregan S.M. Mulsant P. Mullen M. Davis G.H. Powell R. Galloway S.M. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Of these new mutations, one, designated FecXB, causes the substitution of the serine found at position 99 of the mature region of BMP-15 to an isoleucine (BMP-15S99I). This mutation, like the Inverdale mutation, is a non-conserved change in a region of the protein that is highly conserved among members of the TGF-β superfamily. Additionally, a mutation in the GDF-9 gene, designated FecGH has been identified. It also causes increased fertility in heterozygous carriers and sterility in homozygous carriers. This mutation causes the substitution of the highly conserved serine at position 77 of the mature protein with a phenylalanine (GDF-9S77F). Interestingly, sheep that are heterozygous carriers of mutations in both BMP-15 and GDF-9 exhibit ovulation quotas that are higher than heterozygous carriers of either mutation separately (9Hanrahan J.P. Gregan S.M. Mulsant P. Mullen M. Davis G.H. Powell R. Galloway S.M. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), extending the concept that there are physiological or molecular interactions between BMP-15 and GDF-9 that have important consequences on ovarian processes (6Liao W.X.

A current challenge in this field is the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact that the mutations in these genes have on the progression of folliculogenesis and ovulation. A better understanding of such mechanisms will provide tremendous insight into the physiological basis of the local ovarian regulation of female fertility in mammals. In the present study, we have produced recombinant human BMP-15 and GDF-9 that contain the point mutations that affect sheep fertility to characterize the effects of these mutations on the processing, secretion, and biological activity of the proteins. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Full-length human GDF-9 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from ovarian RNA and cloned in-frame at the upstream site of the FLAG epitope tag present in pCMV-Tag4A (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The GDF-9 cDNA with the FLAG tag was then released and subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(-) expression vector (Invitrogen) to form a plasmid designated as phGDF-9F. The plasmid phBMP-15F, described previously (6Liao W.X. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), was used in this study. Next we performed standard PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using phBMP-15F and phGDF-9F to make plasmids having either the I31D or the S99I mutation in the bmp15 gene and the S77F mutation in the gdf9 gene as described previously (6Liao W.X. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); the resulting plasmids were designated as phBMP-15FI31D, phBMP-15FS99I, and phGDF-9FS77F, respectively. Production and Analysis of Recombinant Proteins—For the purpose of producing sufficient amounts of wild-type and mutant BMP-15 and GDF-9 proteins for use in bioassay experiments, stable transformant 293 cell lines were established as described previously (6Liao W.X. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, 293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four h after transfection, the culture media were replaced with serum-free media for 3–4 days before the conditioned media were harvested for further analysis. Recombinant proteins were immunopurified by affinity column chromatography using anti-FLAG Ab-agarose as described previously (12Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For chemical cross-linking, a non-cleavable cross-linker, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (Pierce), was added at a final concentration of 0.625 mm to conditioned media or immunopurified protein solutions at a final concentration of 1–1.5 mg/ml growth factors. Western immunoblotting was performed as described previously (6Liao W.X. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3713-3719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions using the anti-FLAG Ab. Where indicated, integrated relative densities of individual bands were digitized by multiplying the absorbance of the surface areas using the software package NIH ImageJ 1.28. For quantitative comparisons of band intensities, the band density values of each group were calculated and expressed as relative to those of the cells co-expressing wildtype BMP-15 and wild-type GDF-9. Relative band intensities were calculated based only on comparisons between bands on the same blot. Primary Cell Culture and Bioactivity Studies—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (23 days old) were implanted with silastic capsules containing 10 mg of diethylstilbestrol to increase the GC number. After 4 days of diethylstilbestrol exposure, GCs were collected from the ovaries and cultured in serum-free McCoy's 5A medium as described previously (12Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Thymidine incorporation assays using primary GCs were performed as described previously (12Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). All animal protocols were approved by the University of California at San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical Analysis—All thymidine incorporation and SDS-PAGE immunoblotting data presented here are representative examples of at least three separate experiments. Differences between groups are shown as mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments and analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (SPSS standard version 10.0.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To evaluate the effects of naturally occurring point mutations on the production, processing, secretion, and dimerization of BMP-15 and GDF-9, we transiently transfected 293T cells with expression plasmids for these factors, which were tagged on the C terminus with the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1). The BMP-15 proproteins and mature proteins were readily detectable in the conditioned media of cells transfected with wild-type BMP-15, BMP-15I31D, and BMP-15S99I, and there were no differences observed between the mutant and wild-type proteins (Fig. 1B, left panel). When the proteins were subjected to chemical cross-linking using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, the 34-kDa BMP-15 homodimer of each of the mutant BMP-15 molecules and wild-type BMP-15 was observed readily (Fig. 1B, right panel). Likewise, compared with wild-type GDF-9, GDF-9S77F did not cause any observable differences in the secretion of the pro- and mature proteins (Fig. 1C, left panel) nor the formation of the 40-kDa GDF-9 homodimer (Fig. 1C, right panel). Interestingly, immunopurification of wild-type GDF-9 and GDF-9S77F with anti-FLAG-agarose beads yielded only the mature GDF-9 protein, not the proprotein (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Because the GDF-9 proprotein, like the mature protein, contains the C-terminal FLAG epitope (Fig. 1A), it is likely that the folding of the proprotein causes the FLAG motif to be blocked. No previous studies have investigated whether any of the mutations in BMP-15 and GDF-9 affect the biological activity of the proteins. For this purpose we developed stable transformant 293 cell lines expressing human wild-type BMP-15, BMP-15I31D, BMP-15S99I, wild-type GDF-9, and GDF-9S77F. Then we used anti-FLAG-agarose to immunopurify the products from the conditioned media as described previously (12Otsuka F. Yao Z. Lee T.H. Yamamoto S. Erickson G.F. Shimasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39523-39528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because the major consensus biological action shared by both BMP-15 and GDF-9 is the stimulation of GC mitosis, we tested the wild-type and mutant BMP-15 and GDF-9 preparations using our well established rat GC thymidine incorporation assay (12Otsuka F.

In these biological assays the mutant proteins stimulated DNA incorporation with potencies and efficacies that were indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 2). Because BMP-15 and GDF-9 share a nearly identical expression pattern in the oocyte during folliculogenesis (2Shimasaki S. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Erickson G.F. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 72-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), we transiently transfected 293T cells with various combinations of wild-type and mutant BMP-15 and GDF-9 expression plasmids to evaluate whether intracellular interactions between BMP-15 and GDF-9 have any effect on the manifestation of the aberrancies caused by the mutations. Co-expression of GDF-9 with BMP-15I31D or BMP-15S99I caused a strong and significant decrease in the levels of mutant BMP-15 secreted into the media as compared with co-transfection with wild-type BMP-15 (Fig. 3, A and B; compare lane 2 with lane 1 for BMP-15I31D and lane 3 with lane 1 for BMP-15S99I). Likewise, when wild-type GDF-9 was co-transfected with either form of mutant BMP-15, the levels of GDF-9 secreted into the media also were significantly suppressed as compared with cotransfection with wild-type BMP-15 (Fig. 3, A and C; compare lane 2 with lane 1 for BMP-15I31D and lane 3 with lane 1 for BMP-15S99I). In contrast to the BMP-15 mutations, the FecGH mutation in GDF-9 (GDF-9S77F) did not cause any significant changes in the levels of GDF-9 or BMP-15 secretion when cells co-expressing GDF-9S77F and wild-type BMP-15 were compared with those co-expressing wild-type GDF-9 and wild-type BMP-15 (Fig. 3, A–C; compare lane 4 with lane 1). Interestingly, however, when GDF-9S77F was co-transfected with either BMP-15I31D or BMP-15S99I, there was a strong and significant reduction in the secretion of both BMP-15 and GDF-9 as compared with co-expression with wild-type BMP-15 (Fig. 3, A–C; compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4) or co-expression of wild-type GDF-9 and either BMP-15I31D or BMP-15S99I (Fig. 3, A–C; compare lane 5 with lane 2 for BMP-15I31D and lane 6 with lane 3 for BMP-15S99I). These data demonstrate an additive effect of the BMP-15 mutations with the GDF-9S77F mutation. BMP-15 and GDF-9, oocyte-secreted factors that exhibit a high degree of homology, have proven to be critical local regulators of ovarian function (1Shimasaki S. Moore R.K. Erickson G.F. Otsuka F. Reproduction. 2003; 61: 323-337PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shimasaki S. Moore R.K. Otsuka F. Erickson G.F. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 72-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The recent identification of naturally occurring mutations in BMP-15 and GDF-9 that cause reproductive aberrancies in sheep has provided a unique opportunity to study the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the ability of these factors to regulate mammalian reproduction (7Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat.

It is noteworthy that the mutated amino acids in BMP-15 and GDF-9 are conserved among various species (9Hanrahan J.P. Gregan S.M. Mulsant P. Mullen M. Davis G.H. Powell R. Galloway S.M. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We used human BMP-15 and GDF-9 as templates because of the potential clinical relevance and because we have collected extensive data previously using recombinant human BMP-15 (12Otsuka F. Yao Z.

BMP-15 and GDF-9 form a unique subset of the TGF-β superfamily in that they share the highest amino acid sequence homology with each other, they share a unique oocyte-specific expression pattern, and they lack the cysteine that is responsible for forming the covalent bond between the subunits of the characteristic dimers. Although BMP-15 and GDF-9 bear many similarities to other members of the TGF-β superfamily, especially the BMPs, little is known about their functional structural features; thus, the identification of the distinct mutations that result in similar reproductive consequences allow for the investigation of structure-function relationships of these molecules. Also, because mutations in other members of the TGF-β superfamily are often lethal (19Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), investigation of these naturally occurring mutations in BMP-15 and GDF-9 may serve as a paradigm of the impact of mutations in these regions of the molecules of the TGF-β superfamily as a whole. It was originally proposed that the I31D mutation of BMP-15 would prevent the formation of dimers, thus preventing the biological activity of BMP-15 (7Galloway S.M. McNatty K.P. Cambridge L.M. Laitinen M.P.E. Juengel J.L. Jokiranta T.S. McLaren R.J. Luiro K. Dodds K.G. Montgomery G.W. Beattie A.E. Davis G.H. Ritvos O. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Likewise, it was predicted that the S99I BMP-15 mutation might affect the biological activity of BMP-15 (9Hanrahan J.P. Gregan S.M. Mulsant P. Mullen M. Davis G.H. Powell R. Galloway S.M. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), possibly by disrupting interactions with its receptor, based on the finding that mutating the corresponding serine in BMP-2 reduces affinity to the extracellular domain of BMP receptor-II (20Kirsch T. Nickel J. Sebald W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3314-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Our present findings that neither BMP-15 mutation affects BMP-15 dimerization, together with the findings that BMP-15I31D and BMP-15S99I stimulate GC thymidine incorporation to levels that are indistinguishable from that of wild-type BMP-15, suggest that the original predictions that these BMP-15 mutations could affect the ability of the secreted proteins to elicit proper biological activity may not be true. Indeed, it is more likely that defects in the secretion of mature forms of BMP-15 and/or GDF-9 are the mechanisms underlying the aberrant reproductive phenotype of the sheep carrying these mutations. A recent study has shown that immunizing sheep against either BMP-15 or GDF-9 mimics the reproductive aberrancies of the Fec mutations (21Juengel J.L. Hudson N.L. Heath D.A. Smith P. Reader K.L. Lawrence S.B. O'Connell A.R. Laitinen M.P.E. Cranfield M. Groome N.P. Ritvos O. McNatty K.P. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1777-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 22Juengel J.L. Hudson N.L. Whiting L. McNatty K.P. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because immunization against either factor independently caused the reproductive abnormalities, it was proposed that BMP-15 and GDF-9 and/or the BMP-15/GDF-9 heterodimer each must be necessary for normal folliculogenesis in this species. Our data support this concept in that we predict that the FecX mutations would impair the secretion of both GDF-9 and BMP-15, thus affecting normal folliculogenesis regardless of whether one or both of the factors are necessary for the normal progression of folliculogenesis. There have been reports of mutations in other TGF-β superfamily members that appear to have primary effects on the intracellular processing and secretion of the mature proteins (23Belville C. Van Vlijmen H. Ehrenfels C. Pepinsky B. Rezaie A.R. Picard J.-Y. Josso N. di Clemente N. Cate R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Thomas J.T.

Cervenka J. Luyten F.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The effects of these mutations bear resemblance to the substitution mutations in BMP-15 reported here; however, our findings in BMP-15 are unique in that we cannot detect any defects in the processing, secretion, dimerization, or biological activity of BMP-15 caused by the FecX mutations unless the mutant BMP-15 is co-expressed with GDF-9. Similar to the substitution mutations in BMP-15, the S77F mutation in GDF-9 did not affect homodimer formation, and GDF-9S77F stimulation of GC thymidine incorporation was indistinguishable from that of wild-type GDF-9. However, in contrast to the pronounced effects of the BMP mutations on the processing and secretion of BMP-15 and GDF-9, no observable defects were caused by the S77F mutation in GDF-9, neither when GDF-9S77F was singly expressed nor when co-expressed with wild-type BMP-15. An intriguing and surprising result from our present data was that when GDF-9S77F was co-expressed with BMP-15I31D or with BMP-15S99I, there was an augmentation of the effects of the BMP-15 mutations. These results suggest that the further decrease in GDF-9 and BMP-15 secretion would be a likely mechanism to explain the increased ovulation rate observed in sheep that are heterozygous carriers of the FecXB and FecGH mutation (9Hanrahan J.P. Gregan S.M. Mulsant P. Mullen M. Davis G.H. Powell R. Galloway S.M. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Although no reports have been published that describe the reproductive consequences of sheep that are compound heterozygous for the FecXI and FecGH mutations, based on our present data we predict that these sheep would phenocopy the compound heterozygous FecXB/FecGH sheep. Our present study clearly demonstrates that complex intracellular interactions between BMP-15 and GDF-9 have important implications for the processing and secretion of the mature forms of the molecule. Further, our data indicate that the identified substitution mutations in BMP-15 (I31D and S99F) that cause reproductive aberrancies in sheep have primary effects on the secretion of mature BMP-15 and GDF-9 rather than on the biological activity of the molecules. Another important finding is that the S77I GDF-9 mutation augments the effects of the BMP-15 mutations on the secretion of BMP-15 and GDF-9, suggesting a mechanism for the additive effects that these mutations have in sheep in vivo. The mechanism by which the mutations inhibit the processing and secretion of BMP-15 and GDF-9 has not been resolved; however, it is possible that the mutant proteins form unstable heterodimers that are subjected to targeted degradation prior to completion of processing. In this regard there have been exciting recent developments in the study of protein folding that may provide some insight into the molecular basis of the observations that we have reported here. Specifically, there is a growing recognition that the misfolding of proteins during protein synthesis, often caused by gene mutations, can be a direct cause of intracellular targeted degradation. This phenomenon has been associated with many pathological conditions that were thought previously to be unrelated (26Dobson C.M. Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3661) Google Scholar, 27Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the mutations that we have studied impair the proper folding of BMP-15 and GDF-9, leading to targeted degradation of the misfolded proteins. According to this model, because the aberrancies caused by the mutations only occur when BMP-15 and GDF-9 are co-expressed, it appears that the mutations would impair the folding of only the mutant heterodimers and not the homodimers of proteins carrying the mutations. Consistent with the expression pattern of BMP-15 and GDF-9 that is primarily restricted to the oocytes of growing follicles in mammals, none of the mutations in these genes in sheep (7Galloway S.M.

Thus, these factors are extremely attractive targets for manipulating fertility with a low risk of non-ovarian side effects for the purpose of developing new clinical treatments for infertility, for developing new non-steroidal contraceptives, and for modulating fertility in agricultural settings. Our data indicate that regimens aimed at modulating the secretion of BMP-15 and GDF-9 from the oocyte in vivo may be effective for these purposes. Also, our data raise the possibility that aberrancies in the secretion rather than the expression or biological activity of BMP-15 and/or GDF-9 may play a causal role in the abnormal follicle growth in women with polycystic ovaries, the underlying cause of certain forms of unexplained infertility and possibly in the incidence of dizygotic twining.

However, the potential role of SR-BI in chylomicron and chylomicron remnant metabolism is largely unknown. In the present investigation, we report that the cell association of 160 nm-sized triglyceride-rich chylomicron-like emulsion particles to freshly isolated hepatocytes from SR-BI-deficient mice is greatly reduced (>70%), as compared with wild-type littermate mice. Competition experiments show that the association of emulsion particles with isolated hepatocytes is efficiently competed for (>70%) by the well established SR-BI ligands, HDL and oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas LDL is ineffective. Upon injection into SR-BI-deficient mice the hepatic association of emulsion particles is markedly decreased (∼80%) as compared with wild-type mice. The relevance of these findings for in vivo chylomicron (remnant) metabolism was further evaluated by studying the effect of SR-BI deficiency on the intragastric fat load-induced postprandial triglyceride response.

Upon entering the circulation, chylomicrons are converted to remnants by the TG-hydrolyzing action of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and the acquisition of apolipoproteins (apo) such as apoE. Chylomicron remnants are subsequently taken up by the liver by an apoE-mediated process (reviewed in Refs. 1Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J.

However, the removal pathways of chylomicrons and their remnants remain complex, and the precise mechanism of recognition is still unclear and under debate (1Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Google Scholar, 3Yu K.C. Cooper A.D. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D332-354Google Scholar).Here we introduce scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) as a new player in postprandial lipid metabolism. SR-BI binds high density lipoproteins (HDL) and mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters (CE) from HDL without concomitant uptake of HDL protein (24Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar). The major apolipoproteins from HDL (apoAI, apoAII, and apoCIII) mediate the binding of HDL to SR-BI (25Xu S.Z. Laccotripe M. Huang X.W. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that lipid-free apoE binds to SR-BI and enhances CE uptake from lipoproteins (26Bultel-Brienne S. Lestavel S. Pilon A. Laffont I. Tailleux A. Fruchart J.C. Siest G. Clavey V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36092-36099Google Scholar). In addition to HDL, SR-BI was found to bind a broad spectrum of ligands, including modified lipoproteins (acetylated LDL, oxidized LDL, and hypochlorite-modified LDL), native lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)), maleylated bovine serum albumin (BSA), and anionic phospholipids (27Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Google Scholar, 28Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47562-47570Google Scholar). In contrast, SR-BI does not bind polyanions (e.g. fucoidin and polyinosinic acid), which are well known ligands for scavenger class A receptors. In addition to CE, SR-BI selectively takes up a variety of other molecules, like lipoprotein-associated phospholipids (31Urban S. Zieseniss S. Werder M. Hauser H. Budzinski R. Engelmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33409-33415Google Scholar, 32Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43801-43808Google Scholar), HDL-associated CE hydroxides (33Fluiter K. Sattler W. De Beer M.C. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8893-8899Google Scholar), and TG (32Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43801-43808Google Scholar, 34Greene D.J. Skeggs J.W. Morton R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4804-4811Google Scholar).The importance of SR-BI in cholesterol metabolism is readily observed in genetically altered mice. SR-BI knockout (KO) mice are characterized by an increase in serum cholesterol levels reflected in enlarged, cholesterol-rich HDL particles and impaired HDL cholesterol clearance (35Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar). Conversely, adenoviral hepatic SR-BI overexpression results in decreased serum HDL cholesterol content, increased liver uptake, and subsequent delivery of HDL cholesterol to the bile (36Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Google Scholar). In transgenic mice with liver-specific overexpression of murine SR-BI, a decrease in serum HDL cholesterol, apoAI, and apoAII levels was observed (37Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Google Scholar, 38Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Google Scholar). Additionally, plasma TG, LDL cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL-apoB were also decreased. When these SR-BI transgenic mice were fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet, a lowering in plasma apoB levels and abolition of the dietary increase in VLDL-apoB and LDL-apoB was detected. Thus, studies in SR-BI transgenic mice suggest that, in addition to its major role in HDL metabolism, SR-BI can play an additional role in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. However, despite the well known role of SR-BI in HDL metabolism, the role of SR-BI in TG-rich chylomicron (remnant) metabolism is largely unknown.The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of SR-BI in chylomicron (remnant) metabolism by assessing the effects of SR-BI deficiency on the association of chylomicron-like emulsion particles to hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo, as well as the effects on the intra-gastric fat load-induced postprandial TG response. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo data indicate that SR-BI is crucially involved in chylomicron (remnant) metabolism. We conclude that SR-BI is important in facilitating chylomicron (remnant) metabolism and might function as an initial recognition site for chylomicron remnants, whereby the subsequent internalization can be exerted by additional receptor systems like the LDLr and LRP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[1α,2α-3H]Cholesteryl oleate ([3H]CO), glycerol tri[9,10-3H]oleate ([3H]triolein); [3H]TO), and [14C]CO were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Triolein (TO, ∼99%), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (99%), and cholesteryl oleate (CO) were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (99%), cholesterol (>99%), and BSA (fraction V) were obtained from Sigma. Emulsifier safe, Hionic Fluor, and Solvable were obtained from Packard Bioscience (Groningen, The Netherlands).Animals—Heterozygous SR-BI mice on a 129(agouti)/C57Bl/6 background were kindly provided by Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA). The offspring of the mice were analyzed for the presence of targeted or wild-type (WT) SR-BI alleles by PCR, as described by Rigotti et al. (35Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with 8- to 10-week-old male homozygous SR-BI-deficient mice and WT littermates as controls. Animal experiments were performed at the Gorlaeus Laboratories of the Leiden/Amsterdam Center for Drug Research in accordance with the national laws. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments of Leiden University.Preparation of Emulsion Particles—Large (160-nm sized) TG-rich emulsion particles were prepared according to the sonication and ultracentrifugation procedure of Redgrave and Maranhao (39Redgrave T.G. Maranhao R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 835: 104-112Google Scholar) as modified by Rensen et al. (40Rensen P.C. van Dijk M.C. Havenaar E.C. Bijsterbosch M.K. Kruijt J.K. van Berkel T.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 221-225Google Scholar). In short, 100 mg of total lipid at a weight ratio TO/egg yolk phosphatidylcholine/lysophosphatidylcholine/CO/cholesterol of 70/22.7/2.3/3/2 was dispersed in NaCl buffer of density 1.10 g/ml. For synthesis of radiolabeled emulsion particles, 20–100 μCi of [3H]CO, or [3H]TO and [14C]CO was added to 100 mg of total lipid. The mixture was then sonicated for 30 min at 18 μm output using a Soniprep 150 (MSE Scientific Instruments, Crawley, UK) equipped with a water bath for temperature maintenance (54 °C). After sonication, a fraction containing large emulsion particles was obtained by flotation after density gradient ultracentrifugation using a Beckman SW 40 Ti rotor (22 min, 20,000 rpm, 27 °C) and was isolated from the top of the tube by aspiration. The emulsion was stored at room temperature under argon and used within 5 days after preparation.Characterization of Emulsion Particles—Particle size and homogeneity of the emulsion particles was assayed by photon correlation spectroscopy using a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) at 25 °C and a 90° angle between laser and detector. Lipid composition of the emulsion particles was determined using enzymatic assays (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for TG, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Precipath L was used as an internal standard. The emulsion contained 84.4 ± 2.4% (w/w) TG, 2.9 ± 0.2% cholesterol, 0.4 ± 0.1% CO, and 11.6 ± 0.3% phosphatidylcholine (mean ± S.E.; n = 3). The average particle size was 162.8 ± 3.2 nm (mean ± S.E.; n = 20).Isolation and Lipoproteins—Human LDL and HDL were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers as described by Redgrave et al. (41Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Google Scholar) and dialyzed at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. For oxidation of LDL, LDL was centrifuged twice according to Redgrave et al. (41Redgrave T.G. Roberts D.C. West C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 65: 42-49Google Scholar) and dialyzed against PBS, 10 μm EDTA, pH 7.4. LDL was subsequently oxidized by exposure to CuSO4 as described by Van Berkel et al. (42Van Berkel T.J. De Rijke Y.B. Kruijt J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2282-2289Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (43Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), using BSA as a standard.Association Studies of Emulsion Particles with Hepatocytes in Vitro— Hepatocytes were isolated from mice by linear perfusion at 37 °C according to the method of Seglen (44Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Google Scholar), as detailed earlier (45Hoekstra M. Kruijt J.K. Van Eck M. Van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25448-25453Google Scholar). In short, mice were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of ketamine (60 mg/kg; Eurovet Animal Health), fentanyl citrate, and fluanisone (1.26 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg, respectively; Janssen Animal Health) and the heart was cannulated through the vena cava inferior. The portal vein was opened to allow the outflow of buffer, and a ligature, applied around the vena cava inferior (at the position of the bifurcation to the kidney), was closed. The liver was perfused with an oxygenated 6.7 mm KCl and 142 mm NaCl buffer containing 6.7 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. After 10 min of perfusion, a 0.05% (w/v) collagenase type IV-containing buffer, containing 67 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl, 4.8 mm CaCl2, 67 mm Hepes, and 2% BSA, was flushed through the liver for 10 min at a flow rate of 14 ml/min. Subsequently, hepatocytes were isolated after mincing the liver in Hanks' buffer containing 0.3% BSA, filtered through nylon gauze, and centrifuged three times for 10 min at 50 × g. The cell pellets consisted of pure (>99%) hepatocytes as judged by light microscopy, and the viability of the cells was >90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells that were pelleted after the last centrifugation step were resuspended in oxygenated DMEM containing 2% BSA, pH 7.4. Hepatocytes (1–2 mg of cell protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]TO and [14C]CO double-labeled emulsion particles (μgTG) for 3 h at 37 °C in 1 ml of DMEM containing 2% BSA. Cell incubations were performed in a circulating lab shaker (Adolf Kühner AG, Switzerland) at 150 rpm. Every 30 min, the incubations were briefly oxygenated. After the incubations, the cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 600 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed two times with PBS containing 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4 and once with PBS without BSA. Cells were lysed in 0.1 N NaOH, and the protein and radioactivity contents were determined. For competition studies, hepatocytes (1–2 mg of cell protein) were incubated with [3H]CO-labeled emulsion particles (100 μg TG) in the presence of increasing amounts of human HDL, LDL, or oxidized LDL (3 h at 37 °C) and subsequently processed as described above.Distribution of Emulsion Particles in Mice in Vivo—The serum decay, liver uptake, and organ distribution of emulsion particles in mice were assessed as described by Rensen et al. (46Rensen P.C. Herijgers N. Netscher M.H. Meskers S.C. van Eck M. van Berkel T.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1070-1084Google Scholar) with some minor modifications. In short, fasted SR-BI KO and WT littermate mice were anesthetized as described above, and the abdomens were opened. [3H]CO-labeled emulsion particles (150 μg of TG) were injected through the vena cava inferior. At the indicated times, 50 μl of blood were taken and allowed to clot for 30 min. 3H radioactivity in 10 μl of serum, which was obtained after centrifugation for 3 min at 2500 × g, was counted in 4 ml of Emulsifier Safe. The total amount of serum radioactivity was calculated with the equation: serum volume (ml) = [0.0219 × body weight (g)] + 2.66. At the indicated times, liver lobules (not exceeding 15% of liver weight in total) were tied off, excised, and weighed. After dissolution overnight at 65 °C in 0.5 ml of Solvable, radioactivity was counted in 15 ml of Hionic Fluor. After 60 min, the mice were killed, and several organs (i.e. liver, heart, lungs, adrenals, spleen, muscles, and testes) were excised and weighed. The radioactivity in the heart, spleen, and adrenals was determined as described above for liver lobules. Radioactivity in other tissue samples was counted after combustion in a Tri-carb 306 Sample Oxidizer (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). The radioactivity in all tissue samples was corrected for the serum radioactivity assumed to be present at the time of sampling (40Rensen P.C. van Dijk M.C. Havenaar E.C. Bijsterbosch M.K. Kruijt J.K. van Berkel T.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 221-225Google Scholar).Intragastric Fat Load-induced Postprandial TG Response—Groups of 6–8 mice were fasted overnight. For basal TG and cholesterol levels, 50-μl blood samples were drawn just before 9.00 a.m. by tail bleeding into heparinized capillary tubes (t = 0). At 9.00 a.m., animals received an intragastric load of 400 μl of olive oil. After gavage, blood collection was continued every hour for 6 h. Plasma TG and cholesterol levels were measured at the various time points using enzymatic kits as described above. The distribution of TG over the different lipoproteins in plasma was analyzed by fractionation of 30 μl of pooled plasma using a Superose 6 column (3.2 × 30 mm, Smart-system, Amersham Biosciences), and determination of the TG content of the eluted fractions was made as described above.RESULTSEffect of SR-BI Deficiency on the Association of Chylomicron-like Emulsion Particles with Hepatocytes in Vitro—To study the role of SR-BI in the recognition of large chylomicron-like emulsion particles by hepatocytes in vitro, freshly isolated hepatocytes from SR-BI KO and WT littermate mice were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of [3H]TO and [14C]CO double-labeled emulsion particle. SR-BI deficiency appeared to strongly decrease both the [3H]TO and [14C]CO association with hepatocytes (Fig. 1).As SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of CE from HDL, whereby the uptake of CE is 30-fold higher than total particle uptake (24Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar), we questioned whether CE in the large emulsion particle also could be taken up selectively. However, the ratio of [14C]CO over [3H]TO for the hepatocyte-associated values is identical to the ratio within the added emulsion, indicating that both components do associate to the cells as an unity. Because SR-BI can effectively interact with HDL and particularly with ox-LDL, we evaluated the effects of these particles on the association of emulsion-[3H]CO with hepatocytes (Fig. 2). Similarly to HDL cholesteryl ester uptake, the cell association of emulsion particle cholesteryl esters was efficiently competed for by HDL and ox-LDL, whereas LDL was ineffective.Fig. 2Effect of competitors for SR-BI on the association of TG-rich emulsion particles with hepatocytes. Hepatocytes from WT mice were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with [3H]CO-labeled TG-rich emulsion particles (100 μg of TG) in the absence or presence of indicated amounts of unlabeled LDL (▪) or HDL (▴) (A), or oxidized LDL (•) (B). The cell association of [3H]CO was determined and expressed as the percentage of the association observed in the absence of competitor. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. For LDL, p < 0.05 at 200, 400, and 800 μg/ml versus 0 μg/ml. For all concentrations of HDL and oxidized LDL, p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of SR-BI Deficiency on the Kinetics of TG-rich Chylomicron-like Emulsion Particles in Vivo—To assess the relative contribution of SR-BI to the hepatic clearance of the large chylomicron-like emulsion particle in vivo, the kinetics of [3H]CO-labeled emulsion particles were determined in SR-BI KO and WT littermate mice (Fig. 3). After intravenous injection of the emulsion particle (150 μg of TG), the serum decay (Fig. 3A) was similar for both groups of mice, with rapid clearance from the circulation (t½ < 2 min). In WT mice, the majority of the injected dose associated with the liver (50% of the dose at 10 min after injection) (Fig. 3B), which is in agreement with our previous observations (46Rensen P.C. Herijgers N. Netscher M.H. Meskers S.C. van Eck M. van Berkel T.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1070-1084Google Scholar). In contrast, the hepatic association of emulsion particles was strongly reduced in SR-BI KO mice (10% of the dose at 10 min after injection). Although SR-BI deficiency reduced the hepatic association for 80%, the serum decay was not affected (Fig. 3A). Examination of the organ distribution at 60 min after injection showed that a reduced association of emulsion particles with the liver in SR-BI KO mice was compensated for by a strongly increased association with the heart (2.5-fold, p < 0.05) and muscles (3.1-fold, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C), thus explaining the similar serum kinetics for the emulsion in WT and SR-BI KO mice. Apparently, the reduced interaction of the chylomicron-like emulsion with the liver allows further interaction of the emulsion with LPL-expressing tissues.Fig. 3Effect of SR-BI deficiency on the serum decay, liver association, and organ distribution of TG-rich chylomicron-like emulsion particles. [3H]CO-labeled emulsion particles (150 μgofTG) were injected into fasted and anesthetized WT (○) and SR-BI KO (•) mice. At the indicated times, the serum decay (A) and liver association (B) of [3H]CO were determined. At 60 min after injection, the mice were killed, and the uptake in the various organs was determined (C). Recoveries of 3H radioactivity in SR-BI KO and WT mice were 81.3 ± 2.6% and 77.4 ± 1.5% of the injected dose, respectively. Values are means ± S.E. for three mice. For liver association, at 2, 10, 30, 45, and 60 min, p < 0.005 KO versus WT. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effect of SR-BI Deficiency on Chylomicron Metabolism in Vivo—Our combined data obtained with chylomicron-like emulsion particles suggest a prominent role for SR-BI in chylomicron metabolism. To confirm this hypothesis, we next investigated the effect of SR-BI deficiency on the postprandial TG response upon an intragastric fat load, which is an established procedure to study the kinetics of chylomicron metabolism. After an intragastric load with olive oil, plasma TG and cholesterol levels were determined over a period of 6 h in both WT and SR-BI KO mice (Fig. 4). The intragastric load of olive oil had no significant effect on cholesterol levels in SR-BI KO and WT mice (Fig. 4A); most of the cholesterol resides in the HDL fraction (data not shown). Before gavage, SR-BI KO mice had slightly but significantly higher basal levels of plasma TG compared with WT littermate mice (1.01 ± 0.08 mg/ml versus 0.79 ± 0.05 mg/ml, p < 0.05). At 4 h after olive oil administration, WT mice showed a postprandial increase in plasma TG (2.5-fold) (Fig. 4B), which returned to nearly basal TG levels at 6 h after administration. In contrast, SR-BI KO mice showed a 2-fold-increased TG response as compared with WT mice (area-under-the-curve 39.6 ± 1.2 versus 21.1 ± 3.6; p < 0.005). Specifically, the increase in plasma TG was significantly higher at 3, 4, 5, and 6 h after gavage. Analysis of lipoprotein profiles at 6 h after gavage (Fig. 4C) showed that chylomicron-TG was still 4-fold elevated in SR-BI KO mice, as compared with WT littermate mice, and resided mainly in the chylomicron/VLDL fractions (Fig. 4C).Fig. 4Effect of SR-BI deficiency on the postprandial TG response upon an intragastric fat load. Overnight fasted WT (○) and SR-BI KO (•) mice received an intragastric load of 400 μl of olive oil at t = 0. Subsequently, plasma cholesterol (A) and TG (B) levels were determined at the indicated time points and expressed as total amount of cholesterol/kg of body weight and increase in TG levels relative to t = 0(B), respectively. At 6 h after olive oil administration, TG levels in the lipoprotein profiles of pooled plasma of WT and SR-BI KO mice were determined (C). Values are means ± S.E.

Proposed functions include synaptic transmission, peripheral perception of pain, and mechanosensation. Despite the physiological importance of these functions, the precise role of ASICs has not yet been established. In order to increase our understanding of the physiological role and basic structure-function relationships of ASICs, we report here the cloning of six new ASICs from the zebrafish (zASICs). zASICs possess the basic functional properties of mammalian ASICs: activation by extracellular H+, Na+ selectivity, and block by micromolar concentrations of amiloride. The zasic genes are broadly expressed in the central nervous system, whereas expression in the peripheral nervous system is scarce. This pattern suggests a predominant role for zASICs in neuronal communication. Our results suggest a conserved function for receptors of extracellular H+ in the central nervous system of vertebrates.

Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, H+ is co-released with other transmitters, since synaptic vesicles are acidic (pH 5.7) (2Miesenböck G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Google Scholar). Thus, ASICs may act as excitatory receptors. During inflammation, the extracellular H+ concentration can also significantly increase. ASICs may therefore contribute to the perception of painful stimuli in the peripheral nervous system. In addition to the activation by H+, the homology of ASICs to mechanosensitive ion channels in Caenorhabditis elegans and the analysis of knock-out mice for individual ASIC subunits have suggested that ASICs are components of mechanically activated ion channels (3Welsh M.J. Price M.P. Xie J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2369-2372Google Scholar).There are four genes coding for ASICs in the human and mouse genome (asic1–asic4) (1Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin.

Moreover, alternative splicing of the asic1 and asic2 genes generates the splice variants ASIC1a/ASIC1b and ASIC2a/ASIC2b, respectively, that differ in the N-terminal third of the protein (6Bässler E.L.

All ASICs except ASIC4 are expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. ASIC1a, -2a, -2b, and -4 are expressed in the central nervous system (1Waldmann R. Lazdunski M.

Cesare P. Wood J.N. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 2217-2222Google Scholar). ASICs activate rapidly upon H+ application (τact of about 10 ms for ASIC1) (6Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Google Scholar) and desensitize in the continuous presence of H+. ASIC1 and ASIC3 desensitize completely (τinact of about 1 s for ASIC1) (6Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Google Scholar), whereas ASIC2a desensitizes incompletely and more slowly (7Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Google Scholar). ASIC2b and ASIC4 cannot be activated by H+ (4Gründer S. Geissler H.S. Bässler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P.

Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Google Scholar). However, functional ASICs are probably tetrameric proteins, and ASIC2b forms a heteromeric channel with ASIC3 (7Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Google Scholar). Several other combinations of subunits form heteromeric ASICs (8Bassilana F. Champigny G. Waldmann R. de Weille J.R. Heurteaux C.

(Lond.). 2002; 539: 485-494Google Scholar, 11Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2338-2343Google Scholar).Despite the progress made in recent years, we are far from a clear understanding of the physiological role of ASICs. The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a model organism for the study of vertebrate biology that offers some advantages over higher vertebrates. It has a translucent embryo and develops rapidly, allowing easy expression analysis of genes and detection of developmental abnormalities in mutant fish. In order to establish the zebrafish as a model to study the physiological role of ASICs, we report here the molecular cloning of cDNAs for six ASICs, their expression pattern during early zebrafish development, and their electrophysiological characterization in a heterologous expression system. Our results suggest a conserved function for receptors of extracellular H+ in the central nervous system of vertebrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of ASIC cDNAs from Zebrafish—Partial cDNA clones for zASIC1.2, -1.3, and -4.1 were identified by homology cloning from embryonic zebrafish brain and eye. Degenerate oligonucleotides and conditions for PCR were as described elsewhere (4Gründer S. Geissler H.S. Bässler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1607-1611Google Scholar). Partial sequences for zASIC1.1, -2, and -4.2 were identified by searching the online zebrafish genomic sequence trace data base (ENSEMBL) at the Sanger institute using the SSAHA program. Different rat ASIC subunits were used as a probe. These partial sequences were used to design primers for rapid amplification of 5′- and 3′-cDNA ends (RACE). Using the Smart RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech), RACE was performed with poly(A)+ RNA from different embryonic and adult zebrafish tissues. PCR products were subcloned with the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Full-length zASICs were assembled from the longest 5′ and 3′ RACE products. cDNA sequences were deposited in the EMBL data base under the following accession numbers: zASIC1.1, AJ609615; zASIC1.2, AJ609616; zASIC1.3, AJ609617; zASIC2, AJ609618; zASIC4.1, AJ609619; zASIC4.2, AJ609620.For expression studies in Xenopus oocytes, the entire coding sequences of zASICs were amplified from cDNA of larval brain by PCR (ExpandHighFidelity PCR system; Roche Applied Science). Using terminal restriction endonuclease recognition sequences (BamHI and KpnI; zASIC1.1: XhoI and KpnI), the PCR product was ligated in the oocyte expression vector pRSSP containing the 5′-untranslated region from Xenopus β globin and a poly(A) tail. Several clones from two independent PCRs were sequenced to exclude PCR errors.Radiation Hybrid Mapping and Synteny Analyses—PCR primers designed to amplify single exons from zasic genes were used to screen pools of zebrafish/hamster radiation hybrid cell lines (Goodfellow radiation hybrid panel) (12Geisler R. Rauch G.J. Baier H. van Bebber F. Brobeta L. Dekens M.P. Finger K. Fricke C. Gates M.A. Geiger H. Geiger-Rudolph S. Gilmour D. Glaser S. Gnugge L. Habeck H. Hingst K. Holley S. Keenan J. Kirn A. Knaut H. Lashkari D. Maderspacher F. Martyn U. Neuhauss S. Haffter P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 86-89Google Scholar). Two independent sets of primers were used per gene (primer sequences available upon request). The resulting 94-digit radiation hybrid scores were used to establish physical map positions using the Instant Mapping program at the Children's Hospital Zebrafish Genome Project Initiatives Web site (zfrhmaps.tch.harvard.edu/ZonRHmapper/instantMapping.htm). The same program was used to calculate Lod scores. Microsatellite markers (Zmarkers) and expressed sequence tags that flanked each locus were used to establish the putative genetic map positions of the different loci on the integrated genetic/physical Tübingen map (wwwmap.tuebingen.mpg.de/). zasic-containing regions were then screened for the presence of expressed sequence tags that had been used to establish the syntenic correspondence of the zebrafish and human genomes (13Barbazuk W.B. Korf I. Kadavi C. Heyen J. Tate S. Wun E. Bedell J.A. McPherson J.D. Johnson S.L. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1351-1358Google Scholar) (zebrafish-human syntenic correspondence map available on the World Wide Web at zfish.wustl.edu/). Such expressed sequence tags that turned out to be informative were fb82d01 (zasic1.1), fb36e06 and bact2 (zasic2), and fc17a11 (zasic4.1).In Situ Hybridization—PCR products comprising 360–520 bp from the N-terminal part of zASIC1.1 to zASIC4.2 cDNAs were subcloned in the TA cloning vector pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). Clones were sequenced to determine orientations relative to T3 and T7 sites and were used as templates for 50-μl PCRs (Advantage II PCR system; Clontech) using universal M13 forward and reverse primers. PCR products were precipitated and used as templates (∼1 μg/μl) for in vitro transcription of digoxygenin-labeled (Roche Applied Science) sense and antisense riboprobes. Probes were used for whole mount in situ hybridization as described previously (14Hauptmann G. Gerster T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 266Google Scholar). To obtain efficient labeling of internal tissues, hybridizations of larvae ≥3 days postfertilization were carried out using albino larvae that were treated 18 (3-day postfertilization larvae) to 22 min (4-day postfertilization larvae) in 10 μg/ml proteinase K.Electrophysiology—Using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), capped cRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase from linearized cDNA. We injected 0.2–10 ng of cRNAs; currents ranged from 0.5 to 50 μA. cRNA was injected into stage V or VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis, and oocytes were kept in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm Na2HPO4, 5.0 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone) for 1–7 days. Whole cell currents were recorded with a TurboTec 03× amplifier (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany) using an automated, pump-driven solution exchange system together with the oocyte testing carousel controlled by the interface OTC-20 (NPI Electronic). Data acquisition and solution exchange were managed using the software CellWorks version 5.1.1 (NPI Electronic). Data were filtered at 20 Hz and acquired at 1 kHz. The bath solution for two-electrode voltage clamp contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES. For the acidic test solutions, HEPES was replaced by MES buffer. If not otherwise indicated, acidic application solutions were applied for 3.5 s, and neutral bath solution (pH 7.4) was applied for 30 s between channel activation. Holding potential was -60 mV.For patch clamp experiments, bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Acidic test solutions were buffered with MES. Patch pipettes contained 140 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Rapid pH changes in the outside-out configuration were achieved by placing the patch in front of a piezo-driven double-barreled application pipette. Time constant for complete solution exchange is <2 ms (6Bässler E.L. Ngo-Anh T.J. Geisler H.S. Ruppersberg J.P. Gründer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33782-33787Google Scholar). Holding potential was -70 mV. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and acquired at 50 kHz.Data were analyzed using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Dose-response curves were fitted to a Hill equation, and I-V curves were fitted to a polynomal function. Time constants of desensitization were determined by fitting current traces obtained in outsideout patch clamp experiments to a monoexponential function. The current rise time was evaluated by determining the rise time from 20 to 80% of the peak current (time to peak). All values reported represent the mean ± S.E. from n individual measurements, if not otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis was done with Student's t test.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—zASIC1.2 was epitope-tagged by inserting into the cDNA an oligonucleotide encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) of influenza virus. zASIC1.3 was epitope-tagged by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) epitope (YTDIEMNRLGK). Both epitopes were inserted at the C termini of the respective proteins. To have equal signal intensities in Western blots, half the amount of cRNA for zASIC1.3 compared with zASIC1.2 was injected in Xenopus oocytes. Microsomal membranes of oocytes injected with the tagged proteins were prepared 2 days after injection as described (15Gründer S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Google Scholar). Proteins from part of the microsomal membranes (equal to two oocytes) were directly separated on a 9% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PolyScreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was then incubated with either peroxidase-coupled anti-HA antibody (1:1000; Roche Applied Science) or anti-VSV-G antibody (1 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) followed by peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (Lysate in Fig. 7). Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The remaining part of the microsomal membranes (equal to 16 oocytes) was resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% digitonin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A) and incubated with an anti-VSV-G antibody coupled to agarose (1:10; Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed several times and then separated on a gel and subjected to Western blot using the peroxidase-coupled anti-HA antibody as described above.RESULTSMolecular Characterization of ASICs from the Zebrafish— We isolated six full-length cDNA clones coding for proteins with strong homology to ASICs from the zebrafish. The open reading frames of the respective cDNA clones code for proteins consisting of 501–558 amino acids with similar predicted molecular masses of ∼60 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequences for all six zebrafish clones are shown together with the sequence of rat ASICs in Fig. 1. The degree of amino acid identity between the zebrafish and rat ASICs ranges from 60 to 75%. All six ASICs from zebrafish are encoded by different genes (Table I). Since only four asic genes are present in the genome of mouse and humans, the zebrafish has a greater variety of ASICs, which may be compensated by, at least in part, alternative splicing of the asic1 and -2 genes in mammals. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2) predicts that three of the zebrafish ASICs are orthologs of ASIC1, ASIC2, and ASIC4, respectively. We named these clones zASIC1.1, zASIC2, and zASIC4.1, respectively. Two other clones, zASIC1.2 and zASIC1.3, are paralogs of zASIC1.1, and one other clone, zASIC4.2, is a paralog of zASIC4.1. We did not identify an ortholog of ASIC3. However, there are genomic sequence data for additional zebrafish ASICs in the data base. Further studies will show if these genes are transcribed into mRNA coding for functional ASICs or if these genes are inactive pseudogenes.Fig. 1Sequence alignment of zASICs with rat ASIC1a, -2a, -3, and -4. Amino acids showing a high degree of identity are shown as white letters on a black background. The initiator methionine of each cDNA was assigned to the first ATG in frame. Transmembrane domains are indicated by bars, conserved cysteines by stars, and a conserved consensus site for N-linked glycosylation in the loop between transmembrane domains by a branched symbol. Accession numbers are as follows: U94403, ASIC1; U53211, ASIC2; AF013598, ASIC3; AJ271642, ASIC4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIntegrated physical and genetic map positions of zasic lociGeneLGaLinkage groupNearest markerDistanceLODbLogarithm of the odds scoreMinimal genetic interval (p-d)cProximal to distalGenetic Position (from top of LG)Human chromosomedThe physical position of human orthologs; the syntenic region for zasic4.2 was equivocalSyntenycReCentirayscMfCentimorganszasic1.122Wz12404.11110.78Z11379-Z6507∼1512q12Yeszasic1.28Zkp113g7ya435.81Z7819-Z4323∼3312q12Nozasic1.324unp2650gConsidered as duplicate markers by InstantMapperMaximumZ9603-Z6438∼5612q12Nozasic23Wz12338.1715.86Z9664-Z11227∼68.517q11.2-12Yeszasic4.19bz31c2716.54Z7319-Z25375∼432q35-36Yeszasic4.26fj66a042411.62Z17248-Z1209439.5-492q35-36?a Linkage groupb Logarithm of the oddsc Proximal to distald The physical position of human orthologs; the syntenic region for zasic4.2 was equivocale Centiraysf Centimorgansg Considered as duplicate markers by InstantMapper Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Evolutionary relationship of zASIC subunits and other family members. Other family members are ASICs and intestinal Na+ channels (INaCs) from human (h) and rat (r); ripped pocket (RPK) and pickpocket (PPK) from Drosophila; DEG-1, MEC-4, MEC-10, and UNC-8, degenerins from Caenorhabditis; subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) from rat; and the FMRFamid receptor (FaNaCh) from the snail Helix aspersa. Highly divergent sequences at the N and C termini as well as in the proximal part of the extracellular loop had been deleted, and the alignment and the tree for the phylogram have been established by Neighbor-Joining with ClustalX. The tree was then imported into TreeView and rooted with FMRFamid receptor as an outgroup. Maximum likelihood analysis using TreePuzzle gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)All six zASICs show the hallmarks of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel gene family: two hydrophobic domains, rather short N and C termini, and a large loop containing conserved cysteines between the two hydrophobic domains. There is one consensus site for N-linked glycosylation that is predicted to have an extracellular location and that is conserved in all zASICs (Fig. 1). Homology between different ASICs is particularly high in the second transmembrane domain and the region preceding this domain (Fig. 1). The C-terminal motif ((E/D)(F/I)(A/T)C) of rat ASIC1 and -2 that mediates the interaction of these ASICs with the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1 (16Hruska-Hageman A.M. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 5203-5208Google Scholar) is conserved in rat ASIC4 and in zASIC1.1, -2, -4.1, and -4.2 but not in zASIC1.2 and -1.3 (Fig. 1).Expression Pattern of asic Genes in Zebrafish Embryos and Larvae—The expression pattern of the six zasic genes in different zebrafish tissues was analyzed by in situ hybridization at 24, 30, 48, 72, and 96 h postfertilization (hpf). Expression of the asic genes was restricted mainly to neurons and maybe some glial cells. In general, each zasic showed spatially localized expression in specific neuronal tissues up until 48 hpf (Fig. 3) and then more widespread expression throughout the central nervous system from 72 hpf. Although overlapping in several cases, the expression patterns of zasic genes were distinguishable, indicating that each pattern was unique. Hybridization of sense strand cRNAs, which was performed as controls, did not give hybridization signals above background.Fig. 3zasic genes are widely expressed in the developing central nervous system. Lateral (A, C, E, G, I, and K) and ventral (B, D, F, H, J, and L) views of whole brains of embryos at 48 hpf show the distribution of various ASIC mRNAs (blue labeling).

At 48 hpf, expression also became evident in the trigeminal ganglia (Tg in Fig. 3, A and B). At 72 and 96 hpf, expression could be seen throughout most of the central nervous system except for the eyes (Fig. 4K). It was excluded from the dorsal forebrain except for the habenula nuclei. Like asic1.3 (see below), asic1.1 expression was stronger in the left habenula in comparison with the right habenula (Fig. 4K).Fig. 4Localized expression of zasic genes in specific central nervous system neurons and cranial ganglia.

There was also expression in the telencephalon, along the tract of the anterior commissure (black dashes in Fig. 3, C and D). zasic1.2 was additionally weakly expressed in the dorsal midbrain (dMb) and olfactory bulb (OB) at 48 hpf (Fig. 3, C and D). The level of staining increased by 96 hpf (Fig. 4, C and D) when zasic1.2 was also expressed in the tectum (Te in Fig. 4C). Unlike zasic1.1 and -1.3, zasic1.2 was not expressed asymmetrically in the habenulae at 96 h. zasic1.2 was the only zasic to be faintly expressed in the trunk of the fish (Fig. 4L, 96 hpf). Presumably, these cell bodies represent dorsal root ganglia. However, labeling was so faint that we could not unequivocally attribute it to a certain cell or tissue type.zasic1.3 was first expressed at 30 hpf in the anterior and posterior lateral line ganglia (aLL and pLL in Fig. 4, E and F), where it persisted until at least 48 hpf (Fig. 3, E and F). It was also expressed between 30 and 72 hpf in the telencephalon, along the tract of the anterior commissure (black dashes in Fig. 3E and data not shown). There was expression in the ventral thalamus, ventral midbrain, ventral cerebellum, and ventral hindbrain from 30 hpf. By 48 hpf, expression was also evident in the dorsal thalamus and hypothalamus (Fig. 3, E and F). At 72 hpf, weak expression was apparent in the habenulae, but by 96 hpf expression was stronger in the left habenula (LH) compared with the right habenula (RH) (not shown). This lateralized expression of zasic1.3 in the habenula has previously been published under the name habenular expressed sequence tag 1 (hest1) (18Concha M.L. Russell C. Regan J.C. Tawk M. Sidi S. Gilmour D.T. Kapsimali M. Sumoy L. Goldstone K. Amaya E. Kimelman D. Nicolson T. Gründer S. Gomperts M. Clarke J.D. Wilson S.W. Neuron. 2003; 39: 423-438Google Scholar).zasic2 expression was first detected at 30 hpf along the tract of the anterior commissure, where it persisted until 48 hpf (data not shown and dashed line in Fig. 3, G and H). At 48 hpf, zasic2 was also expressed in the preoptic area, ventral thalamus, and ventral midbrain and weakly in the ventral hindbrain (Fig. 3, G and H). At 72 and 96 hpf, expression was seen throughout most of the brain except for the dorsal forebrain. It was also expressed in the retinal ganglion cells (RGC in Fig. 4G).Expression of zasic4.1 was first evident at 48 hpf, at which stage the expression pattern was very similar to but stronger than that of zasic1.2. Of note, zasic4.1 (Fig. 3, I and J) was expressed in an extra domain in the dorsal midbrain (dMb) and in the retinal ganglion cells (data not shown).zasic4.2 was the earliest zasic to be expressed, being evident along the tract of the anterior commissure between 24 and 30 hpf (black dashes in Fig. 4, I and J, and data not shown). At 30 hpf, cells along the tract of the postoptic commissure also expressed zasic4.2 (red dashes in Fig. 4, I and J). At 48 hpf, very localized expression was evident in the preoptic area (POA in Fig. 3, K and L), which was maintained until at least 96 hpf. The posterior hypothalamus, ventral midbrain, hindbrain (Fig. 3, K and L), and retinal ganglion cells (Fig. 4H) all expressed zasic4.2 by 48 hpf. These domains of expression persisted and strengthened in older embryos. Notably, zasic4.2 was the only zasic almost devoid of expression in the telencephalon at 96 hpf (not shown).Functional Properties of zASICs—The functional properties of zASICs were investigated in X. laevis oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Oocytes expressing zASIC1.1, -1.2, -1.3, or -4.1 showed rapidly desensitizing inward currents when acidic solutions were applied, whereas zASIC2 and zASIC4.2 could not be activated by acidic test solutions. All zASIC currents had a similar overall shape (Fig. 5A). They rapidly activated and desensitized completely within less than 1 s. Occasionally, a small transient current increase appeared during desensitization of the channels that was highly variable among oocytes. Prolonged activation of zASIC4.1 led to the appearance of a sustained current component following the transient component (Fig. 5A, inset). This behavior is similar to rat ASIC3 (19Waldmann R. Bassilana F. de Weille J. Champigny G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20975-20978Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed only the transient current component of zASIC4.1 in detail. Recovery from desensitization of zASICs was complete within less than 30 s in pH 7.4 (not shown). The pH at which half-maximal activation of zASICs was reached varied between pH 5.0 and 6.6 (Fig. 5 and Table II). This corresponds to an almost 100-fold difference in agonist concentration. However, these large differences in agonist affinity are comparable with the mammalian ASICs, for which pH of half-maximal activation varies between pH 4.3 (ASIC2a) (20Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Google Scholar) and 6.7 (ASIC3) (21Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2121339927,"Amoebapore A is a 77-residue protein from the protozoan parasite and human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebapores lyse both bacteria and eukaryotic cells by pore formation and play a pivotal role in the destruction of host tissues during amoebiasis, one of the most life-threatening parasitic diseases. Amoebapore A belongs to the superfamily of saposin-like proteins that are characterized by a conserved disulfide bond pattern and a fold consisting of five helices. Membrane-permeabilizing effector molecules of mammalian lymphocytes such as porcine NK-lysin and the human granulysin share these structural attributes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how saposin-like proteins form membrane pores. All mechanisms indicate that the surface charge distribution of these proteins is the basis of their membrane binding capacity and pore formation. Here, we have solved the structure of amoebapore A by NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the specific activation step of amoebapore A depends on a pH-dependent dimerization event and is modulated by a surface-exposed histidine residue. Thus, histidine-mediated dimerization is the molecular switch for pore formation and reveals a novel activation mechanism of pore-forming toxins. Amoebapore A is a 77-residue protein from the protozoan parasite and human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebapores lyse both bacteria and eukaryotic cells by pore formation and play a pivotal role in the destruction of host tissues during amoebiasis, one of the most life-threatening parasitic diseases. Amoebapore A belongs to the superfamily of saposin-like proteins that are characterized by a conserved disulfide bond pattern and a fold consisting of five helices. Membrane-permeabilizing effector molecules of mammalian lymphocytes such as porcine NK-lysin and the human granulysin share these structural attributes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how saposin-like proteins form membrane pores. All mechanisms indicate that the surface charge distribution of these proteins is the basis of their membrane binding capacity and pore formation. Here, we have solved the structure of amoebapore A by NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate that the specific activation step of amoebapore A depends on a pH-dependent dimerization event and is modulated by a surface-exposed histidine residue. Thus, histidine-mediated dimerization is the molecular switch for pore formation and reveals a novel activation mechanism of pore-forming toxins. The protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, inhabits the colon of infected humans. It is the causative agent of human amoebiasis that often leads to tissue damage, colitis, and extraintestinal abscesses (1Ravdin J.I. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 20 (quiz, 1465-1466): 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Amoebiasis is the second leading cause of death from parasitic diseases worldwide (2Stanley Jr., S.L. Lancet. 2003; 361: 1025-1034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). About 50 million people suffer from invasive amoebiasis, of whom up to 100,000 die annually (3Walsh J.A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1986; 8: 228-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In the amoebic trophozoite, several factors have been identified that are involved in pathogenesis. In addition to a galactose-/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin on the amoebic surface that mediates adhesion to colonic mucus and host cells (4Petri Jr., W.A. Haque R. Mann B.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2002; 56: 39-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and secreted cysteine proteinases that disintegrate tissues by cleaving extracellular matrix proteins (5Bruchhaus I. Jacobs T. Leippe M. Tannich E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a family of membrane-active polypeptides have been discovered (6Leippe M. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These polypeptides exist as three isoforms and are named amoebapore A, B, and C, respectively. They are capable of lysing a broad spectrum of target cells, including human host cells and bacteria. It has been recently shown that trophozoites of E. histolytica lacking amoebapore A, due to transcriptional silencing of the encoding gene, became avirulent (7Bracha R. Nuchamowitz Y. Mirelman D. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this protein is a key pathogenicity factor of the parasite. All three amoebapore isoforms have been isolated and biochemically characterized, and their primary structure has been elucidated by molecular cloning of the genes of their precursors (8Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Leippe M. Tannich E. Nickel R. van der Goot G. Pattus F. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3501-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 10Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mature proteins consist of 77 amino acid residues each and are localized within cytoplasmic granules. The overall sequence identity between the three amoebapores is between 35 and 57% (10Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Despite the substantial sequence divergence, they possess a characteristic disulfide bond pattern and a single conserved C-terminal histidine residue. The secondary structure of the major isoform A has been determined to be exclusively α-helical (9Leippe M. Tannich E. Nickel R. van der Goot G. Pattus F. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3501-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and this has also been predicted for amoebapore B and C (10Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All amoebapores are able to form pores in membranes by oligomerization and thus affect the integrity of target cell membranes (10Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 11Gutsmann T. Rieckens B. Bruhn H. Wiese A. Seydel U. Leippe M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By sequence similarity, amoebapores have been grouped into the family of saposin-like proteins (SAPLIP). 1The abbreviations used are: SAPLIP, saposin-like proteins; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; DEPC, diethylpyrocarbonate; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Although the members of the SAPLIP family have different biological functions, they are all able to interact with lipids. With one exception, all of them possess six conserved cysteine residues that are involved in forming the disulfide bond pattern characteristic of this protein family (12Munford R.S. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1653-1663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the enormous evolutionary distance, amoebapores reveal a substantial sequence similarity with membrane-permeabilizing effector molecules of mammalian lymphocytes such as porcine NK-lysin and human granulysin. Like their amoebic counterparts, the mammalian proteins reside in intracellular granules and are able to lyse bacteria and eukaryotic cells (10Leippe M. Andrä J. Nickel R. Tannich E. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 895-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Andersson M. Gunne H. Agerberth B. Boman A. Bergman T. Sillard R. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Olsson B. Wigzell H. Dagerlind A. Boman H.G. Gudmundsson G.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14Pena S.V. Hanson D.A. Carr B.A. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2680-2688PubMed Google Scholar). Based on structural information and biochemical data, several mechanisms have been suggested to explain how saposin-like proteins may form membrane pores (15Bruhn H. Leippe M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Miteva M. Andersson M. Karshikoff A. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For both NK-lysin and granulysin, it has been suggested that binding of the monomeric proteins to the membrane via their charged epitopes results in destabilization of the lipid bilayer (17Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Homble F. Andersson M. Liepinsh E. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Anderson D.H. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Ernst W. Modlin R. Krensky A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), whereas amoebapore A has been proposed to act via the barrel stave mechanism (19Keller F. Hanke W. Trissl D. Bakker-Grunwald T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we present the high resolution three-dimensional structure of monomeric amoebapore A solved by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals that the charge distribution on the surface of amoebapore A differs markedly from that of other members of the saposin-like family of proteins, namely the porcine NK-lysin (20Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and human granulysin (18Anderson D.H. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Ernst W. Modlin R. Krensky A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In contrast to NK-lysin and granulysin with their positively charged epitopes that are suggested to be responsible for membrane interaction, amoebapore A shows an extended hydrophobic surface area. Moreover, we report that dimerization of amoebapore A is a prerequisite for membrane binding and pore formation. This dimerization mechanism is a pH-dependent activation step of cell lysis by amoebapore A, which is mediated by a key histidine residue located at the dimer interface. Protein Purification—Frozen trophozoites of E. histolytica HM-1: IMSS were extracted twice in 10 volumes of 1 n HCl, 5% acetic acid, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 1% NaCl overnight at 4 °C under constant shaking. The acid extracts were centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants were combined and passed through a tC18 12-cc (2 g) Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with 12 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 35% acetonitrile, and elution of adsorbed material was achieved with 15 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile. The eluate was lyophilized, redissolved in 4 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subsequently applied in portions to reversed-phase HPLC using an Aquapore Butyl 300 column (2.1 × 220 mm; Brownlee Laboratories, San Jose, CA) connected with a 130 A separation system (Applied Biosystems). Peptides were eluted with a nonlinear gradient of 0% (3 min), 40-50% (10 min), 50-70% (22 min), and 70% (10 min) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 50 °C and at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. All fractions were immediately tested for pore-forming activity. Active fractions were lyophilized, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and subjected to rechromatography using the same column and a linear gradient of 0-70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and otherwise the same conditions. Homogeneity of purified amoebapore A, which elutes at 55% acetonitrile, has been verified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry and was routinely confirmed by analytical reversed-phase HPLC and Tricine-SDS-PAGE using 13% separation gels (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10499) Google Scholar). Amoebapore A was repeatedly lyophilized and redissolved in 10 mm HCl to evaporate residual trifluoroacetic acid bound to the peptide and stored at -20 °C. NMR Spectroscopy—Lyophilized protein was dissolved in 93% H2O, 7% D2O, and the pH was adjusted to 3.5 The protein concentration was 1.5 mm. Sets of two-dimensional homonuclear 1H-NMR total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra were recorded at 600 or 750 MHz and 24 °C on either a Varian INOVA 750 or Bruker Avance 600/750 spectrometers. The mixing times for the six NOESY spectra were 60, 100, 140, 180, 250, and 300 ms, respectively. The spectral width was 8200 Hz in both dimensions, and the water signal was suppressed by a weak radio frequency pulse during the relaxation delay. For each spectrum, 400 t1 increments were acquired, each with 2048 complex points using the time-proportional phase incrementation scheme. Prior to Fourier transformation, a 60° shifted sine bell window function was applied in both dimensions, and the spectra were zero-filled in t1 so that 1024 × 1024 data points were obtained. Finally, the spectra were baseline-corrected with a polynomial function. To verify the amide proton resonance assignment, we recorded a natural abundance 1H-15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum at 750 MHz with spectral widths of 9000 and 2500 Hz for 1H and 15N, respectively. For the spectrum, 180 t1 increments were acquired each with 1600 complex points. For the H/D exchange experiments, the protein was lyophilized again and dissolved in 100% D2O. The pH and concentration were the same as in the above mentioned experiments. NOESY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms at 500 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE 500. The spectral width was 6009 Hz in both dimensions, and the water signal was suppressed by a weak radio frequency pulse during the relaxation delay. Because of the slowly exchanging amide protons, partly due to the low pH, the temperature was increased from 24 °C in the first recordings to 50 °C in the last recording. All data processing was performed on an SGI Indigo work station using the program nmrDraw (22Delagio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293PubMed Google Scholar). All subsequent procedures, such as spectral assignment, cross-peak integration, and distance determination, were performed by using the NMRview program (23Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar). CD Spectropolarimetry—CD measurements were carried out with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), calibrated according to Chen and Yang (24Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The spectral bandwidth was 1 nm. The measurements were carried out at 24 °C. Protein Concentration—Protein concentrations were calculated from absorption spectra in the range of 240-320 nm using the method of Waxman et al. (25Waxman E. Rusinova E. Hasselbacher C.A. Schwartz G.P. Laws W.R. Ross J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Assay for Pore-forming Activity—Pore-forming activity was determined by monitoring the dissipation of a valinomycin-induced diffusion potential in liposomes as described previously (8Leippe M. Ebel S. Schoenberger O.L. Horstmann R.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, liposomes prepared from crude soybean phosphatidylcholine IIS (Sigma) (40 mg/ml) in 50 mm K2SO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris maleate, pH 5.2, were diluted 1: 4000 in a similar buffer containing Na+ instead of K+ and adjusted to pH 5.2. The addition of 1 nm valinomycin induced a diffusion potential that was monitored by the fluorescence quenching of 3,3′-diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide dye (1 μm; Eastman Kodak Co.) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LS50B; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 620 and 670 nm, respectively. Pore-forming activity was measured as the initial change of fluorescence over time after the addition of sample. One unit is defined as a fluorescence increase to 5% of the prevalinomycin level in 1 min at 25 °C. Structure Calculation—Structure calculations were performed using the software program DYANA (26Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The structure calculation was based on a set of 1418 NOE distance restraints. In addition to the NOE constraints, 2 × 58 hydrogen bond distance restraints, resulting from the H/D exchange experiments, and 3 × 12 distances, representing the spaces within a disulfide bond, were introduced. NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, and weak and assigned to restraints of 1.8-2.8, 1.8-3.4, and 1.8-5.0 Å., respectively, with appropriate pseudo-atom corrections. Hydrogen bond restraints were 1.8-2.4 and 2.8-3.4 Å for H/O and N/O distances, respectively. Disulfide bond restraints were 2.03-2.15, 3.03-3.13, and 2.97-4.49 Å for SG/SG, SG/CB, and SG/CA distances, respectively. In the final structure calculation, all 1570 distance restraints were used to calculate 75 structures. Of these structures, 20 structures with the lowest target functions were selected. The structural statistics of these structures are listed in Table I. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1OF9).Table IStructural statistics for the 20 conformers of amoebapore ADistance restraintsIntraresidue (i − j = 0)606Sequential (|i − j| =1)406Medium range (2 ≤|i − j| = ≤ 4)246Long range (|i − j| ≥ 5)160Hydrogen bonds2 × 58Disulfide bonds3 × 12All1570Pairwise r.m.s. deviation for residues 6-73 in ÅMean global backbone r.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.0.71 ± 0.15Mean global heavy atom r.m.s.d.1.20 ± 0.16Pairwise r.m.s. deviation for secondary structures in ÅMean global backbone r.m.s.d.0.25 ± 0.11Mean global heavy atom r.m.s.d.0.78 ± 0.16Ramachandran plotbMean values for all 20 conformers.Most favored regions (%)75Additional allowed regions (%)18Generously allowed regions (%)7Disallowed regions (%)0a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.b Mean values for all 20 conformers. Open table in a new tab Size Exclusion Chromatography—Freeze dried amoebapore A was solved in 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5), 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.2), and 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), respectively, incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature, and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography with an equilibrated Superdex 75 (16/60) column (Amersham Biosciences) at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min at 4 °C. The column was calibrated using a mixture of four proteins of known molecular mass, i.e. albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5), 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.2), and 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0), respectively, and loaded with 1.0 ml of protein solution. Fractions of 3 ml were collected. Cross-linking—For cross-linking in solution, 0.5 μg of amoebapore A were incubated with 100 μm 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide in 1 m glycine methylester (pH 4.5) at 20 °C for 2 h (27Hoare D.G. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2447-2453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Carraway K.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 160: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Alternatively, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) was added from a freshly prepared stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide to the same amount of amoebapore A in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) to reach a final concentration of 100 μm (29Lomant A.J. Fairbanks G. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). After an incubation period of 30 min at 20 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding an excess of Tris. The samples were subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE using 13% gels (21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10499) Google Scholar). DEPC Modification—Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) modification was performed according to Andrä and Leippe (see Ref. 32Andrä J. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.58 mg of amoebapore A were dissolved in 4.0 ml of a 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) buffer. After incubation with a 200-fold excess of DEPC for 1.5 h at 4 °C and another 1 h at room temperature, the solution was subjected to size exclusion chromatography and eluted with a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.2) at 4 °C. Structure of Amoebapore A—Since the protein could not be recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and was purified from its natural source E. histolytica, structure elucidation of the amoebapore A relied on conventional two-dimensional 1H-NMR experiments. The helical secondary structure elements in amoebapore A were identified by the presence of characteristic dαN(i + 3) and dβN(i + 3) sequential connectivities in the two-dimensional NOESY spectra of this protein. Fig. 1 shows these patterns of connectivities derived from the NOESY spectra. This specific pattern is missing in the loop regions and incomplete for helix 1 due to partial spectral overlap. Additional information about the secondary structure elements was derived from H/D exchange experiments. Even after increasing the temperature to 50 °C for 24 h, several amide protons were still observable (Fig. 1) and therefore included in the structure calculation as hydrogen bonds (see “Experimental Procedures”). The structure of amoebapore A (for statistics, see Table I) consists of five α-helices (Fig. 2, A and B), which comprise residues 4-16 (helix I), 25-35 (helix II), 42-52 (helix III), 55-63 (helix IV), and 67-73 (helix V). A single disulfide bridge connects helices 2 and 3, whereas two disulfide bridges connect helices 1 and 5. According to structural classification of proteins (SCOP) (30Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. C C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5606) Google Scholar), the structure can be described as a folded leaf in which helices 1 and 2 are one-half of the leaf and are folded against helices 3, 4, and 5 as the second half. Helices 1 and 2 are connected by a loop consisting of eight residues (17Ruysschaert J.M. Goormaghtigh E. Homble F. Andersson M. Liepinsh E. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Anderson D.H. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Ernst W. Modlin R. Krensky A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Keller F. Hanke W. Trissl D. Bakker-Grunwald T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Liepinsh E. Andersson M. Ruysschaert J.M. Otting G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10499) Google Scholar, 22Delagio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293PubMed Google Scholar, 23Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar, 24Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar), whereas helices 3 and 4 virtually merge and are separated by only two residues (53 and 54). Residues 64-66 link helices 4 and 5. The two parts of the folded leaf are connected by a loop between helices 2 and 3 (residues 36-41). The superposition of 20 independently calculated structures demonstrates the coherence of the generated ensemble, which is shown as a schematic representation in Fig. 2A. In particular, within the helical regions, the root mean square deviations for the backbone atoms are 0.25 Å. Approximately 75% of the backbone Φ/ψ-dihedral angle pairs were in the most favorable region of a Ramachandran plot, and none were observed in disallowed regions. On the basis of this ensemble, an average structure of amoebapore A was calculated and resembles the typical fold of the saposin-like proteins (Fig. 2B). A comparison of this structure with the structures of porcine NK-lysin and human granulysin is shown in Fig. 3. Although the three structures show a similar global fold, they differ substantially in the spatial arrangement of the helices. The orientations of helices 2, 3, and 4 relative to each other are similar in the three structures. However, the orientation of helices 1 and 5 relative to 2, 3, and 4 diverges considerably in amoebapore A when compared with NK-lysin and granulysin (Fig. 3). In amoebapore A, helix 1 runs almost parallel to helices 2 and 3, whereas in NK-lysin and granulysin, helix 1 is kinked by ∼90°. Remarkably, the molecular surface character of amoebapore A constituted by residues from helices 1 and 2 is predominantly hydrophobic (Fig. 3). The length of this hydrophobic area of about 36 Å is sufficient to span a lipid bilayer (31Bransburg-Zabary S. Kessel A. Gutman M. Ben-Tal N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6946-6954Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, both mammalian molecules, NK-lysin and granulysin, have clusters of positively charged amino acids, which are proposed to be responsible for the initial contact with the membrane and ultimately lead to its destruction (16Miteva M. Andersson M. Karshikoff A. Otting G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Anderson D.H. Sawaya M.R. Cascio D. Ernst W. Modlin R. Krensky A. Eisenberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As such cationic clusters are not present on the surface of amoebapore A (Fig. 3), a different mode of interaction with the lipid bilayer must exist.Fig. 3Ribbon (44Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar) representations of amoebapore A (left), NK-lysin (middle), and granulysin (right) are shown in the upper panel. The C and N termini are depicted in black. All molecules were superimposed onto Cα atoms of residues 30-60. Helices are numbered by roman numerals. The electrostatic potential of the molecular surface is shown in the lower panel in the same orientation as in the upper panel, indicating positive potential in blue and negative potential in red. The representation of the surface was generated using GRASP (43Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Amoebapore A Forms Stable Dimers—As amoebapore A has been shown to be most active at pH 5.2 (32Andrä J. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), initial NMR experiments were performed at this pH. Unfortunately, the proton T2 values measured under these conditions were indicative of protein oligomerization. Stepwise lowering of the pH until 3.5 resulted in proton T2 values corresponding to a monomeric protein species (data not shown). Apparently, the oligomerization of amoebapore A, which pI has been calculated to 5.9, is driven by electrostatic interactions that are disrupted by protonation of acidic residues upon lowering the pH. To examine whether the global conformation of amoebapore A changes with pH, CD spectra of amoebapore A were recorded at pH values of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The identical CD spectra observed in Fig. 4A clearly indicate that the overall conformation of amoebapore A is not influenced by shifting the pH between 3 and 7. Although CD spectroscopy is a very sensitive method to observe changes in secondary structure, we cannot rule out changes in tertiary structure. As the conformation of amoebapore A did not change over the pH range tested, NMR experiments were performed at a pH value (i.e. 3.5) at which the protein does not self-associate. The observed pH-dependent oligomerization of amoebapore A raised the question about the stoichiometry of the functional protein complexes. To determine the stoichiometry and the stability of the oligomers, we performed size exclusion chromatography at different pH values. In accordance with the T2 measurements, chromatography at pH 3.5 revealed that the protein exists as a stable monomer (Fig. 4B). At pH 5.2, the protein eluted from the column as a single peak at a retention time corresponding to the molecular weight of the dimeric species (Fig. 4B). No higher order oligomers were detectable. The fact that amoebapore A is most active at this pH (32Andrä J. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that dimerization is a prerequisite for pore formation. Fractions containing the amoebapore A dimer were examined for pore-forming activity by monitoring the dissipation of a valinomycin-induced diffusion potential in liposomes. All of the pore-forming activity (54,375 units) of the material loaded onto the column was recovered in fractions containing the dimer. To further examine the relationship between pH-dependent activity and the oligomerization state, we performed size exclusion chromatography experiments at pH 8, at which amoebapore A has been described to be inactive (32Andrä J. Leippe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the protein elutes predominantly as a monomer (Fig. 4B). Although some entity was detected near the position of the dimer, it is known that amoebapo"

Unlike a number of other ADAM proteins, which interact with integrin receptors via their disintegrin domains, there is currently no evidence for an ADAM-17-integrin association. By analyzing the adhesion of a series of cell lines with recombinant fragments of the extracellular domain of ADAM-17, we now demonstrate a functional interaction between ADAM-17 and α5β1 integrin in a trans orientation. Because ADAM-17-mediated adhesion was sensitive to RGD peptides and EDTA, and the integrin-binding site within ADAM-17 was narrowed down to the disintegrin/cysteine-rich region, the two molecules appear to have a ligand-receptor relationship mediated by the α5β1 ligand binding pocket. Intriguingly, ADAM-17 and α5β1 were found to co-localize in both membrane ruffles and focal adhesions in HeLa cells. When confluent HeLa cell monolayers were wounded, ADAM-17 and α5β1 redistributed to the leading edge and co-localized, which is suggestive of a cis orientation. We postulate that the interaction of ADAM-17 with α5β1 may target or modulate its metalloproteolytic activity.

In addition, there are 19 ADAMs, called ADAMTS, that are not anchored to the membrane and have an extra thrombospondin domain. Although the proteolytic processing activity of ADAMs has been implicated in growth factor/cytokine/receptor release from cell surfaces, cell migration, and cell fate determination, the presence of non-functional metalloproteinase domains in a number of family members is suggestive of wider functionality. All ADAM proteins have a common multidomain structure, comprising an N-terminal pro-domain, and metalloproteinase, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, and epidermal growth factor domains. Many members of the family possess cytoplasmic domains with potential sites for binding signaling proteins. Perhaps the best-characterized ADAM proteinase is ADAM-17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-converting enzyme (TACE)), which was first identified through its ability to cleave the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α from its membrane-bound precursor (for a review, see Ref. 5Black R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the availability of mutant mice, recombinant protein, and cell-based assays for protein processing have shown ADAM-17 to be involved in the cleavage of a wide variety of ligands and receptors, including β-amyloid precursor protein, pro-transforming growth factor-α, CX3CL1, L-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, Notch, TrkA nerve growth factor receptor, interleukin-6 receptor, and erbB4 epidermal growth factor receptor (6Buxbaum J.D.

All ADAMs contain a disintegrin domain that is related in sequence (and presumably structure) to snake venom disintegrins, and they are therefore potential integrin ligands. All snake venom disintegrins contain an RGD integrin-binding motif within a large, flexible loop, and use this to induce hemorrhage by antagonizing the pro-thrombotic platelet integrin αIIbβ3. Although only one ADAM (ADAM-15) contains an RGD sequence in an analogous position to the snake venom disintegrin motif, many other family members contain acidic motifs in its place that might mediate integrin binding. Through the use of protein-protein binding assays, synthetic peptide competition, and site-directed mutagenesis, a number of examples of ADAM-integrin interactions have now been reported: ADAM-2 with α4β1 and α6β1, ADAM-3 with α6β1, ADAM-9 with α6β1 and αvβ5, ADAM-15 with α5β1 and αvβ3, ADAM-23 with αvβ3, ADAM-28 with α4β1, and a large number of ADAMs (1Black R.A.

Despite the biomedical importance of ADAM-17, there is currently no evidence that it interacts with an integrin. In this study, recombinant ADAM-17 was tested for cell adhesive activity and found to support integrin α5β1-dependent attachment and spreading. ADAM-17 was also found to bind directly to purified α5β1. ADAM-17-integrin interactions were divalent cation-dependent, inhibited by synthetic RGD peptides, and mediated by the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain region, suggestive of an interaction with the integrin ligand-binding pocket. Finally, ADAM-17 and α5β1 were found to co-localize in membrane protrusions during HeLa cell migration. Taken together, these data identify a novel integrin-ADAM interaction that has important implications for the known roles of ADAM-17 in inflammation.

A full-length cDNA clone of human α5 integrin was a gift from Ken Yamada and was subcloned into the pIRESneo2 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech, Cowley, UK). Cell Culture—COS-1 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Down, UK). Human dermal fibroblasts and HeLa cells were provided by Karl Kadler (University of Manchester, UK) and Philip Woodman (University of Manchester), respectively. COS-1 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged every 3-4 days at a ratio of 1:10. Human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in minimal essential medium containing Earle's salts, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% (v/v) minimal essential medium vitamins (Invitrogen). Cells were passaged every 3-4 days at a ratio of 1:3. Transfection of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were detached using 200 μg/ml EDTA, 500 μg/ml trypsin (BioWhittaker/Cambrex, Wokingham, UK) and plated overnight into 6-well culture plates (Costar, High Wycombe, UK) in complete medium. Cells were transfected with either 2 μgof α5-pIRES or pIRES vector alone/well using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h post-transfection, cells were placed into 75-cm2 flasks in growth medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (selection medium). 7-10 days after initial selection, G418-resistant colonies were harvested and expanded into routine culture. Cells expressing high levels of α5β1 integrin were selected by FACS. Recombinant ADAM-17 Expression—cDNA fragments encoding full-length and truncated extracellular fragments of ADAM-17 (Fig. 1) were PCR-cloned from THP-1 mRNA into the pIg mammalian expression vector (a gift from Dave Simmons, Celltech, Slough, UK), 5′ to a human IgG constant region (Fc) tag. This was sequenced, and transfected transiently into COS-1 cells by electroporation (0.4-cm gap at 0.25 kV, 950 microfarads). Transfected cells were then cultured in medium cleared of immunoglobulins using protein G-Sepharose for 7 days. Recombinant protein was purified from the medium by protein A affinity chromatography, using 100 mm citric acid, pH 3.5, as eluant. All samples were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9, and dialyzed against PBS. The enzymatic activity of recombinant ADAM-17 fragments was measured using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay. A peptide corresponding to the ADAM-17 cleavage sequence in pro-TNF-α (Ser-Pro-Leu-Ala-Gln-Ala-Val-Arg-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-Cys) containing an N-terminal fluorescent group (4′,5′-dimethoxyfluorescein) and a C-terminal quenching group (4-(3-succinimid-1-yl)fluorescein-NH2) was incubated with ADAM-17 fragments diluted in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100) for 16 h at 27 °C. Fluorescence was measured at 538 nm using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm. Any cleavage would be expected to separate the fluorescein and quenching groups and lead to increased fluorescence. The specificity of this reaction was tested using a peptide-hydroxamate inhibitor of TACE at 10 nm (compound 2a; prepared as described in Ref. 31Barlaam B. Bird T.J. Lambert-van der Brempt C. Campbell D. Foster S.J. Maciewicz R. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4890-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Monoclonal Antibody Production—Anti-ADAM-17 mAbs were raised in BALB/c mice. Mice were immunized with 100 μg of ADAM-17-Fc and then boosted 1 month later with the same amount. One week before the fusion, mice were given a final booster injection. Spleen cells were fused to 653 myeloma cells using 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. Hybridomas recognizing ADAM-17, and not the Fc tag, were identified by ELISA screening on ADAM-17-Fc and CD14-Fc, and dilution cloned. One clone, 34.4D, was grown in bulk, and purified by protein G affinity chromatography. Cell Spreading and Attachment—For cell spreading assays, protein ligand was diluted into PBS containing divalent cations, and 100-μl aliquots were applied to the wells of flat-bottomed, 96-well tissue culture plates. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the wells were blocked for 1 h with 200 μl of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured (85 °C, 10 min) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Near-confluent 75-cm2 flasks of human dermal fibroblasts were detached using trypsin/EDTA and quenched with medium. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES and 2.5 g/liter glucose to a density 1 × 105/ml, and 100-μl aliquots were added to each well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then fixed with 10 μl of 50% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 10 min. Percentage cell spreading was measured by phase contrast microscopy. For cell attachment assays, coating of wells and cell detachment were performed as described above, except that cells were resuspended to 2 × 105/ml. After cell addition to ligand-coated wells, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Unattached cells were removed by aspiration, and the remaining cells were fixed with 100 μl of 5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 20 min. Wells were then washed three times with 300 μl of divalent cation-free PBS, and cells were stained with 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in 0.2 m MES, pH 6, for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed extensively with water to remove excess crystal violet, and the stain was solubilized with 100 μl of 10% (v/v) acetic acid. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a 96-well plate reader. Integrin-ligand Binding—The wells of a 96-well plate (Immulon-3, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were incubated overnight at room temperature with 100-μl aliquots of purified placental integrin α5β1 (32Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) diluted 1:300 in PBS containing divalent cations and were then blocked with 200 μl of 5% (w/v) BSA in TBS, pH 7.4, for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes with 300 μl of 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA, TBS, pH 7.4 (wash buffer), 100-μl aliquots of ADAM-17-Fc in wash buffer were added. The wells were then incubated at room temperature for 3 h, the ADAM-17-Fc was aspirated, and the wells were washed three times with wash buffer. Bound ADAM-17-Fc was detected by addition of 100-μl aliquots of 1:1000-diluted HRP-conjugated goat anti-human Ig secondary antibody (Sigma, Poole, UK) diluted in wash buffer. Following incubation at room temperature for 20 min, excess HRP conjugate was removed with four 300-μl washes of wash buffer, and 100-μl aliquots of 40 mm 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) in 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 5, 0.01% (v/v) H2O2 were added. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a plate reader. Western Blotting—Samples were separated on 4-12% Bis/Tris SDS gels (Novex, Invitrogen) in MOPS buffer. Following transfer onto nitrocellulose, the filter was blocked in 5% (w/v) milk in TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Anti-ADAM-17 primary antibody was diluted to 10 μg/ml in 5% (w/v) milk in TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated with the nitrocellulose for 1-2 h at room temperature with agitation. Following four 5-min washes in 20 ml of TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the filter was incubated with 1:2000 HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody for 30 min. Excess secondary antibody was removed with four 10-min washes with 20 ml of TBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. HRP was then detected with 10 ml of chemiluminescence reagent for 2 min and exposed to Kodak Biomax photographic film in the dark. Scratch Wounding and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—α5β1-transfected HeLa cells were plated onto glass coverslips at high density in selection medium and grown to confluence. Cell monolayers were wounded by a single scratch of a scalpel blade across the surface of the coverslips. After varying times, cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed coverslips were blocked and permeabilized with 20% (v/v) normal donkey serum, 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated normal human serum, 0.25% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h in 10 μg/ml 34.4D (anti-ADAM-17) and 10 μg/ml mAb11 (anti-α5) or 10 μg/ml mouse and rat IgG (Sigma), respectively. After five washes with PBS, coverslips were incubated with TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-rat and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:200 with PBS. Cells were analyzed using an Olympus IX70 microscope, with a ×63 oil objective, and images were processed by constrained iterative deconvolution (DeltaVision, Applied Precision Instruments, Seattle, WA). 0.2-μm-thick z-sections are shown. FACS—Confluent flasks of cells were detached using 5 mm EDTA in Hanks' buffered saline solution at 37 °C and resuspended in serum-containing medium to a density of 1 × 107/ml. 10 μg/ml primary antibody, diluted in 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide in divalent cation-free PBS, was added on ice for 45 min, and the cells washed three times with 300 μl of 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in divalent cation-free PBS. 1:200 FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody in divalent cation-free PBS containing 10% (v/v) human serum was added on ice for 30 min, and then the cells were washed twice with 300 μl of divalent cation-free PBS containing 1% (v/v) FBS and once with 300 μl of divalent cation-free PBS. Cells were fixed with 100 μl of 2% (v/v) formaldehyde in divalent cation-free PBS. For each sample, 2 × 104 cells were counted using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Cowley, Oxford, UK) at a flow rate of less than 200 events/s. Expression of Recombinant ADAM-17-Fc—Although key functions have been established for the proteolytic activity of ADAM-17, its potential cell binding activity has not been investigated. Therefore, to determine whether ADAM-17 possesses adhesive activity, the full-length extracellular region of the molecule (amino acids 1-651; Fig. 1) was expressed as an Fc fusion protein and used as an adhesion substrate. The ADAM-17-Fc construct was expressed transiently in COS-1 cells and purified from culture medium using protein A affinity chromatography. Coomassie Blue staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed a doublet of ∼120 and 140 kDa indicative of the precursor and processed forms of ADAM-17 (Fig. 2A). Correct removal of the pro-domain at an intramolecular furin cleavage site situated between the pro- and metalloproteinase domains was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the 120-kDa protein band (yielding a sequence of ADPDPMKNTCKLLV; data not shown). Under non-reducing conditions, a broad band of molecular mass ∼250 kDa was observed, which presumably corresponds to a mixture of disulfide-bonded Fc dimers of the 120- and 140-kDa proteins (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this conclusion, the 120-, 140-, and ∼250-kDa bands all reacted with an anti-Fc antibody following Western blotting (data not shown) and with the anti-ADAM-17 mAb 34.4D (Fig. 2B). As one approach to determine whether the ADAM-17-Fc protein was folded correctly, its metalloproteinase activity was measured. For this purpose, an assay based on cleavage of a fluorescently labeled 10-amino acid peptide corresponding to the ADAM-17 cleavage site in pro-TNF-α was employed. As shown in Fig. 2C, ADAM-17-Fc possessed dose-dependent proteolytic activity that was complete at only 0.5 μg/ml protein, consistent with an enzymatic reaction. A peptide-hydroxamate acid-competitive inhibitor of ADAM-17 (compound 2a) inhibited this cleavage completely at 10 nm, demonstrating the specificity of the ADAM-17 activity (data not shown). Recombinant CD14-Fc, employed as a negative control, gave no detectable cleavage of the pro-TNF-α substrate. Thus, recombinant ADAM-17-Fc was expressed and processed normally. The protein also possessed metalloproteinase activity, which is suggestive of correct folding. ADAM-17 Supports Adhesion of Fibroblastic Cells—To examine whether ADAM-17 could support cell adhesion, both attachment and spreading assays were performed with human dermal fibroblasts. These cells were chosen because they express a wide range of extracellular matrix receptors. Efficient coating of the plastic substrate with ADAM-17-Fc was confirmed by anti-Fc ELISA assay (data not shown). ADAM-17-Fc supported fibroblast adhesion in a saturable, dose-dependent manner, whereas a CD14-Fc-negative control was unable to support adhesion above the BSA background (Fig. 3A). A maximal level of cell attachment of ∼50% was observed at a coating concentration of 20 μg/ml ADAM-17-Fc, which was slightly lower than that of a 50-kDa fragment of fibronectin positive control (∼70% attachment). Half-maximal attachment was obtained at ∼4 μg/ml ADAM-17-Fc and ∼0.07 μg/ml 50-kDa fragment, which suggests that ADAM-17 interacts with the cell surface with lower affinity. Similar results were obtained in cell spreading assays (Fig. 3B). Thus, ADAM-17-Fc supported dose-dependent, saturable spreading of dermal fibroblasts to a maximum of ∼70%, compared with a level of ∼95% obtained with the 50-kDa fragment of fibronectin. Half-maximal spreading was achieved at ∼7 μg/ml (ADAM-17) and 0.11 μg/ml (50-kDa fibronectin). CD14-Fc and BSA controls were inactive. Taken together, these data indicate that ADAM-17 is able to promote both attachment of normal fibroblasts and that this adhesion is able to elicit a signaling response that results in cell spreading. In other studies, ADAM-17 was found to support the adhesion of a variety of other cell lines, including B16 melanoma, K562 erythroleukemia, and HCS-2/8 chondrosarcoma cells (data not shown). Cell Adhesion to ADAM-17 Is Mediated by Integrin α5β1— Because ADAM-17 contains a disintegrin domain, integrins are candidate adhesion receptors that could be responsible for the observed cell adhesion and spreading onto ADAM-17-Fc. Integrin-ligand interactions are strongly divalent cation-dependent and EDTA-inhibitable, and, consistent with a role for integrins in ADAM-17 recognition, EDTA blocked dermal fibroblast adhesion to ADAM-17-Fc (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, when dermal fibroblasts were plated in cation-free PBS, cell attachment to ADAM-17-Fc was only observed when the buffer was supplemented with Mn2+ (70% attachment) or, to a lesser degree, with Mg2+ (25% attachment; Fig. 4A). Supplementation with Ca2+ did not support adhesion above BSA background levels. This pattern of cation dependence, in particular the potent stimulation by Mn2+, is consistent with integrin-dependent adhesion. To identify integrin subunits potentially responsible for cell adhesion to ADAM-17-Fc, a series of inhibitory anti-integrin mAbs was screened for their ability to inhibit cell spreading onto 20 μg/ml ADAM-17-Fc (Fig. 4B). Antibodies directed against β1 (4B4, P4C10) or α5 (JBS5, mAb16) subunits reduced spreading by ∼50 and ∼70%, respectively. Inhibitory antibodies directed against α2 (JA218), α4 (HP2/1), and αv (17E6, 14D"

The mutation disrupts two genes, CWH36 and a recently identified open reading frame on the opposite strand, YCL005W-A. We demonstrate that disruption of YCL005W-A is entirely responsible for the Vma- growth phenotype of the cwh36Δ mutant. YCL005W-A encodes a homolog of proteins associated with the Manduca sexta and bovine chromaffin granule V-ATPase. The functional significance of these proteins for V-ATPase activity had not been tested, but we show that the protein encoded by YCL005W-A, which we call Vma9p, is essential for V-ATPase activity in yeast. Vma9p is localized to the vacuole but fails to reach the vacuole in a mutant lacking one of the integral membrane subunits of the V-ATPase. Vma9p is associated with the yeast V-ATPase complex in vacuolar membranes, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation with known V-ATPase subunits and glycerol gradient fractionation of solubilized vacuolar membranes. Based on this evidence, we propose that Vma9p is a genuine subunit of the yeast V-ATPase and that e subunits may be a functionally essential part of all eukaryotic V-ATPases.

V-ATPases 1The abbreviations used are: V-ATPase, vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase; HA, hemagglutinin; 3HA, three copies of the influenza hemagglutinin epitope; YEPD, yeast extract/peptone/dextrose; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ORF, open reading frame; CDART, Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool. are highly conserved proton pumps responsible for acidification of multiple organelles, including the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and lysosomes, in all eukaryotic cells (1Nelson N.

All V-ATPases are multisubunit complexes comprised of a peripheral sector, V1, attached to a membrane sector, V0. In yeast cells, the V1 sector contains eight different subunits, and the V0 sector contains five subunits; all of these subunits have homologs in other eukaryotic cells (1Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of any V-ATPase subunit results in a well defined set of growth defects in yeast, including sensitivity to elevated pH and calcium concentrations, inability to grow on non-fermentable carbon sources, and sensitivity to a variety of heavy metals (3Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This Vma- growth phenotype has been invaluable in determining the subunit composition of the yeast V-ATPase and in assessing the level of V-ATPase function in various mutants, and it has largely driven the emergence of yeast as the model system of choice in many studies of eukaryotic V-ATPases (5Graham L.A. Flannery A.R. Stevens T.H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 6Kane P.M. Smardon A.M. J. Bioenerg.

Although V-ATPase subunit composition is very similar among eukaryotes, highly purified preparations of the Manduca sexta and bovine chromaffin granule V-ATPases both contain membrane proteins of 9–10 kDa that had not been observed in other systems, including yeast (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Merzendorfer H. Huss M.

This protein associated tightly with the V0 sector in both preparations and appeared to be present at a comparable stoichiometry with the other V-ATPase subunits, prompting the investigators to name it the “e” subunit. However, it was impossible to determine whether these proteins played a critical role in V-ATPase function or were “accessory” proteins involved in assembly or regulation in an organelle- and/or species-specific manner. In fact, the bovine protein (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) showed limited homology to the yeast Vma21 protein, which is an endoplasmic reticulum protein essential for V-ATPase assembly (10Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This suggested that higher eukaryotes had evolved a version of Vma21p that might play a similar role in assembly but remained attached to the assembled enzyme. We screened a library of yeast deletion strains for mutants exhibiting the Vma- phenotype characteristic of loss of V-ATPase activity. 2M. Sambade, M. Alba, R. W. West, A. M. Smardon, and P. M. Kane, manuscript in preparation. One mutant, cwh36Δ, exhibited a very strong Vma- phenotype and no vacuolar acidification. Similar results were reported recently by Davis-Kaplan et al. (11Davis-Kaplan S.R. Ward D.M. Shiflett S.L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4322-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) as the result of a genome-wide screen for mutants defective in iron-dependent growth. Here we provide evidence that the cwh36Δ mutation disrupts an open reading frame encoding a yeast homolog of the M. sexta and bovine e subunits. This protein is essential for V-ATPase activity and copurifies with the V-ATPase from vacuolar membranes. Based on these results, this protein, which we propose to call Vma9p, appears to be an essential subunit of the V-ATPase in yeast cells. Yeast Strains and Materials—The BY4741 cwh36Δ::KanMX strain (MAT a his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 cwh36Δ::KanMX) was from the collection of haploid yeast strains each deleted in a single nonessential gene as described by Shoemaker et al. (12Shoemaker D.D. Lashkari D.A. Morris D. Mittmann M. Davis R.W. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and purchased from Invitrogen. PCR amplifications were carried out using LA Taq polymerase purchased from Panvera. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. DNA sequencing was done by the State University of New York Upstate DNA sequencing facility. Concanamycin A was obtained from Wako Biochemicals, and octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside was from Calbiochem. Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody was purchased from Covance, and mouse anti-yeast alkaline phosphatase antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were from Sigma. Yeast strains were maintained on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YEPD) or supplemented minimal medium prepared as described previously (13Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 177-179Google Scholar). Where indicated, YEPD medium was buffered to pH 5 or 7.5 with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm sodium or buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm MES, 50 mm MOPS when CaCl2 was added. Plasmid and Strain Constructions—A fragment of genomic DNA containing the CWH36 and YCL005W-A genes was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGTGAACCACATAAGTGTATGTGCACACGCG-3′ (5′-flanking primer) and 5′-GAGCCAATTGACCACCGCCTC-3′ (3′-flanking primer). The PCR fragment was cleaved with BglII and HindIII and inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pRS315 (14Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Premature stop sites were introduced into the CWH36 and YCL005W-A open reading frames by fusion PCR. To generate the early stop site of Cwh36p, two fragments were amplified using the following oligonucleotides (mutations are underlined): 1) 5′-GGCCCACATTAAAAACATCATGGCCAATGTC-3′ and the 3′-flanking primer and 2) 5′-GGCCATGATGTTTTTAATGTGGGCCATTACG-3′ and the 5′-flanking primer. The two fragments were then purified and combined, and the mutated fragment was obtained by fusion PCR using the two flanking primers. The premature stop codon in YCL005W-A was introduced by the same method except that the primer pairs for the first PCR reaction were the following: 1) 5′-GCTTGGTTGTTCTATGGAGCCATTATCCAGAAC-3′ and the 3′-flanking primer and 2) 5′-GGATAATGGCTCCATAGAACAACCAAGCGTATG-3′ and the 5′-flanking primer. Both mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing and cloned into vector pRS315 as described above. The 3HA epitope tag was inserted at the C terminus of Vma9p as described by Wach (15Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The following three fragments were amplified by PCR. 1) The sequence encoding the VMA9 ORF was amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAAGGCGCTGGTGTTTCG-3′ (VMA9 5′-flanking primer) and 5′-CCCGGGGATCCGTTCGTCAAATTCAGGTCCAAATC-3′, 2) a fragment containing the 3HA epitope and a KanMX genetic marker was amplified from plasmid pFA6a-3HA-KanMX6 (16Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 5′-CGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA-3′ (F2) and 5′-GAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC-3′ (R1), and 3) the sequence just downstream of the VMA9 stop codon was amplified from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides 5′-GAGCTCGAATTCAGCGTCGAGTATATCAAGCCAAG-3′ and the CWH36 5′-flanking primer described above. The underlined portions of fragments 1 and 3 are complementary to portions of fragment 2, and these sequences supported fusion of the three purified fragments after they were combined and PCR-amplified in the presence of the two flanking primers. The product of the fusion PCR was used to transform SF838-1Dα cells (MATα leu2-112 ura3-52 his4-519 ade6 gal2 pep4-3) (17Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by their growth on YEPD plates containing 200 μg/ml G418. Insertion of the 3HA tag immediately before the VMA9 stop codon at the VMA9 genomic locus was confirmed by PCR from genomic DNA of the transformants and DNA sequencing. The vma2Δ::LEU2 and vma3Δ::URA3 alleles were introduced by PCR amplification of the mutant alleles followed by transformation into the epitope-tagged strain as described previously (18Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Biochemical and Immunological Methods—Vacuoles were purified by Ficoll flotation as described by Roberts et al. (19Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 15 mm MES, pH 7, 4.8% glycerol buffer. Concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity was assayed by a coupled enzyme assay (20Lotscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) performed in the absence and presence of 200 nm concanamycin A. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry assay (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of vacuolar vesicles and whole cell lysates was performed as described previously (22Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using mouse monoclonal antibodies 8B1, 13D11, and 10D7, monoclonal antibodies against the A, B, and a subunits, respectively, of the V-ATPase; monoclonal antibody 1D3 against yeast alkaline phosphatase; and monoclonal antibody HA.11 against the 3HA epitope. Immunoprecipitation of the V-ATPase complex was performed as described by Parra and Kane (23Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Vacuoles were solubilized in 2% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside 0.35% of the same detergent was included throughout the immunoprecipitation, and V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated with the anti-B subunit antibody (13D11). Glycerol gradient purification of the V-ATPase was performed as described previously (24Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 1) Washed vacuolar vesicles were resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml protein and solubilized in 2% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. 2) A 7.8-ml glycerol step gradient, consisting of equal volume steps varying by 5% glycerol and covering a range of 50–20% glycerol, was prepared in a 16 × 60-mm Beckman Ultracentrifuge tube. All of the glycerol solutions contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.35% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. The solubilized vesicles were loaded on top of the gradient and then spun at 42,000 rpm for 7 h in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, precipitated by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a 10% final concentration, and then solubilized and visualized by immunoblotting as described. A screen for vma mutants was performed on a library of yeast mutants deleted for each of the non-essential genes to discern genes that might affect V-ATPase activity. Screening revealed a number of mutants that had Vma- growth phenotypes,2 including cwh36Δ (YCL007cΔ). Vacuoles isolated from this deletion strain had a very low V-ATPase activity, suggesting a role for this gene in V-ATPase function.2 Similar observations were also made by Davis-Kaplan et al. (11Davis-Kaplan S.R. Ward D.M. Shiflett S.L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4322-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) starting from a genomic screen for yeast mutants defective in irondependent growth (11Davis-Kaplan S.R. Ward D.M. Shiflett S.L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4322-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of this protein in V-ATPase function, C-terminal HA, Myc, and green fluorescent protein epitope tags were fused to the CWH36 ORF (15Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 16Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). However, no tagged protein was expressed in any of the isolates screened. Kellis et al. (25Kellis M. Patterson N. Endrizzi M. Birren B. Lander E.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar) suggested that the CWH36 ORF overlapped with another, previously unidentified gene on the complement strand (YCL005W-A). The cwh36Δ mutation would also delete most of this gene, and we hypothesized that deletion of this gene may have led to Vma- phenotype of the cwh36Δ strain. Fig. 1A shows the genome position of the two genes. The YCL005W-A ORF encodes a small hydrophobic protein of 8.4 kDa. Comparison of the primary sequence with data bases revealed homology to putative hydrophobic V-ATPase subunits in other organisms, including the M. sexta 9.7-kDa subunit e (9Merzendorfer H. Huss M. Schmid R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17372-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the human 9.2-kDa subunit, which is closely related to the bovine chromaffin granule 9.2-kDa protein. Fig. 1B shows a representative comparison of some of these genes with the yeast protein predicted from the YCL005W-A sequence. The yeast protein shows 25% identity to the M. sexta e subunit and 22% identity to the human, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins. The CDART program (26Geer L.Y. Domrachev M. Lipman D.J. Bryant S.H. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) recognizes related proteins by domain architecture and groups the M. sexta and bovine e subunits with 26 other proteins from many different eukaryotes; when presented to the CDART program, the yeast YCL005W-A ORF was grouped with these proteins. 3The National Center for Biotechnology Information CDART program identifies this common structural motif in 28 predicted protein sequences in addition to Vma9p. These sequences have the following GenBank™/EBI accession numbers: CAE74051, EAA55854, XP_088142, CAE45916, CAE02898, XP_313345, XP_313344, EAA38504, CAD27522, NP_649327, NP_647882, NP_650578, BAC05292, NP_647868, AAK67647, NP_446030, NP_598525, NP_568823, AAL48783, NP_501636, NP_194401, AAK28556, NP_079548, AAF71753, NP_003936, CAA06822, P81103, and CAA75570. To clarify the role that Cwh36p or YCL005W-A protein may have in V-ATPase function, a complementation assay was performed. A fragment encompassing both genes was cloned into a low copy number plasmid and shown to complement the cwh36Δ mutation as demonstrated by restored growth of the transformed cells on YEPD, pH 7.5 + CaCl2 medium (Fig. 1C). Premature stop codons were then introduced into both reading frames, with the stop codon chosen to give no change in amino acid sequence for the gene on the opposite strand. (The positions of the stop codons are shown in Fig. 1A). The mutant plasmids were transformed into a cwh36Δ strain. The plasmid with the mutation predicted to truncate Cwh36p still permits growth of the mutant on YEPD, pH 7.5 and YEPD, pH 7.5 + CaCl2 medium, indicating that loss of Cwh36p does not affect function (Fig. 1C). The plasmid with the mutation predicted to truncate the YCL005W-A ORF does not complement the cwh36Δ mutant phenotype. These data indicate that the Vma- mutant phenotype of the cwh36Δ mutant arises from deletion of YCL005W-A, not CWH36. Based on this information and data described below we propose to rename YCL005W-A as VMA9. To track this putative subunit and compare the effects of a V1 or V0 deletion on subunit localization, the gene was epitopetagged at the C terminus with three copies of the influenza hemagglutinin epitope in a vacuolar protease-deficient strain (pep4 mutant; Ref. 27Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Saari C. Valls L.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). (We were unable to detect the tag when it was introduced into a PEP4 wild-type strain.) The strain containing the epitope-tagged Vma9p-3HA grew as well as the wild-type strain on YEPD, pH 7.5 + CaCl2 medium (data not shown). Vacuolar vesicles from the tagged strain had a concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity of 0.40 ± 0.07 μmol min-1mg-1 (n = 2), 53% of the activity obtained from the congenic wild-type strain. Western blots of the vacuolar vesicles were probed with antibodies to the HA epitope (Fig. 2A). Vacuoles from the VMA9-3HA-containing strain contain a cross-reacting band of ∼15 kDa that is not found in the untagged strain. (The predicted size of Vma9p from the sequence is 8.4 kDa, and the 3HA tag has a predicted molecular mass of 4.8 kDa.) These data indicate that introduction of the 3HA tag into VMA9 does not prevent V-ATPase function and that Vma9p is found at the vacuole. Previous studies have demonstrated that deletion of a V1 subunit results in concurrent loss of other V1 subunits from the vacuole, and deletion of a V0 subunit leads to a decrease in all V-ATPase subunits at the vacuole (22Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effects of loss of V1 and V0 subunits on localization of Vma9p, we introduced a vma2Δ mutation, which deletes the V1 B subunit, or a vma3Δ mutation, which deletes the V0 c subunit, into the VMA9-3HA strain. Isolated vacuoles from these strains had no V-ATPase activity, characteristic of these deletion strains (data not shown). Western analysis (Fig. 2A) confirmed that in the absence of an intact V1 (vma2Δ strain), the HA-tagged protein was still present at the vacuole. However, in the absence of V0 (vma3Δ strain), there was a clear decrease in this protein. In all strains, relative concentrations of the vacuolar protein alkaline phosphatase were the same (Fig. 2A). Western analysis of whole cell lysates showed little difference in relative subunit concentrations between strains (Fig. 2B), except that the V0 a subunit is at very low levels in the vma3Δ strain (22Kane P.M. Kuehn M.C. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 447-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results described above demonstrate that Vma9p is a vacuolar protein and that its presence in the vacuole is dependent on the presence of an intact V0 sector. To test whether Vma9p is actually a subunit of the V-ATPase, we isolated V-ATPase complexes by two different methods. First, we solubilized vacuolar membranes and immunoprecipitated assembled V-ATPase complexes using an antibody to the V1 subunit B. Immunoprecipitates from the Vma9p-3HA strain contain the ∼15-kDa HA-tagged Vma9p, in addition to the 100-kDa V0 subunit a and the 69-kDa V1 subunit A, but immunoprecipitates from the untagged strain or from a mock precipitation lacking any vacuolar membranes contain little or no HA-tagged protein (Fig. 3A). Vacuoles from a vma2Δ strain contain assembled V0 sectors even though they lack V1 subunits (23Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To confirm that Vma9p is associated with the V0 sector of the V-ATPase, we performed a similar immunoprecipitation from the vma2Δ vacuoles containing HA-tagged Vma9p, in this case using an antibody to V0 subunit a that is capable of immunoprecipitating free V0 sectors (23Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the anti-a subunit antibody coprecipitates Vma9p-3HA from these vacuoles. In addition, glycerol gradient analysis of solubilized vacuoles was used to determine whether the tagged subunit fractionated with the assembled V-ATPase complex. Fig. 3C shows an immunoblot of fractions 2–14 of the glycerol gradient. As described previously (24Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19236-19244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the V1V0 complex migrated to a glycerol concentration of ∼35% (fraction 7), and the V1 subunits (A and B) peaked at this position. V0 subunit a is also present in this fraction but shows a somewhat broader distribution through fractions 6–10. Like the V0 a subunit, Vma9p-3HA was present in fraction 7 with the intact V1V0 complexes but was also found in fractions 6–10. All of the subunits were also at the top of the gradient, in fractions 13–14; these fractions may include free V0 sectors as well as disassembled or unsolubilized complexes. Taken together, these data indicate that Vma9p is part of assembled V1V0 complexes and free V0 complexes. Taken together, the data presented here provide strong evidence that Vma9p is a V-ATPase subunit. First, disruption of the VMA9 gene results in a characteristic Vma- phenotype (Fig. 1), loss of vacuolar acidification (11Davis-Kaplan S.R. Ward D.M. Shiflett S.L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4322-4329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar),2 and loss of V-ATPase activity at the vacuole.2 Second, Vma9p is present at the vacuole, and its vacuolar localization is dependent on the presence of other V0 subunits (Fig. 2). Third, Vma9p is assembled with the V-ATPase at the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 3). Biochemical studies demonstrating association of homologous proteins with the M. sexta and bovine V-ATPases had suggested these proteins were subunits (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Merzendorfer H. Huss M. Schmid R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17372-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) but left open the possibility that they might be tissue-specific and provided no test of their significance in V-ATPase function. In contrast, the previously characterized yeast Vma21p is essential for V-ATPase function, based on the Vma- phenotype of vma21Δ mutants, but is not part of the final assembled V-ATPase complex (10Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Significantly, the VMA21 gene showed some homology to the mammalian e subunit genes (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) but little or no homology to the M. sexta and yeast genes, and it was not grouped with the e subunits by the CDART program (26Geer L.Y. Domrachev M. Lipman D.J. Bryant S.H. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The functional data presented here, along with the homology with the ∼9-kDa V-ATPase-associated proteins from M. sexta and bovine cells (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Merzendorfer H. Huss M. Schmid R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17372-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the presence of homologs in many different eukaryotes, suggest that the e subunit may play an essential role in all V-ATPases. These results also predict certain features of this subunit that can be probed in future experiments. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of YCL005W-A (Saccharomyces Genome Database; www.yeastgenome.org) suggests that Vma9p might have two transmembrane domains. This, along with the data indicating that its presence in the vacuole is dependent on the presence of an intact V0 sector but not an intact V1 sector, suggests that it is a V0 sector subunit; coprecipitation of Vma9p-3HA with the V0 sector from vma2Δ vacuoles (Fig. 3B) provides strong evidence that it is indeed a V0 sector subunit. Although we had never noticed an 8.4-kDa protein in previous purifications of the yeast V-ATPase, V0 sectors immunoprecipitated from vacuolar membranes of a vma2Δ mutant do contain a small molecular mass protein (23Parra K.J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19592-19598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that might be Vma9p. In addition, Ludwig et al. (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) noted previously that the chromaffin 9.2-kDa protein was difficult to visualize by SDS-PAGE. The apparent sensitivity of the C-terminal 3HA tag to vacuolar proteases in a Pep4+ strain would suggest that the C terminus of the Vma9p might face the vacuolar lumen, and this is consistent with the topology proposed for the M. sexta e subunit, based on glycosylation of this protein at a site near the C terminus of the protein (8Ludwig J. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Pfeiffer K. Gelawi F. Apps D.K. Schagger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10939-10947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 9Merzendorfer H. Huss M. Schmid R. Harvey W.R. Wieczorek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17372-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that although Vma9p does not reach the vacuole in the vma3Δ mutant, it is present at near wild-type levels in whole cell lysates of the mutant (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the a subunit is rapidly degraded when one of the other V0 subunits is missing. This suggests that proper assembly of V0 sectors is not essential for Vma9p stability, but there is still a possibility that the 3HA tag is stabilizing Vma9p in our experiments. Finally, the position of the e subunit in the V0 sector is an intriguing question. The e subunit appears to contain no intramembrane acidic residues, like the three essential c-like subunits of the yeast V0 sector (28Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), so it is unlikely that it directly participates in proton transport. Placement of the e subunit in the V0 complex may provide further insights into its functional contribution. We thank Manolis Kellis (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for clarifying the predicted sequence of YCL005W-A before it was released."

Specific mutations such as F256V, I765A, and Y837A reduce not only the apparent affinity of the ATPase for TG but also the maximal inhibitory effect. The effect of mutations is dependent on the type and size of the substitute side chain, indicating that hydrophobic partitioning of TG and complementary molecular shapes are involved not only in binding but also in the inhibitory mechanism. A major factor determining the inhibitory effect of bound TG is its interference with conformational changes that are required for the progress of the ATPase cycle. Most prominent and specific is the TG interference with a wide displacement of the Phe-256 side chain that is associated with the E2 to E1·2Ca2+ transition. The specificity of the TG inhibitory mechanism is emphasized by the finding that the F256V mutation does not interfere at all with the effect of 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-hydroquinone, which is another SERCA inhibitor bound by hydrophobic partitioning. The specificity of the inhibitory mechanism is also emphasized by the observation that within the concentration range producing total inhibition of wild-type SERCA-1, TG produces a 4-fold stimulation of the P-glycoprotein (multidrug transporter) ATPase.

We report here a mutational study, including construction and characterization of 20 mutations within the region surrounding the TG binding pocket. The aim of this study was to evaluate specific structural features that may be involved in determining the ATPase affinity for TG and its inhibitory mechanism. The specificity of the TG inhibitory mechanism was further investigated with comparative experiments on the SERCA inhibitor 2,5-di-(t-butyl)-hydroxybenzene (DBHQ) (22Llopis J. Chow S.B. Kass G.E.

Primers of 20-30 bp in length were synthesized for each individual mutation. These primers were utilized to hybridize DNA sequences internal to the flanking primers and were used for PCR mutagenesis by the overlap extension method as described by Ho et al. (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Briefly, two overlapping fragments containing the mismatched bases of the targeted sequence were amplified in separate PCRs. The reaction products were then mixed and amplified by PCR using both flanking primers. The mutant cassette was then exchanged with the corresponding cassette of wild-type cDNA in SV40-pAdlox. After DNA sequencing, the mutated cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells for overexpression of protein under control of the SV40 promoter. COS-1 cell cultures and transfection methods were described by Sumbilla et al. (29Sumbilla C. Lu L. Lewis D.E. Inesi G. J. Biol.

Immunodetection of expressed ATPase in the microsomal fraction was obtained by Western blotting using 9E10 monoclonal antibody against the c-myc tag of SERCA-1. WT human P-glycoprotein was expressed in yeast, purified, and reconstituted in liposomes as described by Figler et al. (30Figler R.A. Omote H. Nakamoto R.K. Al-Shawi M.K. Arch. Biochem.

Synthesis of TG Analog Debutanoyl Thapsigargin—TG (2.0 mg = 3.1 μmol) was dissolved in methanol and 10 μl of triethylamine and then incubated with stirring at room temperature for about 5 h in a small capped tube to obtain selective cleavage of the ester bond at C-8. The reaction was followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis as described by Hua and Inesi (17Hua S. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11865-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The yield of the product was ∼90%. The structure of TG and debutanoyl TG (DBTG) are shown in Fig. 2. Functional Studies—SERCA ATPase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 μm free Ca2+, 5 mm sodium azide, 50 nm Ca2+ ATPase, 3 μm ionophore A23187, 3 mm ATP, and 0-10,000 nm TG. Ca2+-independent ATPase activity was assayed in the presence of 2 mm EGTA without added Ca2+. The reaction was started at 37 °C by adding ATP, and samples were taken at serial times for determination of Pi (31Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinsch P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent activity was calculated by subtracting the Ca2+-independent ATPase from the total ATPase and was corrected to account for the level of expressed protein in each microsomal preparation as revealed by immunoactivity and with reference to microsomes obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with wild-type SERCA-1 cDNA. P-glycoprotein ATPase activity was measured in a reaction mixture that contained 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm Na-ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaN3, 85 nm P-glycoprotein, 1% Me2SO, and TG as indicated. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C, and samples were taken at serial times for determination of Pi product by the method of Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (32Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. Anat.

Digestion of WT or mutant ATPase proteinase K was conducted at 25 °C in media containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.6 mg of microsomal protein (containing recombinant ATPase)/ml and 0.02 mg of proteinase K/ml, in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA present). The reaction was quenched at serial times with trichloroacetic acid to yield a final 2.5% concentration. The quenched protein was then solubilized with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.312 m Tris, pH 6.8, 3.75% sucrose, 1.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue and subjected to electrophoretic analysis (35Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Transgenic Expression of WT and Mutant SERCA—Approximately 10% of the COS-1 cells transfected under our conditions exhibited exogenous SERCA gene expression and targeted the Ca2+ ATPase to the endoplasmic reticulum, as shown by immunofluorescent staining and microscopy (36Zhang Z.

For the experiments reported here, we expressed the WT enzyme and 20 mutants resulting from single or double mutations of 10 amino acid residues near the TG binding site at the interface of the membrane-bound region with the headpiece of the ATPase. In designing the mutational work, we selected amino acid residues adjacent to the TG ring structure. The expression levels of transgenic SERCA are variable, partly because of the efficiency of transfection and partly because of the presence of mutations. The levels were determined by Western blots and densitometry and compared with a standard preparation of the WT enzyme (Fig. 3). The average values listed on Table I were obtained from various transfections and therefore reflect mostly the specific effects of the mutations on the levels of transgenic protein.Table IEffects of mutations on the Inhibitory effect of TGSampleExpressionCa2+ ATPase activityKiaKi, TG concentration to generate 50% inhibition.nmol of Pi/mg of protein/minnmWT11501.44 ± 0.77K252A1.000169.0 ± 13.02.35 ± 1.02L253A0.122147.0 ± 29.51.26 ± 0.21F256V0.318186.0 ± 29.246.63 ± 25.23F256L0.313161.3 ± 5.03.57 ± 2.20G257K0.55261.5 ± 11.61.44 ± 0.40G257E0.51697.5 ± 1.21.38 ± 0.34G257F0.258159.0 ± 8.52.23 ± 0.89Q259K0.981100.5 ± 8.83.26 ± 1.37Q259E0.318168.0 ± 19.50.26 ± 0.09Q259F0.318175.5 ± 22.81.25 ± 0.51Q259A1.014120.0 ± 7.32.66 ± 0.75I761A0.33191.5 ± 10.60.46 ± 0.22I765G0.38166.0 ± 10.015.81 ± 11.59I765A0.396139.5 ± 6.77.67 ± 7.65I829A0.777118.5 ± 3.02.88 ± 0.95F834A0.678127.5 ± 30.11.82 ± 1.29F834S0.519139.5 ± 8.25.11 ± 3.06F834D0NAbNA, not applicable.NAY837A0.291141.0 ± 3.16.17 ± 7.22Y837F0.462145.5 ± 7.33.25 ± 1.61a Ki, TG concentration to generate 50% inhibition.b NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Most of the mutants were expressed with lower efficiency than the WT ATPase, such as L253A, F256L or F256V, G257F, Q259E or Q259F, and I761A. Most notably, the F834D mutation strongly reduced expression, whereas F834A and F834S mutations allowed significant expression levels. It is apparent that the presence of charged residues in critical locations interferes with proper folding of the nascent polypeptide chain even in the presence of normal transcription levels (36Zhang Z. Sumbilla C. Lewis D. Summers S. Klein M.G. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the expressed mutants retained relatively high ATPase activity with some reduction noted for the G257K and I765G mutants. There was no correlation between the expression levels and the ATPase activity of the mutants. ATPase Activity and Effects of Mutations—The total ATPase activity of microsomal preparations includes a Ca2+-independent component that we subtracted from the total to obtain the specific Ca2+-dependent ATPase. It should be pointed out that the activity of all mutants was corrected to reflect the SERCA content of the microsomes used in the assays with reference to the same preparation of the WT ATPase. No significant levels of TG-inhibited Ca2+ ATPase activity were detected in non- or sham-transfected COS-1 cells. It is shown in Fig. 4 that the WT Ca2+ ATPase is inhibited within the nanomolar concentration range of TG, and total inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent activity is observed in the presence of 1 μm TG. This effective concentration range of TG remains unchanged for certain mutants, such as F834A. On the other hand, ATPase inhibition requires higher TG concentrations when other mutants are used, such as F256V. In addition, the maximal inhibition that can be obtained by increasing the TG concentration is significantly reduced (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, for a given amino acid, the inhibitory effect of TG depends on the type of mutation, i.e. F256V as compared with F256L (Fig. 4B). The effects of various mutations on the ATPase sensitivity to TG are shown in Table I, where the TG concentration producing a 50% inhibition is defined as Ki. Pronounced effects on Ki were produced by the F256V and I756G mutations, whereas lower but significant effects were produced by the Y837A, I765A, Y837F, Q259K, and F256L mutations. WT and F256L Affinity for a TG Analog—In all of the experiments reported above the inhibitory effect of TG is given as a function of “total added” TG. However, an evaluation of the actual Ki would require knowledge of the “free” TG concentration. In fact, because of the high affinity and the low concentrations of TG relative to the ATPase, the residual free TG concentration in our reaction mixtures may be significantly lower than the total concentration thereby yielding an underestimate of the mutational effects on the affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme. As a case in point, we tested the effect of DBTG on a mutant (F256L) on which the TG concentration curve is only moderately displaced relative to the WT enzyme. DBTG is a debutanoyl derivative of TG exhibiting lower affinity for SERCA (17Hua S. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11865-11872Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this case the free drug concentration is approximately equal to the total concentration because the ATPase in the reaction mixture is ∼0.5 nm, and the inhibitory effect of DBTG on WT ATPase is observed within the 5-500 nm range. As shown in Fig. 5, the drug concentrations required to obtain inhibition of the F256L mutant are two orders of magnitude higher when DBTG is used instead of TG. This suggests that the experiments with TG may in fact underestimate the mutational effects on the affinity of the inhibitor for the ATPase. TG Interferes with Conformational Changes—To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of inhibition, we considered that TG wedged at the interface of the M3, M5, and M7 transmembrane segments may interfere with structural transitions that are required for the progress of the ATPase cycle. An assessment of these transitions can be conveniently derived from observation of the pattern of ATPase digestion by proteinase K (37Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In fact, electrophoretic analysis of fragments produced by digestion in the absence of Ca2+ yields a light 95-kDa band (Leu-119 site) and a heavier 83-kDa band (Thr-242 site). In the presence of Ca2+, the digestion proceeds faster, but the 95-kDa band is not produced. This difference in digestion pattern is attributed to a Ca2+-dependent conformational transition (E2 to E1·Ca2+), which involves rotation of the A domain with a consequent influence on the digestion sites within the loop connecting the M2 segment to the A domain (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). It is shown in Fig. 6 that TG prevents such an effect of Ca2+, as the 95-kDa band is still produced in the presence of Ca2+, and the ATPase band remains more intense. Furthermore, a slight effect of TG is noted even in the absence of Ca2+ indicating that TG confers stability of the E2 conformation, rendering the enzyme resistant to catalytic activation by Ca2+. Pertinent to the resistance of mutants to inhibition, we found that TG fails to prevent the effect of Ca2+ on digestion with proteinase K in such mutants. Consequently, the digestion patterns obtained with the F256V and I765G mutants exhibit the effect of Ca2+ even in the presence of TG (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the F834A mutant, which does not interfere with the TG effect, yields a digestion pattern nearly identical to that obtained with WT enzyme (Fig. 6). This provides additional evidence indicating that the TG inhibition mechanism is related to interference with conformational changes that are required for the catalytic activity of the Ca2+ ATPase. It is noteworthy that the distinct patterns of proteolysis obtained in the presence of Ca2+ and in the absence of TG (lane 2 in each panel), or the absence of both Ca2+ and TG (lane 4 in each panel), are identical in WT and mutants. This indicates that the equilibrium between E1 and E2 states is not shifted by the mutations per se thus excluding that such a shift could reduce the apparent affinity of the F256 and I765 for TG. Specificity of the Inhibitory Mechanism—In addition to TG, other inhibitors such as DBHQ display a specificity for SERCA. Kinetic studies indicate that although inhibition by a variety of hydrophobic molecules is generally related to interference with global conformational changes of the enzyme (38Lee A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), TG and DBHQ may actually bind to separate sites (39Khan Y.M. Wictome M. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14385-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We then tested whether the F256V mutation would interfere with the inhibitory effect of DBHQ. We found that DBHQ has an identical effect on the WT enzyme and on the F256V (Fig. 7), which is the most effective mutant in reducing the inhibitory effect of TG (Fig. 4 and Table I). Another aspect of TG specificity is its lack of inhibitory effect on other cation transport ATPases (5Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether such specificity is because of lack of binding or an inefficiency of the bound drug. We then tested whether the ATPase activity of the drug transport P-glycoprotein may be influenced by TG. It is shown in Fig. 8 that a 4-fold activation of the P-glycoprotein ATPase is produced by TG with an apparent Km of 0.4 μm followed by reversal of this stimulation at higher concentrations (Ki = 13.5 μm) as is usually observed for other transport substrates in this enzyme (34Al-Shawi M.K. Polar M.K. Omote H. Figler R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52629-52640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This indicates that TG binds with high affinity to membrane-bound transport ATPases of obvious structural diversity, but its ability to inhibit or stimulate catalytic activity is specifically dependent on the structure of the enzyme. Structural studies indicate that TG resides in a cavity delimited by the M3, M5, and M7 helices, near the cytosolic surface of the membrane (Figs. 1 and 9). Our mutational analysis shows that Phe-256 (M3), Ile-765 (M5), and Tyr-837 (M7) are most important for TG binding. It is apparent that the Phe-256 ring provides a complementary surface to TG, which is very important to the strength of binding. The effect produced by the F2565V mutation is consistent with analogous effects produced by corresponding changes on the TG structure (2Christensen S.B. Larsen I.K. Rasmuseen U. Christopherson C. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 649-652Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Tyr-837 ring may be less important because of a misalignment in the native structure, whereby the Y837A alone is less disruptive. The role of Ile-765 is less clear, and the effect of its mutation is likely related to direct structural perturbation. The effects of mutations on binding affinity are not dependent as much on removal of the native side chain as on the type and size of substitution. For instance, the mutation of Phe-256 to Val is more effective than to Leu, and the Ile-765 mutation to Gly is more effective than to Ala, evidently because of the length and hydrophobic character of the substitute chain. These findings are consistent with the idea that TG binding is determined by hydrophobic partitioning and complementary molecular shapes (38Lee A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Apparently, TG binding to the SERCA enzyme involves only one hydrogen bond with Ile-829 (15Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that the ATPase activity of the Ile-765 mutant is somewhat low, i.e. ∼40% of the WT (Table I). We then considered whether the low apparent affinity of this mutant for TG may be a kinetic effect related to a slow step leading to formation of E2 and a consequent lower steady state level of this TG-sensitive intermediate. However, the samples were equilibrated with TG before starting the ATPase measurements, and the dissociation constant of TG from the inhibitory site is very slow (10-2-10-3 s-1 as compared with 10 s-1 for the catalytic turnover). Consequently, the percentage of enzyme undergoing TG dissociation during an ATPase cycle is extremely low. Therefore, the observed inhibition is in practice related to the level of stable and inhibited enzyme-TG complex formed before starting the ATPase reaction. This argues in favor of a direct effect of the Ile-765 mutation on the TG binding site. Interference by single mutations with the TG inhibitory effect, in addition to reduction of binding affinity, underlines the importance of structural specificity not only for TG binding but also for the inhibitory mechanism. This is more prominent in the F256V mutant but also significant in the I765A and Y837A mutants. Other mutations such as the F834A do not produce this effect possibly allowing some structural flexibility near the TG binding site. It is clear that TG would collide severely with Phe-256 and Tyr-837 if the ATPase were to acquire the E1·Ca2+ conformation (Fig. 9). Weaker collisions would also occur with Ile-765, whereas Gln-259 may be able to avoid collisions by changing its side chain conformation. In fact, the experiments on proteinase K digestion demonstrate that mutational interference with the inhibitory effect of TG on catalytic activity (Fig. 4 and Table I) and with Ca2+-induced conformational change (Fig. 6) occur in parallel. A most interesting aspect of our experiments is the demonstration that the inhibitory effect of TG involves a specific mechanism that is not shared by DBHQ, which is another SERCA inhibitor likely bound in a neighboring hydrophobic cleft. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the specificity inhibitory effect of TG for SERCA, as opposed to other transport enzymes, is not related to the lack of binding but rather to the effect of the bound drug. In fact, the 4-fold stimulation of the P-glycoprotein ATPase activity observed in our experiments demonstrates clearly that the response to bound TG may be in the form of inhibition or stimulation, depending on the enzyme structure. It is known, in this regard, that the binding site of the P-glycoprotein undergoes a drug-induced conformational change resulting in ATPase activation coupled to drug transport (40Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1575-1578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 41Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is very interesting that the structural consequences of high affinity binding of the same drug, result in total inhibition or strong stimulation of ATP utilization in two different transport enzymes. Finally, our finding that TG stimulates the P-glycoprotein ATPase provides a better understanding of the resistance acquired by cell lines subjected to selective pressure with TG (19Yu M. Zhang L. Rishi A. Khaedeer M. Inesi G. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3542-3546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Gutheil J.C. Hart S.R. Belani C.P. Melera P.W. Hussain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7976-7981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that the resistant cells manifest up-regulation of SERCA expression with various Phe-256 mutations, but also up-regulation of the multidrug transport P-glycoprotein. This indicates that redundancy plays a role in the acquisition of resistance, including overexpression of the resistant SERCA mutant, as well as overexpression of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein. These findings may be helpful in the assessment of the possible use of TG in targeted cancer treatment (11Denmeade S.R. Jakobsen C.M. Janssen S. Khan S.R. Garrett E.S. Lilja H. Christensen S.B. Isaacs J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2003; 95: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We thank Anne O.

A universal event for the successful construction and function of all of the cells is that proteins are targeted to their correct location both spatially and temporally. The extent of these targeting events is reflected by the fact that more than one-third of the proteome of the cell are translocated across or inserted into a membrane. Mitochondria represent a major site for extensive protein translocation. Virtually all of the mitochondrial proteins (approximately one thousand different polypeptides) are imported from the cytosol and are sorted within the organelle. This event is orchestrated by distinct translocation machineries in the outer (translocase of the outer membrane, TOM) 1The abbreviations used are: TOM, translocase of the outer membrane; TIM, translocase of the inner membrane; SAXS, solution x-ray scattering; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Rg, radius of gyration; Dmax, maximum molecular dimension; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesul-fonic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; WT, wild type. and inner (translocase of the inner membrane, TIM) membranes and within the intermembrane space. An intriguing new class of translocase proteins is the small Tim family, which specifically mediates the import of presequence-devoid polytopic proteins. There are two main pathways for proteins destined to mitochondria. The matrix pathway is used mainly by precursors that contain a cleavable presequence (1Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Google Scholar), whereas precursors devoid of a presequence divert through the distinct carrier pathway (2Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 428-432Google Scholar, 3Tokatlidis K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35285-35288Google Scholar, 4Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C.

The small Tims are organized in two distinct 70-kDa complexes in the intermembrane space, the TIM10 complex that is made of Tim9 and Tim10, which are encoded by essential genes in yeast (6Koehler C.M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4816-4822Google Scholar, 11Davis A.J. Sepuri N.B. Holder J. Johnson A.E. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1271-1282Google Scholar, 12Paschen S.A. Rothbauer U. Kaldi K.

The two complexes operate in the carrier pathway with different substrate specificities but both in coordination with the essential insertion-specific TIM22 complex in the inner membrane (13Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Google Scholar). TIM10 is in large excess over Tim8 and Tim13 and over the TIM22 complex (3Tokatlidis K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35285-35288Google Scholar, 6Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W. Schmid K. Jarosch E. Dolfini L. Junne T. Schatz G. Tokatlidis K.

Allen S. Savory P. Thornton D. Sheehan J. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36100-36108Google Scholar). It binds to the transmembrane segments of the precursor as it emerges from the TOM channel (15Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M.

Biol. 2002; 22: 7780-7789Google Scholar), facilitating in this way passage of these hydrophobic molecules across the aqueous environment of the intermembrane space (2Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 428-432Google Scholar, 3Tokatlidis K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35285-35288Google Scholar, 4Chacinska A. Pfanner N. Meisinger C.

In contrast to most other chaperones, TIM10 does not require ATP hydrolysis and interacts specifically with membrane proteins. Although it has been shown that Tim9 and Tim10 are necessary and sufficient to form the complex (17Luciano P. Vial S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Google Scholar), how the functional chaperone assembles is unclear. Similar to other small Tim proteins, Tim9 and Tim10 themselves must, in the first instance, be imported into the intermembrane space before they can fulfill their own specific roles in the transport of other mitochondrial proteins from the intermembrane space to the inner membrane. This process depends on the formation of the functional TIM10 complex. The structural basis for and the mechanism of this TIM10 assembly process, which includes import, folding, and subsequent complexation for the individual subunits, and their regulation by redox state(s) remain unresolved. A unique feature of the sequence of all small Tims is the strictly conserved “twin CX3C” motif separated from each other by 11-16 residues. Whether in vivo the cysteines are exclusively involved in ligation to zinc (similar to the zinc fingers) (18Lutz T. Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4400-4408Google Scholar) or are disulfide-bridged (15Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Google Scholar, 19Allen S. Lu H. Thornton D. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38505-38513Google Scholar) is again unclear. Nevertheless, the significance of the cysteine residues, whatever are their precise roles, is partly borne out in mutagenesis studies of homologous proteins. Mutation of the fourth cysteine residue in DDP1 (the human homologue of Tim8) affects the folding of the Tim8 protein and Tim8-Tim13 assembly (20Hofmann S. Rothbauer U. Muhlenbein N. Neupert W. Gerbitz K.D. Brunner M. Bauer M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23287-23293Google Scholar, 21Roesch K. Curran S.P. Tranebjaerg L. Koehler C.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 477-486Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the TIM10 complex is only formed between oxidized Tim 9 and Tim10 and that zinc can bind only to the fully reduced state without promoting complex formation (44Lu H. Allen S. Wardleworth L. Savory P. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18952-18958Google Scholar). The combined data so far demonstrate the presence of an intimate relationship between, on one hand, the structure integrity, oxidation, and metal chelation states involving cysteine residues and, on the other, the formation of functional Tim9/Tim10 complexes. In vivo, the most stable form of the proteins is their complexed state. All of the other possible species (i.e. reduced apoprotein, reduced and bound to zinc but not assembled or oxidized but not yet assembled), are transient and short-lived. As a consequence, a study of the structural properties of these different states and how they underpin assembly is only possible in vitro using purified components. Here we characterized the conformations of Tim9 and Tim10 under different redox and metal binding conditions. We present direct experimental evidence explaining the dependence on the redox state of these proteins for successful complex formation. The individual proteins are unfolded in the reduced state and adopt a partially folded molten-globule conformation upon oxidation. The “twin CX3C” motif is vital for the folding of the individual subunits through the formation of intramolecular disulfides, in agreement with previous mapping of the observed disulfides in Tim10 (19Allen S.

The structural properties of the different states support reinforce the notion that the complex is made only from oxidized intramolecularly disulfide-bonded subunits, whereas intermolecular disulfides result in abortive misfolded species. Although zinc does not appear to play a direct role in complex formation, it stabilizes the reduced proteins against proteolysis. The complex remains flexible, although the NMR data showed that it is more structured than the oxidized individual subunits. We determined the low resolution three-dimensional structure of the individual subunits and of their complex by solution x-ray scattering (SAXS). The information from this finding provides new insights into the way TIM10 functions. The results here also suggest that TIM10 assembly is regulated by distinct structural states that correlate with the different redox state(s) of Tim9 and Tim10. In summary, there appears to be a hierarchy of “structures,” with the reduced proteins having the least defined and the most flexible structures and the oxidized complex possessing the most pronounced structural features. This transformation of structures fits with the structural and energetic requirements for efficient protein transport and complex assembly. DNA Constructs and Proteins—Tim9 and Tim10 WT or single Cys mutants were purified from Escherichia coli in a recombinant form as described previously (19Allen S. Lu H. Thornton D. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38505-38513Google Scholar). The recombinant TIM10 complex formation was performed as described previously (14Vial S. Lu H. Allen S. Savory P. Thornton D. Sheehan J. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36100-36108Google Scholar). 15N Labeling of Tim9 and Tim10—E. coli strain BL21-Codonplus (Stratagene) containing a plasmid expressing glutathione S-transferase-Tim9 or glutathione S-transferase-Tim10 was grown in 50 ml of LB-AMP at 37 °C for 12-16 h. Cells were harvested at 5600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in 5 ml of LB. A 2.5-ml cell suspension was added to 1l minimal medium (7 mm Na2HPO4,55mm KH2PO4, 22 mm glucose, 18.4 mm15NH4Cl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 100 mg/liter ampicillin, 30 μm thiamine-HCl), and growth continued at 37 °C until 0.7 > A600 nm > 0.9. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was then added to induce the expression of the fusion protein, and growth continued for ∼4 h until 2.2 > A600 nm > 2.8. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5600 × g, 4 °C, 15 min), washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A plus 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme. Cells were broken by sonication with a tapered microtip at 20% amplification for 3 min or by French press at 1000 p.s.i. The soluble part was isolated by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) and incubated overnight with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A. The non-bound proteins were collected, and beads were washed with 50 ml of buffer A. After washing, the beads were resuspended with 10 ml of buffer A containing 5 units/ml of thrombin (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The Tim10 protein was eluted with an additional 10 ml of buffer A. After disruption of induced cells by sonication or French press, the majority of the fusion protein was found in inclusion bodies (in the pellet). These were solubilized in denaturing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 8 m urea (pH 8.0)) for 1 h at room temperature, separated from insoluble matter by centrifugation (21,000 × g, 20 °C, 30 min), and renatured overnight at 4 °C by a 10-fold dilution with buffer A. The renatured glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was separated from precipitated material by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then incubated with glutathione-agarose beads and further purified as described above. NMR Spectra—One-dimensional 1H NMR and two-dimensional 1H-15N-heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra were acquired at 293 K on Bruker DRX600 spectrometer. 15N-filtered 1H spectra were acquired at 318 K using one-dimensional version of 1H-15N-HSQC pulse sequence. Free induction decay (acquisition time 0.128 s) was multiplied by square sine window function shifted by 72°, and zero-filled to 8192 points before Fourier transformation. Protein samples (concentration 0.2-0.3 mm) were dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl and 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry for the binding of Zn2+ to Tim9, Tim10, and mutants was performed in 10 mm of metal-free HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), 1 mm TCEP (Tris-[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine) at 30 °C with a VP-isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) microcalorimeter. The metal-free buffer was prepared by incubation of 10 mm HEPES with Chelex-100 (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h to remove residual metals. Protein was dialyzed and reduced in the buffer containing 1 mm TCEP overnight. Protein then was loaded in the 1.4-ml cuvette at 10-20 μm, and at least 35 injections of 5 μl of the same buffer containing 15× concentrated Zn2+ (150-300 μm) were made. Protein concentration was determined by both the Bradford assay and amino acid analysis. The data were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin program and best fitted to a one-site binding model. Limited Proteolysis—The individual proteins were incubated with 1 mm DTT in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight to reduce the proteins in the presence of 1 mm EDTA or 50 μm Zn2+. The reduced proteins with or without Zn2+ as well as the oxidized proteins (untreated) then were incubated with trypsin in a ratio of 15:1 for a time as indicated and stopped by the addition of an excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were boiled at 95 °C and analyzed by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were acquired using a JASCO J810 spectropolarimeter in 5 mm Tris (pH 7.6) at 25 °C using a 1-mm cuvette. A protein sample of 10 μm for Tim9 and/or Tim10 was used. Each spectrum represents an average of four scans from 260 to 190 nm at 0.2-nm intervals and the base line established by subtracting spectrum of the buffer. The signals are normalized by the total number of residues (87 for Tim9 and 93 for Tim10). Solution X-ray Scattering and Particle Shape Reconstruction—Scattering data have been collected at station 2.1 of the SRS Daresbury Laboratory using a multi-wire gas detector and a sample-to-detector distance of 1.25 m that covered the momentum transfer interval 0.04 Å < q < 0.6 Å-1, where q = 4π sin Θ/λ,2Θ is the scattering angle, and λ = 1.54 Å is the wavelength. The q-range was calibrated with the diffraction rings of silver behenate powder (based on a spacing of 58.38 Å). Samples were analyzed at 4 °C with protein concentrations in the range 0.5-7 mg/ml (Tim9 and Tim10) and 0.3-1 mg/ml (TIM10 complex). The total data collection time of 60 min (180 min) for the individual protein components (complex) provided sufficient statistics after averaging several independent measurements that were composed of 60-s time frames to check for radiation damage to the samples. Scattering profiles for the three protein samples (Tim9, Tim10, and complex) were analyzed using GNOM (22Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Google Scholar). The latter profile allows us to evaluate structural parameters such as the radius of gyration (Rg) and the maximum molecular dimension (Dmax) from the particle distance distribution function p(r) of a monodisperse protein solution, which represents the distributions of intramolecular distances between scattering centers within a protein molecule. Further details of data reduction and analysis are as published recently (23Witty M. Sanz C. Shah A. Grossmann J.G. Mizuguchi K. Perham R.N. Luisi B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4207-4218Google Scholar). Particle shapes were restored from the experimental scattering profiles using the ab initio procedure based on the simulated annealing algorithm applied to a set of dummy spheres representing the amino acid chain of the molecules (24Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Google Scholar). Whereas the shape models for dimeric Tim9 and Tim10 have been calculated by means of 2-fold symmetry (with 2 × 87 and 2 × 93 amino acid residues, respectively), the molecular model for the complex was obtained by limiting the shape reconstruction to a 3-fold symmetry axis (using 3 × 180 residues). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence spectra of 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS, Sigma) were measured using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The TIM10 complex was used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml, and ANS was used at 20 and 50 μm in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). Fluorescence spectra were measured from 400 to 600 nm with an excitation wavelength set at 390 nm at 25 °C using a 2 × 10-mm cuvette. A slit width of 5 nm was used for both excitation and emission. Free Tim9 and Tim10 Are Partially Folded Molten Globules—The global fold of the reduced and oxidized state of free (unassembled) Tim9 and Tim10 was studied by one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1A). From the increased linewidths and small chemical shift dispersion of the NMR signals, it is apparent that the reduced proteins exist as an ensemble of loosely folded interexchanging conformers. By contrast, oxidized Tim9 and Tim10 have greater chemical shift dispersion and thus more defined structures. New signals appear in the amide region between 8.5 and 9.0 ppm and in methyl region between 0.0 and 0.5 ppm (indicated by asterisk in Fig. 1A). The linewidths (as gauged from the resolved signals) are broader than expected for a protein of this size, indicating that the native individual oxidized proteins most probably exist in a partially folded molten-globule state in which secondary structure elements (mainly α-helices) are formed but which do not pack together in a unique way (Fig. 1A, compare reduced versus oxidized samples). To gain further insight into the structure and dynamics of the individual oxidized proteins, the two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra of 15N-labeled proteins were recorded (Fig. 1B). For both Tim9 and Tim10, two types of resonances are visible in the spectra, a set of sharp signals and a set of very broad signals, all of which have poor chemical shift dispersion. The sharp signals most probably originate from flexible unstructured regions of the molecules, which exhibit fast motions. The spectrum of Tim10 contains ∼40 such signals, seven of which have chemical shifts typical of glycines. In the spectrum of Tim 9, approximately 22 intense signals were observed with at least two of these resonating at chemical shifts typical of glycine residues. Tim10 contains seven glycines, four of which are situated at the N terminus and three at the C terminus. Tim9 has four glycines at its C terminus. Broad signals in these spectra normally originate from regions of molecules that exist in molten-globule states. The presence of a mixture of sharp and broad resonances with many of the glycine signals being intense allow us to conclude that the most flexible and unstructured regions of Tim10 are probably located at both the N and C termini, whereas for Tim9 only the C terminus can be identified as unstructured. The middle regions of both proteins exist in molten-globule state, giving rise to broad signals. Many more sharp resonances are observed in the Tim10 spectrum, suggesting that Tim10 has longer unstructured regions than Tim9. This is also borne out in the 15N-filtered one-dimensional spectra shown in Fig. 3, C and D. These NMR data provide a structural basis for the limited proteolysis on the individual proteins showing that the stable fragment f1 of Tim9 (∼8 kDa) is larger than the fragment of Tim10 (∼6.5 kDa) (Ref. 14Vial S. Lu H. Allen S. Savory P. Thornton D. Sheehan J. Tokatlidis K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36100-36108Google Scholar and Fig. 2C). Furthermore, N-terminal protein sequencing confirmed that fragment f1 of Tim9 starts from its N terminus and the fragment f of Tim10 starts from Ile18.Fig 2Zinc binds and stabilizes the reduced Tim9 and reduced Tim10. ITC measurements of the binding reaction of Zn2+ to the reduced Tim9 (panel A) and reduced Tim10 (panel B) in 10 mm metal-free HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) at 30 °C. Traces of the titration of 150 μm ZnCl2 into 10 μm Tim9 or Tim10 in the cell are shown (top part). The integrated and normalized heats of injections for the binding (▪) were fitted to a model describing one binding site (bottom plot, solid line). Analysis of the data yields a stoichiometry n = 0.7 for Zn2+/Tim9 and 1 for Zn2+/Tim10 and a binding constant of Ka = 5 × 106m-1 and 9 × 106m-1, respectively. C, limited trypsinolysis of Tim9 and Tim10 at different states. +DTT+EDTA, reduced apoprotein; +DTT+Zn2+, reduced protein with zinc; and -DTT, oxidized protein. The reaction was carried out at 4 °C by incubating the protein and trypsin at a ratio of 15:1 and stopped by the addition of 10× mass excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor at the indicated times. Samples were analyzed by 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Zinc Binds Only to the Reduced Tim9 and Tim10 and Is Coordinated by the Four Conserved Cys in the Repeated CX3C Motifs—Zinc binding was studied using ITC at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, there was a clear heat release when 15× concentrated Zn2+ was injected into the reduced Tim9 or Tim10 where all of the thiols were reduced by 1 mm TCEP, showing that an exothermic binding reaction had occurred. In contrast, no heat change (hence no binding) was observed when zinc was injected into oxidized Tim9 or Tim10 (data not shown). The stoichiometry of zinc binding to the reduced Tim9 and reduced Tim10 was 0.7:1 and 1.1:1, respectively (Table I), suggesting a stoichiometry of one zinc ion per protein molecule. Zinc binding to only 70% of reduced Tim9 is presumably attributed to misfolding of some molecules. The binding constant was ∼5 × 106m-1 and 9 × 106m-1 for the proteins, respectively (Table I). The fact that the fully oxidized proteins did not bind zinc at all suggested that in the reduced state that the metal is coordinated by Cys residues of the “twin CX3C” motifs. We further confirmed this point by testing for metal binding to Tim10 mutants where each of the four conserved Cys was exchanged for a Ser. As shown in Table I, Cys mutation resulted in clear defects in zinc binding, confirming that the metal is indeed coordinated by the Cys residues. The relatively low affinity is in agreement with the fact that both Tim9 and Tim10 are unable to retain zinc throughout the purification as measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (Peter Savory and Kostas Tokatlidis) (data not shown) (15Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M.

The oxidized states are mostly stable, especially the fragments corresponding to the stable core delineated by the two CX3C motifs. The reduced proteins that were unfolded by DTT are readily cleaved, but in the presence of zinc, they become more protease-resistant. We conclude that zinc binding stabilizes the reduced Tim9 and Tim10 against proteolysis. In contrast, Tim10 Cys mutants that cannot bind zinc as tightly as the wild type protein remain largely protease-sensitive in their reduced state (data not shown). Far-UV CD spectra of the reduced proteins before and after zinc binding showed no detectable secondary structure change upon zinc binding (data not shown). This is in agreement with the fact that zinc ligation often does not impose any extra constraints on secondary structure as can be deduced by an analysis of zinc binding sites in several crystal structures of zinc-binding proteins. Distinct Structural Changes of Tim9 and Tim10 upon TIM10 Complex Formation—CD and NMR spectroscopy were used to elucidate the conformational changes associated with the assembly process. When comparing the CD spectrum of the complex (Fig. 3A, black line) to the one produced by adding up the spectra of the individual proteins under identical conditions (Fig. 3A, gray line), a clear difference could be seen in the spectra above and below 208 nm and in particular at the characteristic minimum of 222 nm for α-helix, indicating a structural change upon complex formation. Global three-dimensional structural changes were then examined by 1H NMR. As a control, the mixing of reduced Tim9 and Tim10 in a 1:1 ratio did not show any associated changes in chemical shifts (Figs. 1A and 3B); however, mixing oxidized proteins produced a spectrum that is quite different from the simple sum of the individual oxidized Tim9 and Tim10 spectra. New signals appear in the spectrum of the complex in the methyl region (0.0-0.5 ppm) and amide region (8.5-9.5 ppm). The linewidths are sharper than for individ"

In our study, simvastatin stimulated differentiation of osteoblasts remarkably in a dose-dependent manner, with minimal effect on proliferation. To identify the mediators of the anabolic effects of simvastatin on osteoblasts, we tried to identify and characterize simvastatin-induced proteins by using proteomic analysis. Calcyclin was significantly up-regulated by more than 10 times, and annexin I was also up-regulated by simvastatin. However, annexin III, vimentin, and tropomyosin were down-regulated. Up-regulated calcyclin mRNA by simvastatin was validated by reverse transcription in mouse calvarial cells. In confocal microscope analysis, green fluorescence protein-calcyclin fusion protein was ubiquitously observed in the of MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with green fluorescence protein-calcyclin cDNA containing plasmid and was quickly concentrated in the nucleus 20 min after simvastatin treatment. Overexpression of calcyclin cDNA stimulated both the proliferation and expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA significantly, without exposure to simvastatin in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, both the rate of proliferation of the osteoblasts and the expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA were suppressed significantly 1 day after treatment with the calcyclin-specific small interference RNA, and furthermore, simvastatin did not overcome this suppression in the small interference RNA-pretreated MC3T3-E1 cells. In conclusion, calcyclin is one of the candidate proteins that plays a role in osteoblastogenesis in response to simvastatin, although the precise functions of calcyclin in osteoblast remain to be verified.

Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased fracture risk (1AnonymousAm. J.

Little is currently known about the intracellular statin-induced proteins, as well as the mediator proteins specific for the anabolic function of statins.Calcyclin (S100A6), a small acidic protein that weighs about 10 kDa, belongs to the S100 calcium-binding protein family (14Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). These family members share a common S100 calcium-binding motif and are involved in several regulatory functions that include protein phosphorylation, some enzyme activities, the dynamics of cytoskeletal components, transcription factors, and Ca2+ homeostasis, and also cell proliferation and differentiation (15Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 16Donato R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 637-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). An interesting feature of the S100 proteins is that they are expressed by epithelial cells and fibroblasts in a cell-specific way (17Stulik J. Osterreicher J. Koupilova K. Knizek J. Bures J.

Calcyclin is also expressed by osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cells) and up-regulated markedly during osteoblast differentiation; however, its roles in bone physiology are unknown (18Seth A. Lee B.K. Qi S. Vary C.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1683-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In the present study, we reassessed whether simvastatin regulates the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like cells, and we also explored new protein profiles by proteomic techniques in response to simvastatin. Here, we found that calcyclin, the calcium-binding protein, is one of the simvastatin-induced proteins up-regulated by more than 10 times. Furthermore, overexpression of calcyclin by transient transfection stimulated both the proliferation and differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, as well as inhibiting those without simvastatin treatment through suppressing calcyclin by the siRNA. We propose that calcyclin could be one of the mediator molecules inducing the osteogenic functions of simvastatin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures—Mouse calvariae were dissected aseptically from postnatal 1-day Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mouse. Frontal and parietal bones were cleaned of loose soft connective tissue and submerged in an α-modification of Eagle's medium (α-MEM) (Invitrogen). Calvariae were digested at 37 °C for 10 min with shaking in an enzymatic solution containing 0.1% collagenase (Invitrogen) and 0.05% trypsin containing 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) in α-MEM. This procedure was repeated to yield a total of five digests. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min and were then resuspended in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 unit/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin; all from Invitrogen). The cells were grown to 70-80% confluence over the next 3-4 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with humidification.MC3T3-E1 cells were grown in α-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. After the cells reached confluence, they were cultured in differentiation medium (α-MEM containing 50 μg/ml of phosphate ester of ascorbic acid (Sigma), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), and 10-8 m dexamethasone (Sigma) for 5 days and then subjected to transfection.Cell Proliferation and Differentiation Assay—Primary-cultured calvarial cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and stimulated for only 6 h with 10-7 m simvastatin in serum-free α-MEM. To assess the long term effects of simvastatin, the cells were cultured for 8 days being treated with simvastatin every other day for 6 h intermittently. Cell proliferation assay was performed using Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the analysis of cell differentiation, total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells with a commercial RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purity and amount of isolated RNA were assessed by spectrophotometric measurement at 260 and 280 nm. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA at 42 °C for 50 min in a volume of 20 μl containing the following reagents: 0.5 mm dNTP mixture; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mg of oligo(dT), 1× buffer (250 mm Tris, 375 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2, pH 8.3), and 5 units of RNase H-free avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Then the reaction was terminated at 70 °C for 15 min. Aliquots of the cDNA were diluted from 1:1 to 1:100. RT-PCR analysis were done: 94 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 35 s (repeated for 30 cycles), and 72 °C for 15 min. The following oligonucleotides were used for RT-PCR amplification: calcyclin (sequences of EcoRI restriction enzyme site are underlined), forward 5′-GAGAATTCCAGTGATCAGTCATGG-3′, reverse 5′-CAGAATTCCAGAGCTTCATTGTAG-3′; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), forward 5′-GGGACTGGTACTCGGATAACG-3′, reverse 5′ CTGATATGCGATGTCCTTGCA 3′; osteocalcin, forward 5′-CGGCCCTGAGTCTGACAAA-3′, reverse 5′-GCCGGAGTCTGTTCCTCCTT-3′; Type I collagen, forward 5′-GAGGCATAAAGGGTCATCGTGG-3′, reverse 5′-CATTAGGCGCAGGAAGGTCAGC-3′; and β-actin, forward 5′-TTCAACACCCCAGCCATGT-3′, reverse 5′-TGTGGTACGACCAGAGGCATAC-3′.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Gel Staining—Protein samples of mouse calvarial cells used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis were obtained by single simvastatin stimulation for 6 h, and nonstimulated samples were used as a control. The samples were homogenized in a double volume of lysis buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris, and 20 mm dithiothreitol). Then cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay, and 100 μg of proteins were used for the analysis. Commercial strips with a nonlinear immobilized pH 4-7 gradient (Amersham Biosciences) were used for isoelectric focusing. These strips were wetted with a rehydration buffer containing 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and immobilized pH gradient buffer, pH 4-7 (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h at 50 voltage. Isoelectric focusing was performed in the Multiphore II apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) for a total of 40,000 V-h. In the second dimension, the proteins were separated by size in a 7.5-17.5% T polyacrylamide gradient gel. Two slab gels were run using Protean II xi Cell (Bio-Rad) at a constant current of 20 mA for 14 h. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were either silver-stained or Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained. For silver staining, the gels were first fixed for 1 h in 40% ethanol, 5% acetic acid and then washed with 50 ml of double-distilled water followed by a second fixing in 5% ethanol, 5% acetic acid. The gels were washed with 50 ml of double-distilled water and incubated with a solution of 0.02% sodium thiosulfate (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. The gels were washed with 2 × 10 ml of double-distilled water and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 0.1% silver nitrate solution that was precooled to 4 °C. The gels were rinsed with 50 ml of double-distilled water, and the proteins were visualized using a developing solution containing 0.5% formaldehyde, 2% KCO4 until the proteins were visible. Acetic acid solution (1%) was used to stop the reaction. For matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 (0.25%) in 50% methanol, acetic acid overnight at room temperature. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were destained with 40% methanol, 12% acetic acid until the background was clear.Image Analysis Using PDQuest Software and MALDI-TOF-MS—Qualitative analysis of digitized images was carried out using PDQuest two-dimensional analysis software (Bio-Rad). The samples were loaded onto the target plate using the three layers method (19Herbert B. Galvani M. Hamdan M. Olivieri E. MacCarthy J. Pedersen S. Righetti P.G. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 2046-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). 0.6 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 60% acetonitrile, 40% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, prepared fresh every day) were loaded onto the sample plates and left to dry at room temperature. One μl of sample solution was deposited on the matrix layer and left to dry. The spot was then covered with 0.6 μl of the matrix solution. The mass spectra were recorded using a Tof-Spec two-dimensional gel electrophoresis MALDITOF instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK), equipped with a pulsed nitrogen laser (337 nm; pulse width, 4 ns), and operated in delayed extraction linear mode, with an acceleration voltage of 22.5 kV.pcDNA-cacy and pEGFP-cacy Construction and Transfection—Full-length calcyclin cDNA amplified by RT-PCR as described above was sequenced and digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The resulting restriction fragment containing the entire calcyclin coding region was ligated into the vector pcDNA 3.0 (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 250 mg/ml amphotericin B. MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with pcDNA-cacy and pEGFP-cacy construct using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, once the MC3T3-E1 cells reached about 60-70% confluence, they were washed once with α-MEM (serum-free; Invitrogen) and a mixture of 1 μg of plasmid in a total volume of 1 ml/well in a 6-well plate. Transfection was allowed to proceed for 6 h and followed by the removal of the transfection medium and the addition of 2 ml α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The assays were performed the day after transfection.Confocal Microscopic Analysis—For the calcyclin translocation assay, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-cacy plasmid. After various treatments, 10-7 m simvastatin, 10-7 m PTH(1-34) and co-incubation with both simvastatin and PTH for 20 min, pEGFP-cacy transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3% formaldehyde (in PBS) at room temperature for 20 min and then rinsed thoroughly with PBS. Confocal microscopic experiment was performed on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscopy by using a Zeiss 100× oil immersion lens. Fluorescent signals were collected by using Zeiss LSM software in the line-switching mode with dual excitation (488 nm, 568 nm) and emission (515-540 nm, 590-610 nm) filter sets. For the nuclear staining, Hoescht stock solution (final concentration, 0.12 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing the cells with PBS for five times, the confocal images were visualized with a light source at 340-350 nm.siRNA Construction—General guidelines for designing siRNA oligonucleotides are available (20Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) that require avoiding regions of mRNA such as 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and regions within 75 bases of a start codon and sequences having a GC content of >70% or <30%. An appropriate siRNA sequence within the target calcyclin mRNA sequence was chosen according to the manufacturer's software provided by Ambion (Austin, TX). 5′-AAGGAAGGAGCTGAAGGAGTTG-3′ and 5′-AAACTTCCAGGAGTATGTCGC-3′ siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using the siRNA Construction kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Effective RNA interference probes and their effective concentration were determined based on their ability to inactivate cognate sequences. Calcyclin and the siRNA effect were monitored quantitatively using gel analysis. MC3T3-E1 cells were plated onto 6-well plates for RNA preparation and 96-well plates for the proliferation assay and then incubated for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with 10 nm siRNA using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical Analysis—All of the data were expressed as the means and standard deviation. SPSS 10.0 software (Chicago, IL) was used for the statistical analysis, and Student's t test was used for the comparison. The relationships were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05.RESULTSThe Effect of Simvastatin on the Proliferation and Differentiation of Osteoblasts—To examine the effect of simvastatin on both the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, mouse calvarial cells were stimulated with simvastatin single treatment for 6 h. For the study of the long term effects of simvastatin, mouse calvarial cells were cultured for 8 days with intermittent simvastatin treatment (6 h/2 days) in various concentrations (10-9-10-6 m). Simvastatin was treated intermittently because it has been reported that statins exert a number of effects that include stabilizing cells and inhibiting cell proliferation (21Langer A. Constance C. Fodor J.G. Frohlich J.J. Gregoire J. Lau D.C. Leiter L.A. Mancini G.B. Marr D. McPherson R. O'Neill B.J. Rabkin S.W. Can. J. Cardiol. 2003; 19: 921-927PubMed Google Scholar, 22Corsini A. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 5: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Short term treatment of simvastatin was not particular effective on osteoblastic proliferation (Fig. 1A) and exhibited a tendency to increase slightly for a long term effect (Fig. 1B). The proliferation was increased dose-dependently during simvastatin exposure periods and reached a maximum at 10-6 M (Fig. 1B).As shown in Fig. 2, incubation with 10-7 M simvastatin for 6 h enhanced the expression of ALP, type I collagen and osteocalcin to a statistically significant extent, compared with that in the unstimulated conditions in cultured mouse calvarial cells. Because this increase was mostly dose-dependent (10-9-10-6 M), the following experiments were performed with stimulation by a final 10-7 M of simvastatin for 6 h, unless otherwise indicated. Quiescent mouse osteoblasts expressed a low level of ALP mRNA, and this mRNA expression was significantly enhanced and saturated by 10-7 M simvastatin treatment by more than 100-fold (Fig. 2B). Similar to the case of ALP, the increase in type I collagen expression was significant at a concentration of 10-7 M and, interestingly, the expression dropped to the basal level at the concentration of 10-6 M (Fig. 2C). In the case of osteocalcin, the mRNA expression increased dose-dependently and reached a maximum level at a concentration of 10-6 M (∼30-fold; Fig. 2D).Fig. 2The effect of simvastatin treatment on mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation markers. A, ALP, type I collagen and osteocalcin mRNA expressions increased progressively and dose-dependently with simvastatin exposure over 6 h, whereas β-actin mRNA expression was not modified. B-D, the expression of each differentiation marker was investigated by gel electrophoresis and visualized by EtBr staining. All of the data illustrate the mean values of three different experiments and are normalized to those of β-actin. B, the mRNA expression level of ALP was significantly elevated in a dose-dependent manner. C, the mRNA expression level of type I collagen significantly increased dose-dependently but not at the 10-6 m concentration. D, the mRNA expression level of osteocalcin increased significantly dose-dependently. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 simvastatin versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Induction of Calcyclin Protein after Simvastatin Treatment in Mouse Calvarial Cells—Fig. 3 shows an example of a silver-stained two-dimensional gel electrophoresis images aimed at determining any change after 6 h of treatment with simvastatin, and these images were analyzed by PDQuest software (described above). Six spots that showed expressional changes more than four times were obtained selectively from this analysis and characterized by MALDI-TOF-MS (Table I). Calcyclin protein, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, showed a 10-fold increase after 6 h of simvastatin treatment. Annexin I and an unidentified spot also increased by more than four times. However, the others, which included tropomyosin, annexin III, and vimentin, showed a 4-fold decrease.Fig. 3Two-dimensional gel protein profiles after simvastatin treatment for 6 h in mouse calvarial cells.

Fig. 4A illustrates the mean values of three different experiments and shows that calcyclin mRNA increased progressively with the increasing time of simvastatin exposure. Calcyclin mRNA induction significantly increased as quickly as 30 min after the simvastatin addition and showed a maximal effect after 1 h (about 60% increase), and thereafter, the calcyclin mRNA expression returned to the control level by 24 h. Fig. 4B shows an example of RT-PCR aimed at determining the effective simvastatin concentration of calcyclin mRNA induction. The expression of calcyclin reached almost the maximal level at a concentration of 10-9 M and maintained this level to the 10-6 M concentration.Fig. 4Time- and dose-dependent induction of calcyclin mRNA expression after simvastatin treatment in mouse calvarial cells. A, the effect of treatment of mouse calvarial cells with simvastatin 10-7 m for different time intervals was studied by RT-PCR. Calcyclin appeared as a single band at about 310 bp, and β-actin was used as an internal standard. Calcyclin mRNA expression was significantly increased by simvastatin after 1 h and then continued to increase for 7 h. Thereafter, it returned to the control value at 24 h. B, the effect of treatment of mouse calvarial cells with simvastatin at various doses was also studied. Calcyclin mRNA expression was saturated even at the lowest 10-9 m concentration at 6 h after simvastatin treatment and showed similar values at 10-8, 10-7, and 10-6 m. *, p < 0.05, simvastatin versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Distribution of Calcyclin after Simvastatin Treatment—To determine the cellular localization of calcyclin following simvastatin stimulation, calcyclin was fused into enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), and the fusion protein was transiently expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, the fluorescence distributions of the calcyclin were expressed ubiquitously through the unstimulated MC3T3-E1 cells and realized by confocal laser scanning microscope. Twenty minutes after stimulation with simvastatin, the cellular EGFP-cacy was quickly localized to the nucleus. In these experiments, the nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33258. PTH(1-34) alone or a co-treatment of PTH(1-34) with simvastatin also revealed the similar effects on GFP-cacy localization.Fig. 5Localization of calcyclin by confocal microscope in MC3T3-E1 cells. Representative fluorescence images in MC3T3-E1 cells after various treatments, 10-7 m simvastatin and 10-7 m PTH(1-34), and co-incubation with both simvastatin and PTH for 20 min. For the nuclear staining, Hoescht stock solution (final concentration, 0.12 μg/ml) was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. After rinsing the cells with PBS, confocal images were visualized with a light source at 340-350 nm on a Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscopy by using a Zeiss 100× oil immersion lens.

D, GFP-cacy fusion protein was quickly concentrated to the nucleus as quickly as 20 min after simvastatin treatment. E and F, a potent anabolic hormone, PTH(1-34), gave a similar effect on calcyclin localization, as well as following co-treatment"
https://openalex.org/W2029753295,"Processing of membrane-bound transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) and the ER-stress response factor ATF6, and glycoproteins of some hemorrhagic fever viruses are initiated by the proprotein convertase SKI-1/S1P. So far, no cellular protein-based inhibitor of the hydrophobic-amino acid specific SKI-1 is known. The prosegment of the basic-amino acid specific convertases (e.g. furin and PC5) or α1-PDX, a variant of α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) exhibiting an RIPR358 sequence at the reactive site loop, were shown to potently inhibit these secretory proteinases. Accordingly, we tested the SKI-1-inhibitory potential of various point mutants of either the 198 amino acid preprosegment of SKI-1-(1–198) or α1-AT. Transient transfections data showed that, out of numerous mutants studied, the R134E prosegment mutant or the α1-AT reactive site loop variants RRVL358, RRYL358 and RRIL358 are the best specific cellular inhibitors of SKI-1. The observed inhibition of the processing of endogenous SREBP-2, exogenous ATF6 and a PDGF-A (RRLL86) variant were >55% and reach ∼80% in stable transfectants. We also show that SKI-1 forms SDS-stable complexes with these α1-AT variants, but not with wild-type α1-AT or α1-PDX.

The mature virus glycoprotein Gn is generated by proteolytic cleavage from Pre-Gn at the RRLL site by SKI-1 in the ER-cis Golgi compartments (48Vincent M.J. Sanchez A.J. Erickson B.R. Basak A.

The three SREBP isoforms in mammals that belong to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) family of transcription factors are designated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 (39Brown M.S.

Synthesized as membrane-bound precursors, they are cleaved in an SREBP-cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)- and insulin-induced gene (Insig)-dependent fashion. When cellular cholesterol levels are high, Insig proteins bind and retain the SCAP-SREBP complex in the ER. When cells are deprived of sterols, Insig separates, allowing the transport of the SREBP-SCAP complex to the Golgi. Therein, a two-step proteolytic process (SKI-1/S1P and S2P) (49Yang T.

Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2003; : 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). ATF6 is an ER type II leucine zipper transmembrane transcription factor held in the ER by Bip under normal conditions, with its N-terminal DNA binding domain facing the cytosol and its C terminus in the ER lumen (51Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the ER, calcium depletion by thapsigargin or inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin leads to an ER-stress response resulting in Bip dissociation from ATF6. The latter is then translocated in a SCAP-independent fashion to the Golgi where it is first cleaved by SKI-1/S1P and then by S2P. This releases the cytosolic N-terminal domain of ATF6 (nATF6), which subsequently reaches the nucleus to activate ER stress target genes (41Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R.

SREBPs and their processing enzymes, SKI-1/S1P and S2P are certainly important targets for drug development.

It was shown in vivo that SKI-1/S1P plays a crucial role in the processing of SREBPs in liver and is necessary for normal rates of triglyceride and sterol synthesis. Thus, whereas homozygote SKI-1/S1P (-/-) results in a lethal phenotype, conditional knockout in mouse liver results in 64–83% decrease in the rates of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis in hepatocytes (53Yang J.

However, analysis of SKI-1 mRNA distribution revealed a widespread expression that suggests that this convertase plays other roles, as in neurons, bone and cartilage development (5Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Benjannet S. Toure B.B. Basak A. Munzer J.S. Marcinkiewicz J. Zhong M. Barale J.C. Lazure C. Murphy R.A. Chretien M. Marcinkiewicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Scheel J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). The critical implication of SKI-1 in various cellular functions and in certain pathologies emphasizes the importance of understanding the function of this convertase and of developing specific inhibitors that could modulate its activity in disease states. Whereas SKI-1 inhibition was recently achieved with 300 μm of the general serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (55Okada T. Haze K. Nadanaka S. Yoshida H. Seidah N.G. Hirano Y. Sato R. Negishi M. Mori K.

In the present study, we introduced SKI-1 recognition motifs into the reactive site loop (RSL) of α1-AT (P1-P4 positions) as one approach to the development of protein-based inhibitors. We also optimized the prosegment-based inhibition of SKI-1 and identified a unique R134E mutant exhibiting a potent inhibitory activity. These inhibitors represent protein-based inhibitors designed to specifically block intracellular SKI-1 activity. Construction of Human α1-AT Variants by Site-directed Mutagenesis—The pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech) with the human α1-AT cDNA containing the wild-type sequence (AIPM358) in the reactive site loop (RSL) was used as template to introduce mutations.

The various α1-AT variants were subsequently amplified using S22/AS22, and the PCR products were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The PstI/SacII cDNA fragments replaced that of the wild-type α1-AT sequence in the pIRES2-EGFP, resulting in the mutant α1-AT recombinants RRLL, RSLK, RRLI, RRLV, RKVF, RRLE, RRIL, RRVL, RRFL, RRYL, KRLL, and KKLL.Table IOligonucleotides Sense (S) and Antisense (AS) used in the construction of various α1-AT and ppSKI-1 mutantsPrimersSense (S)Antisense (AS)S1/AS1CGCAGACTCCTCTCGATCCCCCCCGAGGTCAAGGAGGAGTCTGCGCTCTAAAAACATGGCCCCTGCS2/AS2CGCAGTCTCAAATCGATCCCCCCCGAGGTCAAGTTTGAGACTGCGCTCTAAAAACATGGCCCCTGCS3/AS3CGCAGACTCATCTCGATCCCCCCCGAGGTCAAGGATGAGTCTGCGCTCTAAAAACATGGCCCCTGCS4/AS4CGCAGACTCGTCTCGATCCCCCCCGAGGTCAAGGACGAGTCTGCGCTCTAAAAACATGGCCCCTGCS5/AS5CGCAAAGTCTTCTCGATCCCCCCCGAGGTCAAGGAAGACTTTGCGCTCTAAAAACATGGCCCCTGCS6/AS6CGCAGACTCGAGTCGATCCCGGGATCGACTCGAGTCTGCGS7/AS7GAGCGCAGAATCCTCTCGATCCGGATCGAGAGGATTCTGCGCTCS8/AS8GAGCGCAGAGTCCTCTCGATCCGGATCGAGAGGACTCTGCGCTCS9/AS9GAGCGCAGATTCCTCTCGATCCGGATCGAGAGGAATCTGCGCTCS10/AS10GAGCGCAGATACCTCTCGATCCGGATCGAGAGGTATCTGCGCTCS11/AS11GTTTTTAGAGAAGAGACTCCTCTCGCGAGAGGAGTCTCTTCTCTAAAAACS12/AS12GTTTTAGAGAAGAAACTCCTCTCGCGAGAGGAGTTTCTTCTCTAAAAACS13/AS13GGATCCGAAGAAACATCTGGGCGACAGACTCGAGTGTCTGGGCAACCTGGCGCGGGS13/AS14GGATCCGAAGAAACATCTGGGCGACAGAATGGATCCCTATTCAGCATACTTGAGGGAACGS15/AS15GAAAAGTCTTTGAATCCCTCAAGCTTGAGGGATTCAAAGACTTTTCS16/AS16GAAAAGTCTTTGCTTCCCTCAAGCTTGAGGGAAGCAAAGACTTTTCS17AS17GTTCCCTCGTGTATGCTGAATCTGCAGATTCAGCATACACGAGGGAACS18/AS18CCCCAACGTGCAGTCTTCCGTTCCGGAACGGAAGACTGCACGTTGGGGS19/AS19CCCCAAGCGAAAGTCTTCCGTTCCGGAACGGAAGACTTTCGCTTGGGGS13/AS20GGATCCGAAGAAACATCTGGGCGACAGAGGATCCTCACAGTTCATCTTTCTGCAGTGTCTGGGCAACCTGS21/AS21CCCCAAGCAGCTGTCTTTCGTTCCGGAACGAAAGACAGCTGCTTGGGGS22/AS22CTCACCCACGATATCATCACCCTTCGGCCAGTAACGTTAGGGG Open table in a new tab Human Prepro-SKI-1 and Its Mutants—The N-terminal fragment of hSKI-1 (wild type) (1–198 amino acids) was amplified by PCR using S13/AS13 and cloned into pCRII-TOPO TA-cloning vector.

Inhibition of Pro-PDGF-A and Pro-PDGF-A* Processing ex Vivo— Chinese hamster ovary CHO-K1 (4 × 105) cells (in a 60-mm plate) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). A total of 6 μg of DNA was used for each transfection in a ratio of 1:4 (substrate:inhibitor) expressing either pIRES2-EGFP-V5 alone, pIRES2-EGFP-pro-PDGF-A-V5 (WT), or pIRES2-EGFP-pro-PDGF-A*-V5 (mutant). Cotransfection with various mutants constructs such as α1-PDX (RIPR358), α1-AT (AIPM358) WT, various α1-AT, and ppSKI-1 variants were used to inhibit the processing of wild-type pro-PDGF-A or its RRLL86 mutant (pro-PDGF-A*). After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Life Technologies), the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM for another 24 h. 48-h post-transfection, the medium was resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Detection by Western blotting was done with monoclonal antibody directed against the V5 epitope fused to the C-terminal end of pro-PDGF-A (1:5000 dilution) (Invitrogen). Transient Transfection and Immunoblot Analysis of Endogenous Hamster SREBP-2—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were set up at a density of 4 × 105 cells per 60-mm plate for transfection. On day 1, cells were transiently transfected with 6 μg of cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000, and cultured overnight in medium B (1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. On day 2, cells were washed with PBS and then switched to medium with 5% lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS) with 50 μm compactin and 50 μm sodium mevalonate in the absence or the presence of sterols for 18 h. Thereafter, the cells received N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal (ALLN; Sigma) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml, a calpain and proteasome inhibitor that blocks the degradation of the mature form of SREBP-2, and the cells harvested 1-h later. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, lysed in 200 μl of SDS buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 25 μg/ml ALLN), passed repeatedly through a 25-gauge needle, and centrifuged. Cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the separated proteins were transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). These were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody IgG-7D4 (dilution 1:200) directed against the N-terminal domain of hamster SREBP-2 (amino acids 32–250). The membranes were washed, and the immunoreactive proteins detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Inhibitory Effect of Various Mutants on the Processing of ATF6— Mon"
https://openalex.org/W2054139674,"Human tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor that regulates a variety of serine proteinases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis through their non-productive interaction with a P1 residue (Arg-24) in its first Kunitz-type domain (KD1). Previous kinetic studies revealed that TFPI-2 was a more effective inhibitor of plasmin than several other serine proteinases, but the molecular basis for this specificity was unclear. In this study, we employed molecular modeling and mutagenesis strategies to produce several variants of human TFPI-2 KD1 in an effort to identify interactive site residues other than the P1 Arg that contribute significantly to its inhibitory activity and specificity. Molecular modeling of KD1 based on the crystal structure of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor revealed that KD1 formed a more energetically favorable complex with plasmin versus trypsin and/or the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex primarily due to strong ionic interactions between Asp-19 (P6) and Arg residues in plasmin (Arg-644, Arg-719, and Arg-767), Arg-24 (P1) with Asp-735 in plasmin, and Arg-29 (P5′) with Glu-606 in plasmin. In addition, Leu-26 through Leu-28 (P2′–P4′) in KD1 formed strong van der Waals contact with a hydrophobic cluster in plasmin (Phe-583, Met-585, and Phe-587). Mutagenesis of Asp-19, Tyr-20, Arg-24, Arg-29, and Leu-26 in KD1 resulted in substantial reductions in plasmin inhibitory activity relative to wild-type KD1, but the Asp-19 and Tyr-20 mutations revealed the importance of these residues in the specific inhibition of plasmin. In addition to the reactive site residues in the P6–P5′ region of KD1, mutation of a highly conserved Phe at the P18′ position revealed the importance of this residue in the inhibition of serine proteinases by KD1. Thus, together with the P1 residue, the nature of other residues flanking the P1 residue, particularly at P6 and P5′, strongly influences the inhibitory activity and specificity of human TFPI-2. Human tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor that regulates a variety of serine proteinases involved in coagulation and fibrinolysis through their non-productive interaction with a P1 residue (Arg-24) in its first Kunitz-type domain (KD1). Previous kinetic studies revealed that TFPI-2 was a more effective inhibitor of plasmin than several other serine proteinases, but the molecular basis for this specificity was unclear. In this study, we employed molecular modeling and mutagenesis strategies to produce several variants of human TFPI-2 KD1 in an effort to identify interactive site residues other than the P1 Arg that contribute significantly to its inhibitory activity and specificity. Molecular modeling of KD1 based on the crystal structure of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor revealed that KD1 formed a more energetically favorable complex with plasmin versus trypsin and/or the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex primarily due to strong ionic interactions between Asp-19 (P6) and Arg residues in plasmin (Arg-644, Arg-719, and Arg-767), Arg-24 (P1) with Asp-735 in plasmin, and Arg-29 (P5′) with Glu-606 in plasmin. In addition, Leu-26 through Leu-28 (P2′–P4′) in KD1 formed strong van der Waals contact with a hydrophobic cluster in plasmin (Phe-583, Met-585, and Phe-587). Mutagenesis of Asp-19, Tyr-20, Arg-24, Arg-29, and Leu-26 in KD1 resulted in substantial reductions in plasmin inhibitory activity relative to wild-type KD1, but the Asp-19 and Tyr-20 mutations revealed the importance of these residues in the specific inhibition of plasmin. In addition to the reactive site residues in the P6–P5′ region of KD1, mutation of a highly conserved Phe at the P18′ position revealed the importance of this residue in the inhibition of serine proteinases by KD1. Thus, together with the P1 residue, the nature of other residues flanking the P1 residue, particularly at P6 and P5′, strongly influences the inhibitory activity and specificity of human TFPI-2. Proteinase inhibitors play a critical role in the regulation of several physiological processes such as blood coagulation, complement fixation, fibrinolysis, and fertilization (1Bode W. Huber R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Most of these inhibitors are proteins having characteristic polypeptide scaffolds, and are grouped into a number of families, including the Kunitz (2Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev.

Three variants/isoforms of molecular mass 32, 30, and 27 kDa are synthesized by these cells and are thought to represent differentially glycosylated forms (15Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y.Y. O'Toole E.A.O.

TFPI-2 exhibits inhibitory activity toward a broad spectrum of proteinases, including trypsin, plasmin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, plasma kallikrein, and the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex. However, TFPI-2 exhibits little, if any, inhibitory activity toward urokinase-type plasminogen activator, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and α-thrombin (16Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 presumably inhibits proteinases through a P1 arginine residue (Arg-24) in its first Kunitz-type domain, as an R24Q TFPI-2 mutant exhibited only 5–10% inhibitory activity toward trypsin, plasmin, and the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex (17Kamei S.

Several approaches have been employed to elucidate the structure-function relationship and broad specificity of Kunitztype inhibitors using the well characterized bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) as a model. Detailed biophysical and biochemical studies have provided a greater insight into the structural basis for the association of BPTI, or its homologues, to proteinases. Moreover, using semisynthetic (20Wenzel H.R. Tschesche H. von Goldammer E. Netzelmann U. FEBS Lett. 1982; 140: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 21Tschesche H. Beckmann J. Mehlich A. Schnabel E. Truscheit E. Wenzel H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 913: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or recombinant approaches (22Stassen J.M. Lambeir A.M. Vreys I. Deckmyn H.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it has been possible to change or enhance the inhibitory activity and spectrum of BPTI, as well as its homologues. Kunitz-type inhibitors possess a compact pear-shaped structure stabilized by three disulfide bonds containing a reactive site region featuring the principal determinant P1 residue in a rigid conformation. These inhibitors competitively prevent access of the serine proteinase for its physiologically relevant macromolecular substrate through insertion of the P1 residue into the active site cleft (24Wlodawer A. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition to the P1 residue, other residues within the reactive site region of BPTI (P4–P4′) have been shown to interact with different serine proteinases, and it is generally recognized that the N-terminal side of the reactive site (P) is energetically more important than the P′ C-terminal side (25Perona J.J. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29987-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In all, about 10–12 amino acid residues in the inhibitor and 20–25 residues in the proteinase are in direct contact in the formation of a stable proteinase-inhibitor complex, and provide a buried area of 600–900 Å (26Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although many proteins structurally similar to BPTI, such as TFPI KD2 (27Burgering M.J.

In the case of TFPI-2, it is generally believed that its first Kunitz-type domain, in a BPTI-like manner, harbors most of its inhibitory activity, although no studies have definitively shown that this domain is sufficient to mediate this activity. In the present study, the complete first Kunitz domain of human TFPI-2 was expressed and purified, and its inhibitory activity toward selected proteinases was compared with that of full-length TFPI-2 and BPTI. In addition, molecular modeling was employed to obtain three-dimensional structural information on complexes of TFPI-2 KD1-plasmin, TFPI-2 KD1-trypsin, and TFPI-2 KD1-factor VIIa to identify residues in KD1 involved in its molecular recognition of each proteinase. From this analysis, residues primarily responsible for the interaction and proteinase specificity were then selected for mutagenesis. Select amino acid residues on both the N- and C-terminal side of the reactive site residue (P1) were substituted individually, and the effects of these point-mutations on the proteinase specificity and inhibitory activity were investigated.

Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar); pdb code 1bml) served as templates in building these models. Bulk solvent was excluded from the proteinase-inhibitor complex, and, accordingly, it was anticipated that hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions that may play an important role in specificity could be accurately evaluated. The protocols for modeling these complexes have been described in detail earlier (8Bajaj M.S. Birktoft J.J. Steer S.A. Bajaj S.P. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, the relative positions of the inhibitor and proteinase domains were maintained and adjustments were only made to the side chains. Hydrophobic/van der Waals, hydrogen bonds, and ionic interactions were observed between each proteinase-inhibitor complex. All of these interactions were taken into consideration in evaluating each proteinase-inhibitor complex, and it was assumed that all potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors would participate in these interactions. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Proteins—The first Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor domain of human TFPI-2 (KD1), and its mutants were overexpressed as N-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys using the T7 promoter system (37Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid derived from pET19b bearing a decahistidine tag leader sequence followed by an enterokinase cleavage site and cDNA encoding the first Kunitz-domain of TFPI-2 was prepared according to standard procedures (38Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual.Third Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, ME2001Google Scholar). Using this recombinant vector as a template, several other constructs containing the desired point mutations were generated using a QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each recombinant construct was examined for in-frame orientation, integrity, and desired mutation by nucleic acid sequencing. Wild-type and mutant His tag KD1 preparations were expressed in E. coli grown in rich media containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin, and induced at 37 °C with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside at mid log-phase (A600 = 0.6–0.8). The overexpressed proteins were recovered from the cell lysates in the form of inclusion bodies following sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole (buffer A). Inclusion bodies were recovered by high speed centrifugation (20,000 × g for 60 min) and thoroughly washed overnight at room temperature before solubilizing in buffer A containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The solubilized inclusion bodies were recovered by high speed centrifugation and were filtered through 0.22-μm Nalgene® filters before application to His-Trap® column individually dedicated to each expressed protein. His-Trap affinity columns were used in a Amersham Biosciences FPLC system and purification was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol. Peak fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and oxidatively refolded by initial dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The refolded proteins were purified to homogeneity by Mono Q FPLC at room temperature. KD1 proteins were eluted from this column in a linear NaCl gradient consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 1 m NaCl. Peak fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and pure fractions were pooled and concentrated on YM-3 ultrafiltration membranes. General Methods—The concentration of each purified KD1 protein was determined by measuring its absorbance at 280 nm using calculated values for E1% derived from its Tyr, Trp, and Cys content (39Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The concentration of plasmin was provided by the supplier, whereas the concentrations of all other proteins used in this study were determined according to Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using BSA as the reference protein. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Trypsin and Plasmin Inhibition Assays—Trypsin and plasmin inhibition assays were performed as described elsewhere (16Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsin and plasmin were incubated with various concentrations of inhibitor preparations for 15 min at 37 °C in a 96-well microtitration plate. The chromogenic substrate S-2251 was then added, and residual amidolytic activity was measured in a Molecular Devices UVmax kinetic microplate reader. Inhibition Assay for Factor VIIa-Tissue Factor Amidolytic Activity— Recombinant soluble human tissue factor (100 nm) and factor VIIa (50 nm) were incubated in a TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mM NaCl)-BSA buffer/5 mm CaCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. Following this incubation, aliquots (100 μl) were dispensed into a 96-well microtitration plate and treated with serial dilutions of inhibitors dissolved in TBS buffer. After 15 min of incubation, 30 μl of S-2288 (final concentration, 1 mm) was added to each well and the absorbance at 405 nm was determined as described earlier. Inhibition Kinetics—The apparent inhibition constant, Ki′ was determined using the non-linear regression data analysis program Ultrafitfv3.0 (Biosoft). Trypsin and plasmin inhibitory data were analyzed according to the following equation for a tight-binding inhibitor, vi=v0[(Ki+[I]0+[E]0)2-4[I]0[E]0+(Ki'+[I]0-[E]0)]/2[E]0(Eq. 1) where vi and v0 are the inhibited and uninhibited rates, respectively, and [I]0 and [E]0 are the total concentrations of inhibitor and enzyme, respectively. Factor VIIa-tissue factor inhibition data, where Ki >> [E]0, were analyzed according to Equation 2. vi=v0/(1+[I]0/Ki')(Eq. 2) The Ki values were obtained by correcting for the effect of substrate according to Bieth et al. (42Bieth J.G. Biochem. Med. 1984; 32: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), where Ki = Ki′/(1 + [S]/Km). Molecular Modeling and Selection of Mutations—Previous studies demonstrated that human TFPI-2 is a strong inhibitor of plasmin and trypsin, and a relatively weak inhibitor of the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex (16Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the specificity of TFPI-2 for plasmin and trypsin relative to the serine proteinase factor VIIa is unclear, but presumably involves residues other than the P1 Arg in the first Kunitz-type domain of TFPI-2, as well as residues in the active site region of the proteinase. To address whether other residues in the reactive site region of TFPI-2 may play a role in its inhibitory potency and specificity, we employed a molecular modeling approach to guide subsequent mutagenesis studies designed to provide information on the functional importance of these residues. Because our preliminary data indicated that a recombinant preparation of the first Kunitz-type domain of TFPI-2 (KD1) exhibited better inhibitory activity in comparison to the intact parent molecule (see below), we decided to model complexes of KD1 with plasmin, trypsin, and factor VIIa based on the crystal structure of BPTI and each proteinase, respectively. A preliminary inspection of the amino acid sequences surrounding the P1 residue in a number of Kunitz-type inhibitors revealed highly conserved residues at the P6, P1, P5′, and P18′ positions (Fig. 1), and our molecular modeling studies thus initially focused on the contributions of these residues in the formation of an energetically stable complex between KD1 and the above proteinases. In the model structures of these complexes, no unfavorable contacts between atoms and no unnatural chiral centers were observed. In the Ramachandran plot of the main-chain ϕ-φ angles, all of the non-glycine residues are in the most favored or permissive regions. Moreover, there are no gross steric clashes that preclude the interaction of proteinases with KD1. For simplicity and consistency, the residue numbering system employed for KD1 and each proteinase is that of its linear sequence position. In addition, to relate each proteinase residue number to its corresponding position in the prototypical proteinase chymotrypsin, each proteinase residue number is followed by its position in chymotrypsin in braces and is preceded by the letter “c.” Finally, the relationship between residues mutated in KD1 and their position in BPTI is indicated in Table I. 2Note that residues in KD1 differ by nine from BPTI. Thus, residue 24 (P1 residue) in KD1 is equivalent to 15 in BPTI. For simplicity, KD1 numbering system is used in the text.

The plasmin-interactive hydrophobic interface is formed by a number of residues in KD1, including Leu-26, Leu-27, Leu-28, Leu-43, and Tyr-55. The residues Leu-18, Tyr-20, Tyr-31, Phe-42, and Tyr-44 in KD1 are buried within and contribute to the formation of an internal hydrophobic pocket. Within the interactive patch, Leu-27 in KD1 interacts with Phe-583{c37}, Met-585{c39}, Phe-587{c41}, and CB of Lys-607{c61} in plasmin (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, Leu-28 interacts with Met-585{c39} in plasmin. Furthermore, the side-chain CD and CE of Lys-607{c61} could make hydrophobic interactions with CD1 and CE1 of Tyr-55 in KD1 (Fig. 2A). These flanking region interactions at the interface of plasmin and KD1 exhibit a marked variability in structural complimentarity when compared with analogous interactions in KD1-trypsin (Fig. 3A) and KD1-factor VIIa (Fig. 3B) complexes. In this regard, the hydrophobic patch observed between KD1 and plasmin does not exist with factor VIIa (Fig. 3B), whereas trypsin appears to have this hydrophobic patch interaction (Fig. 3A).

APP complements amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2), and together they play essential physiological roles. Phosphorylation at the Thr668 residue of APP (with respect to the numbering conversion for the APP 695 isoform) and the Thr736 residue of APLP2 (with respect to the numbering conversion for the APLP2 763 isoform) in their cytoplasmic domains acts as a molecular switch for their protein-protein interaction and is implicated in neural function(s) and/or Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

X11-like (X11L, also referred to as X11β and Mint2), which is a member of the mammalian LIN-10 protein family and a possible regulator of Aβ production, elevated APP and APLP2 phosphorylation probably by facilitating JNK-mediated phosphorylation, whereas other members of the family, X11 and X11L2, did not. These observations revealed an involvement of X11L in the phosphorylation of APP family proteins in cellular stress and suggest that X11L protein may be important in the physiology of APP family proteins as well as in the regulation of Aβ production. β-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the precursor of β-amyloid (Aβ), which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

Aβ is a principal component of senile plaques, a characteristic pathological feature in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain.

APP is a member of an evolutionally conserved gene family that in mammals includes amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) and 2 (APLP2) (3Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Von Koch C. Lo A.C. Tanzi R.E.

APP and its family members are physiologically important and functionally redundant because single disruption of each gene causes minor abnormalities, but combined disruption of APP and APLP2 or APLP1 and APLP2 causes lethality in early postnatal mice (5Heber S.

Among these binding proteins, JIP-1 has been suggested to enhance the phosphorylation of APP by JNK (16Taru H. Iijima K. Hase M. Kirino Y. Yagi Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

In contrast, however, the phosphorylation level of APP is not dramatically affected by JIP-1 in cells (16Taru H. Iijima K. Hase M. Kirino Y. Yagi Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol.

In addition, it remains unclear whether other binding protein(s) could play a prominent role in the regulation of JNK-mediated intracellular phosphorylation. The cytoplasmic domains of APP family proteins are highly homologous, and the phosphorylation site corresponding to Thr668 of APP is conserved in APLP2 as Thr736 (with respect to the numbering conversion for the APLP2 763 isoform) (4Wasco W.

Indeed, similar to Thr668 of APP, Thr736 of APLP2 can be phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase (37Suzuki T. Ando K. Isohara T. Oishi M. Lim G.S. Satoh Y. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Gandy S.E. Kirino Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, also similar to APP, phosphorylation of APLP2 is suggested to act as a molecular switch for binding to cytosolic proteins such as FE65 (11Ando K. Iijima K.I. Elliott J.I. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40353-40361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, whether the molecular mechanisms of APLP2 phosphorylation and its regulation are identical to that of APP has not been fully elucidated. In this study, therefore, we investigated the phosphorylation of APP and APLP2 by JNK and the regulation of these phosphorylation events by their binding proteins. APP and APLP2 were phosphorylated by JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 in vitro and in cells in response to cellular stress. Furthermore, among several known binding proteins, X11L, but not X11 or X11L2, was found to markedly enhance phosphorylation of APP and APLP2. These findings further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of phosphorylation and physiological function(s) of APP and APLP2 as well as differential functions among X11 family proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2076357866,"Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease (APE) is a multifunctional protein possessing both DNA repair and redox regulatory activities. In base excision repair (BER), APE is responsible for processing spontaneous, chemical, or monofunctional DNA glycosylase-initiated AP sites via its 5′-endonuclease activity and 3′-“end-trimming” activity when processing residues produced as a consequence of bifunctional DNA glycosylases. In this study, we have fully characterized a mammalian model of APE haploinsufficiency by using a mouse containing a heterozygous gene-targeted deletion of the APE gene (Apex+/–). Our data indicate that Apex+/– mice are indeed APE-haploinsufficient, as exhibited by a 40–50% reduction (p < 0.05) in APE mRNA, protein, and 5′-endonuclease activity in all tissues studied. Based on gene dosage, we expected to see a concomitant reduction in BER activity; however, by using an in vitro G:U mismatch BER assay, we observed tissue-specific alterations in monofunctional glycosylase-initiated BER activity, e.g. liver (35% decrease, p < 0.05), testes (55% increase, p < 0.05), and brain (no significant difference). The observed changes in BER activity correlated tightly with changes in DNA polymerase β and AP site DNA binding levels. We propose a mechanism of BER that may be influenced by the redox regulatory activity of APE, and we suggest that reduced APE may render a cell/tissue more susceptible to dysregulation of the polymerase β-dependent BER response to cellular stress.

After the initial discovery in Escherichia coli (1Verly W.G. Paquette Y. Can. J. Biochem. 1972; 50: 217-224Google Scholar), APE was purified from calf thymus DNA and extensively characterized as an endonuclease that cleaves the backbone of double-stranded DNA containing AP sites (2Ljungquist S. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1530-1535Google Scholar, 3Ljungquist S. Andersson A. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1536-1540Google Scholar). APE homologues were subsequently identified and characterized in many organisms, including yeast as APN1 (4Popoff S.C. Spira A.I. Johnson A.W. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4193-4197Google Scholar), mice as Apex (5Seki S. Akiyama K. Watanabe S. Hatsushika M. Ikeda S. Tsutsui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20797-20802Google Scholar, 6Seki S. Ikeda S. Watanabe S. Hatsushika M. Tsutsui K. Akiyama K. Zhang B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1079: 57-64Google Scholar), and humans as HAP1 (7Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Google Scholar). In addition to its major 5′-endonuclease activity, APE also expresses minor 3′-phosphodiesterase, 3′-phosphatase, and 3′ → 5′-exonuclease activities (8Wilson III, D.M. Sofinowski T.M. McNeill D.R. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: D963-D981Google Scholar), the biological significance of which is controversial (9Lebedeva N.A. Khodyreva S.N. Favre A. Lavrik O.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 182-187Google Scholar). Independent of its discovery as a DNA repair protein, APE was also characterized as REF-1, for redox factor-1, a redox activator of cellular transcription factors (10Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Google Scholar, 11Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Google Scholar, 12Evans A.R. Limp-Foster M. Kelley M.R. Mutat. Res. 2000; 461: 83-108Google Scholar). Although the molecular detail of APE redox activity is still unclear (13Ordway J.M. Eberhart D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4257-4266Google Scholar), the discovery of APE as a regulator of transcriptional activity may underscore the importance of its involvement in cellular stress-response pathways. APE is the primary enzyme responsible for recognition and incision of non-coding AP sites in DNA arising as a consequence of spontaneous, chemical, or DNA glycosylase-mediated hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond initiated by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. These lesions are particularly common, arising at the rate of ∼50,000–200,000 AP sites per cell per day under normal physiological conditions (14Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225Google Scholar, 15Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526Google Scholar). Unrepaired AP sites may threaten genomic stability by serving as blocks to DNA replication (16Schaaper R.M. Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 487-491Google Scholar), by stalling RNA polymerase II during transcription (17Yu S.-L. Lee S.-K. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 382-388Google Scholar), or by promoting topoisomerase II-mediated double strand breaks (18Wilstermann A.M. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46290-46296Google Scholar). Of the repair pathways available to a cell (19Friedberg E.C. Nature. 2003; 421: 436-440Google Scholar, 20Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Roos W.P. Kaina B. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 3-34Google Scholar), BER is the main pathway responsible for repairing AP sites in DNA. Initiation of BER is made possible by recognition of a damaged base by either a monofunctional or bifunctional DNA glycosylase, in addition to AP site recognition by APE. In monofunctional glycosylase-initiated BER (MFG-BER), a damaged or improper base is recognized and removed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the N-glycosyl bond resulting in the formation of an AP site. AP sites serve as a substrate for APE, which incises the DNA backbone immediately 5′ to the AP site via its 5′-endonuclease activity, producing a single strand break with a normal 3′-hydroxyl group and an abnormal 5′-deoxyribose 5-phosphate (dRP) residue (21Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.2nd. Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 208-270Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β (β-pol) inserts a new base followed by the coupled β-pol-mediated excision of the abnormal 5′-dRP, removal of which has been shown to be rate-limiting (22Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Google Scholar). In bifunctional glycosylaseinitiated BER, the damaged base is recognized and removed by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase followed by incision of the DNA backbone by the associated AP lyase activity, yielding a normal 5′-terminal deoxynucleoside-5′-phosphate residue and an abnormal 3′-terminal α,β-unsaturated aldehyde residue that must be processed prior to repair completion (21Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.2nd. Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 208-270Google Scholar). The removal of the abnormal 3′-blocking lesion by APE 3′-phosphodiesterase activity is believed to be rate-limiting (23Izumi T. Hazra T.K. Boldogh I. Tomkinson A.E. Park M.S. Ikeda S. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1329-1334Google Scholar); however, this rate-limiting role is controversial (24Cappelli E. Degan P. Frosina G. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1135-1141Google Scholar, 25Bogliolo M. Cappelli E. D'Osualdo A. Rossi O. Barbieri O. Kelley M.R. Frosina G. Anticancer Res. 2002; 22: 2797-2804Google Scholar, 26Cappelli E. D'Osualdo A. Bogliolo M. Kelley M.R. Frosina G. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2003; 42: 50-58Google Scholar). After APE recognition of AP sites, BER may proceed by one of two pathways: (i) β-pol-mediated single nucleotide insertion, similar to MFG-BER, or (ii) >1 nucleotide strand-displacement synthesis, required to process modified (i.e. reduced, oxidized) AP sites and involves components of the DNA replication machinery (27Demple B. DeMott M.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8926-8934Google Scholar). Completion of BER requires the nick sealing activity of DNA ligase complexes (28Tomkinson A.E. Chen L. Dong Z. Leppard J.B. Levin D.S. Mackey Z.B. Motycka T.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 151-164Google Scholar). A review of structural studies has proposed a model of BER requiring highly intimate, yet transient protein-protein interactions among BER enzymes to ensure proper damage repair, with APE being at the center of activity (29Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Google Scholar). For example, x-ray cross-complementing protein (XRCC1), a protein with no known enzymatic activity, functions as both a scaffold protein and modulator of BER via functional and physical interaction with APE, bridging the incision and nick-sealing steps of BER (30Vidal A.E. Boiteux S. Hickson I.D. Radicella J.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6530-6539Google Scholar). APE has been shown also to interact with β-pol, recruiting it to the incised AP site and enhancing its rate-limiting dRPase activity (31Bennett R.A.O. Wilson III, D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Google Scholar); this activity is also believed to be involved in the repair of oxidative base lesions (32Allinson S.L. Dianova I.I. Dianov G.L. EMBO J. 2001; 23: 6919-6926Google Scholar). The functional importance of β-pol in oxidative damage repair may be due to the interaction of APE with bifunctional DNA glycosylases responsible for recognizing and removing these lesions. For example, APE has been shown to stimulate 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) turnover and enhance its glycosylase activity while minimizing its associated AP lyase activity (33Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Google Scholar, 34Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar), with XRCC1 accelerating this process (35Marsin S. Vidal A.E. Sossou M. Menissier-de Murcia J. Le Page F. Boiteux S. de Murcia G. Radicella J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44068-44074Google Scholar), thus eliminating a potentially rate-limiting step of APE and potentiating MFG-BER. Similar results have also been obtained with other bifunctional DNA glycosylases such as endonuclease III (hNTH1), responsible for recognition and removal of ring-saturated pyrimidines (36Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9005-9012Google Scholar). These studies, in addition to a recent mathematical model of BER throughput (37Sokhansanj B. Rodrigue G.R. Fitch J.P. Wilson III, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1817-1825Google Scholar), suggest a preference for β-pol-mediated MFG-BER in vivo. The objective of the research described in this study is to characterize in more detail the phenotype of an APE heterozygous knockout (Apex+/–) mouse reported previously (38Meira L.B. Devaraj S. Kisby G.E. Burns D.K. Daniel R.L. Hammer R.E. Grundy S. Jialal I. Friedberg E.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5552-5557Google Scholar), and to address the effect of APE haploinsufficiency on BER capacity. It is important to note that homozygous deletion of the APE gene (Apex–/–) is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous mice survive and are fertile (38Meira L.B. Devaraj S. Kisby G.E. Burns D.K. Daniel R.L. Hammer R.E. Grundy S. Jialal I. Friedberg E.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5552-5557Google Scholar, 39Ludwig D.L. MacInnes M.A. Takiguchi Y. Purtymun P.E. Henrie M. Flannery M. Meneses J. Pedersen R.A. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 17-29Google Scholar, 40Xanthoudakis S. Smeyne R.J. Wallace J.D. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8919-8923Google Scholar). Because the sequences encoding both the DNA repair and redox regulatory activities of APE are disrupted in Apex–/– mice, it is unclear whether one or both of these activities are necessary for embryogenesis. Although the role of APE in the redox activation of p53 and other cellular transcription factors suggests its importance in signal transduction pathways, the embryonic lethality observed for APE and three other BER genes (β-pol, DNA ligase I, and XRCC1) suggests a critical role for BER during embryogenesis (41Friedberg E.C. Meira L.B. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 501-530Google Scholar). Recent studies have implicated a role for p53 in the regulation of the BER pathway (42Smith M.L. Seo Y.R. Mutagenesis. 2002; 17: 149-156Google Scholar); therefore, it is inviting to suggest that APE repair activity in general, and perhaps APE redox regulatory activity in particular, is the reason for the embryonic lethality observed when APE is deficient. Here we present evidence that half the gene dosage of APE results in tissue-specific alterations in MFG-BER and suggest that APE redox activity, as opposed to repair per se, potentiates this phenotypic effect. Data obtained from Apex+/– mice may have relevant transnational implications because APE variants have been identified in the human population (43Hadi M.Z. Coleman M.A. Fidelis K. Mohrenweiser H.W. Wilson III, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3871-3879Google Scholar), and variants in DNA repair have been associated with increased risk for disease such as cancer (44de Boer J.G. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 201-210Google Scholar, 45Mohrenweiser H.W. Wilson III, D.M. Jones I.M. Mutat. Res. 2003; 526: 93-125Google Scholar). The experiments were performed on young (3–6 months) male C57BL/6-specific pathogen-free mice in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals. The Wayne State University Animal Investigation Committee approved the animal protocol. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed a standard lab diet and water ad libitum. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the organs to be studied were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C for later enzyme studies and Western blot analyses. Tissues for total RNA isolation and RT-PCR analysis were immediately homogenized in TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The APE heterozygous knockout (Apex+/–) mice were developed in Friedberg's laboratory as described previously (38Meira L.B. Devaraj S. Kisby G.E. Burns D.K. Daniel R.L. Hammer R.E. Grundy S. Jialal I. Friedberg E.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5552-5557Google Scholar). In order to obtain the requisite number of animals for the study, the Apex+/– mice were inbred and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed a standard lab diet and water ad libitum. The mice appeared normal, were fertile, and there was no retardation in food intake, weight gain, or growth rate; however, it was observed that pups were not produced in expected Mendelian ratios, with heterozygote births predominating, similar to previous observations (39Ludwig D.L. MacInnes M.A. Takiguchi Y. Purtymun P.E. Henrie M. Flannery M. Meneses J. Pedersen R.A. Chen D.J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 17-29Google Scholar). A three-primer PCR strategy was employed to genotype the animals generated by Apex+/– intercrosses as described previously (38Meira L.B. Devaraj S. Kisby G.E. Burns D.K. Daniel R.L. Hammer R.E. Grundy S. Jialal I. Friedberg E.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5552-5557Google Scholar). The level of APE mRNA was measured using RT-PCR analysis using AccessQuick™ RT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNA was isolated from selected tissues using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA concentration was determined by measuring UV absorption at 260/280 nm. Oligonucleotide primers specific for the mouse Apex gene (forward, 5′-CTCAAGATATGCTCCTGGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTATTCCAGTCTTACCAGA-3′) were designed using GeneFisher Interactive Primer Design Tool (Bielefeld, Germany) and synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). RT-PCR thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 48 °C for 45 min, 1 cycle; 95 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle; 95 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 2 min, 22 cycles; and 70 °C for 5 min, 1 cycle. The 350-bp RT-PCR product was stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Intensity of the bands was detected and quantified using a ChemiImager™ system (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA) and expressed as the integrated density value (I.D.V) per μg of RNA used per reaction. Data were normalized based on the amount of β-actin present in each sample. Isolation of crude nuclear extract was accomplished using Sigma CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ extraction kit (Sigma). All samples and tubes were handled and chilled on ice, and all solutions were made fresh according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resultant nuclear extracts were dialyzed against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 100 mm KCl; 10 mm NaS2O5; 0.1 mm DTT; 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 4–6 h at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer® minidialysis units (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined using Protein Assay Kit I (Bio-Rad). Western analysis was performed using 200 μg of crude nuclear extract isolated from selected tissues according to standard protocol. Protein levels were determined using manufacturer recommended dilutions of monoclonal antisera developed against mouse APE/REF-1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and monoclonal antisera developed against rat β-pol (Ab-1 Clone 18S, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA). The bands were detected and quantified using a ChemiImager™ system (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA) after incubation in SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Data are expressed as the I.D.V. of the band per μg of protein loaded. The 5′-endonuclease activity of APE was analyzed using a quantitative in vitro assay that measures the incision of a 26-mer duplex oligonucleotide substrate containing a synthetic tetrahydrofuran (F) AP site (upper strand, 5′-AATTCACCGGTACCFTCTAGAATTCG-3′; lower strand, 5′-CGAATTCTAGAGGGTACCGGTGAATT-3′) as described previously (46Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 pmol of radio-end-labeled and purified duplex AP DNA substrate was incubated with 100 ng of crude nuclear extract-selected tissues in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5; 50 mm KCl; 10 mm MgCl2; 2mm DTT; 1 μg/ml BSA; and 0.05% Triton X-100. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 50 mm EDTA. Assay products (5 μl) were added to 15 μl of loading dye (95% formamide, 5% glycerol, 10 mg of xylene cyanol, 10 mg of bromphenol blue) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Aliquots (3 μl) were run on a 15% denaturing 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel (SequaGel® Sequencing System, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) at 55 °C, soaked in fixing solution (10% glacial acetic acid; 10% methanol), wrapped in Saran wrap, and exposed to a Molecular Imaging Screen (Bio-Rad). Endonuclease activity (presence of a 14-mer band) was visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager® System (Bio-Rad) by calculating the relative amount of the 14-mer oligo product with the unreacted 26-mer substrate (product/(product + substrate)). Data are expressed as machine counts per ng of protein. The principle of this assay is to measure MFG-BER activity. Radio end-labeled and purified 30-bp oligonucleotides (upper strand, 5′-ATATACCGCGGUCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATTdd-3′; lower strand, 3′-ddTATATGGCGCCGGCCGGCTAGTTCGAATAA-5′) containing a G:U mismatch and an HpaII restriction site (CCGG) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2; 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm NAD, 20 μm dNTPs, 5 mm diTrisphosphocreatine, 10 units of creatine phosphokinase) with 50 μg of crude nuclear extract isolated from selected tissues. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 5 min at 95 °C to stop the reaction. The duplex oligonucleotides were allowed to reanneal for 1 h at room temperature before being briefly centrifuged to pellet the denatured proteins. Repair of the G:U mismatch to a correct G:C base pair was determined via treatment of the duplex oligonucleotide with 20 units of HpaII (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h at 37 °C and analysis by electrophoresis on a 20% denaturing 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel (SequaGel® Sequencing System, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Repair activity (presence of a 16-mer band) was visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager® System (Bio-Rad) by calculating the ratio of the 16-mer product with the 30-mer substrate (product/substrate). Data are expressed as machine counts per μg of protein. The DNA binding ability of nuclear extracts isolated from selected tissues was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Nuclear extracts (20 μg) were incubated with 4× reaction buffer (final concentrations: 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0; 100 mm NaCl; 10 mm EDTA; 1 mm DTT; 9.5% glycerol v/v) plus 1 μg of BSA and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 5 min at room temperature. A radio-end-labeled and purified oligonucleotide probe containing an AP site (0.0125 pmol) was added to the reaction mix and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Negative controls (all components except nuclear extract) were included in all experiments. In competitive assays, 100× molar excess of unlabeled DNA was added to the reaction mixture. The protein-DNA complex was resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Reaction products were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager® System (Bio-Rad). TEMPO Extraction of DNA—DNA for the aldehyde-reactive probe slot blot (ASB) assay was extracted according to the method described by Hofer and Moller (47Hofer T. Moller L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 882-887Google Scholar) with some modifications. This method minimizes artifactual DNA damage by using 20 mm TEMPO in all solutions and reagents and by minimizing heat treatment of DNA. Briefly, tissue was homogenized in ice-cold PBS and centrifuged (2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min). Resultant supernatant was decanted and pellet resuspended in lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Proteinase K (30 units, Ambion, Austin, TX) was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by phenol/chloroform and Sevag (chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 24:1) extraction. Extracted DNA was precipitated using 7.5% 4 m NaCl and 2 volumes of 100% cold ethanol and centrifuged (2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min). Resultant pellet was washed in 70% ethanol and resuspended in ice-cold PBS and rehydrated at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with RNase A (2 μg) and RNase T1 (1,000 units, Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C, and resultant DNA was cold ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in deionized water at 4 °C, and stored at –70 °C. Gravity Tip Extraction of DNA—DNA for the random oligonucleotide primed synthesis (ROPS) assay was isolated using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) gravity tip columns as described in the manufacturer's protocol. This method generates large fragments of DNA (up to 150-kb) while minimizing shearing. ASB—The ASB assay was carried out as described previously (14Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225Google Scholar) with slight modifications. TEMPO-extracted DNA (8 μg) was incubated in 30 μl of PBS with 2 mm aldehyde-reactive probe (ARP) (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) at 37 °C for 10 min. DNA was cold ethanol-precipitated (as described above) and resuspended in 1× TE buffer overnight at 4 °C. DNA was heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, quickly chilled on ice, and mixed with equal amount of 2 m ammonium acetate. DNA was immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) by using a Invitrogen Filtration Manifold system. The membrane was washed in 5× SSC for 15 min at 37 °C and then baked under vacuum at 80 °C for 30 min. The dried membrane was incubated in a hybridization buffer (final concentrations: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 0.1 m NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 0.5% casein w/v; 0.25% BSA w/v; 0.1% Tween 20 v/v) for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated in the same hybridization buffer containing 100 μl of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) at room temperature for 45 min. Following incubation in horseradish peroxidase, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min each at 37 °C in TBS, pH 7.5 (final concentrations: 0.26 m NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was incubated in ECL (Pierce) for 5 min at room temperature and visualized using a ChemiImager™ system (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). Standards containing known amounts of AP sites (14Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.-Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225Google Scholar) were used to determine the relative level of AP sites in liver DNA. Data are expressed as number of AP sites per 106 nucleotides. ROPS—The relative number of 3′-OH group-containing DNA strand breaks was quantified using a Klenow(exo–) incorporation assay based on the ability of Klenow to initiate DNA synthesis from 3′-OH ends of single strand DNA (48Basnakian A.G. James S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 255-262Google Scholar). Gravity tip extracted DNA (0.25 μg) was heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min and added to the Klenow reaction buffer (0.5 mm dTTP, 0.5 mm dGTP, and 0.5 mm dATP; 0.33 μm dCTP, 1 μl of Klenow(exo–)) with 10× Klenow buffer per manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 16 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of 25 μl of 12.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples (5 μl) were spotted onto scored and numbered Whatman DE81 paper and allowed to air dry. The spotted chromatography paper was washed five times for 5 min in 0.5 m Na2HPO4 (dibasic) followed by a brief rinse in deionized water two times and then allowed to air-dry. Paper was cut and placed into scintillation vials with 2.5 ml of ScintiVerse mixture (Fisher). Incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP was quantified using a Packard scintillation counter. Statistical significance between means was determined using analysis of variance followed by the Fisher's least significant difference test where appropriate (49Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1981: 169-176Google Scholar). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In order to elucidate the molecular effects of gene-targeted disruption of the mouse APE gene (Apex), our laboratory has characterized in detail a transgenic “knockout” mouse containing a heterozygous deletion of the APE gene (Apex+/–). As reported previously, the Apex–/– mice are embryonic lethal, whereas the Apex+/– animals are fertile, appear normal, and exhibit reduced APE mRNA and APE protein levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and brain cells as compared with their Apex+/+ counterparts (38Meira L.B. Devaraj S. Kisby G.E. Burns D.K. Daniel R.L. Hammer R.E. Grundy S. Jialal I. Friedberg E.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5552-5557Google Scholar). In a series of experiments, we were able to confirm whether APE heterozygosity would cause these mice to exhibit haploinsufficiency with respect to APE in brain, liver, and testes. In order to determine whether loss of a functional allele of APE would result in reduced expression of this gene, we have quantified the expression of APE via RT-PCR analysis. By using total RNA isolated from liver, we observed a 40–50% decrease in APE mRNA (Fig. 1A) in Apex+/– mice as compared with their normal, wild-type (Apex+/+) counterparts. Because differences in APE mRNA may not necessarily reflect differences in APE protein levels, we also measured APE protein levels using Western blot analysis. We show a corresponding 40–50% decrease in APE protein in liver (Fig. 1B). To confirm that changes in APE expression (i.e. changes in mRNA and protein levels) result in changes in APE enzymatic activity, we measured APE 5′-endonuclease activity using a 26-bp oligonucl"

We wanted to determine whether Rho is also involved in the production of superoxide during phagocytosis. Inhibition of Rho by Tat-C3 exoenzyme (Tat-C3) blocked superoxide formation and curtailed the phagocytosis of serum- (SOZ), C3bi- (COZ), and IgG-opsonized zymosan (IOZ) particles. Tat-C3 did not affect superoxide formation in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Superoxide formation was also reduced in J774 cells transfected with a cDNA expressing dominant-negative form of RhoA (N19RhoA). However, purified prenylated recombinant RhoA did not activate NADPH oxidase in vitro, suggesting that Rho does not interact directly with NADPH oxidase. Tat-C3 inhibited the activity of RhoA, but did not affect that of Rac in vitro or in vivo. It also inhibited the phosphorylation of p47PHOX, one of the cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase. Taken together, these results suggest that Rho plays an important role in superoxide formation during phagocytosis of SOZ, COZ, and IOZ via phosphorylation of p47PHOX.

Phagocytosis by macrophages is essential for the uptake and degradation of pathogens. It also triggers immune responses and participates in development and tissue remodeling. Phagocytosis can be triggered by the macrophage receptors FcγRs, which recognize the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). Another type of receptor through which phagocytosis occurs is the complement receptor (CR), 1The abbreviations used are: CR, complement receptor; COZ, C3bi-opsonized zymosan; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; IOZ, IgG-opsonized zymosan; luminol, 5-amino-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-phtalazinedione; LY294002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MV, methylviologen; PA, phosphatidic acid; PD98059, 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SB203580, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methyl-sulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SOZ, serum-opsonized zymosan; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; γS-GTP, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus-1; fMLP, formyl Met-Leu-Phe; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; SRBC, sheep red blood cells. 1The abbreviations used are: CR, complement receptor; COZ, C3bi-opsonized zymosan; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; IOZ, IgG-opsonized zymosan; luminol, 5-amino-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-phtalazinedione; LY294002, 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MV, methylviologen; PA, phosphatidic acid; PD98059, 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; SB203580, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methyl-sulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole; SOD, superoxide dismutase; SOZ, serum-opsonized zymosan; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKC, protein kinase C; γS-GTP, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus-1; fMLP, formyl Met-Leu-Phe; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; SRBC, sheep red blood cells. which recognizes C3b/C3bi fragments. CR1 is thought to participate mainly in particle binding, whereas CR3 (also referred to as CD11b/CD18, Mac-1, and αMβ2) and CR4 (CD11c/CD18 and αXβ2), which are heterodimers of integrin, are responsible for internalizing particles (1Aderem A.

A third receptor involved in phagocytosis is the mannose receptor that recognizes mannose and fucose saccharides in the capsule or on the lipopolysaccharide of invading bacteria (1Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 3Brown E.J. BioEssay. 1995; 17: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 4Chimini G.

Cdc42/Rac regulates the macrophage phagocytosis mediated by FcγR, whereas Rho is thought to regulate that mediated by CR3 (5Caron E. Hall A.

Schreiber A. Zhang W. Grinstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).After phagocytosis in macrophages, there is an abrupt increase in superoxide formation, known as the oxidative burst, which is catalyzed by the membrane-associated NADPH oxidase enzyme complex, which generates superoxide (O2−) by the one-electron reduction of oxygen, using NADPH as electron donor (9Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The redox core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a membrane-spanning heterodimeric flavocytochrome b558 composed of p22PHOX and gp91PHOX. It is present in the membranes of secretory granules that fuse with the plasma membrane upon phagocytosis (10Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Katkin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14256-14260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other components, p40PHOX, p47PHOX, and p67PHOX form a cytoplasmic complex (11Wientjes F.B. Panayotou G. Reeves E. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). p47PHOX is phosphorylated by protein kinases (12Park J.W. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7474-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), primarily by protein kinase C (PKC) (13El Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When phagocytes are activated, the p40PHOX, p47PHOX, and p67PHOX complex translocates to the membrane, where it associates with cytochrome b558 to form the active NADPH oxidase (14Heyworth P.G.

Totty N. Teahan C.G. Segal A.W. Nature. 1991; 353: 668-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) or Rac2 (17Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are essential for activating NADPH oxidase. Rac2 is a critical regulator of NADPH oxidase in response to formyl methionylleucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (IgG-SRBC), whereas it is not responsible for superoxide formation induced by serum-opsonized zymosans (SOZ) (18Kim C. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the resting state, Rac is localized in the cytoplasm in a dimeric complex with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), and when the phagocyte is activated, GTP-bound Rac translocates to the membrane independently of the translocation of the p40PHOX, p47PHOX, and p67PHOX cytosolic complex (17Knaus U.G.

Rap1, another Ras-related GTPase, is rapidly and transiently activated upon stimulation by fMLP, platelet-activating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IgG-coated particles. Rap1 activation is, however, independent of the respiratory burst (20M'Rabet L. Coffer P. Zwartkruis F. Franke B. Segal A.W. Koenderman L. Bos J.L.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1223-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Superoxide production is also induced by interaction of CR3 with anti-CR3 antibody-coated particles (21Serrander L. Larsson J. Lundquist H. Lindmark M. Fallman M. Dahgren C. Stendahl O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), by Staphylococcus particles coated with anti-CD18 antibodies (22Lofgren R. Serrander L. Forsberg M. Wilsson A. Wasteson A. Stendahl O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 46-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and by non-opsonized zymosan (23Le Cabec V. Cols C. Maridonneau-Parini I. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 4736-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Rho is involved in the superoxide formation during these phagocytotic responses, and the aim of the present work was to investigate this question using the mouse macrophage cell line, J774 and primary phagocytic cells. To do this we exploited the observation that C3 exoenzyme modifies Rho by ADP-ribosylation and specifically inhibits its activity (24Aktories K. Braun U. Rosener S. Just I. Hall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, since C3 exoenzyme is not easily transduced into cells, we conjugate it with Tat penetratin, a domain of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The resulting Tat-C3 is readily transduced into cells and efficiently and specifically inhibits Rho. Using Tat-C3 we were able to demonstrate that Rho was involved in the formation of superoxide during phagocytosis by both the FcγR and CR3 pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Zymosan A particles, PD98059, SB203580, LY294002, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline (DMPC), 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), methylviologen (MV), Triton X-100, glutathione (GSH), fMLP, macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (MCSF-1), Y-27632, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin were purchased from Sigma Chemicals.

Park of Hallym University, Korea.Expression and Purification of the Tat-C3, -YCD, and -GFP—In order to introduce C3 exoenzyme efficiently into cells, we fused HIV-1 Tat transduction domain (amino acid residues 49-57, KKKRRQRRR) to the N terminus of the C3 exoenzyme containing a His tag (25Park J. Kim J.S. Jung K.C. Lee H.J. Kim J.I. Kim J. Lee J.Y. Park J.B. Choi S.Y. Mol. Cells. 2003; 16: 216-223PubMed Google Scholar). A similar Tat-C3 (amino acid residue 47-57) was used to test the function of Rho in smooth muscle cell proliferation (26Sauzeau V. Le Mellionec E. Bertoglio J. Scalbert E. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1102-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Cultures of Escherichia coli BL21 (Amersham Biosciences) transformed with plasmid C3 or plasmid Tat-C3 were incubated with 0.1 mm IPTG for 5 h. To prepare denatured Tat-C3 fusion proteins, the induced bacteria were harvested and sonicated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl) containing 6 m urea and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml PMSF). After removing cell debris by centrifugation, the clarified cell extract was loaded onto a Ni2+-IDA column (Novagen), and the column was washed first with binding buffer without 6 m urea, and then with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 80 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl). Proteins were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 m imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl), followed by desalting with a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Tat-YCD and -GFP were purified by the same procedure, and purified proteins were confirmed by Western blotting by using His tag antibody.Cell Culture and Transduction of Tat-C3 Fusion Protein—Mouse macrophage J774 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 20 mm Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 5 mm NaHCO3, 10% FBS, and antibiotics (100 units/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transduction of Tat-C3, the cells were grown to confluence in a 6-well plate, the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of serum-free medium, and the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Tat-C3 for 30 min at 37 °C.Peritoneal Macrophage Cell Culture—Male ICR mice (6 weeks) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center, Central Laboratory Management, Hallym University. Resident macrophages were collected from the peritoneal cavity of mice with DMEM medium, washed, suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and plated in 100-mm culture plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells/plate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the attached cells were washed three times with DMEM medium to remove non-adhering cells and grown for another 24 h. After three more washes, they were used in experiments.Human Neutrophil Preparation—Human neutrophils were obtained from freshly drawn blood of healthy volunteers. After dextran sedimentation, centrifugation through Ficoll-Paque and hypotonic lysis of red blood cells, neutrophils were washed, and the adherent neutrophils were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS as previously described with a slight modification (27Dewitt S. Hallett M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Preparation of FITC-Zymosan—Zymosan A particles were labeled with FITC without addition of gelatin, pelleted by centrifugation, washed more than seven times, and resuspended in PBS (5 × 108 zymosan particles/ml). Aliquots were stored at -70 °C and thawed immediately before use (28Gelfand J.A. Fauci A.S. Green I. Frank M.M. J. Immunol. 1976; 116: 595-599PubMed Google Scholar). Zymosan particles were opsonized with 1 μg/ml mouse serum (SOZ), C3bi (COZ), or IgG (IOZ) (29Allen L.A. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).Phagocytosis Assay and Binding of Zymosans to the Surface of Macrophages—Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells and grown overnight. After incubation in DMEM medium without FBS for 16 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator they were exposed for 30 min to 5 × 105 FITC-conjugated zymosan particles previously opsonized in fresh mouse serum, C3bi, or IgG, and washed and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. Phagocytosis was assayed by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the cells at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm (Kontron SFM25 spectrometer) (30Kim J.S. Kwon H.Y. Choi W.H. Jeon C.Y. Kim J.I. Kim J. Lee J.Y. Kim Y.S. Park J.B. Exp. Mol. Med. 2003; 35: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of FITC-zymosan bound to the surface of the cells was quenched by adding crystal violet to 10 μm final concentration. The surface-bound FITC-zymosan was calculated by subtracting net trans-located fluorescence from total fluorescence of the cells. Where fluorescent beads were employed, the tagged engulfed beads were observed by fluorescence microscopy.Determination of Superoxide—To measure intracellular superoxide, J774 cells (2 × 103) were harvested, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of KRG buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, 8.3 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, and 1 mm CaCl2) containing 50 units/ml SOD, 2000 units/ml catalase, and 50 μm luminol (31Dahlgren C. Karlsson A. J. Immunol. Med. 1999; 232: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by adding opsonized zymosan particles (2 × 104), and the chemiluminescence generated was measured with a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507, EG&G, Berthold, Germany). Prenylated recombinant RhoA was tested for ability to induce superoxide production in the cell-free NADPH oxidase system previously described (32Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).Preparation of Serum-opsonized IOZ Particle-bound Protein A-Agarose Beads (SO-IOZ-beads)—Protein A-agarose beads (10 μl) were washed and resuspended in 40 μl of IOZ particles in PBS (8 μg of particles). Binding of agarose beads and IOZ (or FITC-IOZ) were performed for 4 h at 4 °C with continuous rotation. The IOZ-bound beads were washed and opsonized with 1 μg/ml mouse serum. Finally, serum-opsonized IOZ-bound beads (SO-IOZ-beads) were washed several times with a brief centrifugation to remove unbound serum and zymosans, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS.Observation of Superoxide Produced by SO-IOZ-bead on a Confocal Microscope—Cells were preincubated in serum-free medium for 16 h at 37 °C, incubated with 10 μm DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and then incubated with serum- and phenol red-free medium. Cells were stimulated with SO-IOZ- or SO-FITC-IOZ-beads for 15 min in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml Tat-C3. Cells were washed with PBS followed by addition of serum- and phenol red-free medium. FITC or DCF fluorescence at an excitatory wavelength of 495 nm was observed on a confocal microscope system (Bio-Rad) (33Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 26: 1079-1088Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection with RhoA cDNA Constructs—90% confluent J774 cells in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3 plasmids encoding RhoA constructs (wild-type RhoA and the dominant-negative form, N19RhoA), or co-transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3 RhoA constructs and 5 μg of pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), using the GenePORTER2 transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). After 48 h, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of KRG buffer containing 50 units/ml SOD, 2000 units/ml catalase, and 50 μm luminol for measuring superoxide formation, or resuspended in 2 ml of PBS for phagocytosis assay. Phagocytosis and superoxide formation were started by adding opsonized zymosan particles.Observation of Actin Filaments—When appropriate, 103-104 cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml of Tat-C3 or 30 μm Y-27632 for 30 min, and subsequently stimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF or 100 nm fMLP for 10 min. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS (v/v). To visualize actin filaments, they were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS (v/v), blocked in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/PBS (w/v) for 45 min, and stained with 80 ng/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin in PBS for 1 h. Images were generated by confocal laser scanning microscopy as described previously (34Entwistle A. Noble M. J. Microsc. 1992; 165: 347-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 35Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Quantitation of Ruffling—Ruffling was defined by the presence of F-actin-rich submembranous folds seen by confocal microscopy. The extent of ruffling of each cell was scored using a scale of 0-2, where 0 indicates no ruffles, 1 indicates ruffling confined to one area of the cell (<25% of the cell circumference), and 2 indicates two or more discrete areas containing ruffles. The ruffling index is recorded as the sum of the ruffling scores of 100 cells (7Cox D. Chang P. Zhang Q. Reddy P.G. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).GST Pull-down Assay for Activated RhoA, Rac1, and Rac2—GST pull-downs assay was conducted as described previously (36Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Med. Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Azim A.C. Barkalow K.L. Hartwig J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 257-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of 2×106 cells cultured in 100-mm plates were washed in ice-cold PBS and harvested. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF). After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), aliquots of the supernatant were added to the GST-Rho binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-RBD) or the GST-GTPase binding domain of p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK-1) (GST-PBD), which was previously incubated for 1 h with 50 μg of GST fusion proteins. The beads were incubated with cell lysates and washed, and the proteins on the beads were run on SDS-PAGE. RhoA, Rac1, and Rac2 were determined by Western blotting. For the preparation of GST-RBD and -PBD proteins, RBD and PBD cDNAs produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were incorporated into pGEX4T-1, E. coli DH5α was transfected with plasmids, the expression of proteins was induced with IPTG, and the proteins were purified with GSH-Sepharose beads.Expression and Purification of GST-RhoA and -Rac1 Fusion Proteins and Measurement of GTP Binding by Fusion Proteins—To prepare GST-RhoA and -Rac1, E. coli DH5α was transformed with pGEX4T1-RhoA and -Rac1 plasmids, and GST-RhoA and -Rac1 proteins were purified from the bacteria with GSH-Sepharose beads. To measure the binding of GTP to the fusion proteins, 1 μg of GST-RhoA or -Rac1 was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 0.1 μm γ35S-GTP in 50 μl of GTP binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 μm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline) containing 30 μg of bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein. Assay of GTP binding to proteins was performed by the membrane filtering method with BA85 membrane (25 mm in diameter), according to Kikuchi et al. (38Kikuchi A. Yamashita T. Kawata M. Yamamoto K. Ikeda K. Tanimoto T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2897-2904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification (39Park J.B. Kim J.S. Lee J.Y. Kim J. Seo J.Y. Kim A.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Translocation of RhoA and Rac1 Proteins—J774 macrophages (2 × 105 cells) were treated with various agents for 30 min at 37 °C and stimulated with SOZ and IOZ for 10 min. They were then harvested and lysed by sonication in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO4,20mm Na4P2O7,50 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.05% Triton-X 100) (40Hippenstiel S. Kratz T. Krll M. Seybold J. Eichel-Streiber C. Suttorp N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 830-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cell membranes were collected with a tabletop ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min and 4 °C and resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer. Western blotting with anti-RhoA and Rac-1 antibodies was employed to measure the translocation of RhoA and Rac1.Expression and Purification of GST-p47PHOX, and Phosphorylation Assay of Recombinant GST-p47PHOX Fusion Protein—Recombinant GST-p47PHOX fusion protein was prepared for use as a kinase substrate by the procedure of Park et al. (41Park J.W. El Benna J. Scott K.E. Christensen B.L. Chanock S.J. Babior B.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Kinase assays of the recombinant GST-p47PHOX fusion protein were performed by the method of Yamamori et al. (42Yamamori T. Inanami O. Nagahata H. Cui Y.D. Kuwabara M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages (2 × 106) stimulated with SOZ or IOZ for 15 min were washed and lysed in cold lysis buffer. The GST-p47PHOX protein was bound to GSH-Sepharose beads and incubated with aliquots of cell lysates. The beads were washed, resuspended, and incubated in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm l-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated GST-p47PHOX was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography.Purification of Prenylated RhoA and Rac2 from Sf-9 Cells—To purify prenylated RhoA and Rac2, we used the method described by Diebold and Bokoch (32Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA, encoding RhoA or Rac2, was ligated to the baculovirus transfer vector pAcGLT (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Purified pAcGLT plasmid carrying the GST-RhoA or GST-Rac2 fusion constructs were used for homologous recombination with BaculoGold baculovirus, and Sf9 cells were infected with the baculovirus encoding RhoA or Rac2. GST-RhoA and -Rac2 were purified from Sf9 cell extracts with GSH-Sepharose, followed by cleavage with thrombin.RESULTSTransduction of Tat-C3 into Cells—In an attempt to establish whether Rho is involved in phagocytosis and superoxide formation in macrophages, J774 cells were treated with Tat-C3, which is readily transduced into cells and inhibits Rho. Tat-C3 and -YCD were efficiently transduced into J774 cells (Fig. 1A). Tat-GFP also entered the cells and displayed fluorescence (Fig. 1, B and C). The introduction of Tat-C3 led to an alteration of electrophoretic mobility of RhoA on SDS-PAGE indicating that Tat-C3 modified the RhoA, possibly generating ADP-ribosylated RhoA. No such effect was observed with C3 exoenzyme or Tat-YCD and -GFP. The Tat fusion proteins were also transduced into peritoneal macrophages of mouse (Fig. 1B), and Tat-C3 again induced a mobility shift of RhoA on SDS-PAGE. Tat-C3, -YCD, and -GFP were present at higher densities on cellular membranes than in the cytosol. Much of each protein was dissociated from the membranes in the presence of 1 m NaCl, which blocks the nonspecific ionic interaction between the Tat-proteins and membranes; thereafter, the Tat-proteins remained inside the cells (Fig. 1C).Tat-C3 Inhibits Superoxide Formation Induced by SOZ—To elucidate whether Rho is involved in the induction of superoxide formation, we examined the effect of Tat-C3 on superoxide formation induced by SOZ. C3b in serum rapidly attaches to zymosans, and about 80% of it is converted to C3bi when the zymosans are opsonized"
https://openalex.org/W1985782571,"The β and γ subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (Gβγ) were found to bi-directionally regulate the UV-induced activation of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and the UV-induced activation of p38 was reported to enhance the resistance of normal keratinocytes to apoptosis. However, the signaling pathway downstream of Gβγ for this UV-induced p38 activation is not known. Thus, we examined the role of the Rho GTPase family in the regulation of UV-induced p38 activation by Gβγ. We found that overexpression of Gβγ increased the UV-induced activation of Cdc42 and that overexpression of constitutively active V12 Cdc42 increased the UV-induced p38 activation. Transfection of dominant negative N17 Cdc42 or small interfering RNA for Cdc42 blocked UV-induced p38 activation mediated by Gβγ in COS-1 and HaCaT cells. UV-induced p38 activation by Gβγ was blocked by overexpression of dominant negative p21-activated kinase (PAK)-interacting exchange factor β (βPix), and wild type βPix stimulated the UV-induced p38 activation, which was blocked by N17 Cdc42. Gβγ increased the UV-induced activation of Ras, and the overexpression of V12 Ras increased UV-induced p38 activation, which was blocked by dominant negative βPix. UV-induced p38 activation was inhibited by N17 Ras and a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, manumycin A. Gβγ also increased the UV-induced phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the UV-induced p38 activation was blocked by an EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478. From these results, we conclude that Gβγ mediates UV-induced activation of p38 in a Cdc42-dependent way and that EGFR, Ras, and βPix act sequentially upstream of Cdc42 in COS-1 and HaCaT cells.

The heterotrimeric GTP-binding regulatory proteins, known as G proteins, are composed of α, β, and γ subunits and transduce extracellular signals into intracellular signals by coupling the receptors and effectors (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). When a signaling molecule such as a hormone, a neurotransmitter, or a prostanoid binds to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein coupled receptor; βARKct, carboxyl-terminal region of β-adrenergic receptor kinase; βPix, PAK-interacting exchange factor β; DHm, dominant negative mutant of βPix; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PAK, p21-activated kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. the receptor undergoes a conformational change (2Wess J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Such a conformational change in a receptor leads to the activation of G protein by stimulating the replacement of the GDP with GTP on the α subunit of G protein (Gα), which induces the dissociation of Gα-GTP from its βγ dimer of G protein (Gβγ) (3Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Both the dissociated Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits elicit cellular responses by regulating numerous effectors, which include adenylate cyclases, phospholipases, phosphodiesterases, protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and ion channels (4Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 5Gutkind J.S. Science's STKE. 2000; http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/40/re1PubMed Google Scholar). The G protein signaling is terminated by the hydrolysis of GTP on the Gα subunit into GDP by intrinsic GTPase, which results in the formation of a heterotrimeric inactive structure composed of GDP-bound Gα and Gβγ. Various molecules belonging to regulators of the G protein-signaling (RGS) family control the activity of intrinsic GTPase (6Zheng B. De Vries L. Gist Farquhar M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). UV irradiation induces various cellular responses, which are believed to result from the activation of diverse cellular signal transduction systems. One of the signal transduction systems activated by UV is the MAPK family, which is composed of at least four families that include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and ERK5/BMK1. The MAPK family regulates various cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which are activated by a variety of extracellular signals like growth factors, GPCR agonists, and cellular stress such as UV irradiation, hydrogen peroxide, and protein synthesis inhibitors (7Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 8Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). MAPK is phosphorylated by MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which is phosphorylated and activated by MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). This activation cascade of the MAPK family is well conserved evolutionarily (9Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 82-89Google Scholar). However, there is as much diversity in the regulatory molecules upstream of MAPKKK as there is among regulatory signals (10Hagemann C. Blank J.L. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A variety of signaling molecules have been reported that mediate the UV-induced MAPK activation in mammalian cells, such as the growth factor receptors that are activated ligand-independently (11Sachsenmaier C.

Bos J.L. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar), as well as protein tyrosine phosphatase (13Gross S. Knebel A. Tenev T. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26378-26386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and Ras (14Engelberg D. Klein C. Martinetto H. Struhl K. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 77: 381-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The mammalian Rho family is a member of the Ras-related small GTPases and encompasses six classes, namely Rho, Rac, Cdc42, Rnd, RhoD, and TTF (15Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The GTP-bound Rho proteins activate specific effectors, including serine/threonine kinases such as Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) and p21-activated kinase (PAK), and function as the key components in cellular processes that control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, activate kinase cascades, regulate gene expression, regulate membrane trafficking, promote growth transformation, and induce apoptosis (16Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been reported to regulate JNK and the p38 MAP kinase cascades (17Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar) and thereby regulate gene transcription in a more direct way than via their effects on adhesion complexes (20Wery-Zennaro S. Zugaza J.L. Letourneur M. Bertoglio J. Pierre J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs have the potential to regulate Rho family members by altering their abilities to associate with their regulatory proteins. Several studies indicate that GPCRs, which functionally couple to the heterotrimeric G proteins Gq, G12, and G13, can activate Rho family members (21Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These receptors respond to important physiological agonists, including neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and chemokines. The potential ability of these receptors to activate Rho family members indicates that many of the physiological responses mediated by these receptors may involve the activation of Rho family members. In a previous experiment, the G protein βγ subunit was found to bi-directionally regulate the UV-induced activations of p38 and JNK (22Seo M. Lee Y.I. Cho C.H. Bae C.D. Kim I.H. Juhnn Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24197-24203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that G proteins might mediate the MAPK activation stimulated by stresses like UV and by GPCR agonists. Such activation of p38 was found to enhance the resistance of normal human keratinocytes to apoptosis (23Chouinard N. Valerie K. Rouabhia M. Huot J. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the signaling pathway downstream of Gβγ for the UV-induced activation of p38 is unknown. Because Rho family proteins play a role upstream of the p38 MAPK cascade, Rho family proteins are suggested as playing important roles in the activation of JNK and p38 induced by UV. However, it is not clear which Rho family protein is involved in the activation of p38 induced by stresses such as UV. Therefore, we undertook this study to determine which Rho protein is involved in the UV-induced activation of p38 mediated by Gβγ and which signaling molecules act upstream of Rho proteins. It was found that Gβγ mediates UV-induced activation of p38 in a Cdc42-dependant way and that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ras, and the PAK-interacting exchange factor β (βPix) act sequentially upstream of Cdc42 in COS-1 and HaCaT cells. Expression Plasmids—The expression plasmids for the β1 and γ2 isoforms of the G protein were subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogen) as described previously (22Seo M. Lee Y.I. Cho C.H. Bae C.D. Kim I.H. Juhnn Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24197-24203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of PAK-interacting exchange factor β (βPix), βPix DHm (L238R,L239S), was constructed by replacing leucine 238 and leucine 239 with arginine and serine, respectively, in the Dbl-homology domain to remove the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1 in vivo (24Lee S.H. Eom M. Lee S.J. Kim S. Park H.J. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25066-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of Ras (V12 Ras and N17 Ras), Cdc42 (V12 Cdc42 and N17 Cdc42), and Rac1 (V12 Rac1 and N17 Rac1) were kindly provided by Dr. Chang-Dae Bae (Sungkyunkwan University, Korea). The FLAG-tagged wild type of p38 was gift form Dr. Dongeun Park (Seoul National University). The cDNA coding for the Ras binding domain of c-Raf1 (amino acids 1–149) fused to glutathione S-transferase and the Cdc42 and Rac binding domain of PAK (amino acids 67–150) fused to glutathione S-transferase were generously supplied by Dr. Walter Kolch (University of Glasgow, UK) and Dr. Jung-Won Lee (Seoul National University, Cancer Research Institute), respectively. Cell Cultures and Transfections—African green monkey kidney cells, COS-1 (American Type Culture Collection), and HaCaT human keratinocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The COS-1 cells were split in 10-cm dishes 1 day prior to transfection, and the subconfluent cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of Gβ1 and Gγ2 cDNA, together with additional DNA when necessary, using the DEAE-dextran method (25Aruffo A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons Inc, New York1991: 16.13.11-16.13.17Google Scholar). The control cells were transfected with reagents without DNA or with the vector DNA without the insert. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were re-plated in new dishes, and, 48 h later, the transfected COS-1 cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and irradiated with UVC (254 nm, 100 J/m2). The UV-irradiated cells were harvested after incubation for a further 40 min. The HaCaT cells were trypsinized and suspended in 400 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA or small interfereing RNA (siRNA) were added to cells. After the mixture was transferred to a 4-mm gap electroporation cuvette, electroporation was done using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) at 200 V with 1.5 msec of pulse length and 1.5 s of pulse interval. Then the cells were diluted in growth medium and seeded onto culture plates. The cells were irradiated with UV 48 h after transfection. Double-stranded RNA-mediated Interference—A double-stranded siRNA with 19-nucleotide duplex RNA and 2-nucleotide 3′ dTdT overhangs (sense, 5′-CUAUGCAGUCACAGUUAUGdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-CAUAACUGUGACUGCAUAGdTdT-3′) targeting the sequence at the positions 115–135 relative to the start code (5′-AACTATGCATGCACAGTTATG-3′) of human Cdc42 was designed and purchased from Dharmacon Inc. The siRNA for luciferase GL2 (targeting sequence 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′) was used as a negative control. The siRNA was transfected by using electroporation method, and experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Immunoblot Analysis—UV-irradiated cells were harvested with a cell scraper in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1% Triton X-100. The cells were lysed by incubating the suspension on ice for 30 min. The protein concentration of the lysate was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method. Fifty micrograms of the lysate protein was boiled in Laemmli buffer, separated on a 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, and then incubated in a cold room overnight with a specific antibody. The antibody against Gβ (SW) was prepared as described previously (22Seo M. Lee Y.I. Cho C.H. Bae C.D. Kim I.H. Juhnn Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24197-24203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), antibodies against p38 and EGFR were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, antibodies against phosphorylated p38 (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr1068), and Myc were from Cell Signaling Technology, antibodies against Cdc42 and Rac1 were from Signal Transduction, the FLAG antibody was from Sigma, and the Ras antibody came from Upstate Biotechnology. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently washed with TTBS and incubated with a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1: 2000 dilution, Pierce) for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed with TTBS and incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate mixture (Pierce). The blot was then exposed on x-ray film (AGFA Curix RPI) to obtain an image. The density of the visualized band was quantified using an image analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, model GS-700), and the relative band density was expressed as a multiple of the band density in the UV-irradiated vector-transfected cells. Assay of p38 Activity—The activity of p38 was measured by Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation of either endogenous p38 or transfected FLAG-tagged p38 using a phosphorylated p38 specific antibody. For analysis of FLAG-tagged p38 phosphorylation, UV-irradiated cells were lysed in the lysis buffer, and then 500 μg of cell extract was incubated with 5 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in a cold room overnight and then with protein G-Sepharose-conjugated beads (Pierce) for 2 h. The immune complex was collected by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer. The proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-phospho-p38 and anti-FLAG antibodies. Assay of Ras, Rac1, and Cdc42 activity—Ras activity was assayed by analyzing the binding of the activated Ras to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 (26de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the endogenous Ras was activated by UV irradiation, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The cell lysate (200 μg) was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose coupled to the peptides corresponding to the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were precipitated by centrifugation and washed three times with the lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted in a Laemmli sample treatment buffer, heated for 5 min, and then separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblot analysis was performed using an anti-Ras antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The activities of Cdc42 and Rac1 were assayed by analyzing the binding of the activated proteins to the Cdc42 and Rac binding domain of PAK (amino acid residues 67–150) fused to glutathione S-transferase. Bound Cdc42 and Rac1 were detected by Western blotting using an anti-Cdc42 and a Rac1 antibody, respectively (27Benard V. Bokoch G.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—At least three independent experiments were conducted. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze the averaged values, and a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study aimed to determine which Rho family protein is involved in the UV-induced activation of p38 mediated by Gβγ and which signaling molecules act upstream of Rho proteins. The main finding of this study was that Cdc42, and not Rac1, is required in the UV-induced activation of p38 mediated by Gβγ in COS-1 and HaCaT cells and that EGFR, Ras, and βPix act sequentially upstream of Cdc42. Cdc42, Not Rac1, Is Involved in the UV-induced Activation of p38 Mediated by Gβγ —The G protein βγ subunit was found to mediate the UV-induced activation of p38 in a previous study (22Seo M. Lee Y.I. Cho C.H. Bae C.D. Kim I.H. Juhnn Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24197-24203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but the signaling pathways connecting Gβγ and p38 activation were not elucidated. Rho family proteins are involved in the activation of p38 by various stimuli, including cellular stresses; however, it is not clear whether the Rho protein is involved in the UV-induced activation of p38 mediated by Gβγ. Consequently, this study was undertaken to study the role of Rho proteins in the UV-induced activation of p38 mediated by Gβγ, and, thus, the effect of the overexpression of mutant Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA on the UV-induced activation of p38 was examined. The overexpression of the constitutively active V12 Cdc42 increased UV-induced p38 activation to a level comparable with that achieved by Gβγ overexpression, which was about twice that of the vector-transfected control. The co-expression of V12 Cdc42 and Gβγ slightly augmented the UV-induced p38 activation caused by the expression of either V12 Cdc42 or Gβγ alone, but without statistical significance (Fig. 1A). Expression of V12 Cdc42 alone without UV stimulation increased p38 activity to ∼40% of that achieved by UV stimulation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the overexpression of dominant negative N17 Cdc42 almost completely blocked the increase in the UV-induced p38 activation caused by Gβγ overexpression (Fig. 1A). Because the average transfection efficiency of DEAE-dextran method was ∼30%, the UV-induced phosphorylation of the co-transfected FLAG-tagged p38 was analyzed to control the transfection efficiency. The overexpression of N17 Cdc42 decreased UV-induced p38 activation to 21% of the control in the absence of Gβγ overexpression when the phosphorylation of co-transfected FLAG-tagged p38 was analyzed (Fig. 1C). In addition, the transfection of siRNA for Cdc42 reduced UV-induced p38 activation to 30% in the presence of Gβγ overexpression and 41% in the absence of Gβγ overexpression. Transfection of siRNA for luciferase GL2, an unrelated siRNA, did not change the UV-induced p38 activity (Fig. 1D). All of these results demonstrate that Cdc42 is involved in the UV-induced p38 activation mediated by Gβγ and that Gβγ mediates the UV-induced p38 activation via a Cdc42-dependent pathway. This is the first report, to our knowledge, which shows that Cdc42 is involved in UV-induced p38 activation, although Rac1 has been reported to mediate UV-induced p38 activation, resulting in the apoptosis of Rat-2 fibroblasts (28Eom Y.W. Yoo M.H. Woo C.H. Hwang K.C. Song W.K. Yoo Y.J. Chun J.S. Kim J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the overexpression of constitutively active V12 Rac1 increased the UV-induced p38 activation to a level comparable with that achieved by Gβγ overexpression. It also further and significantly increased the p38 activity caused by Gβγ overexpression from 3.1 to 4.6 times that of the control (p = 0.003), displaying an additive relation between V12 Rac1 and Gβγ in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2A). The expression of V12 Rac1 alone without UV stimulation increased p38 activity to ∼35% of that achieved by UV-stimulation (Fig. 2B). The overexpression of dominant negative N17 Rac1 reduced the UV-induced p38 activation to 69% of the vector-transfected control in the absence of Gβγ overexpression in an analysis of FLAG-tagged p38 phosphorylation in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2C). However, the simultaneous overexpression of N17 Cdc42 and N17 Rac1 blocked UV-induced p38 activation almost completely (Fig 2A). This result indicates that Rac1 might mediate the UV-induced activation of p38 in a Gβγ-independent way and suggests that Rac1 and Gβγ/Cdc42 might mediate UV-induced p38 activation through independent and separate pathways. The overexpression of the constitutively active or dominant negative mutant of RhoA protein did not induce significant changes in UV-induced p38 activation in the absence or in the presence of Gβγ overexpression in COS-1 cells (data not shown). To assess the respective roles of Cdc42 and Rac1 in UV-induced p38 activation, the time courses of their activations and the effects of Gβγ overexpression on their activations were analyzed by measuring their binding to the Cdc42/Rac binding domain of PAK. p38 activity started to increase 2 min after UV irradiation and then continued to increase to reach a peak at 40 min. However, Cdc42 activity started to increase at 5 min and continued to increase until 40 min after UV irradiation (Fig. 3A). The overexpression of Gβγ resulted in a 2.8-fold increase in Cdc42 activity 40 min after UV irradiation, which was blocked by the overexpression of Gβγ-sequestering βARKct (carboxyl-terminal region of β-adrenergic receptor kinase) (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, Rac1 showed peak activity at 2 min after UV irradiation and then decreased to remain slightly above the basal level after 10 min (Fig. 3A). The overexpression of Gβγ and βARK did not significantly change Rac1 activity 2 min after UV irradiation (Fig. 3B). However, the UV-induced activation of p38 at 2 min was blocked almost completely by N17 Rac1 overexpression, but not by N17 Cdc42 (data not shown). This finding indicates that Rac1 might induce p38 activation immediately after UV irradiation in a Gβγ-independent manner, but Cdc42 might mediate the delayed and sustained p38 activation induced by UV irradiation in a Gβγ-dependent manner in COS-1 cells. This suggests that UV immediately activates p38 via Rac1 and then sustains p38 activity via Cdc42 and Rac1. It also implies that Gβγ stimulates the delayed and sustained UV-induced p38 activation through Cdc42 but that it is not involved in the UV-induced p38 immediate activation mediated by Rac1. Thus, it is speculated from these findings that UV irradiation activates G proteins by unknown mechanisms and that the activated Gβγ induces the prolonged activation of p38 via Cdc42 to induce cellular responses. However, further study is needed to determine whether p38 activation mediated by Cdc42 or Rac1 might play different roles in inducing cellular responses. It has been reported that Gβγ activates MKK3 in a Rac- and Cdc42-dependent manner and activates MKK6 in a Rho-, Rac-, and Cdc42-dependent manner (29Yamauchi J. Tsujimoto G. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23362-23372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cdc42 was shown to activate both the p38 and JNK pathways, and Rac1 was shown to activate p38 (17Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, Gβγ was found to activate Cdc42 but not Rac1 in UV-induced p38 activation. A similar differential regulation of Cdc42 and Rac was found during FcR-mediated phagocytosis, where Vav was found to specifically regulate Rac activation, but not Cdc42 activation, and both Cdc42 and Rac were activated at the FcR-dependent phagosomes through distinct pathways (30Patel J.C. Hall A. Caron E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1215-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of such specificity for activation of the Rho family proteins is unclear, but we speculated that it might reflect the difference in cell types and stimulating signals. βPix Acts Upstream of Cdc42 in the UV-induced Activation of p38 Mediated by Gβγ —To find the signaling molecules acting upstream of Cdc42 in the UV-induced p38 activation mediated by Gβγ, the involvement of βPix was examined. βPix is a recently identified guanine nucleotide exchange factor family for the Rho G proteins, Cdc42 and Rac, and it was reported to play an essential role in growth factor-stimulated p38 activation (24Lee S.H. Eom M. Lee S.J. Kim S. Park H.J. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25066-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether βPix is involved in stress-induced p38 activation, and, thus, the effect of the overexpression of the wild type and dominant negative βPix on UV-induced p38 activation was analyzed. Overexpression of the wild type βPix increased the UV-induced p38 activation by approximately twice that of the vector-transfected control. However, this did not result in a further augmentation of the UV-induced p38 activation caused by Gβγ overexpression (Fig. 4A). The overexpression of wild type βPix alone also increased the p38 activity to 40% of that achieved by UV-stimulation (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the dominant negative mutant, βPix DHm, blocked most of the increased UV-induced p38 activity that resulted from the overexpression of Gβ1γ2 (Fig. 4A), and overexpression of βPix DHm blocked p38 activation to 31% of that of the vector-transfected control in a FLAG-tagged p38 phosphorylation assay (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that βPix is involved in the signaling pathway of the UV-induced p38 activation mediated by both exogenous and endogenous Gβγ in COS-1 cells and that Gβγ mediates the UV-induced p38 activation in a βPix-dependent manner. To determine whether βPix acts upstream of Cdc42 alone and not upstream of Rac1 in the UV-induced p3"

We previously showed that the Brn-3b transcription factor is highly expressed in actively proliferating neuroblastoma cells but is significantly decreased when these cells are induced to differentiate. In this study, we analyzed the effects of manipulating Brn-3b levels in the human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32 and showed that constitutive overexpression of Brn-3b consistently increased cellular growth and proliferation in monolayer as well as in an anchorage-independent manner compared with controls whereas stably decreasing Brn-3b can reduce the rate of growth of these cells. Cells with high Brn-3b also fail to respond to growth inhibitory retinoic acid, as they continue to proliferate. Moreover, Brn-3b levels significantly modified tumor growth in vivo with elevated Brn-3b resulting in faster tumor growth in xenograft models whereas decreasing Brn-3b resulted in slower growth compared with controls. Interestingly, elevated Brn-3b levels also enhances the invasive capacity of these neuroblastoma cells with significantly larger numbers of migrating cells observed in overexpressing clones compared with controls. Because invasion and metastasis influence morbidity and mortality in neuroblastoma and so significantly affect the course and outcome of neuroblastomas, this finding is very important. Our results therefore suggest that Brn-3b transcription factor contributes to proliferation of neuroblastoma cells in vivo and in vitro but may also influence progression and/or invasion during tumorigenesis. It is possible that decreasing Brn-3b levels may reverse some effects on growth and proliferation of these cells.

Neuroblastoma is predominantly a childhood malignancy, which arises from neural crest derived cells of the adrenal medulla or sympathetic neuronal lineage. It is the second most common solid childhood cancer with an annual incidence of 8 per million children (1Castleberry R.P. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 1430-1437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma tumors show remarkable clinical heterogeneity, depending on factors such as the age of onset, primary site of origin, and metastatic burden (2Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 3Maris J.M. Matthay K.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2264-2279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neuroblastoma tumors arising in children over the age of 1 year are typically aggressive, with ∼75% of patients presenting with disseminated metastases (stage 4). These tumors are often chemo-resistant and associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rates. In contrast, tumors in infants of less than 1 year, present with lower stage disease (stages 1, 2, and 4s) that are chemosensitive and often associated with good prognosis (4Brodeur G.M. Pritchard J.

Moreover, many of these tumors can spontaneously regress but the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet understood (2Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar, 5Evans A.E. Gerson J. Schnaufer L. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1976; 44: 49-54PubMed Google Scholar). The causes of neuroblastoma and factors that influence the progression of the disease are not fully understood. Whereas a number of genetic abnormalities that have diagnostic and prognostic value, have been identified, the underlying genetic changes that contribute to the development and/or progression of this disease are poorly defined. Thus, recurrent chromosomal abnormalities such as unbalanced translocations and gain of genetic material (17q22) or chromosomal loss (1p36, 11q23, and 14q23) have been consistently reported and are often associated with poor prognosis and adverse outcome (6Christiansen H. Lampert F. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition some genes with modified expression have been identified. For instance, amplification of MYC-N proto-oncogene occurs in 20-25% of neuroblastomas and is a reliable marker of aggressive clinical behavior (7Katzenstein H.M. Bowman L.C. Brodeur G.M. Thorner P.S. Joshi V.V. Smith E.I. Look A.T. Rowe S.T. Nash M.B. Holbrook T. Alvarado C. Rao P.V. Castleberry R.P. Cohn S.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2007-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Bown N. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 54: 897-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In contrast, elevated expression of the neurotrophin receptors, Trk A, has also been shown in some neuroblastoma tumors but is associated with low grade tumors and favorable outcome (9Nakagawara A. Arima-Nakagawara M. Scavarda N.J. Azar C.G. Cantor A.B. Brodeur G.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Therefore it is important to identify genes that are aberrantly expressed in these tumors and which may contribute to the initiation of these neuroblastoma tumors. Moreover, invasion and metastatic growth from the primary tumor will significantly influence the course of this disease but factors that influence tumor progression are poorly defined. We have been studying the expression and role of the Brn-3 family of transcription factors during development and in disease. Brn-3b and the related Brn-3a factors were originally isolated from a sensory neuron: neuroblastoma hybrid cell line, ND7 and brain, respectively (10He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 11Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These proteins belong to the POU (named after the original members Pit-1, Oct-1/2, and Unc-86) family of transcriptional regulators (12Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Finney M. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In studies undertaken in the ND7 cell line, we showed that these Brn-3 proteins are critically associated with distinct cellular status with Brn-3b being highly expressed in actively proliferating cells (11Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1382-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) whereas Brn-3a is associated with survival and differentiation (14Latchman D.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1153-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Smith M.D. Morris P.J. Dawson S.J. Schwartz M.L. Schlaepfer W.W. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21325-21333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus these cells can be maintained in a proliferative state when grown in full growth medium (FGM) containing 10% serum and in this state, cells express high levels of Brn-3b but low Brn-3a (11Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, transfer of these cells into serum-free medium causes them to cease proliferation, withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo differentiation with neurite outgrowth and biochemical properties of differentiated sensory neurons. Interestingly, under these conditions, Brn-3b levels decrease significantly with a concomitant increase in Brn-3a levels (11Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This differential expression was also observed in the human neuroblastoma cell lines, IMR-32 and SH-SY-5Y (15Smith M.D. Morris P.J. Dawson S.J. Schwartz M.L. Schlaepfer W.W. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21325-21333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggesting that these two proteins are associated with different growth states in neuroblastoma cells. This association of Brn-3b with cellular proliferation is strengthened by its elevated expression in a significant number of breast cancer samples compared with levels in normal tissue (17Budhram-Mahadeo V. Ndisang D. Ward T. Weber B.L. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that modifying Brn-3b can alter the growth of breast cancer cell lines, in vitro (18Dennis J.H. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of Brn-3b resulting from alternative promoter usage have been identified (19Theil T. Rodel B. Spiegelhalter F. Moroy T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30958-30964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A domain at the N terminus, which is encoded by exon 1 is present in the longer 43 kDa protein, Brn-3b(l) but is absent in the shorter 35 kDa protein, Brn-3b(s). Interestingly, the shorter isoform of this protein appears to be more highly expressed in many breast cancers (17Budhram-Mahadeo V. Ndisang D. Ward T. Weber B.L. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mechanism by which Brn-3 family of proteins mediate their effects has led to the identification of a number of target genes whose promoters are regulated by these transcription factors. Thus, Brn-3a can activate the expression of neuronal specific targets such as α-internexin (20Budhram-Mahadeo V. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y. Lillycrop K.A. Moroy T. Liem R.K.

Kilimann M.W. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 43: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) whereas Brn-3b(s) represses and/or antagonizes the effects of Brn-3a on these gene promoters. In contrast, the proliferative effects of Brn-3b(s) in breast epithelial cells appears to be associated with its ability to suppress the expression of the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA1 (17Budhram-Mahadeo V. Ndisang D. Ward T. Weber B.L. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as its ability to functionally interact with and enhance the effect of the proliferation associated estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RA, retinoic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RA, retinoic acid. in breast cancer cells (23Budhram-Mahadeo V. Parker M. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1029-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas this transcription factor is clearly associated with increased proliferation in these cells, its mode of action is likely to be quite complex. We have detected Brn-3b expression in neuroblastoma tumor samples 2S. Irshad and V. Budhram-Mahadeo, unpublished results. 2S. Irshad and V. Budhram-Mahadeo, unpublished results. and more recently we have shown its expression in neuronal progenitor cells derived from primary cultures of trunk neural crest cells, 3C. Hudson and V. Budhram-Mahadeo, unpublished results. 3C. Hudson and V. Budhram-Mahadeo, unpublished results. which gave rise to neuroblasts from which neuroblastoma tumors may arise. These results together with our findings, which showed that Brn-3b(s) is expressed at high levels in proliferating neuroblastoma cell lines, led us to investigate the effects of manipulating its expression in neuroblastoma cells. Here we report the significant changes in proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo as well as changes in invasive potential that are associated with constitutively elevating or decreasing Brn-3b protein expression in the human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32. The eukaryotic expression vector pLTR, contained the MoMuLV promoter driving expression of either cDNA encoding either Brn-3b(s) (Brn-3b expression vector) (18Dennis J.H. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or 300 bases of Brn-3b cDNA in the antisense orientation (common to both Brn-3b(s) and Brn-3b(l) (Brn-3b antisense)) (18Dennis J.H. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). pCI neo plasmid was obtained from Promega™ Ltd. The human neuroblastoma cells, IMR-32, were maintained in FGM (10% (v/v) fetal calf serum; 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids; 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic). For generation of stable cell lines, proliferating IMR-32 cells were plated onto 10-cm tissue culture Petri dishes (NUNC, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) at a density of 1 × 105 and left overnight. These were then transfected with either the expression vector containing the cDNA encoding Brn-3b(s) or expressing the first 300 bases of Brn-3b in an antisense orientation, which should prevent the expression of mRNA's encoding either isoform of Brn-3b. The empty expression vector, pLTR was also transfected to provide a control for all subsequent studies undertaken with these manipulated cell lines. To allow for selection of transfected clones, the pCi Neo plasmid, which conferred resistance to the antibiotic, neomycin (G418), was included in all transfections but at a 5-fold reduced concentration compared with the expression constructs. Transfection was carried out using the Lipofectin/peptide (containing an integrin-targeting domain) complex (kind gift from Dr. S. Hart) (24Hart S.L. Arancibia-Carcamo C.V. Wolfert M.A. Mailhos C. O'Reilly N.J. Ali R.R. Coutelle C. George A.J. Harbottle R.P. Knight A.M. Larkin D.F. Levinsky R.J. Seymour L.W. Thrasher A.J. Kinnon C. Hum.

Following transfection, cells were maintained in the FGM but with the neomycin (G418) added to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml for selection. Twenty G418-resistant clones were selected from each transfection (overexpressing, antisense, or empty LTR vector control) and grown up for characterization and further analysis. Subsequently, all selected clones were grown in medium containing 2 mg/ml G418. Analysis of Clones for Different Levels of Brn-3b—Total cellular proteins were prepared by harvesting cells into Laemmli buffer and addition of 5% β-mercaptoethanol or 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min then cell debris removed by centrifugation. 50-100 μg of each protein sample were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 15% PAGE gel at a constant voltage of 150 V. Resolved proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue dye to visualize the integrity of proteins and estimate for variation in protein concentration between different samples or transferred onto Hybond C membrane using a wet-transfer method as described by Maniatis et al. (26Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F., and Sambrook, J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 18.47-18.66, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Filters were incubated with either anti-Brn-3b antibody (rabbit polyclonal, BabCo) at a dilution of 1:1500, or anti-actin antibody (goat polyclonal Ab (I 19), Calbiochem) diluted to 1:1500. Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit and anti-goat) were obtained from DAKO and used at dilutions of 1:3000 or 1:2000). Signals were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence systems (Amersham Biosciences PLC or Pierce). Cellular Growth Curve Studies—To measure changes in growth characteristics and proliferative index of the neuroblastoma cell lines with different levels of Brn-3b, we analyzed for differences in rate of growth and doubling times as reflected by changes in total cell numbers over time. For these studies, each of the selected stable cell lines with different levels of Brn-3b was grown to 80% confluence, trypsinized, and then plated into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well. Triplicate wells were plated for each time point, which was taken at 48 h interval for up to 25 days. Once growing, the medium was changed every 3 days. Cell numbers were counted for each time point, and the results of counts from three independent experiments were used to plot the growth curve with standard error. Saturation Density Limitation Growth Curve—To ensure that the differences in growth rate of each cell line reflected variation in the proliferative rate and was not influenced by depletion of the medium, we carried out a saturation density limitation growth study. For this study, 5 × 103 cells were plated in 24-well plates containing a 13-mm coverslip in each well. After 24 h, the cover slips were transferred to 6-well plates containing 4 ml of full growth medium. The medium was changed every 48 h to ensure maximal growth conditions. After 5 days, cells were harvested and counted. This was carried out at 48-h intervals for 10 days. Tritiated Thymidine Incorporation Proliferation Studies—To ensure that changes in cell numbers were a result of changes in proliferation rather than reduced death, a measure of [3H]thymidine incorporated in actively proliferating cells was measured. Thus each cell line was plated in replicas of 6/experiments in 96-well plates using 1 × 103 cells per well. Cells were grown in the normal growth medium containing G418 for 24 h then pulsed with 1 μl of 50 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (400Ci/mm, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Cells were then trypsinized, harvested, and placed onto glass filters, washed using a Tomtec cell harvester and then treated with scintillant. Counts were measured using a Nuclear Enterprises NE10600 scintillation counter. For analysis of proliferation following treatment with retinoic acid, cells were plated at 1 × 102 cells/well and grown for 48 h in medium containing 10 μm RA. Tritiated thymidine was added for 1 h before harvesting and measurement of incorporation of labeled nucleotide as described above. Retinoic Acid Treatment—It has been well established that addition of retinoic acid (RA) to proliferating neuroblastoma cells causes cells to cease proliferation and either undergo apoptosis or differentiation (27Haussler M. Sidell N. Kelly M. Donaldson C. Altman A. Mangelsdorf D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5525-5529Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with 10 μm RA, effectively inducing cell cycle arrest and differentiation. To study the effect of this growth inhibitor, RA, on proliferation of neuroblastoma cells with different levels of Brn-3b, cells from each clone were plated at a density of 1 × 104/well and grown in normal growth medium. 10 μm retinoic acid was added to the medium the following day and changed every 48 h to replenish the G418 and retinoic acid. Morphological analysis was carried out using the Ziess Axiovert 200. Images (×10, ×20) were taken using the Axiocam and analysis carried out using the AxioVision Software. MTT Assay—MTT assay were carried out to measure live cells in culture. Briefly, cells were washed in 1× PBS and 500 μl of PBS added to each well followed by addition of 50 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml stock solution) to each well. Cells were incubated with this solution in a CO2 incubator for 2 h at 37 °C. Equal volumes (500 μl) of the solubilization buffer (0.1 m HCl in 1× PBS/0.1% Triton X) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C incubator for 5 min cooled to room temperature followed by measurement of absorbance of the converted dye at a wavelength of 570 nm using a plate reader. Analysis of Cell Cycle and Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—1 × 10-6 cells from the different clones were plated into 6 well dishes and grown for the specified times. Cells were then harvested in growth medium, pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm and washed once in 1× PBS then resuspended in 100 μl of 1× incubation buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4; 140 mm NaCl; 5 mm CaCl2 (Roche Applied Science)). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V (Roche Applied Science) (final concentration 2 μg/ml) and PI; final concentration 1 μg/ml (Sigma) were added to cells. After incubation for 15 min in the dark, an additional 300 μl of buffer was added and fluorescence measure using a Beckman Coulter Epics XL with excitation by a 488 nm argon laser and bandpass filters of 525 nm for annexin V and 675 nm for PI (26Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E. F., and Sambrook, J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 18.47-18.66, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Anchorage-independent Growth Studies—Studies to look at changes in the ability of cells with different levels of Brn-3b to grow in anchorage independent manner were carried out by analysis of growth of colonies in soft agar. A base layer of 2 ml of growth medium containing 0.7% agarose were plated in 6-well plates then topped with 1 ml of growth medium containing 0.35% agarose and 1 × 104 cells per ml. Finally 2 ml of growth medium containing 0.7% agarose was layered on top of the cells. Colonies were allowed to grow for 21 days after which time those colonies comprising of at least eight cells were counted using the Ziess axiovert microscope and images acquired using the Axiophot camera and AxioVision imaging system. Xenograft Model to Study Tumor Growth in Athymic Nude Mice—To test whether changing Brn-3b affected the ability of these neuroblastoma cells to grow tumors in vivo, xenograft models were utilized. Sets of six athymic nude mice (8-week-old males and/or females) were used for each neuroblastoma cell line with different levels of Brn-3b as well as the control, LTR1 and 2. Each clone was grown under selection pressure, harvested and pelleted. 1 × 106 cells were injected into the flank of each mouse. The mice were observed every day for signs of ill health. Tumors were measured every 3-4 days and the volume was calculated as length × weight × height/2. When the tumor reached a size of 1-1.5 cm3, the mouse was killed. All experiments were in compliance with the UKCCCR Guidelines for the Welfare of Animals in Experimental Neoplasia. Cell Invasion Assay—For cell invasion assays, BD Bioquote Matrigel™ Invasion Chambers were used. The membrane was prepared for use according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subconfluent IMR-32 cells were removed from flasks using 0.02% EDTA solution but with no trypsin and resuspended in growth medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum (FCS). 5 × 104 cells were plated into the upper chamber whereas the lower chamber contained medium with 10% FCS. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 12 h. Following this time, non-invading cells from the upper chamber were removed and the cells attached to the lower surface of the membrane were fixed in 100% methanol. Cells were then stained with cresyl violet and counted using the Ziess Axiovert microscope. Generation and Characterization of IMR-32 Neuroblastoma Cells with Different Levels of Brn-3b—Because Brn-3b transcription factor appears to be associated with proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, we wished to study the effect of manipulating its expression in these cells as this approach provides a powerful tool to analyze its regulatory role in these cells. Therefore we modified the levels of Brn-3b in the human neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32 by generating stably transfected cells that either constitutively overexpresses the Brn-3b(s) protein or reduced Brn-3b levels using an antisense strategy. Changes in Brn-3b proteins were established in the selected clones by Western immunoblotting using Brn-3b pAb and two clones of each of the transfectants (Brn-3b-overexpressing, antisense and LTR control cells) was selected (Fig. 1). As expected, the two selected Brn-3b-overexpressing clones (Brn-3b-1 and 2), had significantly higher levels of the 35-kDa Brn-3b(s) isoform, which was transfected (Fig. 1A). However, interestingly, there was also an increase in the endogenous levels of the longer 43-kDa isoform, Brn-3b(l) suggesting an auto-regulatory effect, by which increasing the shorter isoform could regulate the expression of the longer form of this protein. This observation is supported by similar findings in the breast cancer cell line, MCF7 (18Dennis J.H. Budhram-Mahadeo V. Latchman D.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As expected, the clones transfected with the antisense construct (3b-as-1/2) showed a reduction but not complete loss of the endogenous levels of both long and short isoforms of Brn-3b protein (Fig. 1B). Elevated Brn-3b Increases Cellular Growth and Proliferation in Monolayer—To test whether changing Brn-3b protein expression modified the growth characteristics of these neuroblastoma cells, we analyzed the rate of proliferation of cells with different levels of Brn-3b when grown in a monolayer. Counts of cells plated at a density of 1 × 104 cells per ml into 6-well plates (Nunc) and total cell numbers in each set was counted every 48 h for 26 days. As shown in Fig. 2A, two independent neuroblastoma cell lines, which constitutively overexpress Brn-3b showed the fastest population doubling time as well as cellular density at plateau phase compared with the pLTR vector control cell lines. Brn-3b-overexpressing clones Brn-3b-1 and 2 were the fastest growing cells, reaching average densities of 2.40 and 2.75 × 106 cells per cm2 respectively after 26 days compared with average density of 0.70 and 0.75 × 106 cells per cm2 seen with control clones LTR1 and LTR2 within the same period. Moreover, as early as day 12, statistically significant differences were noted between cell numbers in both overexpressing Brn-3b-1 and -2 cells compared with LTR1/2 (p = 1-5 × 10-5 and 3-7 × 10-5 using Student's t test analysis). In contrast, the antisense cell lines with decreased Brn-3b (3b-α1 and 3b-α2) grew more slowly than controls, reaching a plateau at an average density of 0.55 and 0.53 × 106 cells after 26 days. The antisense clone, 3b-as-2 showed consistently slower growth compared with 3b-as-1 with more significant changes compared with control cells observed by day 12 (p = 0.02 for LTR1 and 0.0001 for LTR2 compared with p = 0.25 for 3b-as-1 for LTR1 and 0.001 for LTR2). Consistently significant differences in growth were observed for 3b-as-1 compared with controls by day 18-22 (p = 0.009 and 0.0007 for LTR1 and 2, respectively). This difference in the growth of the antisense cells may reflect variation in the resultant loss of Brn-3b proteins using this antisense strategy. Thus the"

We individually substituted 27 hydrophobic Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, and Met residues in the regulatory domain of the fluorescent troponin CF29W with polar Gln to examine the effects of these mutations on: (a) the calcium binding and dynamics of troponin CF29W complexed with the regulatory fragment of troponin I (troponin I96–148) and (b) the calcium sensitivity of force production. Troponin I96–148 was an accurate mimic of intact troponin I for measuring the calcium dynamics of the troponin CF29W-troponin I complexes. The calcium affinities of the troponin CF29W-troponin I96–148 complexes varied ∼243-fold, whereas the calcium association and dissociation rates varied ∼38- and ∼33-fold, respectively. Interestingly, the effect of the mutations on the calcium sensitivity of force development could be better predicted from the calcium affinities of the troponin CF29W-troponin I96–148 complexes than from that of the isolated troponin CF29W mutants. Most of the mutations did not dramatically affect the affinity of calcium-saturated troponin CF29W for troponin I96–148. However, the Phe26 to Gln and Ile62 to Gln mutations led to >10-fold lower affinity of calcium-saturated troponin CF29W for troponin I96–148, causing a drastic reduction in force recovery, even though these troponin CF29W mutants still bound to the thin filaments. In conclusion, elucidating the determinants of calcium binding and exchange with troponin C in the presence of troponin I provides a deeper understanding of how troponin C controls signal transduction.

However, the Phe26 to Gln and Ile62 to Gln mutations led to >10-fold lower affinity of calcium-saturated troponin CF29W for troponin I96–148, causing a drastic reduction in force recovery, even though these troponin CF29W mutants still bound to the thin filaments. In conclusion, elucidating the determinants of calcium binding and exchange with troponin C in the presence of troponin I provides a deeper understanding of how troponin C controls signal transduction. Troponin C (TnC) 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, intact chicken skeletal troponin C; Tn, troponin; TnCF29W, intact TnC mutant with the Phe29 → Trp mutation; TnI, chicken skeletal troponin I; TnI96–148, chicken skeletal troponin I peptide corresponding to residues 96–148; TnI96–116, skeletal troponin I peptide corresponding to residues 96–116; TnI115–131, skeletal troponin I peptide corresponding to residues 115–131; IAEDANS, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Quin-2, 2-((bis(carboxymethyl)amino)-5-methylphenoxy)-methyl)-6-methoxy-8-(bis(carboxymethyl)amino)-quionline; N-domain, N-terminal domain; C-domain, C-terminal domain. regulates striated muscle contraction and relaxation through the binding and release of Ca2+ (for review see Refs. 1Farah C.S.

Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle TnC (∼18 kDa) consists of globular N- and C-terminal domains connected by a 31-residue α-helix (for review see Refs. 4Nelson M.R. Chazin W.J. Biometals. 1998; 11: 297-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar and 5Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulargina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 969-985PubMed Google Scholar). Both domains bind two Ca2+ ions through a pair of EF hand Ca2+-binding motifs. Each pair of EF hands interacts with one another through a short antiparallel β-sheet connecting the two Ca2+-binding loops (Ref. 6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and references within). The EF hands are numbered I–IV, and the helices flanking the loops are designated A–H, with an additional N-terminal 14-residue α-helix (Fig. 1, N-helix), which is absent in the closely related EF hand Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin. Much is known about the cation binding properties of TnC in solution. Each EF hand system binds Ca2+ and Mg2+ competitively, with the two C-terminal EF hands possessing higher Ca2+ and Mg2+ affinities (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Davis J.P.

In fact, the Ca2+-binding sites of the C-domain of TnC possess ∼10-fold higher Ca2+ affinity with a greater than 100-fold slower Ca2+ dissociation rate compared with those in the N-domain (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Johnson J.D. Nakkula R.J. Vasulka C. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8919-8923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In part because of its high Ca2+ and Mg2+ affinities and slow Ca2+ exchange rates (as compared with the kinetics of muscle contraction and relaxation), the C-domain is thought to play a structural role in muscle function by anchoring TnC into the Tn complex. In contrast, the Ca2+ exchange rates of the N-domain of TnC are rapid enough to be involved in the dynamic Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle mechanics (for review see Refs. 3Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar and 10Potter J.D. Johnson J.D. Chueng W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. Vol. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 145-173Crossref Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle contraction begins when cytoplasmic [Ca2+] rises and binds to the N-terminal EF hands of TnC. The entire N-domain of TnC subsequently undergoes a large tertiary conformational change, in which helices B and C move away as a unit from helices N, A, and D, exposing a buried hydrophobic pocket to the solvent (Ref. 5Filatov V.L. Katrukha A.G. Bulargina T.V. Gusev N.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 969-985PubMed Google Scholar and references within). The newly formed hydrophobic pocket is thought to allow the N-domain of TnC to interact with the C-terminal of TnI transferring the inhibitory domain of TnI away from actin (11Tao T. Gong B J. Leavis P.C. Science. 1990; 247: 1339-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Concurrently or subsequently, tropomyosin changes its position on the actin filament and myosin then binds cyclically to actin causing muscle contraction (for review see Refs. 1Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 2Squire J.M. Morris E.P. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). As cytoplasmic [Ca2+] lowers, the sequence of events above reverses (not necessarily in the same order), and the muscle relaxes. One of the steps that may influence the rate of muscle relaxation is Ca2+ dissociation from the N-domain of TnC. The influence that TnC has on the kinetics of muscle relaxation is controversial and incompletely understood (Ref. 12Luo Y. Davis J.P. Smillie L.B. Rall J.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and references within). The actual rate that Ca2+ dissociates from TnC in muscle fibers has not been measured and thus must be inferred. Ca2+ dissociates from the regulatory domain of isolated TnC ∼20–30 times faster than skeletal muscle relaxation and thus has been speculated to be too rapid to influence the rate of relaxation (for review see Ref. 3Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar). However, the antiparallel binding of TnI to TnC increases the Ca2+ sensitivity of the N-domain of TnC ∼10-fold and slows the Ca2+ dissociation rate ∼30-fold, with little additional change upon the formation of the whole Tn complex (Refs. 8Davis J.P.

Johnson J.D. Chueng W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. Vol. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 145-173Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from the Tn complex and not TnC alone may be the more meaningful rate when considering factors that control muscle relaxation kinetics. Consistent with this idea, exchanging a TnC mutant with an ∼2-fold slower N-terminal Ca2+ dissociation rate into skeletal muscle fibers slowed the rate at which the fibers relaxed ∼2-fold (12Luo Y. Davis J.P. Smillie L.B. Rall J.A. J. Physiol. 2002; 545: 887-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, in the same study exchange of an ∼1.5-fold faster TnC mutant into muscle did not statistically increase the rate of relaxation. Clearly, a broader range of Ca2+ dissociation rates from TnC mutants is required to further probe the role of TnC in tuning the rate of striated muscle relaxation. To better understand the regulation of muscle mechanics, it is important to elucidate the Ca2+-dependent interactions of TnC with TnI because TnC regulates muscle contraction as a part of the Tn complex and not in isolation. TnI residues 96–116 (TnI96–116) bind actin and are primarily responsible for the ability of TnI to inhibit the ATPase activity of actomyosin, which can be reversed upon TnC-Ca2+ binding to TnI96–116 (17Syska H. Wilkinson J.M. Grand R.J. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 18Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. J. Biol.

In conjunction with residues 96–116, residues 117–148 of TnI are required for the complete inhibitory activity and regulatory interactions with actin and TnC (20Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Van Eyk J.E. Thomas L.T. Tripet B. Wiesner R.J. Pearlstone J.R. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Hodges R.S. J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5478-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the complete enhancement of the Ca2+ sensitivity and the slowing of the Ca2+ dissociation rate from the regulatory domain of TnC in the presence of intact TnI were mimicked by a peptide of TnI corresponding to residues 96–148 (TnI96–148) (8Davis J.P. Rall J A. Reiser P.J. Smillie L.B. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49716-49726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ca2+-dependent binding of the regulatory domain of TnC to TnI96–148 may be a good model system to study the Ca2+-dependent interactions between TnI and TnC that regulate muscle mechanics. Recently, we investigated the effect of hydrophobic residue substitutions on the Ca2+ binding properties of the regulatory domain of TnC with the Phe29 → Trp mutation (TnCF29W). The global N-terminal Ca2+ affinities of the TnCF29W mutants varied 2340-fold, whereas the Ca2+ association and dissociation rates varied less than 70-fold and more than 45-fold, respectively (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined how these mutations affect the Ca2+ binding properties and dynamics of the TnCF29W-TnI96–148 complex and located hydrophobic residues essential for high affinity binding of TnI96–148. Furthermore, we have tested whether the TnCF29W-TnI96–148 complex is a better predictor than isolated TnCF29W for the Ca2+ binding properties of the Tn complex in muscle and the potential for a particular TnCF29W mutant to support force production. Materials—Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B and EGTA were purchased from Sigma. Quin-2 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The TnI96–148 peptide was synthesized and purified by the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Canada). Protein Mutagenesis and Purification—The construction and expression of intact chicken skeletal TnCF29W in pET3a has been described (24Li M.X. Chandra M. Pearlstone J.R. Racher K.I. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Borgford T. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Chicken skeletal fast TnI was prepared as described for the rabbit protein (25Mak A.S. Golosinska K. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14330-14334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TnCF29W mutants were constructed from the TnCF29W plasmid by primer based site-directed mutagenesis using a Stratagene Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The plasmids for TnCF29W and its mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified as described previously (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Aliquots of TnCF29W and I62QTnCF29W were labeled with the Cys-specific fluorescent probe 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (IAEDANS) at position Cys101 for the myofibril studies. Each TnC was reacted with 3–5-fold molar excess of IAEDANS for ∼6 h at room temperature with constant shaking in 50 mm Tris, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 6 m urea, pH 7.5. The labeling reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 mm DTT, and the labeled proteins were exhaustively dialyzed against 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C to remove unreacted label. Determination of Ca2+ Affinities—All steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS5 Spectrofluorimeter at 15 °C. Trp fluorescence was excited at 275 nm and monitored at 345 nm as microliter amounts of CaCl2 were added to 1 ml of each TnCF29W mutant (0.3 μm) plus TnI96–148 (3 μm) in 200 mm MOPS (to prevent pH changes upon the addition of metal), 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, at 15 °C. The [Ca2+]free was calculated using the computer program EGCA02 developed by Robertson and Potter (26Robertson S. Potter J.D. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 63-75Google Scholar). The Ca2+ affinities are reported as dissociation constants (Kd). Each Kd represents the mean of 3–5 titrations fit with a logistic sigmoid function mathematically equivalent to the Hill equation, as previously described (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Determination of TnI96–148 Peptide Affinities—Trp fluorescence was monitored as described in the previous paragraph. Microliter amounts of TnI96–148 were added to 1 ml of each TnCF29W mutant (0.6 μm) in 200 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm [Ca2+]free, 1mm DTT, pH 7.0, at 15 °C. Each peptide affinity, reported as a dissociation constant, represents the mean of three to five titrations fit to the root of a quadratic equation for binary complex formation as previously described (27Kobayashi T. Zhao X. Wade R. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5386-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Determination of Ca2+ Dissociation Rates—Ca2+ dissociation rates (koff) were measured using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, UK) model SX.18 MV stopped flow instrument with a dead time of 1.4 ms at 15 °C. The samples were excited using a 150-watt Xenon arc source. Ca2+ dissociation from the N-terminal regulatory domain of TnCF29W and its mutants when complexed with TnI96–148 were obtained utilizing Trp fluorescence excited at 275 nm with emission monitored through a UV transmitting black glass filter (UG1 from Oriel, Stratford, CT). koff was also measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ chelator Quin-2 (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Davis J.P. Rall J A. Reiser P.J. Smillie L.B. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49716-49726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Quin-2 was excited at 330 nm with its emission monitored through a 510-nm broad band pass interference filter (Oriel, Stratford, CT). The buffer used in all stopped flow experiments was 10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0. Calculation of Ca2+ Association Rates—The Ca2+ association rates (kon) were calculated using the simple relationship kon = koff/Kd, where koff represents the concerted release of two Ca2+ ions, and Kd represents the binding event of two Ca2+ ions to the N-domain of TnC in the presence of TnI96–148, as previously described (8Davis J.P. Rall J A. Reiser P.J. Smillie L.B. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49716-49726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Muscle Fiber Experiments—Single fibers were isolated the day of use from bundles of rabbit psoas muscle that had been stored in a glycerinating solution at -20 °C no longer than 1 month. Solutions and the mechanical setup utilized for force measurements were as previously described (28Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. Reiser P.J. J. Physiol. 1988; 406: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, a single fiber was soaked in relaxing solution containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min to remove any residual sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The fiber was then tied down in troughs attached to a servo-controlled DC torque motor (Cambridge Technologies, Watertown, MA) and an isometric force transducer (model 403A, Cambridge Technologies) as previously described (29Moss R.L. J. Physiol. 1979; 292: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fiber sarcomere length, width, and depth were measured with a video camera (Sony model XC-ST70) and an image analysis system (Simple PCI; Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA). Resting sarcomere length was set between 2.50 and 2.60 μm. The fiber was then activated in a pCa 4.0 solution and rapidly slackened after isometric force reached plateau. The analogue output of the force transducer was digitized using a DaqBoard/2000 and Daqview software (Iotech Inc., Cleveland, OH). The total force was measured between the plateau and base-line levels. The same procedure was utilized to obtain the resting force level of the fiber in a pCa 9.0 solution. The active force generated by the fiber in the various pCa solutions was calculated as the total force minus the resting force. Three active force measurements were performed in pCa 4.0 with the final activation taken as the maximal force generated by the native fiber (i.e. prior to extraction of endogenous TnC), which led to an average force per cross-sectional area of 85 ± 5 kN/m2. The fiber was then soaked for 2 min in a TnC extraction solution containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm trifluoperazine dihydrochloride at pH 7.0 (30Metzger J.M. Greaser M.L. Moss R.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 855-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The fiber was then washed three times in pCa 9.0 solution to remove any residual trifluoperazine dihydrochloride. If the residual force in pCa 4.0 solution was >10% of the maximal force, the extraction process was repeated. The fibers were then soaked for 2 min in a pCa 9.0 solution containing 16.7 μm recombinant TnCF29W or its mutant. All of the reconstituted fibers were then exposed to a series of pCa solutions varying from pCa 9.0 to 4.0, and the active force versus pCa was measured. Every fourth activation was performed at pCa 4.0, to which each adjacent and randomized pCa was normalized. Myofibril Preparation and Experiments—Rabbit skeletal psoas myofibrils were prepared and stored as previously described (31Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. Greaser M.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 293-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Endogenous TnC was extracted from a sample of the stock myofibrils by first washing the myofibrils three times in a myofibril TnC extraction solution (10 mm MOPS, 90 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.02% Tween 20, pH 8.0) to remove any residual glycerol. The myofibrils were then soaked in the TnC extraction solution for approximately 10 min at room temperature, pelleted, and resuspended in fresh TnC extraction solution an additional three times. The TnC extracted myofibrils were then washed three times in a pCa 9 solution after which the concentration of the myofibrils was determined (31Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. Greaser M.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 293-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 0.1 mg/ml aliquots of the TnC extracted myofibrils in the pCa 9.0 solution were then exposed to 1 μm TnCF29W or I62QTnCF29W labeled with IAEDANS for approximately 5 min. The myofibrils were then diluted with a pCa 3.0 solution to bring the final pCa of the solution to 4.0 according to a mixing table. The reconstituted myofibrils were then plated on a glass slide with a coverslip and imaged as previously described (31Swartz D.R. Moss R.L. Greaser M.L. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 293-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 32Zhang D. Yancey K.W. Swartz D.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 3103-3111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert TV (Thornwood, NJ) epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100× oil immersion phase contrast lens and a Chroma filter set #11000UV (360 nm broad excitation, 400-nm-long pass dichroic and 420-nm-long pass emission). The digital images were obtained using a 12-bit intensity resolution CCD camera (Kodak KAF 1300 chip; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) controlled by a Matrox board and IPLab Spectrum software (version 3.0, Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA) run by a Macintosh 840AV. Effect of Ca2+ on the Fluorescence Spectra of TnCF29W and Mutants in the Presence of TnI96–148 at 15 °C—The influence of individual hydrophobic to Gln mutations in the regulatory domain of TnCF29W on Ca2+ binding and exchange was previously characterized (6Tikunova S.B. Rall J.A. Davis J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6697-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, TnC does not function in muscle in isolation but as part of the Tn complex, primarily interacting with TnI. Thus, we determined the influence of 27 TnCF29W mutants in which all N-terminal hydrophobic residues were individually substituted with Gln (Fig. 1) on Ca2+ binding and exchange in the presence of the regulatory peptide of TnI, TnI96–148. The N-terminal domain of TnCF29W undergoes a large increase in Trp fluorescence upon forming the Ca2+-TnCF29W-TnI96–148 complex (8Davis J.P. Rall J A. Reiser P.J. Smillie L.B. Tikunova S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49716-49726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Pearlstone J.R. Sykes B.D. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7601-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+, the Trp fluorescence of TnCF29W upon the addition of TnI96–148 marginally decreased <1.1-fold at 345 nm (Fig. 2A, dashed line). Subsequent addition of 1 mm [Ca2+]free to TnCF29W plus TnI96–148 blue-shifted (∼8 nm) and increased the Trp fluorescence ∼2.2-fold at 335 nm (Fig. 2A, dotted line). Fluorescence spectra of the other TnCF29W mutants were similar to TnCF29W (data not shown) except for I37QTnCF29W. The addition of TnI96–148 to apo I37QTnCF29W increased the Trp fluorescence ∼1.3-fold, which subsequently decreased ∼1.3-fold upon the addition of 1 mm [Ca2+]free at 345 nm with a similar blue shift in the maximum fluorescence as observed with TnCF29W. The reason for this atypical behavior of I37QTnCF29W is currently unknown. Ile37 is part of the first Ca2+-binding loop located in the middle of the small β-sheet connecting the two N-terminal EF hands. Thus, Ile37 may be critical for proper Ca2+ binding and coordination of subsequent structural changes. Measurement of Ca2+ Binding Affinities for the N-terminal Domains of TnCF29W and Mutants in the Presence of TnI96–148 at 15 °C—The Ca2+ binding affinities (Kd) for TnCF29W and each hydrophobic mutant were measured by following the Ca2+-induced changes in Trp fluorescence in the presence of TnI96–148. Examples of the Ca2+-dependent increases in N-terminal TnCF29W and mutant Trp fluorescence are shown in Fig. 3 for L49QTnCF29W (•), TnCF29W (▴), M81QTnCF29W (□), I73QTnCF29W (▵), and F26QTnCF29W (○). Table I summarizes the Ca2+ binding data for these and the remaining TnCF29W mutants. In the presence of TnI exhibited a half-maximal increase in its Trp fluorescence upon the addition of Ca2+ at 267 ± 3 nm. The Ca2+ affinities for the mutants ranged from 70 ± 1 nm for L49QTnCF29W to 17 ± 3 μm for F26QTnCF29W. Therefore, substitution of hydrophobic residues with polar Gln produced N-domain TnCF29W mutants that exhibited ∼243-fold variation in their Ca2+ affinities in the presence of TnI96–148. The Hill coefficients for all but two of the TnCF29W-TnI96–148, mutant complexes (F26QTnC and I37QTnCF29W) were between 1.6 and 2.8 (see Table I), implying cooperative binding of Ca2+ and TnI96–148 to TnCF29W and its mutants.Table ISummary of Ca2+ binding properties for TnCF29W and its mutants in the presence of TnI96–148Mutant proteinCa2+ KdHill coefficientΔCa2+ sensitivityaΔCa2+ sensitivity is the quotient of the Ca2+ affinity of the protein in isolation (6) divided by the Ca2+ affinity of the protein in the presence of TnI96-148koffkon × 107Peptide Kdnms-1m-1 s-1nmTnCF29W267 ± 32.76 ± 0.0712.310.6 ± 0.24.0146 ± 19M3QTnCF29W312 ± 62.13 ± 0.079.611.57 ± 0.063.7188 ± 12F13QTnCF29W211 ± 42.21 ± 0.0911.87.66 ± .053.6133 ± 34L14QTnCF29W885 ± 342.3 ± 0.26.714.5 ± 0.21.6155 ± 25M18QTnCF29W298 ± 102.3 ± 0.28.68.9 ± 0.33.0189 ± 14I19QTnCF29W417 ± 42.21 ± 0.0910.614.2 ± 0.43.4186 ± 15F22QTnCF29W321 ± 62.38 ± 0.093.112.4 ± 0.13.9443 ± 37F26QTnCF29W17000 ± 30001.0 ± 0.223.2169 ± 41.01473 ± 83M28QTnCF29W327 ± 51.96 ± 0.0511.615.2 ± 0.14.7194 ± 22I37QTnCF29W6400 ± 9500.39 ± 0.0312.298 ± 61.5326 ± 48L42QTnCF29W6284 ± 2402.0 ± 0.11.015.9 ± 0.10.3221 ± 19V45QTnCF29W87 ± 12.16 ± 0.062.08.3 ± 0.29.5259 ± 57M46QTnCF29W288 ± 71.81 ± 0.073.112.6 ± 0.24.4315 ± 11M48QTnCF29W246 ± 72.4 ± 0.113.010.7 ± 0.14.3183 ± 28L49QTnCF29W70 ± 12.10 ± 0.072.48.01 ± 0.0211.4241 ± 10L58QTnCF29W441 ± 152.0 ± 0.19.111.9 ± 0.12.7204 ± 15I61QTnCF29W495 ± 162.5 ± 0.25.222 ± 14.5288 ± 13I62QTnCF29W2628 ± 471.59 ± 0.0414.2102 ± 23.92075 ± 116V65QTnCF29W592 ± 172.4 ± 0.213.510.2 ± 0.21.7268 ± 23I73QTnCF29W1824 ± 312.42 ± 0.0912.529.3 ± 0.21.6147 ± 10F75QTnCF29W598 ± 161.61 ± 0.067.424.9 ± 0.54.2230 ± 18F78QTnCF29W5084 ± 972.5 ± 0.15.316.1 ± 0.10.3126 ± 22L79QTnCF29W658 ± 202.4 ± 0.214.914.0 ± 0.12.1234 ± 41V80QTnCF29W788 ± 132.24 ± 0.0827.916.1 ± 0.22.0149 ± 20M81QTnCF29W335 ± 102.4 ± 0.256.75.15 ± 0.021.5256 ± 13M82QTnCF29W149 ± 12.07 ± 0.044.65.8 ± 0.13.9382 ± 17V83QTnCF29W517 ± 192.4 ± 0.27.215.4 ± 0.33.0210 ± 25M86QTnCF29W420 ± 102.4 ± 0.16.213.4 ± 0.13.2294 ± 34a ΔCa2+ sensitivity is the quotient of the Ca2+ affinity of the protein in isolation (6Tikunova S.B.

https://openalex.org/W1989961023,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae selectively utilizes good nitrogen sources in preference to poor ones by down-regulating transcription of genes encoding proteins that transport and degrade poor nitrogen sources when excess nitrogen is available. This regulation is designated nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR). When cells are transferred from a good to a poor nitrogen source (glutamine to proline) or treated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the protein kinases Tor1/2, Gln3 (NCR-sensitive transcription activator) moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Gln3 re-accumulates in the cytoplasm when cells are returned to a good nitrogen source. However, Gln3 is not uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. Such non-uniform distribution could result from a variety of interactions including association with a cytoplasmic vesicular system or components of the cytoskeleton. We used latrunculin, a drug that disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting actin polymerization, to determine whether the actin cytoskeleton participates in intracellular Gln3 movement. Latrunculin-treatment prevents nuclear accumulation of Gln3 and NCR-sensitive transcription in cells transferred from ammonia to proline medium but does not prevent its accumulation in the cytoplasm of cells transferred from proline to glutamine medium. In contrast, rapamycin-induced nuclear accumulation of Gln3 is not demonstrably affected by latrunculin treatment. These data indicate the actin cytoskeleton is required for nuclear localization of Gln3 in response to limiting nitrogen but not rapamycin-treatment. Therefore, the actin cytoskeleton either participates in the response of Gln3 intracellular localization to nitrogen limitation before Tor1/2, or Tor1/2 inhibition only mimics the outcome of nitrogen limitation rather than directly regulating it.

In this role it is partially responsible for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of these factors. Many of the studies that have identified roles of the actin cytoskeleton in yeast and other systems have made use of the drugs latrunculin A and B (45Spector I. Shochet N.R. Kashman Y. Groweiss A. Science. 1983; 219: 493-495Google Scholar). Latrunculin binds to the actin monomer, inhibits its ability to polymerize, and thereby disrupts the actin cytoskeleton (46Coue M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Google Scholar, 47Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Google Scholar, 48Morton W.M. Ayscough K. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Google Scholar). The above information motivated us to use latrunculin to determine whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a role in intracellular Gln3 localization. Our data show that an intact actin cytoskeleton is required for nuclear accumulation of Gln3 in response to nitrogen limitation but not for its cytoplasmic accumulation in response to nitrogen excess. It does not appear that Gln3 association with the endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for the actin cytoskeleton requirement of GATA-factor localization and transcription activity because co-localization between Gln3 and the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein, Kar2, is limited. However, the structures with which Gln3 appears to be associated are often seen in close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, Gln3 fluorescence localizes to tubular/vesicular structures that appear to be contiguous with the nucleus.

Cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 nm = 0.4-0.5, at 30 °C) at which time a sample was removed for microscopic assay. Latrunculin B or carrier (ethanol) was added to the remainder of the culture, and the cells were incubated for 30 min to permit latrunculin to act. Alternatively, hydroxyurea was added, and the cells were incubated for 120 min. At the end of this preincubation period the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with prewarmed, pre-aerated medium, and transferred to the indicated medium containing either carrier (ethanol), latrunculin, or hydroxyurea as noted in the legends of Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Panel B, representative wild type and mutant cells treated with either 150 μm latrunculin or the carrier and stained with phalloidin to permit evaluation of latrunculin treatment and the act1-157 phenotype. The genetic background containing the act1-157 mutation is somewhat less latrunculin-sensitive than the one we used for the rest of our experiments. We did not, however, increase the latrunculin concentration in this control experiment because we preferred to maintain a uniform latrunculin concentration throughout all of the experiments reported.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5Cell cycle arrest does not inhibit Gln3-Myc nuclear accumulation when cells are transferred from a good nitrogen source to a poor one.

Micrographs were imaged as described in Fig. 9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thirty minutes was chosen as the time for preincubation with latrunculin before the beginning of each experiment for two reasons. First, at this time the actin cytoskeleton was completely disrupted. In addition, we noticed in preliminary experiments that the addition of the carrier in which latrunculin was dissolved (ethanol) caused a modest and temporary disturbance of Gln3-Myc intracellular localization. The percentage of cells in which Gln3-Myc was localized to the nucleus transiently decreased by about 50%, then recovered by 20-40 min and remained constant thereafter at least up to 120 min, which is as long as we monitored the cells (Fig. 1A, filled bars, and data not shown). The decrease was somewhat variable and ranged from about 15 to 50%. Similar transient perturbation of Gln3-Myc localization also occurred when proline-grown cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in fresh proline medium (Fig. 1B, open bars). Here, as in Fig. 1A, proper Gln3-Myc localization was recovered. This transient decrease in nuclear Gln3-Myc did not occur, however, if cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended again without a change of medium, i.e. fresh prewarmed, pre-aerated medium did not replace the medium in which they were grown (Fig. 1B, filled bars). It also did not occur in a proline-grown ure2Δ mutant treated with ethanol. The physiological and biochemical bases of the transient decrease in nuclear Gln3-Myc reported above are not known. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was isolated by the phenol/freeze RNA method of Schmitt et al. (49Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Google Scholar).

PC4 (a control used for sporulation assays whose expression mirrors ribosomal RNA concentration) was used as a control for RNA transfer and loading. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described by Cox et al. (7Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Google Scholar). Gln3-Myc and Kar2 were visualized using 9E10(c-myc) (Covance MMS-150P) monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 or a Kar2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (52Lyman S.K. Schekman R. Cell. 1997; 88: 85-96Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:5000, respectively, as the primary antibody and either Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:200 or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody at a dilution of 1:200, respectively, as secondary antibody. Actin was labeled using a 1:50 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with DAPI as described previously (7Cox K.H. Tate J.J. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37559-37566Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope with a 100× Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio camera and AxioVision 3.0 (Zeiss) software. Images showing phalloidin staining of actin were taken at constant exposure. Images in Figs. 9, 10, 11 were deconvolved with AxioVision 3.0 (Zeiss) software using the constrained iterative algorithm. Nuclear Accumulation of Gln3 in Response to a Poor Nitrogen Source Requires the Actin Cytoskeleton—Gln3 moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus when cells are transferred from a good to poor nitrogen source (ammonia or glutamine to proline medium). To determine whether an intact actin cytoskeleton is required for this process, we measured the effect of latrunculin treatment on intracellular Gln3 distribution in cells transferred from ammonia to proline medium. Actin patches and cables are clearly visible both before (0 min) and 60 min after transferring cells from ammonia to proline medium in the absence of latrunculin (Fig. 2, column 1, rows A, B, and E, F) but appear completely depolymerized in yeast cells preincubated 30 min with latrunculin (Fig. 2, column 1, rows C, D and G, H). Nuclear accumulation of Gln3 correlates with the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton. At zero time, Gln3 is non-randomly distributed in the cytoplasm of both control and latrunculin-treated, ammonia-grown cells (Fig. 2, column 2, rows A, B and C, D). After 60 min in minimal-proline medium, Gln3 accumulated in the nuclei of untreated cells (Fig. 2, column 2, rows E and F), co-localizing with DAPI-stained material (Fig. 2, columns 2-4, rows E and F). In latrunculin-treated cells, little if any nuclear accumulation of Gln3 occurred after transfer to proline medium (Fig. 2, columns 2-4, rows G and H). In a few latrunculin-treated cells transferred to minimal-proline medium, faint actin clusters begin to reappear in long exposures of micrographs taken at the later time points; actin cables,"
https://openalex.org/W2006908464,"We previously isolated different isoforms of a new Ets transcription factor family member, NERF/ELF-2, NERF-2, NERF-1a, and NERF-1b. In contrast to the inhibitory isoforms NERF-1a and NERF-1b, NERF-2 acts as a transactivator of the B cell-specific blk promoter. We now report that NERF-2 and NERF-1 physically interact with AML1 (RUNX1), a frequent target for chromosomal translocations in leukemia. NERF-2 bound to AML1 via an interaction site located in a basic region upstream of the Ets domain. This is in contrast to most other Ets factors such as Ets-1 that bind to AML1 via the Ets domain, suggesting that different Ets factors utilize different domains for interaction with AML1. The interaction between AML1 and NERF-2 led to cooperative transactivation of the blk promoter, whereas the interaction between AML1 and NERF-1a led to repression of AML1-mediated transactivation. To delineate the differences in function of the different NERF isoforms, we determined that the transactivation domain of NERF-2 is encoded by the N-terminal 100 amino acids, which have been replaced in NERF-1a by a 19-amino acid transcriptionally inactive sequence. Furthermore, acidic domains A and B, which are conserved in NERF-2 and the related proteins ELF-1 and MEF/ELF-4, but not in NERF-1a, are largely responsible for NERF-2-mediated transactivation. Because translocation of the Ets factor Tel to AML1 is a frequent event in childhood pre-B leukemia, understanding the interaction of Ets factors with AML1 in the context of a B cell-specific promoter might help to determine the function of Ets factors and AML1 in leukemia.

Immune system development is regulated by the combined action of cytokines, cell-cell interactions, and a distinct set of transcription factors that modulate and coordinate developmental stage- and lineage-specific gene expression. Because expression of a specific set of genes is distinct for each cell lineage and each developmental stage, analysis of transcription factors involved in the regulation of these lineage-specific genes is one approach to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation. Analysis of regulatory regions of B cell-specific genes has revealed the presence of DNA motifs that are repeatedly found in variations and different combinations in most B cell-specific genes. Most B cell-specific genes contain binding sites for different Ets factors such as Pu.1, Ets-1, ELF-1, 1The abbreviations used are: ELF, E74-like factor; NERF, new Ets-related factor; BSAP, B cell lineage-specific activator protein; MEF, myeloid ELF-1-like factor; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CPF, core binding factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PDEF, prostate-derived Ets factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. NERF (ELF-2), and Ets-related gene and factors such as Oct-2, Ikaros, E2A, Rel/NF-κB, BSAP, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1, N-Myc, and early B cell factor (1Hagman J. Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cooperativity between these different factors leads to selective stage- and cell-specific expression of a particular gene. B cell specificity of a transcription factor such as the ubiquitously expressed E2A does not always coincide with its exclusive expression in B cells, but rather depends on formation of B cell-specific protein·protein complexes due to the combination of a particular set of factors expressed in B cells. The Ets transcription factor family plays a key role in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and development; apoptosis; and immune responses, including the growth, survival, and activation of hematopoietic cells (2Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). More than 30 Ets family homologs have been cloned (3Sementchenko V.I. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6533-6548Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and these homologs function as transcription factors under physiological conditions and transform cells when aberrantly expressed. All Ets factors share a highly conserved 80–90-amino acid DNA-binding domain, the Ets domain (4Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Seth A. Ascione R. Fisher R.J. Mavrothalassitis G.J. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S.

This domain is sufficient to interact specifically with DNA; and due to the conserved DNA-binding domain, binding sites for Ets factors are similar, with a (A/G)GA(A/T) core binding motif and slight differences in flanking nucleotides for different Ets factors. Outside the DNA-binding domain, very little homology is common to all members of the Ets family. Ets-related proteins can be grouped into subclasses based on additional homologous domains unique for particular members of the Ets family (4Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 5Seth A. Ascione R. Fisher R.J. Mavrothalassitis G.J. Bhat N.K. Papas T.S.

Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) such as NERF/ELF-2, ELF-1, and MEF/ELF-4, which contain several homologous regions outside the Ets domain not found in other Ets factors. Protein-protein interactions are critical for the function of Ets-related proteins and occur with transcription factors of various other families. Thus, ERP, SAP-1, and ELK-1 (Ets-related protein, SRF accessory protein, and Ets-like) form a ternary complex with the serum response factor, whereas GA-binding protein-α interacts with GA-binding protein-β (2Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6514-6523Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 6Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additional regulation of Ets factors involves phosphorylation by kinases activated via different signal transduction pathways (6Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 7Yordy J.S. Muise-Helmericks R.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6503-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In an effort to search for novel members of the Ets family that might be relevant for B cell gene regulation, we previously identified and characterized cDNA clones encoding three alternative splice products of a novel member of the Ets gene family, NERF/ELF-2, NERF-1a, NERF-1b, and NERF-2, which differ in their N termini (8Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). NERF is most closely related to ELF-1 and MEF/ELF-4. We have demonstrated that both NERF and the related protein ELF-1 are involved in regulating a set of genes in B cells and myeloid cells and are highly expressed in B cells and myeloid cells (8Oettgen P.

We also showed that NERF-2 is expressed in endothelial cells and transactivates the regulatory regions of the tie2 gene (10Dube A. Akbarali Y. Sato T.N. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NERF-2 expression is also increased in endothelial cells in response to hypoxia and to angiopoietin-1, indicating functions for NERF in the immune system and vasculature (11Christensen R.A.

Blk is a B cell-specific tyrosine kinase that is expressed in pre-B and mature B cells, but not in plasma cells; this is similar to the expression of mb-1 (membrane-bound immunoglobulin IgM-α) and B29 (42Dymecki S.M. Zwollo P. Zeller K. Kuhajda F.P. Desiderio S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4815-4823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blk is associated with the antigen receptor and is involved in signal transduction (39Burckhardt A.I. Brunswick M. Bolen J.B. Mond J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7410-7414Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The blk promoter contains a previously uncharacterized NERF/ELF-1-binding site adjacent to a BSAP and AML1 site. Not much is known about regulation of blk gene expression, except that the B cell-specific transcription factor BSAP plays an important role and that the transcription factor NF-κB/p50 interacts with the blk gene during B cell activation (41Zwollo P. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15310-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We furthermore demonstrated that AML1 binds to the blk promoter and cooperatively transactivates the blk promoter in the presence of BSAP (43Libermann T.A. Pan Z. Akbarali Y. Hetherington C.J. Boltax J. Yergeau D.A. Zhang D.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24671-24676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). AML1 has been shown previously to interact with a variety of Ets factors, including the related protein MEF, indicating that a possible interaction between AML1 and NERF may play a role in blk gene regulation (44Verger A. Duterque-Coquillaud M. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We now report that NERF-2 and ELF-1 directly interact with the runt homology domain of AML1 through a basic region upstream of the Ets domain and cooperate with AML1 in activating blk promoter transcription. We also demonstrate that the NERF-1a isoform lacks the NERF-2 transactivation domain and represses AML1-mediated transactivation of the blk promoter. Plasmid Construction—Full-length proteins and different fragments of NERF-2, NERF-1a, and ELF-1 were cloned into the pGEX-5X-3 vector to make GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Novagen). The expression vectors of full-length AML1, AML1-(1–208), and AML1-(87–208) are all derived from AML1b and were prepared as reported previously (45Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). lyn and blk promoter constructs were also prepared as reported previously (8Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For expression of NERF-2 in mammalian cells, NERF-2 was cloned into the NotI site of the pCi vector, which has a cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer. For Gal4 expression constructs, NERF-2 and NERF-1 fragments were cloned in the reading frame into the BamHI site of the Gal4-(1–147) expression vector pSG424. The plasmids Gal4-NERF-2-(1–203), Gal4-NERF-2-(1–164), Gal4-NERF-2-(1–141), Gal4-NERF-2-(1–108), Gal4-NERF-2-(1–103), Gal4-NERF-1a-(1–155), and Gal4-NERF-1b-(1–155) were cloned into the Gal4 vector by deleting C termini using restriction enzymes BglII, EaeI, NcoI, EcoNI, NdeI, BglII, and BglII. Gal4-NERF-2-(1–103) MutA, MutB, MutC, MutD, and MutA+B were generated by site-directed mutagenesis by replacing glutamic acid with alanine. The 5′-FLAG vector was prepared by inserting FLAG sequence-encoding oligonucleotides into the NheI and KpnI sites of the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The inserted FLAG sequence was ATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG. The 3′-Myc vector was prepared by inserting Myc epitope sequence-encoding oligonucleotides into the XhoI and ApaI sites of the pcDNA3.1 plasmid. The inserted Myc epitope sequence was GAA CAA AAA CTC ATC TCA GAA GAG GAT CTG. NERF-2, MEF, PDEF, and ESE1 DNAs were PCR-amplified using Hi-Fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and inserted into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the 5′-FLAG-pcDNA3.1 vector. PCR-amplified AML1 was cloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the 3′-Myc-pcDNA3.1 plasmid to construct AML1–3′-Myc-pcDNA3.1. Deletion mutants of NERF-2 (NERF-2(del108–180)) were produced by removing the NERF-2 DNA sequences between two EcoNI sites at amino acids 108 and 180 in the pCi-NERF-2 vector. Briefly, the plasmid was digested with EcoNI, and isolated bands were religated with linkers 5′-TTGAGGGATTCAAGAAGTCCTGA-3′ and 5′-CTCAGGACTTCTTGAAT CCCTCA-3′, which were previously annealed to fuse the N-terminal 108 amino acids of NERF-2 in-frame with the C terminus of NERF-2 starting at amino acid 180. For NERF-2(del108–180)-FLAG, the pCi-NERF-2(del108–180) vector was used as a template for PCR amplification with primers 5′-CGCGGATCCATGACATCAGCAGTGGTTGAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGTCGACTTTCTCACATGTCACTAGTCC-3′, which contain BamHI and SalI restriction enzyme sites. The PCR-amplified mutant NERF-2 DNA was inserted in-frame into the 5′-FLAG-pcDNA3.1 vector. Cell Culture and Transfection—CV-1 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cotransfection of 3 × 105 CV-1 cells was carried out with 2 μgof reporter gene construct DNA and 3 μg of expression vector DNA using 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (45Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Meyers S. Rhoades K.L. Larson C.J. Chen H.M. Hiebert S.W. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were harvested 16 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (43Libermann T.A. Pan Z. Akbarali Y. Hetherington C.J. Boltax J. Yergeau D.A. Zhang D.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24671-24676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Transfection for each construct was performed independently in duplicates or triplicates and repeated three to four times with two different plasmid preparations with similar results. In Vitro Translation—In vitro protein translation was performed using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The TnT lysate contains ∼150 μg/μl endogenous protein. Each in vitro translation reaction uses 25 μlofTnT lysate/50-μl reaction. GST Pull-down Experiments—The GST pull-down experiments were performed as described previously (46Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. The integrity of the bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Approximately equal amounts of the fusion proteins were used for each reaction. Briefly, the GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21; expression was confirmed and quantified by SDS-PAGE; and GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads for pull-down assays as described (46Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant 35S-labeled AML1 and 35S-labeled rhombotin-2 were produced by in vitro transcription/translation (TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system kit) from pCi-AML1 and pCi-rhombotin-2 plasmid templates. Recombinant proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins at 4 °C for 1 h in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were then washed three times, and associated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells grown on 100-mm dishes were cotransfected overnight with 6 μg of FLAG-tagged Ets constructs and 6 μg of Myc-tagged AML1 expression vector or the parental vector using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The cells were then changed to fresh growth medium for 24–36 h and collected in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5% Igepal (Nonidet P-40 substitute), 0.5% of Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 1:30 diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to a new tube. Total cell lysates were diluted at a 4:6 ratio with immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1:30 diluted protease inhibitor mixture). Then, 20 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (M2-agarose, Sigma) were added to the cell lysates. Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C with a slow rotating motion. The immunoprecipitated complex was washed five times with 25 mm Tris, 2.7 mm KCl, and 137 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). After the final washing, the bound proteins were eluted in nonreducing SDS sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) or with 3× FLAG peptide (150 ng/μl final concentration; Sigma). The samples were boiled for 3 min and loaded onto 10% Tris/glycine gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h. The membranes were blocked overnight in 5% dry milk in 25 mm Tris, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), and 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C. The transferred membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (1:1250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The signal was detected by ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) on x-ray film. NERF-2 Physically Interacts with AML1—Our previous studies established that the promoter region of the B cell-specific blk gene contains Ets- and AML1-binding sites in close proximity to each other (43Libermann T.A. Pan Z. Akbarali Y. Hetherington C.J. Boltax J. Yergeau D.A. Zhang D.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24671-24676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because AML1 has been shown to interact and cooperate with other Ets transcription factors, including Ets-1 and MEF, we explored the possibility that NERF-2, which activates the blk promoter, can cooperate with AML1 in regulating blk gene expression (8Oettgen P. Akbarali Y. Boltax J. Best J. Kunsch C. Libermann T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5091-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We first tested whether NERF-2 directly interacts with AML1 using a GST pull-down assay in which E. coli cells expressing GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, in vitro translated full-length AML1 could be specifically retained on agarose beads containing the GST-NERF-2 fusion protein, but not on glutathione beads containing only GST. In contrast to AML1, rhombotin-2 did not bind to NERF-2 in the GST pull-down assay. This result shows that NERF-2 can specifically interact with AML1. A Basic Region Upstream of the Ets Domain of NERF-2 Interacts with AML1—To map the region of NERF-2 responsible for interaction with AML1, 35S-labeled AML1 was incubated with a series of GST-NERF-2 deletion mutant proteins (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2B and summarized in Fig. 4, mutants containing N-terminal amino acids 1–203 (fourth lane) still interacted with AML1 proteins as efficiently as full-length NERF-2 (amino acids 1–581) (third lane). However, C-terminal mutants containing amino acids 204–581 (fifth lane) lost interaction activity with AML1.Fig. 4Interaction of NERF-2 and AML1 synergistically activates the blk promoter. A, blk promoter-luciferase assays were performed with NERF-1a, NERF-2, or AML1 (+CBFβ) or with NERF-2 + AML1 (+CBFβ) or NERF-1a + AML1 (+CBFβ) expression constructs in CV-1 cells. NERF-2 + AML1 (+CBFβ) coexpression resulted in greater luciferase activity compared with the combined increase of NERF-2-alone and AML1-alone activities, demonstrating that physical interaction of NERF-2 and AML1 has a cooperative function in activating the blk promoter. However, NERF-1a interaction with AML1 showed a suppressive function with AML1-induced blk promoter activity. RLU, relative luciferase units. B, two clones of the NERF-2(del108–180) deletion mutant fused to the FLAG peptide in the FLAG vector (Mut #1 and Mut #17) were generated as described under “Materials and Methods.” These mutant DNAs were cotransfected with AML1-Myc into 293T cells, and their proper expression was tested by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies for AML1 and NERF-2 mutants, respectively. As a control, wild-type FLAG-NERF-2 was also transfected. C, FLAG-tagged wild-type NERF-2 and NERF-2(del108–180) mutant constructs were transiently cotransfected with Myc-tagged AML1 into 293T cells. Cell lysates were co-immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2. Western blotting (WB) was performed using anti-Myc polyclonal antibody to detect the AML1 protein. AML1 was detected only when NERF-2-FLAG and AML1-Myc were cotransfected into the cells, but not with NERF-2(del108–180) deletion mutants with AML1, vector only, or NERF-2 or AML1 plus vector. D, NERF-2(del108–180) deletion mutants were cotransfected with or without AML1 (+CBFβ) along with the blk promoter construct into CV-1 cells. The blk promoter activities were measured and are presented as -fold increase relative to the control without AML1. The -fold cooperation was calculated by dividing the activation of the promoter in the presence of both factors by the expected additive result after background subtraction. The mutants showed only an additive effect for AML1 and NERF-2 transactivation, whereas wild-type NERF-2 showed strong transcriptional cooperativity. E, the C terminus of AML1 is required for cooperativity with NERF-2. Transient transfections were carried out with NERF-2, CBFβ, and either AML1 or mutants of AML1 to identify the region of AML1 required for functional interaction with NERF-2. AML1-(1–289), AML1-(1–351), and AML1-(1–381) are C-terminal truncations of AML1; the numbers represent the amino acids that are encoded. The results represent the means ± S.E. The -fold cooperation was calculated by dividing the activation of the promoter in the presence of both factors by the expected additive result after background sub"

Ras-GRP1 provides signals to immature T cells that confer survival and proliferation, but RasGRP1 also promotes T cell receptor-mediated deletion of mature T cells. We used the WEHI-231 cell line as an experimental system to determine whether RasGRP1 can serve as a quantitative modifier of B cell receptor-induced deletion of immature B cells. A 2-fold elevation in RasGRP1 expression markedly increased apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells following B cell receptor ligation, whereas a dominant negative mutant of RasGRP1 suppressed B cell receptor-induced apoptosis. Activation of ERK1 or ERK2 kinases was not required for RasGRP1-mediated apoptosis. Instead, elevated RasGRP1 expression caused down-regulation of NF-κB and Bcl-xL, which provide survival signals counter-acting apoptosis induction by B cell receptor. Inhibition of NF-κB was sufficient to enhance B cell receptor-induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells, and ligation of co-stimulatory receptors that activate NF-κB suppressed the ability of RasGRP1 to promote B cell receptor-induced apoptosis. These experiments define a novel apoptosis-promoting pathway leading from B cell receptor to the inhibition of NF-κB and demonstrate that differential expression of RasGRP1 has the potential to modulate the sensitivities of B cells to negative selection following antigen encounter.

Recent work with genetically modified mice has demonstrated that RasGRP1 provides signals that enhance the survival and proliferation of T cells at several stage during their development and immunological selection. RasGRP1 is transcriptionally induced by pre-TCR signaling, and the resulting increase in RasGRP1 expression is sufficient to confer survival and proliferation in the absence of other pre-TCR-derived signals (10Norment A.M.

These experiments portray RasGRP1 as a promoter of survival and proliferation responses to pre-TCR or TCR during intrathymic T cell development but with the converse role of mediating TCR-induced deletion in mature peripheral T cells. B cell development in the bone marrow is also governed by a series of selections for immunologically competent but not self-reactive antigen receptors. To avoid auto-immunity, immature B cells carrying BCR that recognize self-antigen need to be suppressed either by anergization, by respecification through receptor editing, or by deletion through BCR-induced apoptosis (14Goodnow C.C.

WEHI-231 cells express surface IgM of unknown antigen specificity, but cross-linking with anti-IgM mimics the interaction of this BCR with a high affinity antigen. Anti-IgM-initiated signaling imposes cell cycle arrest on WEHI-231 cells within a few hours, and maintenance of BCR ligation beyond 1 day results in apoptosis. BCR-induced deletion of WEHI-231 cells shares many of the regulatory mechanisms relevant to immunological negative selection of primary B cells, including suppression by the co-stimulators CD40 ligand or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (18Jakway J.P. Usinger W.R. Gold M.R. Mishell R.I. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2225-2231PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The regulatory roles of Ras GTPases and Ras-specific exchange factors in BCR-induced deletion of WEHI-231 cells are unknown. We used WEHI-231 cells to test the potential of differential expression of RasGRP1 to modify cell cycle arrest and apoptosis responses to BCR signaling. A doubling of RasGRP1 protein levels conferred hypersensitivity to deletion following BCR ligation. The cells with elevated RasGRP1 expression became apoptotic more rapidly and were severely depleted from mixed populations after a 2-day exposure to anti-IgM. Expression of a dominant negative form of RasGRP1 suppressed apoptosis induction following BCR ligation. The WEHI-231 cells with elevated RasGRP1 expression had reduced NF-κB activity, and inhibition of NF-κB was sufficient to hypersensitize WEHI-231 cells to apoptosis induction following BCR ligation. Our experiments demonstrate that differential expression of RasGRP1 has the potential to acutely determine B cell responses to BCR ligation. But in contrast to what has been found in immature T cells undergoing pre-TCR or TCR-mediated selection, Ras-GRP1 promotes deletion rather than survival in the WEHI-231 model for BCR-mediated selection of immature B cells. Cells and Reagents—WEHI-231 cells were obtained from Mike Gold (University of British Columbia) and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (complete medium). LPS was from Sigma. Bay 11-7082 as well as the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were from Calbiochem. Anti-mouse CD40 and anti-human Thy-1 were from Pharmingen, goat anti-mouse IgM was from Jackson Immunoresearch, and anti-HA was from BABCO/Covance. Antibodies detecting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology. The anti-RasGRP1 antibody (199) was from Santa Cruz. The specificity of this antibody for RasGRP1 has been demonstrated in RasGRP1-deficient thymocytes (11Priatel J.J. Teh S.J. Dower N.A. Stone J.C. Teh H.S. Immunity. 2002; 17: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Antibodies against IκBα (C-21) and Bcl-xL were from Santa Cruz and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively, and their specificities have also been confirmed by analyses of genetically deficient cells (20Goudeau B. Huetz F. Samson S. Di Santo J.P. Cumano A. Beg A. Israel A. Memet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15800-15805Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 21Umeda J. Sano S. Kogawa K. Motoyama N. Yoshikawa K. Itami S. Kondoh G. Watanabe T. Takeda J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CFSE was from Molecular Probes. cDNA Constructs and Retroviral Transduction of WEHI-231 Cells— The full-length HA-tagged RasGRP1 cDNA is identical to the XFL construct previously described (6Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The full-length, HA-tagged R271E, EF hand-deleted, and C1 domain-deleted forms of RasGRP1 were derived from the GEFμ, ΔC1+, and EFΔ mutants (6Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). HA-tagged, wild-type, and G12V mutants of Ras GTPases were constructed in our lab. The wild-type Ras GTPases had a GFP N-terminal fusion, which suppresses cellular responses to Ras activation downstream signaling while retaining the ability to bind RafRBD when GTP-bound. 2B. Guilbault and R. J. Kay, unpublished results. M-Ras Q71L was a generous gift of L. Quilliam (Indiana University). The Bcl-xL cDNA was a generous gift of C. Thompson (University of Pennsylvania). Retroviral vectors were derivatives of CTV vectors (22Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 704-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with or without IRES-mediated expression of GFP or of the extracellular domain of human Thy-1. Transfection of ecotropic packaging cells and viral infection was performed as described (23Krebs D.L. Yang Y. Dang M. Haussmann J. Gold M.R. Methods Cell Sci. 1999; 21: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). After infection, transduced cells were first selected for drug resistance and then further selected for co-expression of human Thy-1 or GFP by sorting on a FacsVantage flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Stimulation of Cells with anti-IgM and Reversal of Apoptosis Induction by Trypsin—WEHI-231 cells in complete medium were stimulated through BCR by the addition of anti-IgM at the concentrations indicated. To reverse the apoptosis induction signal provided by anti-IgM, the cells were rinsed in PBS, treated with 0.025% trypsin in PBS for 10 min at 20 °C, rinsed with PBS, and returned to culture in complete medium. The mechanism by which trypsin treatment reverses the induction of apoptosis that is initiated by anti-IgM treatment is unknown. Trypsinization does not result in the immediate removal of anti-IgM from the cell surface but could cause peptide cleavages that reduce the extent of cross-linking within surface IgM-anti-IgM complexes. Apoptosis Detection Using Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining of Fixed Nuclei—WEHI-231 cells stimulated as indicated were rinsed in PBS containing 0.1% glucose and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 24 h. The cells were then rinsed in PBS and stained with PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide and 200 μg/ml RNaseA overnight in the dark at 20 °C. The cells were then analyzed for PI content by flow cytometry using a FacsCalibur cytometer and Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Cell Division Analysis Using CFSE Labeling—WEHI-231 cells at 105 cells/ml were cultured with or without anti-IgM for 24 h. The cells were then treated with 0.025% trypsin as described above to reverse anti-IgM treatment and plated in fresh medium for 30 min. Up to 2 × 107cells were incubated in 2 ml of PBS containing 9 μm CFSE for 10 min at 37 °C, rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then sorted, cultured for the indicated time and analyzed by flow cytometry. Preparation of Protein Lysates—WEHI-231 cells were cultured in serum-containing medium at 5 to 10 ×105 cells/ml, treated as indicated, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in ice-cold Mg+ lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, plus protease inhibitors). The cytoplasmic fractions were isolated by preparing lysates in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 4 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2 containing protease inhibitors (25Mui A.L. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Total or cytoplasmic lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and protein content was measured prior to Western blot analysis. Affinity Precipitation of Active Ras Proteins—The cells were incubated at 1 ×107 cells/ml in activation buffer (25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1% glucose, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min at 37 °C. Anti-IgM was then added to 20 μg/ml for the indicated times. The stimulations were interrupted by the addition of ice-cold, Mg+ lysis buffer, and the lysate protein content was measured. Affinity precipitation of activated Ras proteins by binding to RafRBD was performed as described (26Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Western Blots—The cell lysates were combined with 1 volume of loading buffer (8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol), separated by electrophoresis on 12.5% acrylamide gels containing SDS, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked overnight with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The membranes were then rinsed twice in TBST incubated overnight at 4 °C or 90 min at room temperature with primary antibody diluted in TBST with 3% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then rinsed four times for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). The ECL chemiluminescence system (Santa Cruz) was used to visualize immunoreactive bands either by film or using the Versadoc 5000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Band volume analysis was performed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). NF-κB Luciferase Assay—5 × 106 cells/ml were suspended in medium containing a reporter gene construct (10 μg/ml, pNF-κB-LUC; Stratagene) in combination with 2 μg/ml of thymidine kinase promoter-dependent Renilla luciferase construct to assess transfection efficiency (pRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI), placed on ice for 20 min, and electroporated at 270 V and 950 microfarads in 4-mm cuvettes (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad). The cells were then rinsed twice with medium, and 106 cells/ml were plated in fresh medium and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and lysed for luciferase assays performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay; Promega). RasGRP1 Enhances Apoptosis of WEHI-231 Cells Following BCR Ligation—WEHI-231 cells express RasGRP1, as determined by Northern blot (6Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and Western blot (Fig. 1). A cDNA encoding full-length, N-terminally HA epitope-tagged murine RasGRP1 was stably expressed in WEHI-231 cells by retroviral transduction. The cDNA-encoded RasGRP1 was expressed in transduced cells at about 1.5-fold higher levels than the endogenous RasGRP1 in control (empty vector-transduced) WEHI-231 cells (Fig. 1). However, endogenous RasGRP1 levels were reduced in the RasGRP1-transduced cells, indicating negative feedback regulation of RasGRP1 translation or turnover. The net result was a 2-fold increase in total RasGRP1 in the cDNA-transduced versus control cells. We will refer to WEHI-231 cells transduced with the RasGRP1 cDNA as RasGRP1high cells, whereas WEHI-231 cells that were concurrently transduced with empty retroviral vector and selected will be referred to as control cells. Two or more independently derived polyclonal sets of control and RasGRP1high cells were used for our experiments, to ensure that variation in phenotypes were a function of RasGRP1 transduction and not due to variation within the cell populations prior to transduction. To test the functionality of the transduced RasGRP1, we compared levels of Ras GTP loading in RasGRP1high cells versus control WEHI-231 cells. There was a marginal increase in GTP-bound K-Ras in RasGRP1high cells prior to BCR ligation, whereas the transient increase in GTP-bound K-Ras that occurs in response to BCR ligation in control WEHI-231 cells was exaggerated and prolonged in RasGRP1high cells (Fig. 2). Activation of N-Ras and H-Ras was also increased in RasGRP1high cells, although with somewhat different kinetics and dependences on BCR ligation (Fig. 2). In the absence of BCR ligation, elevated RasGRP1 expression had no effect on the incidence of apoptosis, as measured by subdiploid DNA content after cell permeabilization (Fig. 3A), and slightly lowered the rate of cell division as measured by dilution of labeling by CFSE (Fig. 3B). Ligation of BCR with anti-IgM for 48 h imposed cell cycle arrest in RasGRP1high and control cells with similar efficiency, but the apoptotic response to BCR ligation was enhanced about 3-fold in the RasGRP1high cells (Fig. 3A). Elevated expression of RasGRP1 was particularly effective at sensitizing WEHI-231 cells to deletion following transient exposure to anti-IgM. When control WEHI-231 cells were treated with anti-IgM for 24 h and then treated with trypsin (see “Experimental Procedures”), they evaded apoptosis and re-entered the cell cycle within 24 h (Fig. 3A), and most of the cells had passed through two cell divisions by 48 h (Fig. 3B). In contrast, a 24-h exposure to anti-IgM followed by trypsin treatment induced apoptosis in about half of the RasGRP1high cells over the next 24 h (Fig. 3A), and the surviving RasGRP1high cells had delayed re-entry into the cell cycle (Fig. 3, A and B). To directly assess differential sensitivities of cells to BCR-induced deletion, control and RasGRP1high cells were co-cultured in anti-IgM for 48 h, after which viable cells of each type were quantified by flow cytometry. There was a 5-fold reduction in viable RasGRP1high cells relative to co-cultured control cells following exposure to anti-IgM (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that a doubling of RasGRP1 expression greatly increased the sensitivity of WEHI-231 cells to deletion by BCR ligation. This experiment also showed that RasGRP1-mediated deletion was autonomous to the RasGRP1high cells. The potential of endogenous RasGRP1 to contribute to BCR-induced apoptosis was addressed by expression of RasGRP1 with a R271E point mutation in the nucleotide exchange domain. This mutation is predicted to prevent binding of Ras GTPases (28Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8117-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and eliminates Ras activation by RasGRP1 (6Tognon C.E. Kirk H.E. Passmore L.A. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 9Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, the R271E mutant suppresses TCR-induced Ras activation specifically at cellular sites where RasGRP1 is activated (9Bivona T.G. Perez De Castro I. Ahearn I.M. Grana T.M. Chiu V.K. Lockyer P.J. Cullen P.J. Pellicer A. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Nature. 2003; 424: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) and therefore acts as a dominant negative for RasGRP1, presumably by competing for positive regulators of RasGRP1 but failing to provide downstream signaling through Ras GTPases. When expressed in WEHI-231 cells at nine times the level of endogenous RasGRP1, the R271E mutant almost completely suppressed BCR-induced apoptosis (R271E2+; Fig. 4), whereas lower expression of R271E resulted in partial inhibition of BCR-induced apoptosis (R271E+; Fig. 4). Assuming that the R271E dominant negative is specific for RasGRP1 in WEHI-231 cells, this apoptosis-suppressing phenotype indicates that endogenous RasGRP1 is essential for efficient induction of apoptosis following BCR ligation. RasGRP1 Contributes to BCR-induced Deletion via the Activation of Ras Family Members—Because the only mechanistic defect of the R271E mutant is an inability to bind to and activate Ras GTPases, the suppression rather than enhancement of BCR-induced apoptosis by R271E implies that enhancement of BCR-induced apoptosis by RasGRP1 occurs through activated Ras GTPases. The ability of Ras activation to trigger apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells was tested by expression of G12V mutants of K-Ras, N-Ras, or H-Ras, which are GTPase-defective and thus constitutively activated. After infection with retroviral vectors expressing the G12V Ras mutants, transduced cells were selected by a combination of drug resistance and sorting for expression of a co-transduced cell surface marker. The expression of each of the G12V Ras GTPases was very low in the selected WEHI-231 cells (data not shown), but despite this the G12V Ras-transduced cells that could be recovered following selection had enhanced sensitivity to BCR-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5), albeit with considerable variation among experiments. These G12V Ras GTPases can be expressed at high levels when transduced by the same vectors into other cell types (data not shown), so the inability to recover highly expressing WEHI-231 cells even after vigorous selection implies that the WEHI-231 cells that acquired proviruses conferring high G12V expression were deleted during the selection, in the absence of BCR ligation. The weakly expressing cells that were selectable had Ras signaling below a threshold required for BCR-independent deletion but sufficient to synergize with BCR in inducing apoptosis. M-Ras Q71L is an activated Ras GTPase that, in comparison with H-Ras G12V, provides lower signaling intensity through Ras-activated signaling pathways (29Quilliam L.A. Castro A.F. Rogers-Graham K.S. Martin C.B. Der C.J. Bi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23850-23857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). M-Ras Q71L-transduced WEHI-231 cells could be readily selected and were consistently more sensitive to BCR-induced apoptosis than control cells (Fig. 5). Combined, these results indicate that Ras signaling at low intensity (via M-Ras Q71L or via proviral insertions providing very low expression of G12V Ras mutants) synergizes with BCR signaling to induce apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells, whereas high intensity signaling from Ras GTPases is not tolerated in these cells, presumably because this causes deletion in the absence of BCR signaling. Role of BCR in Apoptosis Induction by RasGRP1—BCR ligation is necessary for apoptosis induction via RasGRP1 (Fig. 3A). This could be due to synergy between RasGRP1-mediated Ras activation and parallel BCR-initiated signaling pathways not involving Ras activation. Alternatively, the requirement for BCR ligation could reflect activation of RasGRP1 by BCR-initiated signaling pathways. Previous work has defined an activation mechanism for RasGRP1 that requires membrane translocation via binding of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol to the C1 domain of RasGRP1 (3Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone"
https://openalex.org/W2043476448,"It is widely held that growth factor signaling is terminated by lysosomal degradation of its activated receptor and the endocytosed growth factor is transported to lysosomes. Nuclear targeting is another important pathway through which signals of growth factors are mediated. However, mechanisms underlying desensitization of nuclear targeting growth factors are poorly understood. Here we report that the nuclear targeting pathway is down-regulated by the proteasome system. Degradation of endocytosed midkine, a heparin-binding growth factor, was suppressed by both proteasome and lysosome inhibitors to similar extents. By contrast, a proteasome inhibitor, but not lysosome ones, accelerated the nuclear accumulation of midkine. An expression vector of signal sequence-less midkine, which is produced in the cytosol, was constructed because endocytosed midkine may be translocated to the cytosol from cellular compartments before entering the nucleus. The cytosol-produced midkine underwent proteasomal degradation and accumulated in the nucleus as did the endocytosed midkine. It was polyubiquitinated, and its nuclear accumulation was enhanced by a proteasome inhibitor. We further dissected the midkine molecule to investigate roles in degradation and trafficking. The N-terminal half-domain of midkine was significantly more susceptible to proteasomal degradation, whereas the C-terminal half-domain was sufficient for nuclear localization. Together, these data highlight the desensitization of nuclear targeting by growth factors and indicate a critical role of the proteasome system in it."

Using fluorescence stopped-flow kinetic studies, we have discerned the conformational changes in the Rho protein that occur upon nucleotide and nucleic acid binding. We show that the 2′, (3′)-O-[N-methylanthraniloyl] derivative of ATP (mant-ATP) is a good fluorescent substrate of Rho and is hydrolyzed with a Km comparable with that for ATP but a kcat five to six times slower than that for ATP. The kinetics of ATP and mant-ATP binding indicates that, in the absence of RNA, the Rho protein is structurally distinct from the Rho hexamer found when bound to RNA or DNA. In the absence of RNA, the nucleotide-binding rates are 50- to 70-fold slower, and the dissociation rates are 40- to 120-fold slower than the corresponding rates in the presence of RNA. We conclude that RNA or DNA binding to the primary nucleic acid binding sites causes conformational changes in the Rho hexamer that result in the opening of the subunit interfaces. Furthermore, the kinetic studies revealed a unique protein conformational change in the Rho·RNA complex upon ATP binding that is a result of RNA contacting the secondary nucleic acid binding sites in the central channel of the Rho ring.

The Escherichia coli transcription termination factor Rho is a hexameric protein that has the ability to unwind RNA/DNA heteroduplexes (1Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T.

Cell. 2003; 114: 157-159Google Scholar, 5Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 251-260Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which Rho causes transcription termination is not known, Rho protein binds nascent mRNA at specific loading sites, and it is believed that Rho translocates along RNA until it reaches the transcription complex, where it disrupts the transcription ternary complex (3Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Google Scholar, 6Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7754-7758Google Scholar). Translocation along nucleic acid is, therefore, a basic activity of Rho similar to helicases (7Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Google Scholar, 8Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Google Scholar), and understanding it requires the knowledge of how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis events at the multiple nucleotide-binding sites on the Rho hexamer are coordinated to the mechanics of protein translocation. In this study, we measured the kinetics of nucleotide binding to Rho complexed to RNA or DNA that reveal conformational changes in the Rho protein that we believe are important for RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis. E. coli Rho protein contains two types of nucleic acid binding sites, referred to as the primary and the secondary sites (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar). The primary nucleic acid binding sites reside in the N-terminal domains that form a crown over the Rho hexamer (10Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Google Scholar), and these sites bind pyrimidine-rich DNA or RNA with a high affinity (11Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Google Scholar). In addition to wrapping around the primary sites, the RNA but not the DNA interacts with the secondary sites in the central channel of the hexamer (12Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Google Scholar). The kinetics of RNA binding to the Rho hexamer showed that the initial binding of RNA occurs at a diffusion-limited rate constant to the primary sites (13Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Google Scholar). The primary sites act as loading sites that facilitate the binding or RNA loading into the central channel. Poly(C) RNA stimulates the Rho ATPase activity nearly 105-fold, and it needs to contact both the primary and the secondary sites for ATPase stimulation (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar, 14McSwiggen J.A. Bear D.G. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 609-622Google Scholar). A recent crystallography analysis shows an open ring structure of the Rho hexamer that resembles a lock washer (10Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Google Scholar), similar to the structures observed by electron microscopy (15Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, the RNA or the DNA is wrapped around the primary sites, but the RNA is not contacting the secondary sites. Although AMPPNP 1The abbreviations used are: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; mant-ATP, 2′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine-5′-triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). nucleotide is bound to each subunit interface, the interfaces are open and not fully organized to catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP, and Mg(II) is not evident. It was proposed that this structure of Rho represents a state that is poised to load the RNA into the central channel, and that when RNA contacts the secondary sites in the central channel, it will lead to ring closure and the stimulation of ATP hydrolysis. We have measured the kinetics of nucleotide binding utilizing ATP, fluorescent ATP, and unhydrolyzable ATP analogs to characterize the conformational changes in the Rho protein upon nucleotide and nucleic acid binding. Our results show that the structure of RNA-free Rho is distinct from the RNA- or DNA-bound Rho hexamer. The kinetics of nucleotide binding and dissociation show that the ATP-binding sites are not readily accessible, indicating that the subunit interfaces are closed in the absence of RNA. In the presence of RNA or DNA, the association and dissociation of nucleotides from Rho become fast, indicating that the subunit interfaces are open when RNA or DNA is bound to the primary sites. With the Rho·RNA complex but not the DNA complex, the fast bimolecular binding of ATP is followed by a protein conformational change at a rate very close to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Based on the observed kinetics of nucleotide binding, we propose that the protein conformational change after ATP binding represents RNA binding to the secondary sites and possibly ring closure that results in a Rho hexamer that is competent in nucleotide hydrolysis and translocation. Protein, RNA, and Buffer—Rho protein was over-expressed in E. coli strain HB101 transformed with pKS26R (rho; ampr) and pNT203 (λcI857/λN; tetr) that was kindly provided by Dr. Katsuya Shigesada (Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (16Mori H. Imai M. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 39-49Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was sequenced, and the wild-type Rho sequence was confirmed. The cells were grown at 32 °C, and Rho was heat-induced at 42 °C and purified according to the procedure of Finger and Richardson (17Finger L.R. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1640-1645Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Rho protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.325 (mg/ml)–1 cm–1 (18Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Google Scholar). The indicated Rho protein concentration is in hexamer hereafter. Poly(C) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Poly(C) RNA had a reported S20,w value of 7.1 in 0.015 m NaCl, 0.0015 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0, with an average length of 420 bases, and its concentration was determined by UV absorption at 269 nm using an extinction coefficient of 6200 m–1 cm–1 for the cytosine base. RNA was dissolved in TE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA) and used without further purification. dC100 was chemically synthesized and gel purified before use. Tris buffer contains 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Nucleotides and Nucleotide Analogs—ATP, AMPPNP, and ATPγS were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. 3′-Mant-2′-dATP was purchased from Jena Bioscience, and 2′-mant-3′-dATP was a kind gift from Dr. Susan Gilbert (University of Pittsburgh). 2′, (3′)-Mant-ATP was synthesized (19Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Google Scholar) and characterized as described (20Jameson D.M. Eccleston J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 363-390Google Scholar). N-Methylisatoic anhydride purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) was used to fluorescently label the adenine nucleotide. The resulting products were fractionated using a DEAE-Sephacel column with a linear gradient of 20 mm to 1.0 m triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.6). The nucleotides were resolved by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60, F254 (Aldrich Chemicals) in 1-propanol/NH4OH/water 6:3:1 (v/v), containing 0.5 g/liter EDTA. The nucleotide analogs display a brilliant blue fluorescence, whereas the N-methylanthranilic acid shows violet fluorescence when excited at 366 nm. The fractions with A256/A356 ratio of 4 corresponded to the monosubstituted 2′, (3′)-mant-ATP (21Moore K.J. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14550-14564Google Scholar). Mant-ATP Hydrolysis—The kinetics of mant-ATP hydrolysis in the presence of RNA was measured by quantifying the product phosphate using the molybdate method (22Piper J.M. Lovell S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 70-75Google Scholar). Mant-ATP hydrolysis was not observed in the absence of RNA. Rho protein (0.1 μm) and poly(C) RNA (0.134 μm) were mixed with mant-ATP in Tris buffer at 18 °C. Initial mant-ATPase rates were plotted against [mant-ATP] and fit to a hyperbola to obtain the steady-state kinetic parameters. Stopped-flow Kinetics of Nucleotide Binding—The rapid kinetic measurements were carried out in a stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (Model SF-2001) manufactured by KinTek Corp. (Austin, TX). Equal volumes of Rho, Rho·poly(C), or Rho·dC100 in Tris buffer from one syringe were mixed with ATP or ATP analogs from a second syringe at 18 °C. With the nonfluorescent nucleotides (ATP, AMPPNP, or ATPγS), the samples were excited at 290 nm and fluorescence at λem > 345 nm was monitored using a long pass filter (LP 345 filter from Oriel Corp.). With the mant-nucleotides, sensitized fluorescence due to FRET was monitored at 450 nm using a band-pass filter (440 nm < λem < 460 nm) from Oriel Corp. after excitation at 290 nm. Three to six kinetics traces were averaged and fit to one or the sum of two exponentials in F(t)=A1*exp(-k1×t)+A2*exp(-k2×t)+C(Eq. 1) where F(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t, C is a constant representing the fluorescence intensity at t = ∞, A1 and A2 are the fluorescence amplitudes, and k1 and k2 are the observed rate constants. Stopped-flow Kinetics of Mant-ATP Dissociation from Rho—The dissociation kinetics of mant-ATP from Rho·RNA complex was measured in a stopped-flow instrument equipped with a double mixer. Rho protein and poly(C) RNA from one syringe were mixed with mant-ATP from a second syringe into an aging tube for t1 = 10 ms to 1.0 s. The aged solution was then mixed with ATP from a third syringe into the observation cuvette. Both the sensitized (λex of 290 nm and λem at 450 nm) and direct mant-ATP fluorescence (λex of 345 nm and λem at 450 nm) was measured. Release of mant-ATP from Rho in the absence of RNA was also studied. Rho and mant-ATP in one syringe was rapidly mixed with ATP from a second syringe. The mant-ATP dissociation kinetic data were fit to one or the sum of two exponentials (Eq. 1) to obtain the rates and amplitudes. Kinetics of Nucleotide Binding to Rho—The kinetics of nucleotide binding were measured by following the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of Rho after it was rapidly mixed with the nucleotide in a stopped-flow instrument. Each subunit of Rho hexamer contains one tryptophan close to the nucleotide-binding site at the subunit interface (10Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Google Scholar). When Rho was mixed with ATP in a stopped-flow instrument, a time-dependent decrease in protein fluorescence was observed (Fig. 1A). The protein fluorescence change was small, and thus many traces were averaged to obtain the ATP binding kinetics. The observed rate of the protein fluorescence change increased linearly with [ATP] (Fig. 1B), and the slope (0.035 ± 0.0016 μm–1 s–1) provided an estimate of the ATP binding rate, and the y-intercept (0.2 s–1) provided an estimate of the ATP dissociation rate. Similar experiments with the unhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, provided a binding rate of 0.045 ± 0.002 μm–1s–1 similar to the ATP-binding rate (Table I).Table IKinetics of nucleotide binding to the Rho proteinNucleotidekony-InterceptSecond phase ratey-Interceptμm-1 s-1s-1μm-1 s-1s-1ATP0.035 (± 0.002)0.2 (± 0.4)ndand, undetectablendAMPPNP0.045 (± 0.002)1.3 (± 0.25)ndndMant-ATP0.07 (± 0.007)0.89 (± 0.1)0.008 (± 0.001)0.14 (± 0.01)ATP + poly(C)2.5 (± 0.1)7.8 (± 2.5)47 (± 0.6)1.2 (± 0.7)AMPPNP + poly(C)0.017 (± 0.004)0.82 (± 0.04)ndndATPγS + poly(C)2.370Mant-ATP + poly(C)3.6 (± 0.1)6.2 (± 1.5)0.2 (± 0.02)1.5 (± 0.54)3′-mant-2′-dATP + poly(C)1.2 (± 0.05)11.6 (± 1.5)ndnd2′-mant-3′-dATP + poly(C)0.78 (± 0.024)10 (± 0.8)ndndMant-ATP + dC1000.5 (± 0.08)5.5 (± 1.9)0.1 (± 0.02)0.7 (± 0.34)a nd, undetectable Open table in a new tab Kinetics of Nucleotide Binding to Rho·poly(C)—Next, we measured the kinetics of ATP binding to the Rho·poly(C) complex. Biphasic kinetics were observed upon mixing ATP with a complex of Rho and poly(C) RNA. An initial time-dependent increase in protein fluorescence was followed by a decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 2A). The fluorescence enhancement rate increased linearly with [ATP], with a slope of 2.5 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 and a y-intercept of 7.8 ± 2.5 s–1 (Fig. 2C). The fluorescencequenching rate increased hyperbolically with increasing [ATP], reaching a plateau value (kmax) of 47 ± 0.6 s–1 with a K ½ = 23 ± 1.4 μm (Fig. 2D). Because the rate of each phase depends upon [ATP], both phases are coupled to the ATP-binding step. The fast phase measures the bimolecular ATP-binding step, because the rate increases linearly with [ATP]. Comparison of the ATP-binding rate with and without RNA shows that the Rho·RNA binds ATP about 70-times faster than the RNA-free Rho. Thus, the ATP-binding sites are more accessible when RNA is bound to the Rho hexamer. The second phase, which was observed only with the Rho·RNA complex upon ATP-binding, must correspond to a protein conformational change, because the rate increases hyperbolically with [ATP] (23Johnson K.A. Sigman D.S. The Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1992: 1-61Google Scholar). Because the kinetic parameters (kmax and K ½) of the second phase are close to the ATPase kcat (35–40 s–1) and Km (30 μm) values in the presence of poly(C), the second phase may be associated with either the ATP hydrolysis step or a conformational change prior to ATP hydrolysis. To determine whether the second phase was associated with ATP hydrolysis or a step prior to ATP hydrolysis, the binding of AMPPNP and ATPγS was measured. With the unhydrolyzable AMPPNP analog, only a time-dependent increase in protein fluorescence was observed (data not shown). The observed rate increased with [AMPPNP] linearly to provide an AMPPNP-binding rate of 0.017 ± 0.004 μm–1 s–1 (Table I). This rate is similar to that of AMPPNP binding in the absence of RNA. Thus, RNA does not stimulate the AMPPNP-binding rate. In addition, the protein conformational change that we observed upon ATP binding was not present upon AMPPNP binding. This might suggest that the protein conformational change is associated with ATP hydrolysis. However, the kinetics of ATPγS binding to the Rho·RNA complex were biphasic and similar to ATP. Mixing of Rho·RNA complex with ATPγS led to a transient increase in protein fluorescence followed by a decrease, similar to ATP binding (data not shown). The binding rate of ATPγS (2.3 μm–1 s–1) is similar to the ATP-binding rate, and the conformational change following nucleotide binding occurred with a kmax of 70 s–1 and a K ½ of 30 μm (Table I). Thus, unlike AMPPNP, ATPγS seems to be a good analog of ATP. The results with ATPγS indicate that the second phase represents a protein conformational change that occurs before ATP hydrolysis. It is possible that the protein conformational change represents RNA contacting the secondary sites in the central channel of the Rho ring, because this step is necessary for the hydrolysis of ATP (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar). Kinetics of ATP Binding to Rho·polydC—To explore the possibility that the protein conformational change following ATP binding is associated with the RNA contacting the secondary sites, we measured the kinetics of ATP binding to the Rho·dC100 complex. It has been shown that polydC binds to the primary nucleic acid binding sites that reside in the N-terminal domain of the Rho protein, but not to the secondary RNA-binding sites in the central channel of the Rho ring (24Wei R.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28380-28387Google Scholar). polydC does not stimulate the hydrolysis of ATP (9Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Google Scholar, 25Lowery C. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1381-1385Google Scholar). After mixing ATP with Rho·dC100 in a stopped-flow instrument, a small increase in protein fluorescence was observed, but the ATP-induced conformational change characterized by the decrease in protein fluorescence was not observed (Fig. 2B). The lack of the second phase was not due to a defect in ATP binding to the Rho·DNA complex, because (as shown below) mant-ATP binds to Rho·dC100 at a stimulated rate. Because the protein conformational change is observed only with the Rho·RNA complex, the experiments of ATP binding to Rho·DNA support the idea that the protein conformational change is associated with the RNA binding to the secondary sites. Mant-ATP as a Fluorescent ATP Analog—We have investigated here the use of mant-ATP (Fig. 3A) as a fluorescent analog of ATP to carry out sensitive nucleotide-binding measurements. In many NTPase, it has been shown that the kinetics and thermodynamics of mant-nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are very similar to the parent nucleotides; hence, mant-nucleotides are widely used analogs (20Jameson D.M. Eccleston J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 363-390Google Scholar). The spectral properties of the mant fluorophore are ideally suitable for monitoring nucleotide binding by FRET from Trp to the mant fluorophore bound at the ATP-binding site. Fig. 3B shows the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of Rho protein and mant-ATP. The emission spectrum of Rho protein overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the mant-nucleotide indicating the possibility of FRET. Before using mant-ATP in nucleotide-binding kinetic experiments, we measured the kcat and Km of mant-ATP hydrolysis. No hydrolysis was observed in the absence of RNA similar to what is observed with ATP. In the presence of poly(C) RNA, the kcat of mant-ATP hydrolysis is 6.5 s–1 at 18 °C (Fig. 3C), which is 5- to 6-fold slower than the kcat of ATP hydrolysis under similar reaction conditions. The Km of mant-ATP (48 ± 6.6 μm) is similar to the ATP Km (30 μm). These results indicate that mant-ATP is a good ATP analog that can be used to study nucleotide binding. Kinetics of Mant-ATP Binding to Rho—The kinetics of mant-ATP binding to Rho protein was measured by using the stopped-flow method via FRET. Rho protein was rapidly mixed with mant-ATP, and the time-dependent increase in fluorescence due to FRET was monitored by exciting Rho at 290 nm and monitoring mant-ATP emission at longer wavelengths (440 nm < λem < 460 nm). The kinetics of mant-ATP binding was biphasic (Fig. 4A). The fast phase rate increased linearly with mant-ATP concentration (Fig. 4B), with a slope of 0.07 ± 0.007 μm–1 s–1 and a y-intercept of 0.9 ± 0.1 s–1. The slope of the fast phase dependence is very close to the bimolecular rate of ATP binding (Table I). Similar biphasic kinetics but at faster rates was observed for mant-ATP binding to the Rho·poly(C) complex (Fig. 5A). The fast phase of the observed biphasic kinetics increased linearly (Fig. 5B) with a slope of 3.6 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 and a y-intercept of 6.2 ± 1.5 s–1. These values are very similar to the fast phase of ATP binding in the presence of RNA (Table I). Thus, it is clear that the fast phase represents the initial binding of mant-ATP to Rho or the Rho·RNA complex. However, the origin of the slow phase is less clear. The slow phase could represent a conformational change in Rho upon mant-ATP binding. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that the two phases in mant-ATP binding arise from the two isomers of mant-ATP; that is, the mant group linked to the 2′-hydroxyl versus the 3′-hydroxyl group. It is known that the synthesis of mant-ATP provides an equilibrium mixture of 2′- and 3′-isomer of mant-ATP with a yield of 35 and 65%, respectively (26Cremo C.R. Neuron J.M. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3309-3319Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the interactions of Rho with two additional mant-nucleotide derivatives, where the fluorophore was attached specifically to the 3′-hydroxyl (3′-mant-2′-deoxy) or the 2′-hydroxyl (2′-mant 3′-deoxy) of the ribose ring. Both the mant-dATP analogs bind to Rho·poly(C) in a single kinetic phase (Fig. 5, C and E). The observed rates increased linearly with [nucleotide], as shown in Fig. 5, D and F. The slopes indicated that the 3′-mant-2′-dATP binds slightly faster than the 2′-mant-3′-dATP (Table I). Thus, it seems that the two phases in mant-ATP binding kinetics are due to the slightly different binding properties of the 2′- and 3′-isomers. Mant-ATP binding was also measured to the Rho·dC100 complex. The kinetics of nucleotide binding is fast when DNA is complexed to the Rho protein. The fast phase rate increased linearly with nucleotide concentration to provide a slope of 0.5 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 and a y-intercept of 5.5 ± 1.9 s–1 (Table I). Thus, the binding of dC100 to the Rho hexamer increases the nucleotide-binding rate about 7-fold. Kinetics of Mant-ATP Dissociation from Rho—To determine the effect of RNA on the dissociation kinetics of nucleotide, we measured the off rate of mant-ATP in the absence and in the presence of RNA. Mant-ATP was pre-mixed with Rho and RNA for a short time (t1 = 10 ms to 1.0 s) using the three-syringe set up of the stopped-flow instrument to minimize mant-ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6A for the double-mixing setup). After the short preincubation period, Rho·RNA·mant-ATP complex was chased with excess ATP. Dissociation of mant-ATP from the Rho·RNA complex was determined by monitoring the mant-ATP fluorescence decrease after excitation at 345 nm. Fig. 6B shows a representative time course of mant-ATP fluorescence decrease. The dissociation kinetics best fit to the sum of two exponentials. The first phase shows mant-ATP release close to 9 s–1, and the second phase, accounting for nearly 40% of the total fluorescence change amplitude, shows a slightly slower mant-ATP release of 3 s–1. We made sure that the rates of the two phases were not dependent upon the preincubation time (t1), which was tested up to 1.0 s. Fig. 6C shows that in the absence of added RNA, mant-ATP release is dramatically slower (0.07 s–1). The stopped-flow kinetics in this study show that the nucleotide-binding rates are much faster when Rho is complexed to RNA as compared with the RNA-free Rho protein. Nucleotides such as ATP, ATPγS, and mant-ATP bind to the Rho·RNA complex with similar association rates of the order of 106m–1 s–1. The RNA-free Rho protein, on the other hand, binds ATP and mant-ATP with a slow association rate of the order of 104m–1 s–1. The same trend was observed in the rate of nucleotide release from Rho. When RNA is bound to Rho, mant-nucleotide release is fast, whereas the RNA-free Rho slowly dissociates the bound mant-ATP. The 50- to 70-fold slower rate of nucleotide binding and the 40- to 120-fold slower rate of nucleotide release in the absence of RNA indicates that the structure of RNA-free Rho is different from the one complexed with the RNA cofactor (Fig. 7). It is known that the RNA wraps around and binds with a high affinity to the primary RNA-binding sites in the N-terminal domain of Rho (3Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Google Scholar, 27Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Google Scholar, 28Yu X. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1279-1287Google Scholar, 29Bogden C.E. Fass D. Bergman N. Nichols M.D. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 487-493Google Scholar). Our results indicate that RNA binding to the primary sites causes a conformational change in the quaternary structure of Rho that exposes the nucleotide-binding sites at the subunit interface and renders them more accessible to the incoming and outgoing nucleotides (Fig. 7). This is in agreement with the result that the mant-ATP binding rate is stimulated by dC100, which binds only to the primary sites. The association rate of mant-ATP for the Rho·polydC complex is, however, only 7-fold greater than the association rate of mant-ATP to free Rho, whereas the association rate of mant-ATP for the Rho·poly(C) complex is 50- to 70-fold greater. Hence, the complex of Rho with RNA must be structurally distinct from the complex of Rho with DNA. However, this was not evident from the crystal structure of the Rho hexamer with oligo(C) and oligodC (10Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Google Scholar). The studies of nucleotide binding in this paper and the previous studies of RNA binding (13Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Google Scholar) indicate that there is cooperativity between the nucleic acid and the nucleotide-binding sites. When RNA is bound to Rho, the ATP-binding kinetics are biphasic, and the experiments in this study provide evidence for a protein conformational change following ATP binding that results in RNA binding to the secondary-binding sites. The protein conformational change was observed with ATPγS but not the unhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP. Thus, conformational changes in the nucleic acid binding site are caused by specific interactions of the nucleotide with the Rho hexamer. Similarly, DNA does not stimulate the rate of nucleotide binding to the extent that RNA does, which indicates that DNA and RNA induces distinct changes in the nucleotide-binding sites. The protein conformational change as a result of ATP binding to the Rho·RNA complex occurs at about 47 s–1, which is very close to the rate of RNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis (35–40 s–1). We propose that the Rho hexamer becomes competent in ATP hydrolysis and translocation upon undergoing this conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W2070152466,"Two multiprotein E3 (ubiquitin-protein ligase) ubiquitin ligases, the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box) and the APC/C (anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome), are vital in ensuring the temporal order of the cell cycle. Particularly, timely destruction of cyclins via these two E3s is essential for down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase. In general, G1 and S phase cyclins are ubiquitylated by the SCF, whereas ubiquitylation of mitotic cyclins is catalyzed by the APC/C. Here we show that fission yeast S phase cyclin Cig2 is ubiquitylated and degraded via both the SCF and the APC/C. Cig2 instability during G2 and M phase is dependent upon the SCF complex, whereas the APC/C is responsible for Cig2 destruction during anaphase and G1, thereby ensuring a spike pattern of Cig2 levels, peaking only at S phase. Two F-box/WD proteins Pop1 and Pop2, homologues of budding yeast Cdc4 and human Fbw7, are responsible for Cig2 instability. Pop1 binds Cig2 in vivo. An in vitro binding assay shows that an internal 93 amino acid residues comprising a part of the cyclin box are necessary and sufficient for this binding. Cig2 phosphorylation is also required for interaction with Pop1. We previously showed that transcriptional oscillation of cig2+ requires Pop1 and Pop2 function. SCFPop1/Pop2 therefore regulates Cig2 levels in a dual manner, transcriptionally and post-translationally. Our results also highlight a collaborative action of the APC/C and the SCF toward the common substrate Cig2.

This type of composite degradation control may be more general as the regulatory mechanism in other complex systems. Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis plays a crucial role in a variety of biological systems. In this pathway, ubiquitin is transferred via a series of reactions to substrate proteins, and multiubiquitylated proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar, 2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Google Scholar). Timing and substrate specificity of proteolysis are determined by a ubiquitin ligase or E3. 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; E2, ubiquitin-carrier protein; APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; SCF, Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin. Two E3s that comprise multiprotein components are of particular importance for cell cycle progression. These are termed the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-1-F-box) and the APC/cyclosome (anaphase promoting complex, referred to as the APC/C hereafter) (3Peters J.-M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Google Scholar, 4Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Google Scholar, 5Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Google Scholar). The SCF complex consists of three invariant components including Skp1, Cullin-1, and Rbx1/Roc1/Hrt1 and various F-box proteins. Skp1 and Cullin-1 are required for the structural organization of the SCF complex, whereas Rbx1 is a RING-finger protein that interacts with E2-ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (6Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

F-box proteins play a unique role in SCF function, as they interact with Skp1 via their F-box motif and simultaneously bind specific substrates, thereby acting as receptors that recruit these substrates to the SCF complex. The genome of each organism contains multiple open reading frames encoding F-box proteins, the number of which generally ranges from 15 to 50 (8Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1 (Reviews3002)Google Scholar), and each F-box protein is responsible for recruiting individual substrates to the SCF complex (9Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Google Scholar). Structurally, F-box proteins consist of two domains: an N-terminally proximal F-box and a C-terminal protein-protein interaction motif. The latter includes WD40 repeats and leucine-rich repeats. Cell cycle progression is governed by the master kinase cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk), which consists of a catalytic cdk subunit and regulatory cyclin subunit (10Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Google Scholar, 11Krylov D.M. Nasmyth K. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 173-177Google Scholar). Although metazoans have evolved to contain multiple species of cdk and cyclin subunits, unicellular organisms such as yeast utilize a single cdk molecule, Cdc2 in fission yeast and Cdc28 in budding yeast, which comprises distinct cdk forms by interacting with different types of cyclins (12Nasmyth K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 405-412Google Scholar). To regulate the cell cycle, cyclin levels must oscillate, thus cyclin proteolysis plays a central role in the down-regulation of cdk activities. Mitotic B-type cyclins such as cyclin A and B are ubiquitylated by the APC/C in a “destruction box”-dependent fashion (13Murray A.W. Solomona M.J. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Google Scholar, 14Sudakin V. Ganoth D. Dahan A. Heller H. Hershko J. Luca F.C. Ruderman J.V. Hershko A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 185-198Google Scholar, 15Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-441Google Scholar). In contrast, G1 and S phase cyclins such as budding yeast Cln1 and Cln2 and mammalian cyclin D and E are ubiquitylated by the SCF (16Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Google Scholar, 17Moberg K.H. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C. Haber D.A. Hariharan I.K. Nature. 2001; 413: 311-316Google Scholar, 18Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P.

Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Google Scholar). In fission yeast, intracellular levels of S phase cyclin Cig2 are subject to tight control during the cell cycle in which the Cig2 protein exists as a sharp spike pattern, peaking only at S phase (21Martin-Castellanos C. Labib K. Moreno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 839-849Google Scholar, 22Fisher D. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 850-860Google Scholar, 23Mondesert O. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1527-1533Google Scholar). This is achieved by both transcriptional and post-translational, namely proteolytic, mechanisms. We previously showed that the APC/C and the SCF coordinately act to keep Cig2 levels low outside S phase (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). The APC/C is required for Cig2 destruction from anaphase onset throughout G1 phase, whereas cell cycle-dependent transcription, peaking at S phase, requires the SCF. We showed that two F-box/WD repeat proteins, Pop1 and Pop2 (25Kominami K. Toda T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Google Scholar, 26Kominami K. Ochotorena I. Toda T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 721-735Google Scholar, 27Jallepalli P.V. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8159-8164Google Scholar), homologues of budding yeast Cdc4 and human hCdc4/Fbw7, are required for this periodic cig2+ transcription. In pop mutants, the cig2+ transcript is no longer cell cycle-regulated, its level instead being constitutive throughout the cell cycle (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). We envisage that some transcription factor(s) responsible for transcriptional fluctuation of cig2+ is degraded via SCFPop1/Pop2, although the identity of this factor remains unknown. Interestingly, in addition to these two regulatory pathways, the third mechanism underlying Cig2 down-regulation is functional, by degradation of Cig2 during G2 (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). We have shown that this Cig2 instability during G2 is Skp1-dependent. However, whether this role for Skp1 in Cig2 degradation requires SCF function or whether it is specific to Skp1 independently of the SCF complex (28Hermand D. Bamps S. Tafforeau L. Vandenhaute J. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9671-9677Google Scholar) remains elusive. In the current study, we address the question as to how Skp1 regulates Cig2 stability. We have shown that Pop1 and Pop2 are in fact required for Cig2 instability during G2. Cig2 is also unstable during M phase, in which SCFPop1/Pop2 functions independent of the APC/C. Pop1 binds Cig2 both in vivo and in vitro. Domain analysis of Cig2 shows that the region required for binding to Pop1 is independent of the N-terminal “destruction box”; instead, the internal 93 amino acid residues containing the “cyclin box” are responsible in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Strains and Fission Yeast Methods—Strains used in this study are found in Supplementary Table S1. Standard methods for Schizosaccharomyces pombe were followed as described (29Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 773-782Google Scholar). Gene Disruption—The entire open reading frame of each F-box-encoding gene was disrupted using PCR-generated fragments (30Bähler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Google Scholar). The 1.8-kb ura4+ or 1.6-kb kanr gene was amplified with flanking sequences corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the relevant genes. These fragments were transformed into a ura4/ura4 diploid. Ura+ or G418r colonies were selected on minimal plates lacking uracil or rich plates containing G418, respectively. Correct disruption of genes of interest was verified by colony PCR using two primers, one from the ura4+ or kanr marker gene and the other from the deleted gene. These heterozygous diploids were then sporulated on plates lacking nitrogen. Asci were dissected, and germination of haploid segregants monitored. Out of 16 F-box-encoding open reading frames, two genes (pof1+ and pof6+) are essential, whereas the remaining 14 genes are non-essential for cell division (31Katayama S. Kitamura K. Lehmann A. Nikaido O. Toda T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 211-224Google Scholar, 32Lehmann A. Katayama S. Harrison C. Dhut S. Kitamura K. McDonald N. Toda T. Genes Cells. 2004; (DOI: 10.111/j.1356-9597.2004.00730.x)Google Scholar) Synchronous Culture—For hydroxyurea arrest release experiments, hydroxyurea (10 mm) was added to exponentially growing strains in rich YE5S medium, incubated for 2 h, filtered, resuspended in fresh rich medium in the absence of hydroxyurea. In some experiments, growth temperatures were shifted from the permissive (26 °C for temperature-sensitive and 30 °C for nda3 strains) to the restrictive temperature (36 °C for temperature-sensitive strains and 20 °C for cold-sensitive strains). In Vitro Binding Assay—Cig2/dm (destruction box mutant) (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar) or Cig2 N-terminally or C-terminally truncated constructs, Cdc13, Cdc18, or Rum1, was labeled with [35S]methionine plus cysteine (Promix, Amersham Biosciences) in a coupled in vitro transcription-translation system (TnT, Promega). All the plasmids were subcloned into vector plasmids with PCR-based methods. The labeled proteins were incubated with Cdc2 kinase (beads) and GST-Pop1 at 30 °C for 30 min (input). The Cdc2 kinase was purified from nda3-arrested extracts (0.65 mg) by Suc1 beads. Then, GST-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were added into the input reactions and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound fractions were separated by centrifugation and washed five times with binding buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm orthovanadate). The bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm GSH, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. λ-Phosphatase Treatment—The dephosphorylation of Cig2 in binding assays was carried out by incubating the input Cig2 in 1× λ protein phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MnCl2) containing 80 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 20 min. To inhibit λ protein phosphatase, the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) was added at 2.5 mm final concentration. Immunochemical Method—Total cell extracts were prepared after boiling followed by disruption of cells with glass beads as described (25Kominami K. Toda T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were prepared without boiling. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (αTub) antibody (Sigma), anti-HA antibody (16B12, Berkeley Antibody), anti-Cdc2 antibody and anti-Cig2 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdc13 antibody, anti-Cdc18 antibody, and anti-Rum1 antibody were used. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and a chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) were used to detect bound antibody. For immunoprecipitation, 1 mg of soluble cell extracts, 2.5 μg of anti-HA antibody (16B12, Berkeley Antibody), and a 30-μl slurry of Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were used. The F-box Proteins Pop1 and Pop2 Are Required for Cig2 Degradation in Exponentially Growing Cells—Fission yeast Cig2 is unstable during most of the cell cycle, where Skp1, a core component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase, is needed for this instability (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). To ask whether Skp1-dependent instability of the Cig2 protein requires F-box proteins, all the 16 open reading frames encoding F-box proteins in the fission yeast genome were disrupted, and the steady state amount of Cig2 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-Cig2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, although Cig2 levels were not up-regulated in most of the deletion strains, mutants carrying deletions in three F-box-encoding genes, pop1, pop2, and pof7, appeared to result in elevated levels of Cig2. To address the protein stability of Cig2 in these three disruptants, the half-life of Cig2 was next examined. Exponentially growing cultures of each deletion strain were treated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, thereby shutting off de novo protein synthesis, and residual Cig2 levels were examined afterward. As shown in Fig. 1B, in pof7 mutants, Cig2 was as unstable as in wild type cells. Also, accumulation of Cig2 in this mutant was not reproducible (data not shown). In clear contrast, in pop1 and pop2 mutants, Cig2 was indeed stabilized substantially, and the half-life of Cig2 was >2 h, whereas in wild type cells under the same conditions, it was <10 min (Fig. 1, C and D) This result indicates that Pop1 and Pop2, but not the other F-box proteins, are involved in Cig2 degradation. Pop1 and Pop2, but Not the APC/C, Are Also Required for Cig2 Instability during G2 and M Phase—We next addressed Cig2 stability using synchronous cultures, which were blocked at early S phase by hydroxyurea and then released into fresh medium in the absence of hydroxyurea. It is known that Cig2 is degraded via the APC/C upon onset of anaphase (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). To exclude the potential involvement of the APC/C in Cig2 degradation during this experiment, a mitotically arresting nda3-311 mutant containing a cold-sensitive β-tubulin gene (33Hiraoka Y. Toda T. Yanagida M. Cell. 1984; 39: 349-358Google Scholar) was used. At each time point upon release, protein samples were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed with the appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 1-5) and 2B, the level of Cig2 was abruptly decreased between 1 and 2 h after release from hydroxyurea. This timing of Cig2 degradation coincided with the completion of S phase as shown previously (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). The level of Cdc13, mitotic B-type cyclin, on the other hand, remained unchanged during this period, confirming that Cig2 degradation under this condition does not require the APC/C. Cig2 degradation was, nonetheless, proteasome-dependent, as Cig2 was stabilized in the mts3-1 mutant, which was defective in subunit 14 of the 19 S proteasome regulatory particle (34Gordon C. McGurk G. Wallace M. Hastie N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5704-5711Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). The requirement of Pop1 and Pop2 for Cig2 degradation was next addressed using nda3pop1 or nda3pop1pop2 mutants. In sharp contrast to the pattern of nda3 single mutants, in nda3pop1 double or nda3pop1pop2 triple mutants, Cig2 was stabilized (Fig. 2A, lanes 6-15, and 2B for quantification). These results suggest that Cig2 is degraded through SCFPop1/Pop2 and the proteasome during G2 and M phase. Pop1 Forms a Complex with Cig2 in the Cell—We previously showed that Cdc18, one of the SCFPop1/Pop2 substrates, forms a complex with Pop1 (25Kominami K. Toda T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Google Scholar). If Cig2 is also a substrate for SCFPop1/Pop2, Cig2 is expected to bind Pop1 and Pop2. As shown below, this was indeed the case. The intrinsic instability of Pop1 makes it difficult to detect the Pop1 protein expressed from the genomic promoter (35Zhou C. Wee S. Rhee E. Naumann M. Dubiel W. Wolf D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 927-938Google Scholar). Therefore, multicopy plasmids containing tagged Pop1 (Pop1-HA) under thiamine-repressible nmt promoter (36Maundrell K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10857-10864Google Scholar) were introduced, and immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, Pop1-HA coimmunoprecipitated with Cig2 (lane 3). This interaction was specific, as Cig2 did not precipitate in the absence of primary anti-HA antibody (lanes 2 and 5), and in addition, Cdc13 was not pulled down in the precipitates under the same conditions (lanes 3 and 6). As Pop1 and Pop2 act in the same pathway by forming heterodimers as well as individual homodimers (26Kominami K. Ochotorena I. Toda T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 721-735Google Scholar, 37Wolf D.A. McKeon F. Jackson P.K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 373-376Google Scholar), we then addressed whether Pop1 is still capable of interacting with Cig2 in the absence of Pop2. Pop1-HA was expressed in pop2 mutants, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. As shown in Fig. 3B, Pop1 coprecipitated with Cig2 in this mutant as efficiently as in wild type cells (lanes 4 and 7). Again, an interaction was specific, as Cig2 did not precipitate in the absence of primary antibody or with an excess amount of HA peptide competitors (lanes 3, 5, 6, and 8). These results show that Pop1 forms a complex with Cig2 in the cell, and for this interaction, its partner Pop2 is not required. Cig2 Accumulates When Other Substrates of SCFPop1/Pop2 Are Overproduced—Rum1 and Cdc18 are two known substrates for SCFPop1/Pop2 (25Kominami K. Toda T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Google Scholar, 27Jallepalli P.V. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8159-8164Google Scholar, 37Wolf D.A. McKeon F. Jackson P.K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 373-376Google Scholar), and we previously showed that protein levels of Rum1 are greatly enhanced under the condition where Cdc18 is overproduced, and conversely, Cdc18 accumulates in Rum1-overproducing cells (25Kominami K. Toda T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1548-1560Google Scholar). This is most likely attributable to the competition between two substrates toward availability of binding with Pop1 and Pop2. Given the notion that Cig2 is a novel substrate for SCFPop1/Pop2, we next tested whether Cig2 also accumulates when other substrates of SCFPop1/Pop2 are overproduced. When Cdc18 was overproduced, Cig2 levels were up-regulated accompanied with co-accumulation of Rum1 (Fig. 3C). Similarly, in Rum1-overproducing cells, Cig2 as well as Cdc18 accumulated to high levels (Fig. 3D). This result substantiates the notion that Cig2 is a substrate of SCFPop1/Pop2. Phosphorylation of Cig2 Is Essential for Binding to Pop1—We next sought to examine binding characteristics between Cig2 and Pop1 using in vitro translation systems. At first, to assess binding capability and specificity, various full-length proteins were labeled with radioisotope, incubated with Cdc2 kinase, and then mixed with bacterially produced and purified GST-tagged Pop1 protein (GST-Pop1). The binding between radiolabeled proteins and GST-Pop1 was examined by pull-down with GSH-Sepharose beads. Proteins translated and labeled in these reactions included Cig2, Cig2/dm (Cig2 construct with a mutated destruction box), Cdc13, Cdc18, and Rum1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-6, and see “Experimental Procedures”). These pull-down experiments showed that GST-Pop1 bound Cig2 as efficiently as Cdc18 and Rum1 (lanes 7, 10, and 11), whereas GST-Pop1 did not bind Cdc13 (lane 9). Moreover, Cig2 was not pulled down by mock Sepharose beads (lane 12), indicating that the interaction depends on Pop1. Consistent with the independence of the APC/C in SCFPop1/Pop2-mediated Cig2 degradation, Cig2/dm was still capable of binding GST-Pop1 (lane 8). It is often the case that phosphorylation of SCF substrates is a prerequisite for their binding to F-box proteins and subsequent ubiquitylation (9Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Google Scholar, 38Orlicky S. Tang X. Willems A. Tyers M. Sicheri F. Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Google Scholar, 39Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Google Scholar). It was shown previously that this was also the case for SCFPop1/Pop2-mediated degradation of Cdc18 and Rum1 (40Benito J. Martin-Castellanos C. Moreno S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 482-497Google Scholar, 41Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Google Scholar). The requirement of Cig2 phosphorylation for binding to Pop1 was, therefore, examined in the above binding assays by treating Cig2 with λ-phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 4B, it was evident that binding between Pop1 and Cig2 was abolished by phosphatase treatment (lane 5). Phosphatase activity was required for this inhibition, as simultaneous inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors blocked its inhibitory effect (lane 6). This result suggests that the interaction between Pop1 and Cig2 is dependent on phosphorylation of Cig2. Determination of Internal Regions of Cig2 That Are Required for Binding to Pop1—Having established the in vitro binding assay between Pop1 and Cig2, we sought to identify the domain within Cig2 that is necessary for an interaction with Pop1. For this purpose, various subclones of Cig2 that lack either N-terminal or C-terminal regions were expressed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-6). Binding between translated proteins and GST-Pop1 was then examined as before. In the case of N-terminal truncations, subclones lacking 180 amino acid residues (Cig2-NΔ180) as well as deletions of 60 and 121 residues were still capable of interacting with GST-Pop1 (Fig. 5A, lanes 12-15). Again, interaction was specific as Cig2 without GST-Pop1 or with GST alone did not pull down Cig2 (lanes 10 and 11), and only Cdc18 and Rum1, but not Cdc13, bound GST-Pop1 (lanes 16-18). This result shows that N-terminal 180 amino acid residues of Cig2 are dispensable for binding to Pop1. As for C-terminal truncations (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-5), two constructs (Cig2-CΔ53 and -Δ106, lanes 10 and 12) were still positive, although binding of Cig2-CΔ106 was somewhat weaker. In contrast, the other two deletions (Cig2-Δ85 and -Δ190, lanes 11 and 13) did not bind Pop1. We do not know at present the reason that Cig2-Δ85 was negative, whereas the shorter Cig2-Δ106 could bind Pop1. It is possible some structural abnormalities specifically created in Cig2-Δ85 may hinder an interaction with Pop1. To delineate further the minimal region of Cig2 for binding to Pop1, an internal fragment containing 181-358 was constructed and expressed (Fig. 5C, lane 4). As expected from the above results, this fragment was indeed capable of binding to Pop1 (lane 12). Then, this fragment was further divided into two regions, 181-283 and 284-385 (lanes 5 and 6, respectively), and binding of each fragment was examined. It was found that only the N-terminal region (181-283) was positive (lanes 13 and 14). Also, a shorter fragment consisting of 181-273 (lane 8) bound to Pop1 (lane 16). Taking these results together (see Fig. 5D for a summary of the binding assay), internal 93 amino acid residues of Cig2 (181-273) are necessary and sufficient for binding to Pop1. Here we show that Cig2 is a novel substrate for the SCFPop1/Pop2 ubiquitin ligase. This conclusion is drawn from the following results. First, the Cig2 protein becomes stabilized in pop mutants such that the half-life is >2 h when compared with <10 min in wild type cells. Second, Pop1 binds Cig2 both in vivo and in vitro. Third, like other substrates of the SCF (38Orlicky S. Tang X. Willems A. Tyers M. Sicheri F. Cell. 2003; 112: 243-256Google Scholar, 39Nash P. Tang X. Orlicky S. Chen Q. Gertler F.B. Mendenhall M.D. Sicheri F. Pawson T. Tyers M. Nature. 2001; 414: 514-521Google Scholar), binding between Cig2 and Pop1 is dependent upon Cig2 phosphorylation. Coordinated Regulation of Cig2 Levels via SCFPop1/Pop2 and APC/C—Cig2 levels are tightly regulated during the normal cell cycle in such a way that it exists as a spike pattern only at S phase. Uncontrolled expression of Cig2 leads to cell lethality accompanied by mitotic defects including “cut” phenotype (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). The work presented in this study has established the coordinated manner of cell cycle-dependent Cig2 degradation via SCFPop1/Pop2 and APC/C ubiquitin ligases (Fig. 6). Continued from anaphase of the previous cycle, during G1, the APC/C is kept active and responsible for Cig2 ubiquitylation and destruction. Upon initiation of S phase, the APC/C is inactivated, and Cig2 levels show peaked accumulation, which is coupled with transcriptional induction. When S phase is finished, Cig2 levels are dramatically decreased via the SCFPop1/Pop2 pathway, and this down-regulation endures throughout M phase until onset of anaphase, when the APC/C is activated. To ensure this type of spike pattern, SCFPop1/Pop2 plays an addition role in down-regulating cig2+ transcription throughout all stages except for S phase (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). Furthermore, not only during vegetative cycles but also sexual development, Cig2 levels are repressed in order for the cell to conjugate (42Kominami K. Seth-Smith H. Toda T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5388-5399Google Scholar). In this process, the APC/C appears to play a major role. Phosphorylation Sites of Cig2—Binding analysis using a reticulocyte system shows that the internal 93 residues of Cig2 (181-273) are sufficient for interaction with Pop1. This region overlaps with a part of the conserved cyclin box (168-380), which is required for interaction with Cdc2. Consistent with this, we previously showed that the Cig2 mutant protein (Cig2-AAA) that is no longer capable of interacting with Cdc2 becomes stabilized in the cell (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). We show here that phosphorylation of Cig2 is needed for binding. There are 14 serine/threonine residues in the 181-273 fragment, in which one serine (268SP269) corresponds to the consensus cdk-phosphorylation site. However preliminary experiments suggest that the Cig2 mutant in this serine (268AP269) is still unstable. 3K.-i. Kitamura and T. Toda, unpublished results. It is possible that, although phosphorylation of Cig2 is required, unlike other substrates such as Rum1 and Cdc18, the Cdc2 kinase is not involved in Cig2 ubiquitylation by SCFPop1/Pop2. Alternatively, phosphorylation of Cig2 might be more complicated and performed by multiple kinases including Cdc2 as in cyclin E degradation in metazoan (43Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Google Scholar). It is also possible that Cdc2 phosphorylates non-SP/TP sites within this region. To address this question, detailed mutational analysis of Cig2 in potential phosphorylation sites will be needed. We previously suggested that Pop1 is not involved in Cig2 instability during G2 (24Yamano H. Kitamura K. Kominami K. Lehmann A. Katayama S. Hunt T. Toda T. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1377-1387Google Scholar). This was based upon the data showing instability of the N-terminally tagged Pk-Cig2 in pop1 or pop2 mutants. During subsequent experiments, we realized that the instability of Cig2 observed in the previous study is unexpectedly attributable to epitope tagging of Cig2 rather than the authentic nature of the Cig2 protein. Although Pk-Cig2 was apparently functional, as it suppressed cig2 deleted strains, Pk-Cig2 behaved abnormally in terms of protein stability, i.e. unlike untagged Cig2, Pk-Cig2 is unstable in a pop mutant background. Epitope tagging of proteins is widely used and, as far as the tagged protein complements phenotypes derived from corresponding mutants, it is generally postulated that this tagged protein retains the same characteristics as the non-tagged wild type form. As shown here, this may not be always the case. We would like to raise the point that, depending upon the individual experiments, careful assessment of data, particularly functionality of tagged proteins, would be required. Binding between Pop1 and Cig2 in the Absence of Pop2—Although both Pop1 and Pop2 are required for in vivo instability of Cig2, in terms of binding per se, only Pop1 is sufficient, as Pop1 alone interacts with Cig2 both in vivo and in vitro in the absence of Pop2. This implies that either a Pop1 monomer or a Pop1-Pop1 homodimer is capable of binding to Cig2. It is of interest then how only Pop1-Pop2 heterodimers are involved in Cig2 degradation. It is possible that heterodimers are required for interaction with other components of the SCF, which results in Cig2 ubiquitylation. Alternatively, heterodimer formation might be necessary for an interaction between ubiquitylated Cig2 and the proteasome. In any case, our data indicate that binding between F-box protein and substrate is necessary but not sufficient for subsequent proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Implications of Cig2 Homeostasis by Multiple Ubiquitin Pathways—In animal cells, Pop1/Pop2 homologue hCdc4 is required for ubiquitylation of cyclin E in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (16Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Google Scholar, 17Moberg K.H. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C. Haber D.A. Hariharan I.K. Nature. 2001; 413: 311-316Google Scholar, 18Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Google Scholar, 43Welcker M. Singer J. Loeb K.R. Grim J. Bloecher A. Gurien-West M. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 381-392Google Scholar). Thus Cig2 could be regarded as a functional homologue of cyclin E, except that Cig2 also contains the destruction box and is ubiquitylated by the APC/C. Whether or not cyclin A, which contains the destruction box and was co-purified with Skp1 and F-box protein Skp2 (44Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Google Scholar), is also ubiquitylated by the SCF remains to be determined. In budding yeast, it was suggested that Clb5 levels are regulated via the SCF in addition to the APC/C (45Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Google Scholar). At present, Cig2 (and Clb5) are, therefore, unique cyclins in which both the APC/C and the SCF are required for timely destruction during the cell cycle. It is conceivable that in higher systems that require elaborate control over cellular levels of key regulatory proteins, this type of composite degradation mechanisms may be more general.

https://openalex.org/W2005460049,"Ghα protein, which exhibits both transglutaminase and GTPase activities, represents a new class of GTP-binding proteins. In the present study, we characterized Ghα in rat uterine smooth muscle (myometrium) and followed its expression during pregnancy by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. We also measured transglutaminase and GTP binding functions and used a smooth muscle cell line to evaluate the role of Ghα in cell proliferation. The results show that pregnancy is associated with an up-regulation of Ghα expression at both the mRNA and protein level. Ghα induced during pregnancy is preferentially localized to the plasma membrane. This was found associated with an increased ability of plasma membrane preparations to catalyze Ca2+-dependent incorporation of [3H]putrescine into casein in vitro. In the cytosol, significant changes in the level of immunodetected Ghα and transglutaminase activity were seen only at term. Activation of α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR) enhanced photoaffinity labeling of plasma membrane Ghα. Moreover, the level of α1-AR-coupled Ghα increased progressively with pregnancy, which parallels the active period of myometrial cell proliferation. Overexpression of wild type Ghα in smooth muscle cell line DDT1-MF2 increased α1-AR-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation. A similar response was obtained in cells expressing the transglutaminase inactive mutant (C277S) of Ghα. Together, these findings underscore the role of Ghα as signal transducer of α1-AR-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation.

Together, these findings underscore the role of Ghα as signal transducer of α1-AR-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation. In this context, pregnant rat myometrium provides an interesting physiological model to study the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the GTPase function of Ghα Different from the traditional heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins, Ghα protein is a bifunctional enzyme with both transglutaminase and GTPase activities (1Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Google Scholar). Transglutamination requires Ca2+ and is inhibited by GTP, whereas GTPase activity is inhibited by Ca2+. Initially identified as tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2), 1The abbreviations used are: TG, transglutaminase; AR, adrenergic receptor(s); PLC, phospholipase C; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; AppNHp, adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Ghα is a member of a large family of transglutaminases that includes plasma Factor XIIIa, epidermal TG1 and TG3, or prostate TG4 (2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nature. 2003; 4: 140-156Google Scholar). These enzymes catalyze the formation of covalent γ-glutamyl-ϵ-lysine bonds between proteins or polyamines and protein substrates. Such modifications play a role in different biological processes such as blood coagulation, epidermal differentiation, formation of copulatory plug in rodents, or extracellular matrix organization (2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nature. 2003; 4: 140-156Google Scholar). Like other transglutaminases, Ghα consists of four domains: an amino-terminal β-sandwich and a catalytic core with the active site cysteine (Cys-277) for transglutamination, followed by two carboxyl-terminal β-barrels. The three-dimensional structure of Ghα complexed with GDP revealed a unique guanine nucleotide binding pocket located between the catalytic core and the first β-barrel and formed by residues coming from both domains (3Liu S. Cerione R.A. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2743-2747Google Scholar). By virtue of its GTP binding/GTPase activity, Ghα acts as a signaling molecule for α1-AR (4Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Google Scholar, 5Im M.-J. Riek R.P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18952-18960Google Scholar), oxytocin receptors (6Baek K.J. Kwon N.S. Lee H.S. Kim M.S. Muralidhar P. Im M.-J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 739-744Google Scholar, 7Park E.-S. Won J.H. Han K.J. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Lee H.S. Yun H.-Y. Kwon N.S. Baek K.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 283-289Google Scholar), and thromboxane receptors (8Vezza R. Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12774-12779Google Scholar). α1-AR were, however, the most studied Ghα protein-coupled receptors. Activation by α1-AR induces exchange of GDP to GTP and dissociation of GTP-Ghα from the Ghβ subunit, which was recently identified as calreticulin (9Feng J.-F. Readson M. Yadav S.P. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10743-10749Google Scholar). GTP-bound Ghα interacts with downstream effector PLCδ1, thereby resulting in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ increase (10Das T. Baek K.J. Gray C. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27390-27397Google Scholar, 11Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Google Scholar, 12Baek K.J. Kang S.K. Damron D.S. Im M.-J.

Deactivation of this signaling pathway is triggered by GTP hydrolysis and reassociation of Ghα with free Ghβ subunit. Although α1-AR/Ghα coupling was well established in many cell types, the cellular responses triggered by this signaling pathway still remain unclear. Indeed, only a few studies have addressed the role of Ghα as a signal transducer of G protein-coupled receptors. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential involvement of Ghα in myometrial α1-adrenergic-induced responses. It is well known that norepinephrine modulates myometrial contractility during pregnancy. Adrenergic signaling pathways are under the control of progesterone and estradiol, which regulate the expression of receptors (β-AR), heterotrimeric G proteins (Gsα, Giα, and Gqα), and PLCβ enzymes (14Vivat V. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Revelli J.P. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7975-7978Google Scholar, 15Elwardy-Merezak J. Maltier J.P. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Lecrivain J.L. Vivat V. Legrand C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 23-37Google Scholar, 16Cohen-Tannoudji J. Mhaouty S. Elwardy-Merezak J. Lecrivain J.L. Robin M.T. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol.

Hence, during pregnancy under progesterone dominance, norepinephrine stimulates β-AR and α2-AR, which both activate adenylyl cyclase and increase intracellular concentrations of cAMP (18Cohen-Tannoudji J. Vivat V. Heilmann J. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 137-145Google Scholar, 19Mhaouty S. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11012-11016Google Scholar). The latter second messenger induces myometrial relaxation by inhibiting the pathways leading to Ca2+ increase (20Wray S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1-C18Google Scholar). At term, when concentrations of estradiol rise, the β-adrenergic pathway becomes desensitized (21Simon V. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Legrand C. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1899-1905Google Scholar), and norepinephrine acts on α2-AR (19Mhaouty S. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11012-11016Google Scholar, 22Mhaouty-Kodja S. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31100-31106Google Scholar) and α1-AR (23Limon-Boulez I. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Coudouel N. Benoit de Coignac A. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1175-1182Google Scholar). At this time, α2-AR shift to inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase, whereas α1-AR activate the Gq/PLCβ system and participate in the Ca2+ increase and uterine contraction. An intriguing observation is that α1-AR are expressed throughout pregnancy, although they are not efficiently coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis due to down-regulation of Gqα (16Cohen-Tannoudji J. Mhaouty S. Elwardy-Merezak J. Lecrivain J.L. Robin M.T. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 55-64Google Scholar) and PLCβ isoforms at this period (17Mhaouty-Kodja S. Houdeau E. Legrand C. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 570-576Google Scholar). We thus questioned whether these receptors could signal through Ghα to regulate response(s) other than contraction. Indeed, myometrial cells undergo proliferation during pregnancy, which is critical for uterine adaptation to fetoplacental growth (24Alexandrova M. Soloff M.S. Endocrinology. 1980; 106: 730-735Google Scholar, 25Engstrom T. Bratholm P. Vilhardt H. Christensen N.J. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 153: 393-399Google Scholar). Although many studies have addressed the regulation of such a process in physiopathological situations like uterine leiomyoma, very little is known about the physiological processes involved during pregnancy. For this purpose, we first characterized myometrial Ghα and followed its expression, at the mRNA and protein level, during pregnancy and at term. We also determined myometrial transglutaminase activity and photoaffinity labeling of Ghα in the absence or presence of GTP or α1-adrenergic agonist. Finally, we used a smooth muscle cell line to analyze the role of Ghα and its transglutaminase-inactive (C277S) mutant in cell proliferation induced by α1-AR. Materials—[3H]Thymidine (7 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Putrescine (33 Ci/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent were from Amersham Biosciences. AppNHp, GTP, N,N′-dimethylcasein, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, phenylephrine, phentolamine, and putrescine were from Sigma. LipofectAMINE Reagent Plus was purchased from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-Ghα was from NeoMarkers and monoclonal anti-PLCδ1 from Upstate Biotechnology, and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. The cDNAs encoding wild type and mutant (C277S) Ghα protein, subcloned in pcDNA3, were kindly provided by Dr. R. M. Graham and Dr. S. Iismaa (Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney, Australia). Animals and Tissues—Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Janvier (Le Genest, France). The females were caged with males overnight, and successful mating was determined by the presence of spermatozoa in the vaginal smear (day 1 of pregnancy). Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at days 5, 12, 15, and 20 of pregnancy or at term during the expulsion of fetoplacental units, following the guidelines laid down by the National Institutes of Health guide. The uterine horns were quickly isolated and cut open lengthwise, and the fetoplacental units were removed. The myometrium was then freed of adherent endometrium. Cell Culture and [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—DDT1-MF2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. For [3H]thymidine uptake, cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected (0.6 μg of DNA/0.12 × 106 cells/well) with expressing vector for wild type or mutant (C277S) Ghα constructs using LipofectAMINE Reagent Plus. The cells transfected with the empty pcDNA vector were used as control. DDT1-MF2 cells were then given fresh serum-free medium and allowed to achieve quiescence for 24 h prior to subsequent application of 10 μm phenylephrine for an additional 24 h. DNA synthesis was assessed following the addition of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) for a period of 6 h before the end of the treatment protocol. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cold 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate DNA as described previously (26Breuiller-Fouche M. Heluy V. Fournier T. Dallot E. Vacher-Lavenu M.C. Ferre F. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 1998; 4: 33-39Google Scholar). The precipitates were resuspended in 0.5 n NaOH, and aliquots were counted by scintillation counting. Experiments were done in triplicate. For Western blot analysis, DDT1-MF2 cells were plated in 6-well plates (0.3 × 106 cell/well), and the transfected DNA of the empty vector, wild type, or mutant Ghα was 1.2 μg of DNA/well. RNA Preparation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from rat myometrium and liver as described previously (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). The RT-PCR reactions were done with the kit from Invitrogen. Briefly, 3 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and the resulting cDNAs were stocked at -80 °C. A 0.05 volume of each RT reaction was amplified using specific upstream and downstream primers for Ghα and the internal control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primers sequences for rat Ghα (8Vezza R. Habib A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12774-12779Google Scholar) and rat GAPDH (28Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Google Scholar) were 5′-ATCTACCAGGGCTCTGTCAA-3′ and 5′-ACTCCACCCAGCAGTGGAAA-3′, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′ and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′, respectively. PCR reactions (40 cycles) were 94 °C for 2 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, with initial activation of the enzyme at 94 °C for 5 min. For semiquantitative analysis, PCR cycle profiles were conducted, and the cycle number (25 cycles) was chosen from the linear portion of the curve. The resulting products were run on 2% agarose gel and quantitated by ethidium bromide fluorescence. Preparation of Myometrial Fractions—Rat myometrium and liver were homogenized in buffer A for Western blot analysis, in buffer B for transglutaminase assay, and in buffer C for photoaffinity labeling experiments. After 10-min centrifugation at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and submitted to 100,000 × g centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h to separate plasma membranes from cytosol. Pellet containing plasma membranes was resuspended in homogenization buffer, and protein concentration of plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions was determined according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples were stored at -80 °C until use. Buffer A contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.32 m sucrose. Buffer B contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.4 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2. Buffer C was composed of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EGTA. The three buffers were supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins from rat myometrium and liver (20 μg of protein) or DDT1-MF2 cells (5 μg of protein) were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with monoclonal anti-Ghα or anti-PLCδ1 diluted 1:500. Incubation with secondary antibody (1:10,000) was carried out for 45 min at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the chemiluminescence detection system and quantified. The quantification of Ghα and PLCδ1 expression was determined by densitometric scanning followed by computer analysis using the NIH Image 1.62 program. Transglutaminase Assay—The ability of plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions to catalyze the incorporation of [3H]putrescine into dimethylcasein was determined as described previously (30Iismaa S.E. Wu M.-J. Nanda N. Church W.B. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18259-18265Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of proteins were incubated with 0.8% (w/v) dimethylcasein and 10 μm [3H]putrescine in a 50-μl total volume of buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol. Reactions were initiated at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or 0.5 mm GTP. After 40-min incubation, reactions were stopped by addition of 50% cold trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were washed three times with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and solubilized with 0.1 m NaOH. Radiolabeling was measured by scintillation counting. Photoaffinity Labeling—Photoaffinity labeling of Ghα with [α-32P]GTP was carried out as described previously (4Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Google Scholar). Plasma membrane fractions (200 μg of protein) were incubated with 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP for 10 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm AppNHp in the absence or presence of 10 μm phenylephrine, 0.5 mm unlabeled GTP, or 100 μm phentolamine. Reactions were stopped in ice; the samples were irradiated with UV light (254 nm) for 20 min and solubilized with Laemmli solution for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were autoradiographed and then immunodetected for Ghα. The levels of labeled and immunodetected Ghα were determined by densitometric scanning followed by computer analysis using NIH Image 1.62 program. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test for unpaired data. A probability level less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Characterization of Rat Myometrial Ghα—To assess the expression of Ghα in pregnant rat myometrium, we used RT-PCR technique and Western blot analysis. Rat liver where the expression of Ghα has been reported already was used as control. Using specific primers, we amplified a 520-bp fragment of Ghα from pregnant rat myometrium and rat liver (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4). Control PCR reactions performed on nontranscribed RNAs indicated no contamination of the RNA preparations with genomic DNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). Monoclonal antibodies raised against Ghα stained a single band of the appropriate molecular mass (74 kDa) in plasma membranes and cytosolic fractions of pregnant rat myometrium and rat liver (Fig. 1B). Our results also show that the subcellular distribution of Ghα is tissue-specific (Fig. 1B). Indeed, Ghα is predominantly cytosolic in liver, while a high amount of this protein is associated with the myometrial plasma membranes. Rat Myometrial Ghα during Pregnancy—We examined the expression level of myometrial Ghα at different stages of pregnancy. Semiquantitative analysis showed that the level of Ghα transcripts, but not of the internal control GAPDH, is altered during pregnancy (Fig. 2A). Indeed, mRNA level of Ghα increased progressively during pregnancy, with pronounced changes occurring at day 12 of pregnancy (2-fold of day 5) and at term (1.5-fold of day 20) (Fig. 2B). Quantification of the immunodetected Ghα also indicated an up-regulation of this protein. Indeed, the amount of membrane-associated Ghα increased progressively during pregnancy (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the amount of cytosolic Ghα remained stable until day 20 of pregnancy (Fig. 3B), and a significant elevation (+35%) was seen only at term. Comparison of the subcellular distribution of Ghα during pregnancy was expressed as the membrane/cytoplasmic ratio. The obtained data illustrated in Fig. 3C revealed a progressive enrichment of plasma membrane compartment in Ghα during the course of pregnancy. Indeed, whereas the cytosolic localization of Ghα prevailed over membrane-associated Ghα at day 5 of pregnancy, this situation was completely reversed at the end of pregnancy (ratio of 0.56 at day 5 versus 1.5-1.8 between day 20 and term).Fig. 3Myometrial Ghα amount during pregnancy. A and B, quantification of myometrial plasma membrane (A) and cytosolic (B) Ghα at days 5 (d5), 12 (d12), 15 (d15), and 20 (d20) of pregnancy and at term (T). Data are expressed as percentage of T and are mean ± S.E. of nine independent experiments. The amount of plasma membrane and cytosolic Ghα in non-pregnant rat represented 50 ± 7% and 60 ± 6% of term value, respectively. a, p < 0.05 compared with expression at d5. b, p < 0.05 compared with expression at d12 or d15.

Moreover, this period is associated with a preferential increase of membrane-bound Ghα. Myomerial Transglutaminase Activity during Pregnancy—Ghα is a bifunctional enzyme with both transglutaminase and GTPase activities. To characterize myometrial transglutaminase activity, we tested the ability of plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions to catalyze, in vitro, the incorporation of [3H]putrescine into dimethylcasein. Addition of 2 mm CaCl2 increased transglutaminase activity in both plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions of pregnant rat myometrium (6.4-fold and 4.8-fold above basal in the plasma membrane and the cytosol, respectively) (Fig. 4A). To evaluate the degree of participation of Ghα in this myometrial activity, we tested the inhibitory effect of GTP. As shown in Fig. 4A, 0.5 mm GTP blocked ∼90% of Ca2+-stimulated transglutaminase activity in plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments. We also examined myometrial transglutaminase activity at different stages of pregnancy. In the absence of Ca2+, plasma membrane and cytosolic transglutaminase activity did not change throughout pregnancy (a mean of 121 and 66 fmol/mg of protein/min in plasma membrane and cytosol, respectively). Addition of Ca2+ significantly increased transglutaminase activity, and GTP counteracted this elevation in both fractions at all stages of pregnancy studied (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 4, B and C, Ca2+-stimulated activity of the plasma membrane fraction increased progressively during pregnancy, whereas the cytosolic transglutaminase activity was stable until day 20 of pregnancy. In correlation with Western blot analysis, a significant increase (+30%) of the cytosolic transglutaminase activity was observed only at term (Fig. 4C). Functional Coupling of Myometrial α1-AR to Ghα—We next analyzed whether myometrial Ghα, by virtue of its GTP binding activity, interacts with α1-AR. For this purpose, plasma membrane preparations were incubated with [α-32P]GTP in the absence or presence of 10 μm phenylephrine (α1-adrenergic agonist). Labeled G proteins were then separated by electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes prior to autoradiography and immunodetection. The molecular mass of the 74-kDa radiolabeled protein coincided with that of the immunoreactive Ghα detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A, top and bottom). Addition of unlabeled GTP completely blocked labeling of Ghα (Fig. 5A, top). Moreover, application of phenylephrine significantly augmented photoaffinity labeling of Ghα (140-160% of basal) at all stages of pregnancy studied (Fig. 5, A (top) and B). These responses were blocked by addition of phentolamine, an α1-adrenergic antagonist (data not shown). Interestingly, both basal and phenylephrine-stimulated [α-32P]GTP labeling of Ghα increased during pregnancy (Fig. 5B). The maximal amounts were observed between day 20 of pregnancy and term. In this comparative study, labeled Ghα was hardly detectable at day 5 of pregnancy, even in the presence of phenylephrine. Ghα in DDT1-MF2 Smooth Muscle Cell Line—α1-AR/Ghα coupling was shown to activate PLCδ1, thereby resulting in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ increase (11Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Google Scholar, 13Kang S.K. Kim D.K. Damron D.S. Baek K.J. Im M.-J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 383-390Google Scholar). To investigate whether such activation occurs in pregnant rat myometrium, we first characterized the expression of PLCδ1. Results illustrated in Fig. 6A indicated the presence of this PLC enzyme in non-pregnant, pregnant, and term rat myometrium. However, the amount of PLCδ1 during pregnancy represents only 30% of that observed in term rat animals (Fig. 6B). Pregnancy-dependent down-regulation of PLCδ1 is in correlation with the fact that all pathways leading to Ca2+ increase and contraction are inhibited or reduced during pregnancy. We thus asked whether α1-AR/Ghα coupling could be involved in myometrial proliferation. To answer this question, we used the DDT1-MF2 cell line, which was described previously as a useful model to study the myometrial adrenergic signaling pathway regulations (31Marjamaki A. Sato M. Bouet-Alard R. Yang Q. Limon-Boulez I. Legrand C. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16466-16473Google Scholar, 32Limon-Boulez I. Bouet-Alard R. Gettys T.W. Lanier S.M. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 331-338Google Scholar). As myometrial cells, this smooth muscle cell line expresses endogenously α1-AR (33Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Cotecchia S. Lomasney J.W. DeBernardis J.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5651-5655Google Scholar). Transfection of DDT1-MF2 cells with cDNAs encoding wild type or transglutaminase-inactive (C277S) Ghα successfully resulted in an increase of the amount of Ghα (Fig. 7A). Assessment of transglutaminase activity showed that addition of 2 mm CaCl2 enhanced in vitro [3H]putrescine incorporation into casein only in extracts derived from wild type-transfected cells, thus confirming the lack of this function in C277S-expressing cells (Fig. 7B). To determine whether α1-AR stimulate DNA synthesis through Ghα, serum-starved transfected cells were incubated in the absence or presence of phenylephrine. Fig. 7C shows that activation of α1-AR resulted in an increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation into control cells (+50% above unstimulated cells). Overexpression of wild type Ghα further increased phenylephrine-stimulated DNA synthesis (a mean of 90% above stimulated control cells). Interestingly, a similar response was observed in cells expressing C277S-Ghα (Fig. 7C). Therefore, these results indicate that Ghα, via its GTP binding/GTPase function, participates in smooth muscle proliferation induced by α1-AR.Fig. 7Overexpression of Ghα increased proliferation of DDT1-MF2 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with constructs of wild type (WT) and transglutaminase-inactive (C277S) mutant of Ghα or empty vector (Control). A, Western blot to detect the expression of Ghα. B, transglutaminase activity in transfected DDT1-MF2 cells in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. C, cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence (Basal) or presence of phenylephrine (Phe). Cell proliferation was determined after [3H]thymidine incorporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as percentage of basal control cells and are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. a, p < 0.05 compared with its corresponding basal. b, p < 0.05 compared with Phe in control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of Ghα in Rat Myometrium—By using RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we showed the expression of Ghα in pregnant and term rat myometrium. Transglutaminase assay also indicated the presence of a Ca2+- and GTP-sensitive transglutaminase. In addition, GTP inhibited ∼90% of myometrial transglutaminase activity. Among members of the transglutaminase family, TG3 is also sensitive to guanine nucleotides (34Hitomi K. Ikura K. Maki M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 657-659Google Scholar). However, this transglutaminase presents a restricted expression to epiderm (2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nature. 2003; 4: 140-156Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we can then easily conclude that Ghα is predominantly expressed in pregnant and term rat myometrium. Another argument in favor of the predominant expression of Ghα in pregnant rat myometrium is the good correlation among the levels of immunodetected Ghα protein, myometrial transglutaminase activity, and photoaffinity-labeled Ghα during pregnancy. These findings could explain the absence of additional bands in rat myometrium compared with mouse heart (35Nanda N. Iismaa S. Owens W.A. Husain A. Mackay F. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20673-20678Google Scholar) by using the NeoMarkers monoclonal antibodies. The presence of Ghα was also reported in non-pregnant human myometrium (6Baek K.J. Kwon N.S. Lee H.S. Kim M.S. Muralidhar P. Im M.-J. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 739-744Google Scholar). However, its regulation has not been studied throughout pregnancy. The present study shows that the mRNA and protein levels of Ghα increase with pregnancy. This suggests that myometrial Ghα gene is regulated, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Our preliminary experiments indicate that myometrial Ghα is not under the control of progesterone or estradiol (data not shown). A possible candidate for such a regulation could be retinoic acid. Indeed, this potent inducer of Ghα expression, as shown in many cell types, is locally synthesized and stored in pregnant rat uterus (36Zheng W.L. Ong D.E. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 963-970Google Scholar, 37Schweigert F.J. Bonitz K. Siegling C. Buchholz I. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 906-911Google Scholar). In addition, rat myometrium expresses different retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RXRβ) that could transduce retinoic acid-induced effects (37Schweigert F.J. Bonitz K. Siegling C. Buchholz I. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 906-911Google Scholar, 38Larcher A. Neculcea J. Chu K. Zingg H.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 69-76Google Scholar). Future studies will examine whether myometrial Ghα is regulated by retinoic acid during pregnancy. Preferential Association of Induced Ghα with Myometrial Plasma Membranes during Pregnancy—Ghα is known to reside predominantly in the cytosol. However, some studies localized a portion of this protein in the plasma membrane compartment (2Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nature. 2003; 4: 140-156Google Scholar). The present study reports a progressive enrichment of myometrial plasma membranes in Ghα during pregnancy. Indeed, Western blot analysis and transglutaminase assay as well as photoaffinity labeling study showed an increase of plasma membrane-associated Ghα, whereas the amount of Ghα in the cytosol remained unchanged until day 20 of pregnancy. The molecular mechanisms underlying this differential localization of intracellular Ghα during pregnancy need to be clarified. It is possible that Ghα actively translocates from the cytosol to the plasma membrane during pregnancy because this protein was reported to moonlight between these compartments (39Korner G. Bachrach U. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 44-50Google Scholar, 40Gill L.S. Pabbathi V.K. Vignes M. Haynes L.W. Brain Res. 1998; 788: 95-103Google Scholar). Alternatively, retinoic acid was shown to increase the ability of Ghα to associate with the plasma membrane in HeLa cells (41Singh U.S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27292-27298Google Scholar). Interaction between Myometrial α1-AR and Ghα—By using photoaffinity labeling technique, we showed that myometrial Ghα functionally interacts with α1-AR in pregnant and term rats. The progressive enhancement in the level of α1-AR-coupled Ghα correlates well with the up-regulation of plasma membrane-associated Ghα during pregnancy. This strongly suggests that plasma membrane-associated Ghα is accessible to the interaction with G protein-coupled receptors in pregnant rat myometrium. Previous findings in human vascular smooth muscle cells reported that the particulate Ghα codistributes with stress fibers and may thus stabilize cytoskeletal structures through its cross-linking function (42Chowdhury Z.A. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz G.D. Bach T.L. Garcia-Manero G. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 38-49Google Scholar). In the latter study, the particulate Ghα appeared inactive when assayed by in vitro putrescine/casein assay, maybe due to its tight binding to preferred local substrates (42Chowdhury Z.A. Barsigian C. Chalupowicz G.D. Bach T.L. Garcia-Manero G. Martinez J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 38-49Google Scholar). It is known that stimulation of transglutaminase activity into cells requires both high concentrations of Ca2+ and a decrease of guanine nucleotide levels (43Smethurst P.A. Griffin M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 803-808Google Scholar, 44Zhang J. Lesort M. Guttmann R.P. Johnson G.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2288-2295Google Scholar). In rat myometrium, pathways leading to Ca2+ increase and uterine contraction are inhibited during pregnancy to allow development of fetoplacental units. In addition, in the presence of exogenous Ca2+, myometrial plasma membrane Ghα was able to catalyze the incorporation of putrescine into casein. These discrepancies between both models lead us to suggest that plasma membrane Ghα plays different roles in uterine and vascular smooth muscles. The present work supports previous findings in that intracellular localization of Ghα dictates its functions. Indeed, Ghα purified from plasma membranes was shown to exhibit higher GTP binding activity than the cytosolic Ghα in mouse heart (45Park H. Park E.-S. Lee H.S. Yun H.-Y. Kwon N.S. Baek K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 496-500Google Scholar). In addition, translocation of Ghα from the plasma membrane to the cytosol is accompanied by the loss of GTP binding and the appearance of transglutaminase activity (39Korner G. Bachrach U. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 130: 44-50Google Scholar, 40Gill L.S. Pabbathi V.K. Vignes M. Haynes L.W. Brain Res. 1998; 788: 95-103Google Scholar). In myometrium, the up-regulation of cytosolic Ghα at term coincides with the onset of labor. At this time, the very high elevation of intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ could stimulate transglutaminase activity. Recent data from mice lacking TG2 showed that this function is important for the stabilization of apoptotic thymocytes before their clearance (46Szondy Z. Sarang Z. Molnar P. Nemeth T. Piacentini M. Mastroberardino P.G. Falasca L. Aeschlimann D. Kovacs J. Kiss I. Szegezdi E. Lakos G. Rajnavölgyi E. Birckbichler P.J. Melino G. Fésüs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7812-7817Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to suggest that the cytosolic Ghα stabilizes dying myometrial cells during uterine involution that occurs after delivery. Ghα-induced Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation—We have shown previously that myometrial α1-AR participate to the initiation of uterine contraction at term through activation of the Gq/PLC system (23Limon-Boulez I. Mhaouty-Kodja S. Coudouel N. Benoit de Coignac A. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1175-1182Google Scholar, 47Legrand C. Maltier J.P. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1986; 76: 415-424Google Scholar). During pregnancy, Gqα and PLCβ isoforms are down-regulated, thereby resulting in a weak phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to the activation of α1-AR (16Cohen-Tannoudji J. Mhaouty S. Elwardy-Merezak J. Lecrivain J.L. Robin M.T. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 55-64Google Scholar, 17Mhaouty-Kodja S. Houdeau E. Legrand C. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 570-576Google Scholar). The present study shows that α1-AR interact with Ghα in pregnant rat myometrium. Moreover, the level of α1-AR-coupled Ghα increased during pregnancy, with a peak reached at day 20. Interestingly, our recent findings reveal a similar pattern for the increase of the myometrial weight and DNA amount during pregnancy. 2M. Dupuis, A. Lévy, and S. Mhaouty-Kodja, unpublished data. The correlation between α1-AR/Ghα coupling and myometrial proliferation could be highly relevant to understanding the physiological significance of α1-AR expression during pregnancy, particularly given that α1-AR mediate proliferation of several smooth muscle cell types (48Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Google Scholar). To address this question, we transfected DDT1-MF2 cells with wild type and transglutaminase-inactive Ghα. Previous studies have shown that mutating the active site cysteine (Cys-277) impairs transglutaminase activity of Ghα without affecting its GTP binding/GTPase function and interaction with α1-AR (49Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Google Scholar). The results indicated that α1-AR operate through Ghα to stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation. Firstly, overexpression of Ghα enhanced α1-adrenergic-induced DNA synthesis. Secondly, the use of C277S-Ghα showed that this response involves the GTP binding/GTPase function of Ghα. Some studies in vascular smooth muscle cells reported the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in α1-AR-induced proliferation (48Zhong H. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 261-276Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe an additional mechanism by which α1-AR could regulate smooth muscle cell proliferation. Indeed, our data are the first demonstration of the involvement of Ghα in such a cellular response. The molecular mechanisms underlying smooth muscle cell proliferation remain to be clarified. In rat hepatocytes, it was suggested that Ghα could act on PLCδ1 to induce cell proliferation (50Wu J. Liu S.-H. Zhu J.-L. Norton P.A. Nojiri S. Hoek J.B. Zern M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22213-22219Google Scholar). In non-pregnant human myometrium, such interaction between Ghα and PLCδ1 was described (7Park E.-S. Won J.H. Han K.J. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Lee H.S. Yun H.-Y. Kwon N.S. Baek K.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 283-289Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our results indicate that if PLCδ1 could be a downstream effector for α1-AR/Ghα coupling and participate in the Ca2+ increase and uterine contractions at term, this seems unlikely during pregnancy. In fact, at this period, PLCδ1 is down-regulated, as are the majority of the contraction-associated proteins. Ghα was also shown to participate in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases by α1-AR in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (51Lee K.-H. Lee N. Lim S. Jung H. Ko Y.-G. Park H.-Y. Jang Y. Lee H. Hwang K.-C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 84: 101-107Google Scholar). Further studies will define whether Ghα activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to induce myometrial cell proliferation during pregnancy. In summary, our results reveal, for the first time, that the expression of Ghα is induced in pregnant rat myometrium. Moreover, the induced protein preferentially associates with the plasma membrane where it interacts with α1-AR. During pregnancy, Ghα may play an important role in the transduction of myometrial α1-adrenergic signaling. Firstly, we have shown previously that Gqα is down-regulated at this period. Secondly, Ghα enhanced α1-adrenergic-induced proliferation of DDT1-MF2 smooth muscle cell line. We are sincerely grateful to Dr. R. M. Graham and Dr. S. Iismaa for the generous gift of wild type and mutant Ghα constructs. We acknowledge M. T. Robin for help in preparing the figures."
https://openalex.org/W1963958066,"We have shown previously that a T10 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) bound to the transcriptional terminator of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tDNAIle(TAT) gene arrests elongating yeast RNA polymerase (pol) III at a position that precedes by 20 bp the upstream end of the PNA roadblock (Dieci, G., Corradini, R., Sforza, S., Marchelli, R., and Ottonello, S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 5720–5725). Here, a PNA-binding cassette was placed at various distances downstream of a functional tDNAIle transcriptional terminator (T6) that is not bound by the T10 PNA, and the effect of the PNA roadblock on RNA 3′-end formation, transcript release, and transcription reinitiation was examined. With a PNA roadblock placed as close as 5 bp downstream of the T6 terminator, pol III could still reach the termination site and complete pre-tRNA synthesis, implying that the catalytic site-to-front edge (C-F) distance of the polymerase can shorten by >10 bp upon recognition of the terminator element. In addition, transcripts synthesized by a PNA-roadblocked terminating pol III were found to be released from transcription complexes. Interestingly, however, the same roadblock dramatically reduced the rate of transcription reinitiation. Also, when placed 5 bp downstream of a mutationally inactivated terminator element (T3GT2), the PNA roadblock restored transcription termination, thus indicating that the inactivated terminator is compromised in its ability to cause pol III pausing, but can still induce C-F distance shortening and transcript release. The latter two activities were found to be further impaired in variants of the inactivated terminator bearing fewer than three consecutive T residues (T2G2T2 and TG2TGT). The data indicate that RNA polymerase pausing, C-F distance shortening, and transcript release are functionally distinguishable features of the termination process and point to the RNA release propensity of pol III as a major determinant of its remarkably high termination efficiency. We have shown previously that a T10 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) bound to the transcriptional terminator of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae tDNAIle(TAT) gene arrests elongating yeast RNA polymerase (pol) III at a position that precedes by 20 bp the upstream end of the PNA roadblock (Dieci, G., Corradini, R., Sforza, S., Marchelli, R., and Ottonello, S.

The data indicate that RNA polymerase pausing, C-F distance shortening, and transcript release are functionally distinguishable features of the termination process and point to the RNA release propensity of pol III as a major determinant of its remarkably high termination efficiency. The three eukaryotic transcription machineries seem to have evolved different strategies for transcription termination. Termination by RNA polymerase (pol) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, RNA polymerase; T10, H-T10-d-Lys-NH2; PNA, peptide nucleic acid; C-F, catalytic site-to-front edge; TF, transcription factor. I is relatively complex, minimally requiring a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein to arrest RNA chain elongation and a transcript/polymerase release element upstream of a pause site (1Reeder R.H. Lang W.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 473-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). pol II termination is an even more complex process, being primarily regulated by mRNA 3′-end processing (2Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). At variance with pol I and pol II, pol III accurately and efficiently recognizes termination signals constituted by a short stretch of T residues in the apparent absence of any additional factor (3Cozzarelli N.R. Gerrard S.P. Schlissel M. Brown D.D. Bogenhagen D.F. Cell. 1983; 34: 829-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, pol III termination closely resembles bacterial RNA polymerase termination at intrinsic (Rho-independent) terminators, where a GC-rich stem-loop structure in the RNA, followed by a run of T residues in the coding DNA strand, is sufficient to dissociate a ternary elongation complex (4von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 5Nudler E. Gottesman M.E. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the case of pol III, however, factor-independent termination occurs in the absence of a stem-loop RNA structure, and simple clusters of four or more T residues in the coding strand serve as termination signals in most cases (6Paule M.R. White R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these differences, at least some mechanistic features of the termination process seem to be shared by the three different eukaryotic RNA polymerase systems and by the bacterial RNA polymerase as well. In particular, termination generally requires RNA polymerase pausing close to the termination site, and such a pause is crucial to allow sufficient time for destabilization of the transcription elongation complex by a cis-acting release element. At intrinsic bacterial terminators, the dA-dT stretch in the DNA contributes significantly to RNA polymerase pausing, and formation of a stem-loop structure in the RNA destabilizes the elongation complex, thus promoting transcript (and polymerase) release (7Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Science. 1999; 284: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 8Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Komissarova N. Becker J. Solter S. Kireeva M. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, termination by eukaryotic pol I requires a pause-inducing factor (Reb1 in yeast (10Ju Q.D. Morrow B.E. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5226-5234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transcription termination factor TTF-I in mammals (11Evers R. Smid A. Rudloff U. Lottspeich F. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)), which binds to a specific site in the terminator region, and an upstream sequence acting as a transcript release element (12Lang W.H. Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). (A releasing factor is additionally needed for rRNA 3′-end formation and release in mammals (13Mason S.W. Sander E.E. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).) Transcription termination by pol III might as well rely on a similar interplay of pause and release elements. In this case, however, both of these elements are expected to be superimposed on the simple dT-dA stretch constituting the pol III termination signal. It is known that pol III pausing occurs on DNA sequences coding for runs of U residues (14Matsuzaki H. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1173-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Campbell Jr., F.E. Setzer D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2260-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) concurrently with exoribonucleolytic retraction promoted by the C11 subunit of the enzyme (16Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Chedin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The mechanism of RNA release by a pol III termination complex is still largely unknown, however; and a transcript (or transcription complex) release element has never been functionally identified in the pol III system. A convenient approach for studying transcription termination relies on the use of protein roadblocks precisely positioned downstream of termination sequences. By physically contacting a terminating RNA polymerase, such roadblocks can effectively interfere with the termination process, thus providing information on structural transitions undergone by the enzyme during termination. For example, a functional coupling between transcription termination and an RNA polymerase structural rearrangement was suggested previously based on the observation that a bacterial termination complex arrested at the termination site by a downstream roadblock is unable to release the RNA chain (18Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Protein roadblocks have also been employed for the study of transcription termination by eukaryotic RNA polymerases. In the case of pol I, the lac repressor has been shown to effectively substitute for Reb1 in inducing the pausing step of termination (19Jeong S.W. Lang W.H. Reeder R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5929-5936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reb1 was also shown to induce pol III pausing (12Lang W.H. Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the case of pol III, however, a lac repressor positioned just downstream of the termination site did not produce any effect on transcription, except for a 2–3-nucleotide transcript shortening (20Syroid D.E. Capone J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A valuable alternative to DNA-binding protein roadblocks is represented by DNA ligands such as synthetic polyamides (21Gottesfeld J.M. Neely L. Trauger J.W. Baird E.E. Dervan P.B. Nature. 1997; 387: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 22Gottesfeld J.M. Belitsky J.M. Melander C. Dervan P.B. Luger K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and peptide nucleic acids (23Hanvey J.C. Peffer N.J. Bisi J.E. Thomson S.A. Cadilla R. Josey J.A. Ricca D.J. Hassman C.F. Bonham M.A. Au K.G. Carter S.G. Bruckenstein D.A. Boyd A.L. Noble S.A. Babiss L.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1481-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 24Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Buchardt O.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5720-5725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which have the advantage of being much smaller than DNA-binding proteins, yet highly effective in interfering with transcription in a strictly sequence-specific manner. In particular, we have recently shown that an H-T10-d-Lys-NH2 (T10) peptide nucleic acid (PNA) can efficiently block pol III elongation by forming a stable triple helix adduct with the poly(dA) tract present on the transcribed strand of class III gene terminators (25Dieci G.

Variants of this gene carrying a downstream T10 PNA-binding cassette were obtained by PCR using oligonucleotide 5′-CAAGCCGGAACTCAAAAGGG as the forward primer and the following oligonucleotides as reverse primers: 5′-AAAAAAAAAAGAGCTCTAGAAAAAAGAGAAAGTGCT for Ile_PNAlink9, 5′-AAAAAAAAAATCTAGAAAAAAGAGAAAGTGCTCGAG for Ile_PNAlink5, 5′-AAAAAAAAAAGCAAAAAAGAGAAAGTGCTCGAG for Ile_PNAlink2, 5′-AAAAAAAAAATCTAGAACAAAGAGAAAGTGCTCGAGG for Ile_PNAT3GT2, 5′-AAAAAAAAAATCTAGAACCAAGAGAAAGTGCTCGAGG for Ile_PNAT2G2T2, and 5′-AAAAAAAAAATCTAGACACCAGAGAAAGTGCTCGAGG for Ile_ PNATG2TGT.

In Vitro Transcription—In all transcription experiments, the DNA template (in the form of a supercoiled plasmid) was preincubated with 400 nm T10 PNA in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) at 40 °C for 60 min in a volume of 11 μl.

The size difference between full-length and truncated transcripts in Figs. 1B, 2, 5A, and 6A was determined by direct comparison with the migration positions of known size products obtained from a dideoxy chain termination sequencing reaction run on the same sequencing gel (7 m urea and 5–7% polyacrylamide). Gel filtration analysis of transcription products on Sepharose 2B (Amersham Biosciences) was performed as described previously (27Dieci G. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Lukhtanov E. Thuriaux P. Werner M.

Corradini R. Sforza S. Marchelli R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5720-5725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Under multiple round transcription conditions, the overall levels of tDNAIle transcription dramatically decreased in the presence of 400 nm T10 PNA, with the concomitant appearance of truncated transcripts that were considerably shorter than the full-length pre-tRNAIle transcripts (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). A precise determination of the difference in size between full-length and truncated transcripts synthesized from the tRNAIle gene (carried out on a sequencing gel; see “Experimental Procedures” for details) revealed that the truncated tDNAIle transcription products were 23 nucleotides shorter than the average full-length tDNAIle transcript (Fig. 1B). 2Transcription termination at T runs generally results in transcript size microheterogeneity due to the incorporation of different numbers of 3′-terminal U residues (14Matsuzaki H. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1173-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); a migration position corresponding to the middle region of the terminated transcript ladder (as in Fig. 1B, lane 1) was thus chosen as a reference to determine the transcript size difference. These truncated transcripts were produced by transcription complexes that had been arrested ahead of the termination site by the PNA roadblock. Taking the upstream border of the roadblock as a landmark for the position of the polymerase front edge and the RNA 3′-end as a signature of the position of the catalytic site, the catalytic site-to-front edge (C-F) distance of a PNA-arrested, elongating pol III could be estimated to be ∼20 bp. Full-length transcripts produced in the presence of the PNA (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2) were generated by highly efficient reinitiation of a small number of PNA-free transcription complexes, as demonstrated by the fact that such transcripts almost completely disappeared when the PNA-inhibited reaction was limited to a single round with heparin (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Under single round transcription conditions (lanes 3 and 4), the PNA roadblock caused only a transcript shortening effect, but it did not produce any change in the total transcription output, thus indicating that transcription inhibition brought about by the PNA is due to an impairment of transcription reinitiation. Based on the observation that a (T10 PNA)2-DNA adduct is highly effective in blocking an elongating pol III, we devised a strategy aimed at exploiting the PNA roadblock for the study of transcription termination. For this purpose, we prepared a series of tDNAIle(TAT)-derived constructs bearing a T10 PNA-binding cassette (i.e. a stretch of 10 consecutive A residues on the transcribed strand) placed at various distances (from 2 to 9 bp) downstream of a functional T6 termination site (designated Ile_PNAlink2, Ile_PNAlink5, and Ile_PNAlink9) (Fig. 2A). The use of these tDNAIle derivatives to probe pol III termination relies on the target specificity of the T10 PNA, viz. on its ability to bind a T10 (or longer) sequence element, but not a T6 (or shorter) sequence. In fact, transcription of a natural tDNA bearing such a terminator (e.g. the dT6-dA6 element of tDNA-Glu(TTC)) is unaffected by PNA concentrations that severely inhibit transcription of genes such as tDNAIle(TAT), which has a T12 terminator (25Dieci G. Corradini R. Sforza S. Marchelli R. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5720-5725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, when added to the templates represented in Fig. 2A, the T10 PNA will bind only to the dT10-dA10 cassette placed downstream of the T6 terminator, but not to the terminator itself. These templates were transcribed in vitro in either the presence or absence of the T10 PNA, and the resulting RNA products were separated on a sequencing gel (Fig. 2B). With the Ile_PNAlink9 and Ile_PNA-link5 templates (lanes 3–6), overall transcription in the presence of the T10 PNA was inhibited by 2- and 4-fold, respectively; yet in both cases, most of the transcripts were full-length, with a size distribution nearly identical to that observed in the absence of the PNA (compare lanes 4 and 6 with lanes 3 and 5). Transcription termination at the T6 terminators borne by these templates was otherwise highly efficient; only a few polymerases read through this terminator and produced longer transcripts (a trace of which is visible in the upper half-region of lanes 3, 5, and 7), corresponding to termination at the downstream T10 PNA-binding cassette sequence. Such downstream termination products were not formed in the presence of the T10 PNA (lanes 4, 6, and 8). With the Ile_PNAlink2-T10 PNA adduct (lanes 7 and 8), in which the upstream end of the PNA roadblock is only 2 bp behind the last T residue of the T6 terminator, strong PNA-dependent transcription inhibition was observed (comparable with the inhibition observed for transcription of the unmodified tDNAIle template) (lanes 1 and 2), and truncated transcripts appeared in the presence of the PNA (lane 8). The fact that pol III can complete pre-tRNAIle synthesis despite the presence of a downstream PNA roadblock that is only 5 bp away from the last T residue of the T6 terminator (Ile_PNAlink5 template) (lanes 5 and 6) provides strong circumstantial evidence for a terminator-induced conformational change that allows the enzyme active site to reach a position on the template that is no more than 7 bp away from the upstream end of the roadblock (i.e. the fourth T residue of the T6 terminator, which corresponds to the average termination site). Indeed, the observation that truncated transcripts (corresponding to upstream arrested complexes; see below) accumulated to significantly higher levels in the case of the Ile_PNAlink2 template sets a lower limit of ∼5 bp for the polymerase C-F distance. Such a distance is clearly at variance with the C-F distance estimated for a PNA-arrested, elongating pol III on the wild-type tRNAIle gene (lanes 1 and 2). In the latter case, in fact, the enzyme did not seem to advance beyond a position that is ∼20 bp away from the upstream end of the roadblock. In the region immediately preceding the PNA roadblock, the unmodified tDNAIle and Ile_PNAlink5 templates differ only in the presence or absence of the T6 termination sequence (plus the 5-bp linker in the case of Ile_PNAlink5). Therefore, the observed difference in pol III active site positioning with respect to the upstream end of the roadblock and thus with respect to the front edge of the enzyme is likely to reflect a terminator-induced structural rearrangement of the enzyme. PNA-induced Uncoupling of pol III Termination and Reinitiation—In the case of the unmodified tRNAIle(TAT) gene, the T10 PNA arrested elongating pol III before it reached the terminator, thereby strongly inhibiting subsequent recycling (Fig. 1). We thus asked whether transcription inhibition caused by a PNA roadblock placed downstream of the T6 termination site (i.e. under conditions in which a substantial fraction of the transcripts are of full-length size) (Fig. 2B) is also due to impairment of pol III recycling. This point was addressed by limiting transcription of pre-formed PNA·tDNA complexes to a single round. In the experiment in Fig. 3 (A and B), the Ile_PNAlink5 and Ile_PNAlink2 templates, on which the PNA roadblock had been pre-assembled, were transcribed under conditions allowing either multiple rounds (lanes 1 and 2) or only a single round (lanes 3 and 4) of transcription. With both templates, the PNA reduced the total output of multiple round transcription to levels almost identical (Fig. 3B) or close (Fig. 3A) to those produced in a single round reaction. Under single round transcription conditions, the PNA had no significant effect on the total amount of transcripts or on their size, except for the appearance of substantial amounts of truncated transcripts in the case of Ile_PNAlink2 (Fig. 3B, lane 4) and of lower amounts of similarly sized transcripts also in the case of the Ile_PNAlink5 template (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). Transcript shortening observed with the Ile_PNAlink2 template closely paralleled that reported in Fig. 2B (where full-length and truncated products were much better resolved because they were fractionated on a sequencing gel). The data thus indicate that a PNA roadblock positioned as close as 5 bp downstream of the termination site does indeed strongly interfere with transcription reinitiation, but it still allows the completion of most pre-tRNA chains. Transcript Release from PNA-arrested pol III Termination Complexes—According to a previous study of transcription termination by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, roadblock-induced arrest of the bacterial enzyme on a Rho-independent terminator sequence results in suppression of RNA chain release at the termination site (18Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We thus reasoned that, similar to the bacterial enzyme situation and consistent with the observed inhibition of transcription reinitiation, a terminating pol III impeded in its downstream movements by the PNA roadblock might be incapable of releasing the completed transcript. We tested this possibility by investigating the physical state (either free or transcription complex-bound) of the transcripts produced in PNA-inhibited reactions by molecular filtration on Sepharose 2B, a gel permeation matrix that can resolve released RNA from RNA molecules that are still part of arrested ternary complexes (14Matsuzaki H.

It comprises three functional globin genes (5′-ζ2-α2-α1–3′), the expression of which is strictly dependent on a positive regulatory element located 40-kb upstream, HS-40. This DNase I-hypersensitive site is the only known regulatory element displaying strong erythroid-specific enhancer activity within the human α-globin complex.

Taken together, these results emphasize the importance of promoter sequences as the main targets for the activation mechanism of the human α-globin genes by HS-40. The human α-globin complex is located in the telomeric region of the short arm of chromosome 16. It comprises three active genes: the embryonic ζ2 gene and the two fetal-adult α2 and α1 genes, which are arranged from 5′ to 3′ in the order of their activation during development (5′-ζ2-α2-α1–3′) (1Higgs D.R. Baillieres Clin. Haematol. 1993; 6: 117-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The complex is located in a GC-rich isochore within an early replicating and constitutively DNase I-sensitive chromatin domain in both erythroid and non-erythroid cells, although the α-globin genes are transcribed exclusively in erythroid cells (2Craddock C.F.

This transcriptional erythroid specificity is controlled by a single positive regulatory element, which corresponds to a DNase I-hypersensitive site located 40 kb upstream of the ζ2 gene and thus named HS-40 (5Bernet A.

The human α-globin complex is also surrounded by several widely expressed genes, including the –14 gene, which is located 14-kb upstream of the ζ2 gene and is transcribed in the opposite orientation compared with the α-globin genes (15Vyas P. Vickers M.A. Picketts D.J. Higgs D.R. Genomics. 1995; 29: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcription of the –14 gene is independent of HS-40 despite the location of HS-40 in the fifth intron of the ubiquitous gene (5Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HS-40 therefore appears to be involved in the highly selective and erythroid-specific transcriptional activation of the human α-globin genes. Nonetheless, the mechanism responsible for this selective activation remains unknown. To characterize this mechanism, we investigated how the HS-40-mediated transcriptional activation of the human α-globin genes could be affected by the insertion of new sequences between HS-40 and the globin genes. In a previous study, we observed that the insertion of either an extra α-globin gene or a marker gene driven by a non-erythroid promoter in the vicinity of HS-40 led to a drastic reduction of HS-40-mediated activation of the resident α-globin genes, without necessarily leading to the activation of the newly inserted gene by HS-40. The results also demonstrated that the observed impairment of HS-40 activity was independent of the position, the orientation, and the erythroid or non-erythroid nature of the newly inserted gene (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we used the recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) 1The abbreviations used are: RMCE, recombinase-mediated cassette exchange; HMBA, N,N′-hexamethylene bisacetamide; CMV, cytomegalovirus; nt, nucleotide(s); WT, wild type; LTR, long terminal repeat. technique and a hybrid mouse erythroleukemia cell line (MEL) carrying a single copy of human chromosome 16. Through this study, we targeted the insertion of (i) the α-globin coding sequence alone, either methylated or unmethylated, (ii) the α-globin promoter alone, and (iii) the α-globin coding sequence driven by either the –14 gene promoter or an α-globin promoter devoid of its TATA-box, immediately downstream of HS-40. The results demonstrate that HS-40 activity is not impaired by the insertion of a coding sequence alone except when it is methylated but is impaired by the insertion of a sole promoter sequence. Moreover, our results indicate that this negative effect increases along with the transcriptional rate of the inserted promoter. These results are discussed in term of the mechanism by which HS-40 activity can be captured by the different promoters present within the same human α-globin complex. Cell Culture—All experiments were performed in the mouse erythroleukemia hybrid cell line LT585P3, which contains a single copy of normal human chromosome 16 (6Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J.A.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and erythroid terminal differentiation was induced by growing the cells for 3 days in the presence of 5 mmN,N′-hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA; Sigma). Exchange Plasmids—The following four exchange plasmids were derived from the previously described pαT-globin gene plasmid (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To construct the Δpα/α-globin plasmid, the human α-globin promoter was deleted from the pαT-globin gene plasmid as an XbaI/NcoI fragment, thus generating protruding 5′ and 3′ ends that were filled in by Klenow enzyme. The pα/Δα-globin plasmid was obtained by deleting the human α-globin coding sequence from the pαT-globin gene plasmid as an NcoI/BglII fragment and filling the protruding ends in by Klenow enzyme. For the p-14/α-globin plasmid, the –14 gene minimal promoter for complete transcriptional activity was obtained by PCR reaction on LT585P3 genomic DNA using the 5′ primer, GCTCTAGAGCGCGGAACTCGGTGGCTTC, and the 3′ primer, ACCTGAACAGCAGCTTATTGC. The underlined sequence indicates an XbaI site that was added in order that the 611-bp-long PCR product could be introduced into the pαT-globin gene plasmid as an XbaI/NcoI fragment in place of the α-globin promoter (The NcoI site came from the pGEM-T PCR cloning vector; Promega). The ΔTATA/α-globin plasmid was obtained by mutating the TATA-box of the human α-globin promoter on the pαT-globin gene plasmid in vitro using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). For the purpose of this mutation, we used the 5′ primer, CGGGCGTGCCCCCGCGCCCCAAGCAAGCTTCCTGGCGCGCTCGCG, and the 3′ primer, CGCGAGCGCGCCAGGAAGCTTGCTTGGGGCGCGGGGGCACGCCCG. The underlined sequences indicate the insertion of a new HindIII restriction site, which was used to verify the mutation on the plasmid by enzymatic digestion prior to transfection. For the Δpα/α-globinMeth plasmid, the Δpα/α-globin plasmid was methylated in vitro using the SssI methylase (Roche Applied Science) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The Δpα/α-globinMeth plasmid was then subjected to digestion by the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII to clear the preparation of any incompletely methylated copies of the plasmid.

Isolated ganciclovir-resistant clones were then amplified and analyzed by Southern blot to verify the exchange of the CMV-HygroTK cassette for the newly inserted sequence. RNase Protection Assay—Total cellular RNA was prepared using RNA-plus™ (Quantum Biotechnologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (5Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 10 μg of total RNA and the following two labeled antisense RNA probes. The human riboprobe (5Bernet A. Sabatier S. Picketts D.J. Ouazana R. Morlé F. Higgs D.R. Godet J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) includes 231-nt complementary to the first intron and exon of both adult human α-globin genes and is expected to produce (i) a single protected fragment of 133 nt with normal α-globin mRNAs (αH), (ii) a single protected fragment of 97 nt with p-14/α-globin hybrid mRNAs (p-14/α), and (iii) two protected fragments of 97 and 34 nt with TATA-box-mutated α-globin mRNAs (ΔTATA/α). The mouse α-globin riboprobe includes 180 nt complementary to the 3′ end of the first exon of the mouse α-globin genes and is expected to give a protected fragment of 75 nt (αM) with mouse α-globin mRNAs. Radioactive signals corresponding to each specific protected fragment were quantified using a GS-525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) and the Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). We have previously demonstrated that the insertion of a new human α-globin gene immediately downstream of HS-40 leads to a drastic decrease in HS-40-mediated transcriptional activation of the resident human α-globin genes, concomitant with an increase in activation of the inserted erythroid gene (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine which part of the inserted gene is responsible for this competition over HS-40 activity, we decided to use the RMCE strategy (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R.

Endogenous Human α-Globin Expression Is Inhibited Only upon Insertion of a New Promoter Near HS-40 —We inserted either the α-globin coding sequence alone (from the Δpα/α-globin plasmid) or only the promoter of the α-globin gene (from the pα/Δα-globin plasmid) by RMCE. The isolated clones were analyzed by Southern blot using an HS-40 probe for legitimate exchange of the CMV-HygroTK gene of the parental clone (HYTK clone) (16Espéret C. Sabatier S.

Five clones showed either the 2.2- or 1.3-kb fragment expected for the insertion of the Δpα/α-globin cassette in either transcriptional orientation, and six clones showed either the 1.5- or 2.1-kb fragment expected for the insertion of the pα/Δα-globin cassette in either orientation. The targeted clones and parental cells harboring no insertion (WT) were then grown for 4 days in the presence or absence of HMBA, a chemical inducer of erythroid differentiation. Equal amounts of total cellular RNA prepared from these cells were analyzed by RNase protection assay, using a mixture of probes allowing for the specific detection of human and mouse α-globin transcripts. We were unable to analyze the rate of transcription driven by the newly inserted α-globin promoter, as no additional sequence was added 3′ of the promoter in order to avoid any interference. Typical results are shown in Figs. 1C and 2C, and quantitative analyses obtained from three different experiments are presented in Figs. 1D and 2D.Fig. 2Characterization of clones bearing the targeted insertion of the human α-globin promoter alone.A, schematic map of the human α-globin locus in WT cells, HYTK clone (HYTK →), and cells harboring the replacement of the HygroTK gene by the pα/Δα-globin construct in the same orientation as the endogenous human α genes (pα/Δα-globin →) or in the opposite orientation (pα/Δα-globin ←).

The white portion of the bar represents the average deviation, and the n-value is shown on the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data indicate that the level of expression of the human endogenous α-globin genes does not significantly differ between the clones bearing the α-globin coding sequence and the parental cells harboring no insertion (Fig. 1, C and D, compare lanes 2–6 with lane 1). In contrast, the level of human α-globin mRNAs is markedly reduced in all of the clones bearing the α-globin promoter devoid of any coding sequence (Fig. 2, C and D, compare lanes 2–7 with lane 1). Indeed, the results demonstrate that the human endogenous α-globin expression in the presence of the α-globin promoter is only 45% of its level in WT cells. These data indicate that the inhibition of the human endogenous α-globin gene expression observed when a new gene is inserted near HS-40 is due to the specific insertion of a promoter sequence. Insertion of a Methylated Coding Sequence Impairs the Human α-Globin Expression—As we had found that the α-globin coding sequence inserted near HS-40 has no effect on the activation of the α-globin genes during erythroid differentiation, we wondered whether methylation could turn this sequence into an interfering one. We therefore targeted the insertion of an in vitro methylated α-globin coding sequence. Southern blot analyses were performed to identify correctly targeted Δpα/α-globinMeth clones using the PstI restriction enzyme and an α-globin probe (Fig. 3, A and B). All of the Δpα/α-globinMeth clones, as well as the WT and HYTK controls, showed the 1.5-kb fragment corresponding to the human resident α-globin genes. The four Δpα/α-globinMeth clones showed an extra 0.9-kb signal as expected for the insertion of the Δpα/α-globinMeth cassette in either orientation (Fig. 3B and data not shown). In parallel, the methylation state of the inserted sequence was analyzed using the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes HpaII, MaeII, and HhaI (Fig. 3B and data not shown). The results clearly indicate that following treatment with an enzyme such as HpaII, the 1.5-kb signal corresponding to the nonmethylated human resident α-globin genes disappears in all Δpα/α-globinMeth clones and controls (Fig. 3B, compare each odd lane with its following even lane), whereas each of the Δpα/α-globinMeth clones conserves the 0.9-kb fragment, proving that the HpaII enzyme is unable to digest the Δpα/α-globinMeth cassette as was expected for a methylated sequence (Fig. 3B, lanes 6, 8, and 10). We then digested the Δpα/α-globinMeth clone genomic DNA using the methylation-insensitive isoschizomer of HpaII, MspI (data not shown). In that case, the 0.9-kb fragment disappeared in each of the Δpα/α-globinMeth clones, confirming that the HpaII/MspI sites (i) are present in the Δpα/α-globinMeth cassette and (ii) are methylated. To test the spreading of methylation from the methylated cassette to adjacent genomic DNA, we analyzed the DNA methylation status from the inserted cassette up to the core region of HS-40 by Southern blot, using the HS-40 probe and the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes HpaII, MaeII, and HhaI (Fig. 3C and data not shown). Fig. 3C presents typical results obtained following digestion by PstI either alone (Fig. 3C, compare lane 1 with each odd lane) or in combination with MaeII, which recognizes a site within HS-40 core (compare lane 2 with each even lane). All of the results showed an identical pattern for the control and Δpα/α-globinMeth clones, indicating that there is no spreading of methylation from the newly inserted sequence and that neither HS-40 nor the endogenous α-globin genes located downstream are damaged by DNA methylation. To determine the effect of insertion of the Δpα/α-globinMeth cassette on the endogenous human α-globin gene expression, we then analyzed the level of transcription of the human α-globin genes in the Δpα/α-globinMeth clones. Equal amounts of total cellular RNA from the methylated clones and parental cells harboring no insertion were analyzed by RNase protection assay before and after induction with HMBA (Fig. 3D). Quantitative results obtained from two different experiments are shown in Fig. 3E. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the human endogenous α gene expression in clones bearing the methylated insertion corresponds to only 60% of the normal human α-globin gene expression in WT cells (Fig. 3D, compare lane 1 with lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9, and Fig. 3E, compare lanes 2–5 with lane 1), although, as previously described, the insertion of the same unmethylated sequence does not lead to any change in the globin gene expression. These results demonstrate that the decrease in activation of the human α-globin genes in the Δpα/α-globinMeth clones is not due to a spreading of methylation, which would inhibit HS-40, but to a modification of the chromatin status resulting from the insertion of the methylated sequence between HS-40 and the α-globin genes. Insertion of an Ubiquitous Promoter Leads to Partial Inhibition of the Endogenous α-Globin Expression—The human α-globin complex is surrounded by several widely expressed genes, including the –14 gene, the promoter of which is naturally located between HS-40 and the human α-globin genes. As we have shown that promoters are able to trap HS-40 activity, we wondered whether the resident –14 gene competes with the downstream α-globin genes. Therefore, we tested the effect of the insertion of an additional –14 promoter on the human α-globin gene activation. For this experiment, we inserted the –14 promoter driving the α-globin coding sequence so that we could accurately quantify the effect of the –14 promoter itself because (i) we have shown that the α-globin coding sequence alone has no influence on the expression of the human endogenous globin genes, and (ii) it enables us to make a comparison with the previous insertions by RNase protection assay using the same human α-globin probe. Clones were analyzed by Southern blot using the HS-40 probe, and five clones showed either the 1.5- or 2.9-kb fragment expected for correct insertions in either orientation (Fig. 4, A and B). Equal amounts of total cellular RNA, prepared from the characterized clones and WT cells before or after induction with HMBA, were analyzed by RNase protection assay. Only the results following HMBA treatment are presented, as the expression of the p-14/α-globin construct is identical before and after induction (data not shown). The transcription of the inserted gene is observed as a protected signal of 97 nt (Fig. 4C); quantitative results obtained from three different experiments are shown in Fig. 4D. The data indicate that the p-14/α-globin gene expression is very weak (Fig. 4D). Indeed, it represents only 10% of the human resident α-globin gene expression in WT cells (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2–6 with lane 1, and Fig. 4D, compare lane 1 with each odd lane), therefore corresponding to a level of expression six times less than those of the entire α gene inserted in the same place (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The data also show that following induction of the cells in differentiation, the mean expression of the human endogenous α genes in p-14/α-globin clones represents only 56% of their expression in WT cells (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2–6 with lane 1, and Fig. 4D, compare lane 1 with each even lane). These results demonstrate that the ubiquitous –14 promoter can interfere with HS-40-mediated erythroid activation of the human α-globin genes. Insertion of a Human α-Globin Gene Devoid of Its TATA-box Leads to Partial Inhibition of Endogenous α-Globin Gene Activation—We have shown that the insertion of the α-globin (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol.

One of the major differences existing between the latter and the other promoters is the absence of a TATA-box in the –14 promoter. We have thus attempted to examine the putative role of the TATA-box in the mechanism of HS-40-mediated transcriptional activation of the human α-globin genes by inserting an α-globin gene with a mutated TATA-box. The ΔTATA/α-globin cassette was constructed by replacing the six bases, ATAAAC, forming the α-globin TATA-box by AAGCTT so that we would not modify the spacing of the promoter features (see “Experimental Procedures”). ΔTATA/α-globin clones were analyzed by Southern blot using the HS-40 probe, and six clones showed either the 2.8- or 1.3-kb fragment expected for the insertion of the cassette in either orientation (Fig. 5, A and B). Equal amounts of total cellular RNA, prepared from the characterized clones and WT cells both before and after induction by HMBA, were analyzed by RNase protection assay (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2–7 with lane 1, and data not shown). Typical quantitative results obtained from two independent experiments are shown in Fig. 5D. Contrary to what we were expecting according to the literature (18Amrolia P.J. Ramamurthy L. Saluja D. Tanese N. Jane S.M. Cunningham J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10051-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Kim C.G. Swendeman S.L. Barnhart K.M. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5958-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that the α-globin gene devoid of its TATA-box is still expressed and fairly up-regulated following addition of HMBA. Indeed, before induction with HMBA, the ΔTATA/α-globin gene is expressed as efficiently as the α-globin gene driven by its normal promoter when inserted at the same place (Ref. 16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and data not shown), and following induction of the cells in differentiation, the mutated gene expression increases strongly to reach a mean value of 24% of the expression of both human endogenous α-globin genes, which corresponds to 41% of the normal α-globin gene expression when inserted in the same place (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the fact that the ΔTATA/α-globin gene still responds to HS-40-mediated activation (Fig. 5, C and D). Moreover, the results indicate that, following induction of the ΔTATA/α-globin clones with HMBA, the human resident α genes are expressed to a mean rate of 50% of their normal expression in WT cells, which is very similar to the data obtained with the p-14/α-globin clones. Unfortunately, we were unable to compare the level of human endogenous α-globin expression between the ΔTATA/α-globin clones and WT cells before induction in differentiation, because this level is not significantly above the background level in either type of cells (data not shown). These results overall demonstrate that the TATA-box plays a partial role in HS-40-mediated activation of the human α-globin genes. In a previous study using hybrid MEL cells, which contain a single copy of human chromosome 16, we demonstrated that insertion of a new gene immediately downstream of HS-40 leads to a drastic decrease in HS-40-mediated activation of the endogenous human α-globin genes (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The observation that the inserted α-globin gene is activated at the expense of the human endogenous α genes suggests a phenomenon of competition as part of the mechanism of long range activation of the α-globin genes by HS-40. In this report, we therefore inserted different normal or mutated parts of a human α-globin gene, at the same site immediately downstream of HS-40, to determine which of the inserted gene features are responsible for the phenomenon of competition. We observed that insertion of the human α-globin coding sequence devoid of a promoter had no effect on endogenous human α-globin expression, whereas insertion of the α promoter alone led to a level of endogenous human α-globin expression of only 45% of its level in WT cells. These results emphasize the central role of the promoter sequence in the competition mechanism among genes of a single complex for activation by HS-40. Nonetheless, the α-globin promoter alone induces a less drastic effect than the entire α gene inserted at the same site (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although, we could not quantify the transcription rate driven by the α promoter alone (see “Results”), we can hypothesize that its weaker negative effect is because of a less efficient transcription rate in the absence of a coding sequence. Indeed, a transcriptional positive regulatory element has been described downstream of the α-globin gene cap site (20Brickner H.E. Zhu X.X. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15363-15368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is not included in the pα/Δα-globin construct. This element seems to be necessary for the α promoter to achieve maximal transcription level (20Brickner H.E. Zhu X.X. Atweh G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15363-15368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it has no activity by itself as shown by the neutrality of the α-globin coding sequence when inserted alone (Fig. 1D). Even though the α-globin coding sequence alone has no effect, the insertion of its in vitro methylated form induced a mild decrease in human endogenous α-globin expression. Having demonstrated that methylation does not spread from the coding sequence toward adjacent sequences, such as HS-40 or the endogenous α genes, this observation suggests that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation interfere with the mechanism of α-globin activation by HS-40 and that the integrity of the 40 kb that lies between HS-40 and the α genes is essential. Nonetheless, it remains possible that insertion of methylated DNA in such a close proximity to HS-40 induces more subtle changes in HS-40 tertiary structure and/or factor binding pattern. The data obtained from insertion of both the coding sequence and the promoter alone, along with our previous results (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), indicate that HS-40 may be able to recognize any promoter present in its vicinity regardless of its capacity to activate transcription from this promoter. Because the promoter of the ubiquitous –14 gene naturally lies between HS-40 and the globin genes, we decided to insert the –14 promoter driving the α-globin coding sequence directly downstream of HS-40 to test its effect on the endogenous human α-globin expression. We thus showed that the –14 promoter, as the other nonerythroid promoters, CMV and LTR (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), can trap HS-40 activity without being activated itself and induces partial inhibition of the human endogenous α gene expression, underlining the fact that the –14 gene might not be totally neutral regarding HS-40 activation of the globin genes in the natural context of the intact locus. Although our results illustrate the fact that HS-40 may recognize any promoter in its surroundings, they also suggest that TATA-box-containing promoters (LTR, CMV, α-globin) may compete more efficiently with the endogenous human α genes for activation by HS-40 than TATA-box-less promoters such as the –14 promoter. Indeed, the residual level of endogenous human α expression compared with WT cells is 11–12% for the insertion of the LTR, CMV, and α-globin promoters (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas it is 56% for the insertion of the –14 promoter. It is known that some enhancers, when shared between a TATA-box-containing and a TATA-box-less gene, preferentially activate the TATA-box-containing gene (21Ohtsuki S. Levine M. Cai H.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 22Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). We thus decided to test the putative role of the TATA-box in the mechanism of HS-40 activity and demonstrated that insertion of an α-globin gene devoid of its TATA-box decreases the human endogenous α gene expression down to 50% of its level in WT cells; the insertion of a normal α gene leaves only 11% of the endogenous human α gene expression (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has been shown that no transcription is detected from a mouse α-globin gene devoid of its TATA-box in in vitro transcription assays (19Kim C.G. Swendeman S.L. Barnhart K.M. Sheffery M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5958-5966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in the TATA-box of the β-globin promoter have also proved to drastically down-regulate transcription of the β-globin gene in transient transfection experiments (18Amrolia P.J. Ramamurthy L. Saluja D. Tanese N. Jane S.M. Cunningham J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10051-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the current study, however, we observed that the TATA-mutated α gene is still transcribed and fairly efficiently activated during erythroid differentiation, although it is expressed approximately half as much as the normal α gene inserted at the same position (48% of a single endogenous α gene expression in WT cells for the TATA-mutated α gene compared with 112% for the normal inserted α gene). These results seem to emphasize the fact that the TATA-box is an essential feature for enabling a promoter to trap HS-40 activity efficiently. Nonetheless, because the –14 and TATA-mutated α promoters both lack a TATA-box and show a weaker expression, it is difficult to argue whether the most important factor for a promoter to efficiently trap HS-40 activity is the presence of a TATA-box or a high level of transcription. However, when compiling the results obtained from the constructs that share the same α-globin coding sequence and that differ only in their promoters, we observed a clear correlation between the rate of mRNAs produced by the inserted constructs and the decrease in human endogenous α-globin mRNAs (Fig. 6). Thus, the importance of the transcription machinery composition and/or efficiency in the competition mechanism that regulates the human α-globin gene activation by HS-40 is emphasized. This observation is in agreement with our previous results obtained with the LTR and CMV promoters (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Indeed, insertion of these promoters known to drive high transcription rates (independently of any activation by HS-40) led to strong impairment of HS-40-mediated activation of the endogenous human α-globin genes (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). More generally, the results presented in this and previous (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reports highlight the mechanism that allows a promoter to trap HS-40 activity at the expense of the human α-globin genes. Indeed, it appears that HS-40 activity can be trapped (i) regardless of the orientation and downstream or upstream position of the inserted gene (16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), (ii) regardless of the erythroid or non-erythroid nature of the inserted gene (Ref. 16Espéret C. Sabatier S. Deville M.A. Ouazana R. Bouhassira E.E. Godet J. Morlé F. Bernet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25831-25839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar and data presented in this report), but (iii) according to the transcription rate initiated by the promoter (herein) and (iv) with a maximum efficiency when no epigenetic modification alters the chromatin lying between HS-40 and the human α genes (herein). Nonetheless, all of these observations were made in a MEL cell line. So, although the natural chromosomal environment is respected, it would be interesting to verify our hypothesis in a more physiological model such as whole mice. A competition phenomenon is also known to occur within the human and mouse β-globin loci, which are very homologous to the human α-globin complex. A “looping” model, suggesting that distal dominant positive elements can physically interact with one target gene at a time by looping out the intervening DNA, has been described to explain the mechanism of competition within the mouse β-globin complex (23Carter D. Chakalova L. Osborne C.S. Dai Y.F. Fraser P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 24Tolhuis B. Palstra R.J. Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Mol.

Indeed, HS-40 could interact preferentially with the closest promoter via protein/protein interactions, forming a loop of DNA, which would be impaired by methylation of the intervening sequence. These interactions could lead either to an activation process for an erythroid promoter or to a sterile interaction with a nonerythroid promoter. With HS-40 being a unique element, each interaction would be at the expense of the other genes present in the same complex. The stronger the interaction with one gene, the less the others would be expressed, thus explaining the phenomenon of competition. Our results would complete this model further by emphasizing the role played by the rate of transcription in the strength of interaction between HS-40 and any particular promoter. We thank A.
