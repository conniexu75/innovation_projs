Wang et al. demonstrate how they can expand on that platform to fabricate very large quantum optical circuitry. They integrated more than 550 quantum optical components and 16 photon sources on a state-of-the-art single silicon chip, enabling universal generation, control, and analysis of multidimensional entanglement. The results illustrate the power of an integrated quantum optics approach for developing quantum technologies. Science , this issue p. 285"

Tylewicz et al. found that, as the days get shorter, communication channels between cells in aspen trees shut down. The blocked plasmodesmata sequester the dormant meristems from growth signals. Growth-promoting signals can be turned on and off relatively rapidly, but the closed plasmodesmata are not so nimble. Thus, despite the occasional sunny day, the trees stay dormant until spring.

https://openalex.org/W2790040397,"Benefiting from more precise imaging and radiotherapy, patients with locoregionally nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have a significantly higher survival rate. Nonetheless, distant metastasis is still the predominant mode of failure. Advances in cancer research have highlighted that pathological angiogenesis is necessary for tumor metastasis by offering oxygen, nutrients, or cell metastatic conduits. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, are increasingly implicated in modulation of angiogenesis in physiological and pathological conditions. Currently, we detected that miR-23a was highly enriched in NPC tissues at the metastatic or premetastatic stage, and its levels in NPC were associated with microvessel density. Subsequently, we proved that alteration of miR-23a expression modulated the growth, migration, and tube formation of HUVECs in vitro and affected the blood vessel outgrowth in the zebrafish model. Considering the possibility that extracellular miR-23a was horizontally transferred from CNE2 cells to HUVECs, we analyzed miR-23a encapsulated in exosomes, showing that overexpression of exosomal miR-23a in NPC promoted angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we provided evidences that miR-23a regulated angiogenesis by directly targeting testis-specific gene antigen (TSGA10). Taken together, our findings revealed that metastasis-associated miR-23a from NPC-derived exosomes plays an important role in mediating angiogenesis by targeting TSGA10."

Design Cross-sectional, observational study. Methods The study was conducted in 297 eyes of 297 healthy subjects aged 18 to 87 years. In one randomly selected eye of each participant the volume and mean thicknesses of the different macular layers were measured by SD-OCT using the instrument's macular segmentation software. Main outcome measures Volume and mean thickness of macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), retinal pigmentary epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor layer (PR). Results Retinal thickness was reduced by 0.24 μm for every one year of age. Age adjusted linear regression analysis revealed mean GCL, IPL, ONL and PR thickness reductions and a mean OPL thickness increase with age. Women had significantly lower mean GCL, IPL, INL, ONL and PR thicknesses and volumes and a significantly greater mRNFL volume than men. Conclusion The thickness of most retinal layers varies both with age and according to sex. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the rate of layer thinning produced with age."
https://openalex.org/W2790951509,"Recombination (R) rate and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses are the basis for plant breeding. These vary by breeding system, by generation of inbreeding or outcrossing and by region in the chromosome. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a favored food legume with a small sequenced genome (514 Mb) and n = 11 chromosomes. The goal of this study was to describe R and LD in the common bean genome using a 768-marker array of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based on Trans-legume Orthologous Group (TOG) genes along with an advanced-generation Recombinant Inbred Line reference mapping population (BAT93 x Jalo EEP558) and an internationally available diversity panel. A whole genome genetic map was created that covered all eleven linkage groups (LG). The LGs were linked to the physical map by sequence data of the TOGs compared to each chromosome sequence of common bean. The genetic map length in total was smaller than for previous maps reflecting the precision of allele calling and mapping with SNP technology as well as the use of gene-based markers. A total of 91.4% of TOG markers had singleton hits with annotated Pv genes and all mapped outside of regions of resistance gene clusters. LD levels were found to be stronger within the Mesoamerican genepool and decay more rapidly within the Andean genepool. The recombination rate across the genome was 2.13 cM / Mb but R was found to be highly repressed around centromeres and frequent outside peri-centromeric regions. These results have important implications for association and genetic mapping or crop improvement in common bean."
https://openalex.org/W2790481975,"Background Intestinal parasitic infections are considered a serious public health problem and widely distributed worldwide, mainly in urban and rural environments of tropical and subtropical countries. Globally, soil-transmitted helminths and protozoa are the most common intestinal parasites. Blastocystis sp. is a highly prevalent suspected pathogenic protozoan, and considered an unusual protist due to its significant genetic diversity and host plasticity. Methodology/main findings A total of 294 stool samples were collected from inhabitants of three rural valleys in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The stool samples were evaluated by parasitological methods, fecal culture, nested PCR and PCR/Sequencing. Overall prevalence by parasitological analyses was 64.3% (189 out of 294 cases). Blastocystis sp. (55.8%) was the most prevalent, followed by Endolimax nana (18.7%), Entamoeba histolytica complex (7.1%), hookworm infection (7.1%), Entomoeba coli (5.8%), Giardia intestinalis (4.1%), Iodamoeba butchilii (1.0%), Trichuris trichiura (1.0%), Pentatrichomonas hominis (0.7%), Enterobius vermicularis (0.7%), Ascaris lumbricoides (0.7%) and Strongyloides stercoralis (0.7%). Prevalence of IPIs was significantly different by gender. Phylogenetic analysis of Blastocystis sp. and BLAST search revealed five different subtypes: ST3 (34.0%), ST1 (27.0%), ST2 (27.0%), ST4 (3.5%), ST8 (7.0%) and a non-identified subtype. Conclusions/significance Our findings demonstrate that intestinal parasite infection rates in rural areas of the Sumidouro municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil are still high and remain a challenge to public health. Moreover, our data reveals significant genetic heterogeneity of Blastocystis sp. subtypes and a possible novel subtype, whose confirmation will require additional data. Our study contributes to the understanding of potential routes of transmission, epidemiology, and genetic diversity of Blastocystis sp. in rural areas both at a regional and global scale."
https://openalex.org/W2790090353,"This is the first genetic anthropology study on Arabs in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. The present meta-analysis included 100 populations from 36 Arab and non-Arab communities, comprising 16,006 individuals, and evaluates the genetic profile of Arabs using HLA class I (A, B) and class II (DRB1, DQB1) genes. A total of 56 Arab populations comprising 10,283 individuals were selected from several databases, and were compared with 44 Mediterranean, Asian, and sub-Saharan populations. The most frequent alleles in Arabs are A*01, A*02, B*35, B*51, DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DQB1*02:01, and DQB1*03:01, while DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01-DQB1*02:02 are the most frequent class II haplotypes. Dendrograms, correspondence analyses, genetic distances, and haplotype analysis indicate that Arabs could be stratified into four groups. The first consists of North Africans (Algerians, Tunisians, Moroccans, and Libyans), and the first Arabian Peninsula cluster (Saudis, Kuwaitis, and Yemenis), who appear to be related to Western Mediterraneans, including Iberians; this might be explained for a massive migration into these areas when Sahara underwent a relatively rapid desiccation, starting about 10,000 years BC. The second includes Levantine Arabs (Palestinians, Jordanians, Lebanese, and Syrians), along with Iraqi and Egyptians, who are related to Eastern Mediterraneans. The third comprises Sudanese and Comorians, who tend to cluster with Sub-Saharans. The fourth comprises the second Arabian Peninsula cluster, made up of Omanis, Emiratis, and Bahrainis. It is noteworthy that the two large minorities (Berbers and Kurds) are indigenous (autochthonous), and are not genetically different from “host” and neighboring populations. In conclusion, this study confirmed high genetic heterogeneity among present-day Arabs, and especially those of the Arabian Peninsula."
https://openalex.org/W2792051842,"Evidence-based interventions are essential in the prevention of violence against women (VAW). An understanding of risk factors for male perpetration of VAW using population-based research is crucial for developing such interventions. This study is a baseline assessment of a two-arm unmatched cluster randomised controlled trial (C-RCT), set up to assess the impact of a Rural Response System (RRS) intervention for preventing violence against women and girls in Ghana. This study aims at assessing past year prevalence and risk factors for sexual or physical intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration among men.The population-based survey involved 2126 men aged 18 and above living in selected communities in 4 districts in the central region of Ghana. Logistic regression techniques were used to determine risk factors for sexual or physical IPV perpetration. All models adjusted for age of respondent and took into account the study design.Half of the men had perpetrated at least one form of violence against their intimate partners in their lifetime while 41% had perpetrated sexual or physical IPV. Majority (93%) of the men had been in relationships in the 12 months preceding the survey, and of these, 23% had perpetrated sexual or physical IPV. Childhood factors associated with sexual or physical IPV included witnessing abuse of mother (aOR:1.40(1.06-1.86)), and neglect (aOR:1.81(1.30-2.50)). Other major risk factors for IPV perpetration were: having multiple partners (aOR:1.76(1.36-2.26)), (involvement in transactional sex (aOR:1.76(1.36-2.26)), substance use (aOR:1.74(1.25-2.43)) and gender inequitable attitudes (aOR:0.94(0.91-0.97)).Childhood violence experience and witnessing, risky behaviour (multiple partners, transactional sex, substance use) and gender inequitable attitudes are major risk factors for sexual or physical IPV perpetration. Perpetration of sexual or physical IPV tend to co-occur with non-partner violence and emotional IPV perpetration. Interventions targeting these factors are critical in reducing IPV."

https://openalex.org/W2790556761,"The nuclear import receptor karyopherin β1 (KPNB1) is involved in the nuclear import of most proteins and in the regulation of multiple mitotic events. Upregulation of KPNB1 has been observed in cancers including glioblastoma. Depletion of KPNB1 induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is not clearly elucidated. Here, we found that downregulation and functional inhibition of KPNB1 in glioblastoma cells induced growth arrest and apoptosis without apparent mitotic arrest. KPNB1 inhibition upregulated Puma and Noxa and freed Mcl-1-sequestered Bax and Bak, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis. Moreover, combination of Bcl-xL inhibitors and KPNB1 inhibition enhanced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. KPNB1 inhibition promoted cytosolic retention of its cargo and impaired cellular proteostasis, resulting in elevated polyubiquitination, formation of aggresome-like-induced structure (ALIS), and unfolded protein response (UPR). Ubiquitination elevation and UPR activation in KPNB1-deficient cells were reversed by KPNB1 overexpression or inhibitors of protein synthesis but aggravated by inhibitors of autophagy-lysosome or proteasome, indicating that rebalance of cytosolic/nuclear protein distribution and alleviation of protein overload favor proteostasis and cell survival. Chronic activation of eIF2α/ATF4 cascade of UPR was responsible for the upregulation of Puma and Noxa, apoptosis and ABT-263 sensitivity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that KPNB1 is required for proteostasis maintenance and its inhibition induces apoptosis in glioblastoma cells through UPR-mediated deregulation of Bcl-2 family members."
https://openalex.org/W2789375348,"To assess the role of environment, medical care and individual risks factors for P. aeruginosa colonization and infection.A French multicentric prospective study involved ten ICUs for a five months period. Every adult patient newly hospitalized in ICUs with no P. aeruginosa carriage up to 48 hours after admission was included and weekly screened before discharge or death. Screening swabs were either rectal, sputum or oropharyngeal samples. Hydric environment was also sampled each week. Data on patient clinical features, environmental and device exposures, and antibiotics supports were regularly collected. Multivariate analysis was performed with a multistate model.The overall prevalence of P. aeruginosa carriage was 15.3% (201/1314). Risk factors associated with patient colonization were: use of inactive antibiotics against P. aeruginosa (HR = 1.60 [1.15-2.21] p<0.01), tap water contamination at the entry in the room (HR = 1.66 [1.01-2.27] p<0.05) and mechanical invasive ventilation (HR = 4.70 [2.66-8.31] p<0.0001). Active antibiotics prevented from colonization (HR = 0.67 [0.48-0.93] p = 0.02) and from infection (HR = 0.64 [0.41-1.01] p = 0.05). Interaction between hydric environment antibiotics support was not statistically associated with patient colonization.Hydric contamination and antibiotics pressure seem to remain key independent risk factors in P. aeruginosa colonization. These results advocate the need to carry on preventive and targeted interventions toward healthcare associated infections."
https://openalex.org/W2791297329,"Background Fundamental measures of control of tuberculosis are early detection and timely treatment of the affected. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with patient-related and health system-related delays among patients with tuberculosis in the Republic of Montenegro. Methods A cross-sectional study included 130 tuberculosis patients older than 15 years of age. The inclusion criteria were diagnosis of tuberculosis based on clinical, pathohistological and microbiological findings. Patient delay referred to the number of days between the onset of symptoms and the first consultation with general practitioner (GP). Health system delay represented the number of days between the first consultation with GP and the initiation of tuberculosis treatment.We classified delays longer than median delay length as 'prolonged delays'. Delays greater than 75th percentile of the maximum length of delay were classified as 'extreme delays'. Results Distribution of patient and health system delay in the overall delay was apprioximately equal (49% vs. 51%). Being married (OR = 2.54, p = 0.026) and having more negative attitudes towards tuberculosis (OR = 4.00, p = 0.045) were associated with extreme patient delay. Greater knowledge on tuberculosis was associated with lower likelihood of prolonged (OR = 0.24, p = 0.031) and extreme (OR = 0.30, p = 0.012) patient delay. Persons with negative sputum smear were more likely to experience prolonged (OR = 7.01, p<0.001) and extreme (OR = 4.40, p = 0.032) health system delay. Persons older than 47 years of age were more likely to experience prolonged health system delay (OR = 2.61, p = 0.042). Specialist consultation delay was associated with prolonged (OR = 1.08, p = 0.001) and extreme (OR = 1.05, p<0.001) health system delay. Conclusion Contribution to overall delay is equally distributed between the patients and the health care system. Improvement of knowledge in the general population and continuing medical education of the health care workers on tuberculosis could lead to reduction in patient and health system delays in treatment of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2791763160,"Silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead (H. nobilis) carp (collectively bigheaded carp) are invasive fish that threaten aquatic ecosystems in the upper Midwest United States and the Laurentian Great Lakes. Controlling bigheaded carp is a priority of fisheries managers and one area of focus involves developing acoustic deterrents to prevent upstream migration. For an acoustic deterrent to be effective however, the hearing ability of bigheaded carp must be characterized. A previous study showed that bigheaded carp detected sound up to 3 kHz but this range is narrower than what has been reported for other ostariophysans. Therefore, silver and bighead carp frequency detection was evaluated in response to 100 Hz to 9 kHz using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). AEPs were recorded from 100 Hz to 5 kHz. The lowest thresholds were at 500 Hz for both species (silver carp threshold: 80.6 ± 3.29 dB re 1 μPa SPLrms, bighead carp threshold: 90.5 ± 5.75 dB re 1 μPa SPLrms; mean ± SD). These results provide fisheries managers with better insight on effective acoustic stimuli for deterrent systems, however, to fully determine bigheaded carp hearing abilities, these results need to be compared with behavioral assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2793992286,"In cells, phosphorylation of pantothenic acid to generate phosphopantothenic acid by the pantothenate kinase enzymes is the first step in coenzyme A synthesis. Pantothenate kinase 2, the isoform localized in neuronal cell mitochondria, is dysfunctional in patients with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Fosmetpantotenate is a phosphopantothenic acid prodrug in clinical development for treatment of pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, which aims to replenish phosphopantothenic acid in patients. Fosmetpantotenate restored coenzyme A in short-hairpin RNA pantothenate kinase 2 gene-silenced neuroblastoma cells and was permeable in a blood-brain barrier model. The rate of fosmetpantotenate metabolism in blood is species-dependent. Following up to 700 mg/kg orally, blood exposure to fosmetpantotenate was negligible in rat and mouse, but measurable in monkey. Consistent with the difference in whole blood half-life, fosmetpantotenate dosed orally was found in the brains of the monkey (striatal dialysate) but was absent in mice. Following administration of isotopically labeled-fosmetpantotenate to mice, ~40% of liver coenzyme A (after 500 mg/kg orally) and ~50% of brain coenzyme A (after 125 μg intrastriatally) originated from isotopically labeled-fosmetpantotenate. Additionally, 10-day dosing of isotopically labeled-fosmetpantotenate, 12.5 μg, intracerebroventricularly in mice led to ~30% of brain coenzyme A containing the stable isotopic labels. This work supports the hypothesis that fosmetpantotenate acts to replace reduced phosphopantothenic acid in pantothenate kinase 2-deficient tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2793722805,"Objectives Different studies have reported the association between perceived stress and unhealthy diet choices. We aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between perceived stress and fat intake among undergraduate medical students. Methods/Principal findings A cross-sectional study was performed including first-year medical students. The outcome of interest was the self-report of fat intake assessed using the Block Screening Questionnaire for Fat Intake (high vs. low intake), whereas the exposure was perceived stress (low/normal vs. high levels). The prevalence of high fat intake was estimated and the association of interest was determined using prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Models were created utilizing Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Data from 523 students were analyzed, 52.0% female, mean age 19.0 (SD 1.7) years. The prevalence of high fat intake was 42.4% (CI: 38.2%–46.7%). In multivariate model and compared with those with lowest levels of stress, those in the middle (PR = 1.59; 95%CI: 1.20–2.12) and highest (PR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.46–2.53) categories of perceived stress had greater prevalence of fat intake. Gender was an effect modifier of this association (p = 0.008). Conclusions Greater levels of perceived stress were associated with higher fat intake, and this association was stronger among males. More than 40% of students reported having high fat consumption. Our results suggest the need to implement strategies that promote decreased fat intake."
https://openalex.org/W2792627078,"In this contribution, we determine the genetic population structure in the Skunk Clownfish (Amphiprion akallopsisos) across the Indian Ocean, and on a smaller geographic scale in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Highly restricted gene flow was discovered between populations on either side of the Indian Ocean using the control region as a mitochondrial marker (mtDNA). We verify this conclusion using 13 microsatellite markers and infer fine scale genetic structuring within the WIO. In total 387 samples from 21 sites were analysed using mtDNA and 13 microsatellite loci. Analysis included estimation of genetic diversity and population differentiation. A haplotype network was inferred using mtDNA. Nuclear markers were used in Bayesian clustering and a principal component analysis. Both markers confirmed strong genetic differentiation between WIO and Eastern Indian Ocean (EIO) populations, and a shallower population structure among Malagasy and East African mainland populations. Limited gene flow across the Mozambique Channel may be explained by its complex oceanography, which could cause local retention of larvae, limiting dispersal between Madagascar and the East African coast. Two other potential current-mediated barriers to larval dispersal suggested in the WIO, the split of the SEC at approximately 10° S and the convergence of the Somali Current with the East African Coast Current at approximately 3° S, were not found to form a barrier to gene flow in this species."
https://openalex.org/W2793712949,"Introduction Previous studies indicate that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection and combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can affect bone turnover. Furthermore, HIV-infected patients have lower bone mineral density (BMD) compared to a healthy reference population. Objective To evaluate the longitudinal effect of HIV-infection and cART on bone turnover markers (BTMs) and BMD in men with primary HIV-infection (PHI). Design, methods Thirty-five PHI-men were divided into two groups, those that received cART for the first time (n = 26) versus no-cART (n = 9). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed on femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH) and lumbar spine (LS) and BTMs (P1NP, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, ICTP and CTX) were measured at baseline and follow-up. Results At baseline, the median CD4+ T-cell count was 455 cells/mm3 (IQR 320–620) and plasma viral load 5.4 log10 copies/mL (IQR 4.7–6.0) in the cART treated group, compared to 630 (IQR 590–910) and 4.8 (IQR 4.2–5.1) in the untreated group. The median follow-up time was 60.7 weeks (IQR 24.7–96.0). All BTMs, except ICTP, showed a significant increase during cART versus no changes of BTMs in the untreated group. FN and TH BMD showed a significant decrease in both groups. LS BMD did not change in both groups. Conclusion Bone turnover increased in PHI-men treated with cART which was accompanied by a decrease in FN and TH BMD. No increase of bone turnover was seen in untreated PHI-men. Our study suggests that cART results in increased bone turnover and decreased BMD of the hip in PHI-men."

Using OCT (Micron IV®; Phoenix Research Labs, Pleasanton, CA, USA), the natural course of photoreceptor degeneration was recorded from postnatal day (P) 15 to P 287. The OCT images were qualitatively observed by comparing them to histological and ultrastructural findings at P 62 and P 169. In addition, each retinal layer was quantitatively analyzed longitudinally during degeneration, compared it to that observed in wild type Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The relationships between the ERG (full-field combined rod-cone response, 3.0 cds/m2 stimulation) findings and OCT images were also analyzed.In the qualitative study, the two layers presumably corresponding to the photoreceptor inner segment ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ) were identified in the P23H rat until PN day 32. However, the photoreceptor inner and outer segment (IS/OS) layer became diffusely hyperreflective on OCT after P 46, and the EZ and IZ zones could no longer be identified on OCT. In contrast, in the SD rats, the EZ and IZ were clearly distinguished until at least P 247. The ultrastructural study showed partial disarrangements of the photoreceptor outer segment discs in the P23H rats at P 62, although a light-microscopic histological study detected almost no abnormality in the outer segment. In the quantitative study, the outer retinal layer including the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) became significantly thinner in the P23H rats than in the SD rats after P 71. The thickness of the IS/OS layer was maintained in the P23H rats until P 130, and it became statistically thinner than in the SD rats at P 237. The longitudinal attenuation in the amplitude of the a- and b-waves of ERG was significantly correlated with the thickness of the combined OPL and ONL but not with that of the IS/OS layer.OCT showed the degenerated photoreceptor IS/OS layer in rhodopsin P23H transgenic rats (line 2) as a diffuse hyperreflective zone, even in the early stage, with the partially disarranged and destabilized OS discs recognizable by ultrastructural assessment but not by a histological study. The amplitude of the a- and b-waves mainly depends on the thickness of the OPL and ONL layer rather than the thickness of the photoreceptor IS/OS layer in P23H rats."
https://openalex.org/W2793677863,"We studied the phylogeography and plumage variation of the Russet-crowned Warbler (Myiothlypis coronata), from Venezuela to Bolivia, with focus on populations from Ecuador and northern Peru. We analyzed sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, geographic distributions, as well as photographs of specimens deposited at museum collections. Phylogenetic analyses identified three major lineages formed by populations from: Venezuela and Colombia (M. c. regulus), Ecuador and northern Peru (M. elata, M. castaneiceps, M. orientalis, M. c. chapmani), and central Peru and Bolivia (M. c. coronata). We found further population structure within M. c. regulus and M. c. coronata, and population structure and complexity of plumage variation within the Ecuador-northern Peru lineage. Time-calibrated trees estimated that most intraspecific variation originated during the Pleistocene; however, this pattern may not be attributed to an increase in diversification rate during that period. We discuss these results in the context of the importance of geographic-ecological barriers in promoting lineage diversification along the Andes and put forward a preliminary taxonomic proposal for major lineages identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2790389141,"Sensorimotor training (SMT) is popularly applied as exercise in rehabilitation settings, particularly for musculoskeletal pain. With insufficient evidence on its effect on pain and function, this exploratory randomised controlled trial investigated the potential effects of SMT in rehabilitation of chronic non-specific low back pain. Two arms received 9x30 minutes physiotherapy with added interventions: The experimental arm received 15 minutes of postural SMT while the comparator arm performed 15 minutes of added sub-effective low-intensity training. A treatment blinded tester assessed outcomes at baseline 2–4 days prior to intervention, pre- and post-intervention, and at 4-week follow-up. Main outcomes were pain and functional status assessed with a 0–100mm visual analogue scale and the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Additionally, postural control was analysed using a video-based tracking system and a pressure plate during perturbed stance. Robust, nonparametric multivariate hypothesis testing was performed. 22 patients (11 females, aged 32 to 75 years) with mild to moderate chronic pain and functional limitations were included for analysis (11 per arm). At post-intervention, average values of primary outcomes improved slightly, but not to a clinically relevant or statistically significant extent. At 4-week follow-up, there was a significant improvement by 12 percentage points (pp) on the functional status questionnaire in the SMT-group (95% confidence intervall (CI) = 5.3pp to 17.7pp, p < 0.001) but not in the control group (4 pp improvement, CI = 11.8pp to 19.2pp). However, group-by-time interaction effects for functional status (Q = 3.3, 19 p = 0.07) and pain (Q = 0.84, p = 0.51) were non-significant. Secondary kinematic outcomes did not change over time in either of the groups. Despite significant improvement of functional status after SMT, overall findings of this exploratory study suggest that SMT provides no added benefit for pain reduction or functional improvement in patients with moderate chronic non-specific low back pain.

https://openalex.org/W2790579590,"An agent-based computer model that builds representative regional U.S. hog production networks was developed and employed to assess the potential impact of the ongoing trend towards increased producer specialization upon network-level resilience to catastrophic disease outbreaks. Empirical analyses suggest that the spatial distribution and connectivity patterns of contact networks often predict epidemic spreading dynamics. Our model heuristically generates realistic systems composed of hog producer, feed mill, and slaughter plant agents. Network edges are added during each run as agents exchange livestock and feed. The heuristics governing agents’ contact patterns account for factors including their industry roles, physical proximities, and the age of their livestock. In each run, an infection is introduced, and may spread according to probabilities associated with the various modes of contact. For each of three treatments—defined by one-phase, two-phase, and three-phase production systems—a parameter variation experiment examines the impact of the spatial density of producer agents in the system upon the length and size of disease outbreaks. Resulting data show phase transitions whereby, above some density threshold, systemic outbreaks become possible, echoing findings from percolation theory. Data analysis reveals that multi-phase production systems are vulnerable to catastrophic outbreaks at lower spatial densities, have more abrupt percolation transitions, and are characterized by less-predictable outbreak scales and durations. Key differences in network-level metrics shed light on these results, suggesting that the absence of potentially-bridging producer–producer edges may be largely responsible for the superior disease resilience of single-phase “farrow to finish” production systems."
https://openalex.org/W2790688203,"Ubiquitin E3 ligases mediate ubiquitination and degradation of intracellular proteins. We have shown that a relatively new Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) protein E3 ligase, SCF FBXL19, has an anti-inflammatory effect and controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics via targeting cell membrane receptor and small GTPases for their ubiquitination and degradation, but the molecular regulation of its subunit FBXL19 stability remains unclear. Here we show that FBXL19 degradation is controlled by the balance between its ubiquitination and acetylation. FBXL19 is an unstable protein with a half-life of ∼3 h. FBXL19 can be polyubiquitinated, and the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 prolongs FBXL19 half-life, suggesting that FBXL19 degradation is mediated in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. FBXL19 can also be acetylated, and enhancing acetylation of FBXL19 by a deacetylase inhibitor reduces FBXL19 ubiquitination levels. Acetylation-mimic FBXL19 mutant exhibits a longer half-life than wild type. An acetyltransferase CBP catalyzes acetylation of FBXL19. Inhibition or down-regulation of CBP reduces FBXL19 stability, whereas it is increased in CBP-overexpressing cells. Taken together, the data indicate that CBP-mediated acetylation reduces ubiquitination and stabilizes FBXL19. Further, we demonstrate that FBXL19 targets small GTPase Cdc42 for its ubiquitination and degradation, whereas this effect is reversed by inhibition of CBP, suggesting that CBP increases the effect of SCF FBXL19 E3 ligase through acetylation and stabilization of FBXL19. Our study reveals a new molecular model for regulation of SCF E3 ligase function by acetylation and stabilization of its subunit F-box protein.-Wei, J., Dong, S., Yao, K., Martinez, M. F. Y. M., Fleisher, P. R., Zhao, Y., Ma, H., Zhao, J. Histone acetyltransferase CBP promotes function of SCF FBXL19 ubiquitin E3 ligase by acetylation and stabilization of its F-box protein subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2793258892,"Payments for ecosystem services programs have become common tools but most have failed to achieve wide-ranging conservation outcomes. The capacity for scale and impact increases when PES programs are designed through the lens of the potential participants, yet this has received little attention in research or practice. Our work with small-scale marine fisheries integrates the social science of PES programs and provides a framework for designing programs that focus a priori on scaling. In addition to payments, desirable non-monetary program attributes and ecological feedbacks attract a wider range of potential participants into PES programs, including those who have more negative attitudes and lower trust. Designing programs that draw individuals into participating in PES programs is likely the most strategic path to reaching scale. Research should engage in new models of participatory research to understand these dynamics and to design programs that explicitly integrate a broad range of needs, values, and modes of implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2793339591,"The RNA-binding protein Rbm38 is a target of p63 tumor suppressor and can in-turn repress p63 expression via mRNA stability. Thus, Rbm38 and p63 form a negative feedback loop. To investigate the biological significance of the Rbm38-p63 loop in vivo, a cohort of WT, Rbm38−/−, TAp63+/−, and Rbm38−/−;TAp63+/− mice were generated and monitored throughout their lifespan. While mice deficient in Rbm38 or TAp63 alone died mostly from spontaneous tumors, compound Rbm38−/−;TAp63+/− mice had an extended lifespan along with reduced tumor incidence. We also found that loss-of-Rbm38 markedly decreased the percentage of liver steatosis in TAp63+/− mice. Moreover, we found that Rbm38 deficiency extends the lifespan of tumor-free TAp63+/− mice along with reduced expression of senescence-associated biomarkers. Consistent with this, Rbm38−/−;TAp63+/− MEFs were resistant, whereas Rbm38−/− or TAp63+/− MEFs were prone, to cellular senescence. Importantly, we showed that the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL17D and Tnfsf15) were significantly reduced by Rbm38 deficiency in senescence-resistant Rbm38−/−;TAp63+/− mouse livers and MEFs. Together, our data suggest that Rbm38 and p63 function as intergenic suppressors in aging and tumorigenesis and that the Rbm38-p63 loop may be explored for enhancing longevity and cancer management."
https://openalex.org/W2789299320,"Purpose Chronic pancreatitis (CP) can cause fat or bile acid malabsorption due to exocrine insufficiency. Fat or bile acid malabsorption has been reported to increase the risk of urolithiasis through increased intestinal oxalate absorption. However, no studies have reported an association between CP and urolithiasis. Methods We identified 15,848 patients (age: ≥20 years) diagnosed as having CP between 2000 and 2010 from the National Health Insurance Research Database as the study cohort. Beneficiaries without a history of CP were randomly selected and propensity-matched with the study cohort in a 1:4 ratio according to age; sex; comorbidities of hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alcohol-related illness, stroke, and coronary artery disease; and the index date. The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (0.44%), hyperparathyroidism (0.10%), or end stage renal disease (1.55%) in CP patients was low, but these comorbidities were also considered in the analysis. All patients were followed until the end of 2011 or withdrawal from the National Health Insurance program to determine the incidence of urolithiasis. Results The cumulative incidence of urolithiasis was higher in the CP cohort than that in the non-CP cohort (log-rank test, P < 0.001) with a 1.89-fold risk of urolithiasis (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.74–2.06). The prevalence of CP was higher in men (81.9%) and in patients younger than 49 years (63.5%; mean age: 48.5 ± 15.3 years). CP was associated with the development of urolithiasis in each age group (≤49 years: aHR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.81–2.22; 50–64 years: aHR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.40–2.09; ≥65 years: aHR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.20–1.98) and each sex (women: aHR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.67–2.66; men; aHR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.70–2.04). Among the patients without comorbidities, the rate of urolithiasis increased from 2.93/1,000 person-years in non-CP patients to 8.28/1,000 person-years in CP patients. Among the patients with comorbidities, the rate of urolithiasis increased from 6.12/1,000 person-years in non-CP patients to 10.9/1,000 person-years in CP patients. The contribution of CP to the relative risk of urolithiasis was greater in patients without comorbidities (without comorbidities: aHR = 2.81, 95% CI = 2.30–3.44) than in those with comorbidities (aHR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.61–1.94). Conclusion CP is associated with urolithiasis in this population-based cohort study. The contribution of CP to the relative risk of urolithiasis was even greater in patients with a lower risk of urolithiasis, such as those without other comorbidities. Our findings warrant a survey and education on urolithiasis for patients with CP."
https://openalex.org/W2790581214,"Building communities' resilience to natural weather hazards requires the appropriate assessment of such capabilities. The resilience of a community is affected not only by social, economic, and infrastructural factors but also by natural factors (including both site characteristics and the intensity and frequency of events). To date, studies of natural factors have tended to draw on annual censuses and to use aggregated data, thus allowing only a limited understanding of site-specific hot or cold spots of resilience. To improve this situation, we carried out a comprehensive assessment of resilience to typhoon disasters in Nansha district, Guangzhou, China. We measured disaster resilience on 1×1-km grid units with respect to socioeconomic and infrastructural dimensions using a set of variables and also estimated natural factors in a detailed manner with a meteorological modeling tool, the Weather Research and Forecast model. We selected typhoon samples over the past 10 years, simulated the maximum typhoon-borne strong winds and precipitation of each sample, and predicted the wind speed and precipitation volume at the 100-year return-level on the basis of extreme value analysis. As a result, a composite resilience index was devised by combining factors in different domains using factor analysis coupled with the analytic hierarchy process. Resilience mapping using this composite resilience index allows local governments and planners to identify potential hot or cold spots of resilience and the dominant factors in particular locations, thereby assisting them in making more rational site-specific measures to improve local resilience to future typhoon disasters."
https://openalex.org/W2789498796,"One of the major limitation for the application of QTL results in pig breeding and QTN identification has been the limited number of QTL effects validated in different animal material. The aim of the current work was to validate QTL regions through joint and specific genome wide association and haplotype analyses for growth, fatness and premier cut weights in three different genetic backgrounds, backcrosses based on Iberian pigs, which has a major role in the analysis due to its high productive relevance. The results revealed nine common QTL regions, three segregating in all three backcrosses on SSC1, 0–3 Mb, for body weight, on SSC2, 3–9 Mb, for loin bone-in weight, and on SSC7, 3 Mb, for shoulder weight, and six segregating in two of the three backcrosses, on SSC2, SSC4, SSC6 and SSC10 for backfat thickness, shoulder and ham weights. Besides, 18 QTL regions were specifically identified in one of the three backcrosses, five identified only in BC_LD, seven in BC_DU and six in BC_PI. Beyond identifying and validating QTL, candidate genes and gene variants within the most interesting regions have been explored using functional annotation, gene expression data and SNP identification from RNA-Seq data. The results allowed us to propose a promising list of candidate mutations, those identified in PDE10A, DHCR7, MFN2 and CCNY genes located within the common QTL regions and those identified near ssc-mir-103-1 considered PANK3 regulators to be further analysed."
https://openalex.org/W2790971562,"Introduction Despite the established contribution of deregulated microRNA (miRNA) function to carcinogenesis, relatively few miRNA-cancer gene interactions have been validated, making it difficult to appreciate the true complexity of miRNA-cancer gene regulatory networks. Results In this effort, we identify miRNA interactomes of 17 well-established cancer genes, involved in various cancer types, through a miRNome-wide 3’ UTR reporter screening. Using a novel and performant strategy for high-throughput screening data analysis, we identify 390 interactions, quadrupling the size of the known miRNA interactome for the cancer genes under investigation. Clear enrichments of established and predicted interactions underscore the validity of the interactome data set. Interactomes appear to be primarily driven by canonical binding site interactions. Nonetheless, non-canonical binding sites, such as offset 6mer and seed-mismatched or G:U wobble sites, also have regulatory activity, albeit clearly less pronounced. Furthermore, we observe enhanced regulation in the presence of 3’ supplementary pairing for both canonical and non-canonical binding sites. Conclusions Altogether, the cancer gene-miRNA interactome data set represents a unique resource that will aid in the unraveling of regulatory miRNA networks and the dynamic regulation of key protein-coding cancer genes. In addition, it uncovers aspects of the functional miRNA binding site’s architecture and the relative contributions of different binding site types."
https://openalex.org/W2793880532,"In 2013, Uganda adopted a test-and-treat policy for HIV patients 15 years or younger. Low retention rates among paediatric and adolescent antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiates could severely limit the impact of this new policy. This evaluation tested the impact of a differentiated care model called Family Clinic Day (FCD), a family-centered appointment scheduling and health education intervention on patient retention and adherence to monthly appointment scheduling.We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial, from October 2014 to March 2015. Forty-six facilities were stratified by implementing partner and facility type and randomly assigned to the control or intervention arm. Primary outcomes included the proportion of patients retained in care at 6 months and the proportion adherent to their appointment schedule at last study period scheduled visit. Data collection occurred retrospectively in May 2015. Six patient focus group discussions and 17 health workers interviews were conducted to understand perspectives on FCD successes and challenges.A total of 4,715 paediatric and adolescent patient records were collected, of which 2,679 (n = 1,319 from 23 control facilities and 1,360 from 23 intervention facilities) were eligible for inclusion. The FCD did not improve retention (aOR 1.11; 90% CI 0.63-1.97, p = 0.75), but was associated with improved adherence to last appointment schedule (aOR 1.64; 90% CI 1.27-2.11, p<0.001). Qualitative findings suggested that FCD patients benefited from health education and increased psychosocial support.FCD scale-up in Uganda may be an effective differentiated care model to ensure patient adherence to ART clinic appointment schedules, a key aspect necessary for viral load suppression. Patient health outcomes may also benefit following an increase in knowledge based on health education, and peer support. Broad challenges facing ART clinics, such as under-staffing and poor filing systems, should be addressed in order to improve patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2794102389,"Dollar spot is one of the most common diseases of golf course turfgrass and numerous fungicide applications are often required to provide adequate control. Weather-based disease warning systems have been developed to more accurately time fungicide applications; however, they tend to be ineffective and are not currently in widespread use. The primary objective of this research was to develop a new weather-based disease warning system to more accurately advise fungicide applications to control dollar spot activity across a broad geographic and climactic range. The new dollar spot warning system was developed from data collected at field sites in Madison, WI and Stillwater, OK in 2008 and warning system validation sites were established in Madison, WI, Stillwater, OK, Knoxville, TN, State College, PA, Starkville, MS, and Storrs, CT between 2011 and 2016. A meta-analysis of all site-years was conducted and the most effective warning system for dollar spot development consisted of a five-day moving average of relative humidity and average daily temperature. Using this model the highest effective probability that provided dollar spot control similar to that of a calendar-based program across the numerous sites and years was 20%. Additional analysis found that the 20% spray threshold provided comparable control to the calendar-based program while reducing fungicide usage by up to 30%, though further refinement may be needed as practitioners implement this warning system in a range of environments not tested here. The weather-based dollar spot warning system presented here will likely become an important tool for implementing precision disease management strategies for future turfgrass managers, especially as financial and regulatory pressures increase the need to reduce pesticide usage on golf course turfgrass."
https://openalex.org/W2793199381,"The output from whole genome sequencing is a set of contigs, i.e. short non-overlapping DNA sequences (sizes 1-100 kilobasepairs). Piecing the contigs together is an especially difficult task for previously unsequenced DNA, and may not be feasible due to factors such as the lack of sufficient coverage or larger repetitive regions which generate gaps in the final sequence. Here we propose a new method for scaffolding such contigs. The proposed method uses densely labeled optical DNA barcodes from competitive binding experiments as scaffolds. On these scaffolds we position theoretical barcodes which are calculated from the contig sequences. This allows us to construct longer DNA sequences from the contig sequences. This proof-of-principle study extends previous studies which use sparsely labeled DNA barcodes for scaffolding purposes. Our method applies a probabilistic approach that allows us to discard ""foreign"" contigs from mixed samples with contigs from different types of DNA. We satisfy the contig non-overlap constraint by formulating the contig placement challenge as a combinatorial auction problem. Our exact algorithm for solving this problem reduces computational costs compared to previous methods in the combinatorial auction field. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scaffolding method both for synthetic contigs and for contigs obtained using Illumina sequencing for a mixed sample with plasmid and chromosomal DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2792353221,"Although numerous studies have described the relationship between HPA axis dysregulation and internalizing symptoms among adolescents, research using hair cortisol concentrations in pre- and young adolescent samples has not been reported. We investigated the association of self-reported internalizing symptoms with cortisol concertration in hair among pre- and young adolescents aged 10–12 years. Forty-six boys and 39 girls supplied a hair sample of at least 3 cm in length for an analysis of this period (3 months) cortisol excretion. Saliva cortisol reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C) also was assessed. The study found a positive association between ratings of depressive symptoms and cumulative levels of hair cortisol only in boys. Furthermore, higher ratings of anxiety symptoms were associated with lower hair cortisol concertration and lower saliva cortisol reactivity among girls. This study provides the first evidence for the notion that depressive symptoms in boys are associated with long-term cortisol concertration in hair, whereas anxiety symptoms in girls are associated with HPA-axis hypoactivity, when hair cortisol concentrations and saliva cortisol reactivity to acute stress are assessed concurrently."
https://openalex.org/W2792923791,"Aims To interpret how the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) changes with increasing age, axial length, or anterior chamber depth as measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the normal elderly population in Taiwan. Methods A total of 82 volunteers (143 eyes) were enrolled. Generalized estimating equations were used to evaluate the correlation. Results The RNFL was significantly thinner in the superonasal (p = 0.004), inferotemporal (p = 0.046), and temporolower (p = 0.009) segments with age. The same trend was also observed in the superotemporal (p = 0.330) segment, although it was not statistically significant. The global RNFL thickness decreased by 4.97 μm per decade (β = -0.497; p = 0.021), and thinning was significant in the superonasal (-9.90 μm per decade, p < 0.001) and temporolower (-6.78 μm per decade, p < 0.001) segments; the same trend showed borderline significance in the superotemporal (-6.96 μm per decade, p = 0.073) and inferotemporal (-7.23 μm per decade, p = 0.059) segments. In eyes with longer axial length, the RNFLs significantly decreased in the non-temporal segments. Global RNFL thickness decreased by 3.086 μm for each additional millimeter of axial length (β = -3.086; p < 0.001). Conclusions Changes in RNFL thickness were correlated with age in the superonasal, superotemporal, inferotemporal, and temporolower segments, and were correlated with axial length in the non-temporal segments. Anterior chamber depth was not correlated with RNFL thickness."
https://openalex.org/W2790610001,"Meniscal pathologies are among the most common injuries of the femorotibial joint in both human and equine patients. Pathological forces and ensuing injuries of the cranial horn of the equine medial meniscus are considered analogous to those observed in the human posterior medial horn. Biomechanical properties of human menisci are site- and depth- specific. However, the influence of equine meniscus topography and composition on its biomechanical properties is yet unknown. A better understanding of equine meniscus composition and biomechanics could advance not only veterinary therapies for meniscus degeneration or injuries, but also further substantiate the horse as suitable translational animal model for (human) meniscus tissue engineering. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the composition and structure of the equine knee meniscus in a site- and age-specific manner and their relationship with potential site-specific biomechanical properties. The meniscus architecture was investigated histologically. Biomechanical testing included evaluation of the shore hardness (SH), stiffness and energy loss of the menisci. The SH was found to be subjected to both age and site-specific changes, with an overall higher SH of the tibial meniscus surface and increase in SH with age. Stiffness and energy loss showed neither site nor age related significant differences. The macroscopic and histologic similarities between equine and human menisci described in this study, support continued research in this field."
https://openalex.org/W2792635542,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in England fell by 36% between 2000 and 2007 and it is estimated that approximately 50% of the fall was due to improved treatment uptake. Marked socio-economic inequalities in CHD mortality in the United Kingdom (UK) remain, with higher age-adjusted rates in more deprived groups. Inequalities in the persistence of medication for primary and secondary prevention of CHD may contribute to the observed social gradient and we investigated this possibility in the population of Wales (UK).An electronic cohort of individuals aged over 20 (n = 1,199,342) in Wales (UK) was formed using linked data from primary and secondary care and followed for six years (2004-2010). We identified indications for medication (statins, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, clopidogrel) recommended in UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance for CHD (high risk, stable angina, stable angina plus diabetes, unstable angina, and myocardial infarction) and measured the persistence of indicated medication (time from initiation to discontinuation) across quintiles of the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, an area-based measure of socio-economic inequality, using Cox regression frailty models. In models adjusted for demographic factors, CHD risk and comorbidities across 15 comparisons for persistence of the medications, none favoured the least deprived quintile, two favoured the most deprived quintile and 13 showed no significant differences.During our study period (2004-2010) we found no significant evidence of socio-economic inequality in the persistence of recommended medication for primary and secondary prevention of CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2789722366,"Navigation in cluttered environments is an important challenge for animals and robots alike and has been the subject of many studies trying to explain and mimic animal navigational abilities. However, the question of selecting an appropriate home location has, so far, received only little attention. This is surprising, since the choice of a home location might greatly influence an animal's navigation performance. To address the question of home choice in cluttered environments, a systematic analysis of homing trajectories was performed by computer simulations using a skyline-based local homing method. Our analysis reveals that homing performance strongly depends on the location of the home in the environment. Furthermore, it appears that by assessing homing success in the immediate vicinity of the home, an animal might be able to predict its overall success in returning to it from within a much larger area."
https://openalex.org/W2789729599,"Exercising horses uniquely accommodate 7-8-fold increases in heart rate (HR). The present experiments for the first time analysed the related adaptations in action potential (AP) restitution properties recorded by in vivo telemetric electrocardiography from Thoroughbred horses. The horses were subjected to a period of acceleration from walk to canter. The QRS durations, and QT and TQ intervals yielded AP conduction velocities, AP durations (APDs) and diastolic intervals respectively. From these, indices of active, λ = QT/(QRS duration), and resting, λ0 = TQ/(QRS duration), AP wavelengths were calculated. Critical values of QT and TQ intervals, and of λ and λ0 at which plots of these respective pairs of functions showed unity slope, were obtained. These were reduced by 38.9±2.7% and 86.2±1.8%, and 34.1±3.3% and 85.9±1.2%, relative to their resting values respectively. The changes in λ were attributable to falls in QT interval rather than QRS duration. These findings both suggested large differences between the corresponding critical (129.1±10.8 or 117.4±5.6 bpm respectively) and baseline HRs (32.9±2.1 (n = 7) bpm). These restitution analyses thus separately identified concordant parameters whose adaptations ensure the wide range of HRs over which electrophysiological activation takes place in an absence of heart block or arrhythmias in equine hearts. Since the horse is amenable to this in vivo electrophysiological analysis and displays a unique wide range of heart rates, it could be a novel cardiac electrophysiology animal model for the study of sudden cardiac death in human athletes."
https://openalex.org/W2792223504,"The present study investigates the relationship between the attachment dimensions (anxious vs. avoidance) and the cognitive performance of individuals, specifically whether the attachment dimensions would predict the working memory (WM) performance. In the n-back task, reflecting the WM capacity, both attachment related and non-attachment related words were used. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups that received either the secure or the neutral subliminal priming. In the secure priming condition, the aim was to induce sense of security by presenting secure attachment words prior to the n-back task performance. In neutral priming condition, neutral words that did not elicit sense of security were presented. Structural equation modeling revealed divergent patterns for attachment anxiety and avoidance dimensions under the different priming conditions. In neutral priming condition, WM performance declined in terms of capacity in the n-back task for individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety. However in the secure priming condition, WM performance was boosted in the n-back task for individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety. In other words, the subliminal priming of the security led to increased WM capacity of individuals who rated higher levels of attachment anxiety. This effect, however, was not observed for higher levels of attachment avoidance. Results are discussed along the lines of hyperactivation and deactivation strategies of the attachment system."

The Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein plays an important role in regulating intracellular cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis. We hypothesized that intravenous NPC2 supplementation reduces cholesterol accumulation, hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis in a nutritional NASH rat model. Methods Rats were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for four weeks resulting in moderately severe NASH. Animals were treated with intravenous NPC2 or placebo twice weekly for either the last two weeks or the entire four weeks. End-points were liver/body- and spleen/body weight ratios, histopathological NASH scores, fibrosis, serum liver enzymes, cholesterol, lipoproteins, cytokines, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction derived hepatic gene expression related to cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis. Results HFHC rats developed hepatomegaly, non-fibrotic NASH histopathology, elevated liver enzymes, serum cholesterol, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Their sterol regulatory element binding factor 2 (SREBF2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) mRNAs were down-regulated compared with rats on standard chow. NPC2 did not improve liver weight, histopathology, levels of serum liver enzymes or pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), Interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-1β in HFHC rats. Two weeks of NPC2 treatment lowered hepatic TNFα and COL1A1 mRNA expression. However, this effect was ultimately reversed following additional two weeks of treatment. Four weeks NPC2 treatment of rats raised ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) mRNAs in the liver, concurrent with a strong tendency towards higher serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Furthermore, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-ɣ (PPARG) gene expression was reduced. Conclusions NPC2 proved inefficient at modifying robust hepatic NASH end-points in a HFHC NASH model. Nonetheless, our data suggest that hepatic ABCA1 expression and reverse cholesterol transport were upregulated by NPC2 treatment, thus presenting putative therapeutic effects in diseases associated with deregulated lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2794244509,"For a reinforced concrete beam subjected to fatigue loads, the structural stiffness and bearing capacity will gradually undergo irreversible degeneration, leading to damage. Moreover, there is an inherent relationship between the stiffness and bearing capacity degradation and fatigue damage. In this study, a series of fatigue tests are performed to examine the degradation law of the stiffness and bearing capacity. The results pertaining to the stiffness show that the stiffness degradation of a reinforced concrete beam exhibits a very clear monotonic decreasing ""S"" curve, i.e., the stiffness of the beam decreases significantly at the start of the fatigue loading, it undergoes a linear decline phase in the middle for a long loading period, and before the failure, the bearing capacity decreases drastically again. The relationship between the residual stiffness and residual bearing capacity is determined based on the assumption that the residual stiffness and residual bearing capacity depend on the same damage state, and then, the bearing capacity degradation model of the reinforced concrete beam is established based on the fatigue stiffness. Through the established model and under the premise of the known residual stiffness degradation law, the degradation law of the bearing capacity is determined by using at least one residual bearing capacity test data, for which the parameters of the stiffness degradation function are considered as material constants. The results of the bearing capacity show that the bearing capacity degradation of the reinforced concrete beam also exhibits a very clear monotonic decreasing ""S"" curve, which is consistent with the stiffness degradation process and in good agreement with the experiment. In this study, the stiffness and bearing capacity degradation expressions are used to quantitatively describe their occurrence in reinforced concrete beams. In particular, the expression of the bearing capacity degradation can mitigate numerous destructive tests and save cost. The stiffness and bearing capacity degradation expressions for a reinforced concrete beam can be used to predict the deformation and bearing capacity of a structure during the service process and determine the structural fatigue damage and degree of degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2792860675,"Supranormal contractile properties are frequently associated with cardiac diseases. Anesthetic agents, including propofol, can depress myocardial contraction. We tested the hypothesis that fropofol, a propofol derivative, reduces force development in cardiac muscles via inhibition of cross-bridge cycling and may therefore have therapeutic potential. Force and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) transients of rat trabecular muscles were determined. Myofilament ATPase, actin-activated myosin ATPase, and velocity of actin filaments propelled by myosin were also measured. Fropofol dose dependently decreased force without altering [Ca2+]i in normal and pressure-induced hypertrophied-hypercontractile muscles. Similarly, fropofol depressed maximum Ca2+-activated force (Fmax) and increased the [Ca2+]i required for 50% of Fmax (Ca50) at steady state without affecting the Hill coefficient in both intact and skinned cardiac fibers. The drug also depressed cardiac myofibrillar and actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. In vitro actin sliding velocity was significantly reduced when fropofol was introduced during rigor binding of cross-bridges. The data suggest that the depressing effects of fropofol on cardiac contractility are likely to be related to direct targeting of actomyosin interactions. From a clinical standpoint, these findings are particularly significant, given that fropofol is a nonanesthetic small molecule that decreases myocardial contractility specifically and thus may be useful in the treatment of hypercontractile cardiac disorders.—Ren, X., Schmidt, W., Huang, Y., Lu, H., Liu, W., Bu, W., Eckenhoff, R., Cammarato, A., Gao, W.

The present study revealed that increased apelin concentration in serum of diabetic mice neutralized the myogenic response mediated by apelin receptor (APJ) and resulted in increased RBF, which promoted the progression of diabetic nephropathy. The results showed that apelin concentration, RBF, and albuminuria:creatinine ratio were all increased in kkAy mice, and increased RBF correlated positively with serum apelin both in C57 and diabetic mice. The increased RBF was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), β-arrestin, and increased endothelial NOS in glomeruli. Meanwhile, calcium, phosphorylation of MLC, and β-arrestin were decreased by high glucose and apelin treatment in cultured smooth muscle cells, as well. eNOS was increased by high glucose and increased by apelin in cultured endothelial cells (ECs). Knockdown of β-arrestin expression in smooth muscle cells cancelled phosphorylation of MLC induced by apelin.

Rats then received 50 μg/kg/day of octreotide by intraperitoneal injection from day 10 to day 17 post-infection. Animals were sacrificed on days 7 and 14 post-infection for immunohistochemical analysis and on days 14, 35 and 50 for mRNA expression analysis of SSTR subtypes. Histological analysis of jejunum tissues demonstrated infection of C. parvum along the villus brush border on day 7 post-infection and infection clearance by day 14 post-infection. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that in the inflamed jejunum, a significant increase in SSTR1 and SSTR2 expression was observed on day 14 post-infection. Octreotide therapy down-regulated the expression of SSTR2 on day 37 post-infection but significantly increased expression of SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR3 on day 50 post-infection. The results indicate that specific SSTRs may regulate the inflammatory pathway in the rat intestinal inflammation model."

Here, we propose a strategy for the functional study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human DNA repair genes XPD/ERCC2, RAD18, and KU70/XRCC6 and the checkpoint activation gene ATR that are essentially involved in the cell cycle and DNA damage repair. We analyzed the mutational effects of the DNA repair genes under DNA-damaging conditions, including ultraviolet irradiation and treatment with genotoxic reagents, using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae system to overcome the limitations of the human cell-based assay. We identified causal variants from selected SNPs in the present analyses. (i) R594C SNP in RAD3 (human XPD/ERCC2) caused severe reductions in the growth rate of mutant cells upon short-wavelength UV irradiation or chemical reagent treatment. (ii) The growth rates of the selected variants in RAD18, YKU70, and MEC1 were similar to those of wild-type cells on methyl methanesulfonate and hydroxyurea treated media. (iii) We also assessed the structural impact of the SNPs by analyzing differences in the structural conformation and calculating the root mean square deviation, which is a measure of the discordance of the Cα atoms between protein structures. Based on the above results, we propose that these analytical approaches serve as efficient methods for the identification of causal variants of human disease-causing genes and elucidation of yeast-cell based molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2793144683,"Background Macrophages play a crucial role in the interaction between tumor and immune system, and iNOS is known as a surrogate marker of M1 macrophages activation. The goal of the study was to investigate the role of iNOS polymorphisms as prognostic marker in mCRC patients. Materials and methods Functional significant polymorphisms in the promoter of INOS gene were analyzed by PCR-based and direct DNA sequencing in 4 cohorts of patients receiving bevacizumab based first-line chemotherapy: two evaluation cohorts (TRIBE ARM A and ARM B) and two validation cohorts (FIRE 3 arm A and MOMA). The relation of the SNPs with PFS and OS was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Subgroup analyses according to RAS status were preplanned. Results In the exploratory cohort 1 (TRIBE A), patients with CCTTT any>13repeats (N = 57) showed improved median PFS compared with patients carrying the ≤13/≤13 repeats variant (N = 152) (HR, 0.64; 95%CI 0.44–0.92, p = 0.010). Similar results were shown adopting the >26repeats/≤26 repeats (HR, 0.56; 95%CI 0.36–0.87, p = 0.005). In RAS mutant, patient with any>13 repeats (N = 24) had improved PFS results compared with those carrying the ≤13/≤13 repeats variant (N = 81) (HR, 0.51; 95%CI 0.30–0.87, p = 30.009). Similar results were found adopting the >26 repeats/≤26 repeats cut off: (HR, 0.52; 95%CI 0.27–0.98, p = 0.035). These data were partially confirmed in the exploratory cohort 2 (TRIBE B): a better median PFS was observed in patients with >26 repeats vs ≤26 repeats (N = 205) patients. However, these data were not confirmed in the two validation cohorts. Conclusion We failed to replicate the exploratory findings in both validation sets. The CCTTT polymorphic region of the INOS gene does not predict outcome in mCRC receiving bevacizumab based first line chemotherapy. Further investigations are needed to reveal mechanisms between tumor, immune system and chemotherapy response."
https://openalex.org/W2790181377,"A randomized controlled trial was performed on racing horses, to evaluate the efficacy of a new class of therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine—ReGeneraTing Agents® (RGTA®), to treat tendinopathies. Preliminary uncontrolled studies on tendon healing in racing horses with RGTA® (OTR4131)—Equitend® showed encouraging results, justifying performing a randomized, controlled, multicenter study with a two-year racing performance follow up. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Equitend® versus placebo on acute superficial digital flexor tendonitis in racing French Standardbred Trotters (ST). Twenty-two ST were randomly and blindly assigned to receive with a ratio of 2 to 1, a single Equitend® (n = 14) or placebo (n = 8) intralesional injection under ultrasonographic guidance. Horses were evaluated over 4 months, by clinical and ultrasonographic evaluations (day 0, months 1, 2, 4), and their racing performances followed up over the 2 years after treatment. During the first month of treatment, a significant decrease in the cross-sectional area (CSA) was found in the Equitend® group (p = 0.04). After 4 months, the number of Equitend® treated horses with an improved CSA was significantly higher than the placebo-treated horses (p = 0.03571). The Equitend® group returned to their pre-injury performance level, racing in, and winning, significantly more races than the placebo group (p = 0.01399 and 0.0421, respectively). Furthermore, recurrence was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the Equitend® group (71.4% vs 16.6%, p = 0.02442). In conclusion, we measured a significant, short-term, reduction effect on CSA and demonstrated a long-term beneficial effect of intralesional injection of Equitend® for the treatment of superficial digital flexor tendonitis on racing ST, racing 2. 3 times more often than placebo, with 3.3 times fewer recurrences maintaining pre-injury performance level. This study may open the way for the development of a human treatment of tendonitis."
https://openalex.org/W2790565283,"Background 
Childhood and adolescent depression is common and often persists into adulthood with negative implications for school performances, peer relationship and behavioural functioning. The Child Depression Inventory (CDI) has been used to assess depression among adolescents in many countries including Nigeria but it is uncertain if the theoretical structure of CDI appropriately fits the experiences of adolescents in Nigeria. This study assessed varying theoretical modelling structure of the CDI in a population of apparently healthy adolescents in Benue state, Nigeria.


Methods 
Data was extracted on CDI scale and demographic information from a total of 1, 963 adolescents (aged 10–19 years), who participated in a state wide study assessing adolescent psychosocial functioning. In addition to descriptive statistics and reliability tests, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor analysis (CFA) were used to model the underlying factor structure and its adequacy. The suggested new model was compared with existing CDI models as well as the CDI’s original theoretical model. A model is considered better, if it has minimum Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA<0.05), Minimum value of Discrepancy (CMIN/DF<3.0) and Akaike information criteria. All analyses were performed at 95% confidence level, using the version 21 of AMOS and the R software.


Results 
Participants were 14.7±2.1 years and mostly male (54.3%), from Monogamous homes (67.9%) and lived in urban areas (52.2%). The measure of the overall internal consistency of the 2-factor CDI was α = 0.84. The 2-factor model had the minimum RMSEA (0.044), CMIN/DF (2.87) and least AIC (1037.996) compared to the other five CDI models.


Conclusion 
The child depression inventory has a 2-factor structure in a non-clinical general population of adolescents in Nigeria. Future use of the CDI in related setting may consider the 2-factor model."
https://openalex.org/W2791132636,"Chewed and expectorated quids, indigestible stringy fibers from the roasted inner pulp of agave or yucca root, have proven resilient over long periods of time in dry cave environments and correspondingly, although little studied, are common in archaeological archives. In the late 1960s, thousands of quids were recovered from Mule Spring Rockshelter (Nevada, USA) deposits and stored without consideration to DNA preservation in a museum collection, remaining unstudied for over fifty years. To assess the utility of these materials as repositories for genetic information about past inhabitants of the region and their movements, twenty-one quids were selected from arbitrary excavation depths for detailed analysis. Human mitochondrial DNA sequences from the quids were amplified by PCR and screened for diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms. Most detected single nucleotide polymorphisms were consistent with recognized Native American haplogroup subclades B2a5, B2i1, C1, C1c, C1c2, and D1; with the majority of the sample set consistent with subclades C1, C1c, and C1c2. In parallel with the DNA analysis, each quid was radiocarbon dated, revealing a time-resolved pattern of occupancy from 347 to 977 calibrated years before present. In particular, this dataset reveals strong evidence for the presence of haplogroup C1/C1c at the Southwestern edge of the US Great Basin from ~670 to 980 cal YBP, which may temporally correspond with the beginnings of the so-called Numic Spread into the region. The research described here demonstrates an approach which combines targeted DNA analysis with radiocarbon age dating; thus enabling the genetic analysis of archaeological materials of uncertain stratigraphic context. Here we present a survey of the maternal genetic profiles from people who used the Mule Spring Rockshelter and the historic timing of their utilization of a key natural resource."
