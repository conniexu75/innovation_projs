https://openalex.org/W4298087988,"To meet the future challenges and foster integrated and holistic research approaches in agricultural sciences, new and sustainable methods in research data management (RDM) are needed. The involvement of scientific users is a critical success factor for their development. We conducted an online survey in 2020 among different user groups in agricultural sciences about their RDM practices and needs. In total, the questionnaire contained 52 questions on information about produced and (re-)used data, data quality aspects, information about the use of standards, publication practices and legal aspects of agricultural research data, the current situation in RDM in regards to awareness, consulting and curricula as well as needs of the agricultural community in respect to future developments. We received 196 (partially) completed questionnaires from data providers, data users, infrastructure and information service providers. In addition to the diversity in the research data landscape of agricultural sciences in Germany, the study reveals challenges, deficits and uncertainties in handling research data in agricultural sciences standing in the way of access and efficient reuse of valuable research data. However, the study also suggests and discusses potential solutions to enhance data publications, facilitate and secure data re-use, ensure data quality and develop services (i.e. training, support and bundling services). Therefore, our research article provides the basis for the development of common RDM, future infrastructures and services needed to foster the cultural change in handling research data across agricultural sciences in Germany and beyond."

With this study, we wanted to (1) investigate how linguistic characteristics of language on the one hand and hearing impairment on the other hand have an impact on lipreading abilities and (2) provide a tool to assess lipreading abilities for German speakers. 170 participants (22 prelingually deaf) completed the online assessment, which consisted of a subjective hearing impairment scale and silent videos in which different item categories (numbers, words, and sentences) were spoken. The task for our participants was to recognize the spoken stimuli just by visual inspection. We used different versions of one test and investigated the impact of item categories, word frequency in the spoken language, articulation, sentence frequency in the spoken language, sentence length, and differences between speakers on the recognition score. We found an effect of item categories, articulation, sentence frequency, and sentence length on the recognition score. With respect to hearing impairment we found that higher subjective hearing impairment is associated with higher test score. We did not find any evidence that prelingually deaf individuals show enhanced lipreading skills over people with postlingual acquired hearing impairment. However, we see an interaction with education only in the prelingual deaf, but not in the population with postlingual acquired hearing loss. This points to the fact that there are different factors contributing to enhanced lipreading abilities depending on the onset of hearing impairment (prelingual vs. postlingual). Overall, lipreading skills vary strongly in the general population independent of hearing impairment. Based on our findings we constructed a new and efficient lipreading assessment tool (SaLT) that can be used to test behavioral lipreading abilities in the German speaking population."
https://openalex.org/W4298086896,"Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a component of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) cell wall, is detectable in the urine of MTB infected patients with active tuberculosis (TB). LAM-specific antibodies (Igs) have been developed by a variety of traditional and recombinant methods for potential use in a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). We evaluated the analytical performance of the TB LAM Igs to identify pairs that offer superior performance over existing urine LAM tests. We assessed 25 new and 4 existing Igs in a matrixed format using a multiplex electrochemiluminescence-based liquid immunoassay. A total of 841 paired Ig combinations were challenged with in vitro cultured LAM (cLAM) derived from MTB strains representing diverse phylogenetic lineages, alongside urinary LAM (uLAM) from the urine of adults with active pulmonary TB. Analytical sensitivity of down-selected Ig pairs was determined using MTB Aoyama-B cLAM, while diagnostic accuracy was determined using clinical samples. When testing cLAM, the reactivity of Ig pairs was similar across MTB lineages 1-4 but lineage 5:6 had significantly more reactivity among Ig pairs. Overall, 41 Ig pairs had a strong binding affinity to cLAM, as compared to the reference pair of S4-20/A194-01, and 28 Ig pairs therein exhibited a strong affinity for both cLAM and uLAM. Retrospective testing on clinical urine specimens demonstrated varying sensitivities (12-80%) and specificities (14-100%). The five top pairs had a similar analytical limit of detection to the reference pair but in four instances, the sensitivity and specificity with clinical uLAM samples was poor. Overall, epitopes presented by uLAM are different from cLAM, which may affect antibody performance when testing uLAM in patient samples. Several new Ig pairs had similar ranges of high sensitivity to cLAM but overall, there were no new candidate Ig pairs identified in this round of screening with increased performance with uLAM as compared to an existing optimal pair."
https://openalex.org/W4298087379,"Bangladesh is experiencing a nutrition transition with an increase in the double burden of malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study sought to: 1) examine trends and differences in underweight, overweight/obesity, hypertension and diabetes by gender, area of residence, and wealth in Bangladesh from 2004 to 2018, 2) assess what factors contributed to changes in these outcomes.We used data from five rounds of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys (n = 76,758 women 15-49y and 10,900 men 18-95y in total). We calculated differences, slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index (CIX) to examine trends over time and differences in outcomes by wealth and residence. We identified determinants and estimated drivers of changes in outcomes using regression-based decomposition.Between 2004 and 2018, underweight prevalence decreased in both women (33% to 12%) and men (26% to 18%), whereas overweight/obesity increased (17% to 49% in women and 21% to 34% in men). Hypertension also increased in both women (31% to 44%) and men (19% to 33%) while diabetes changed marginally (11% to 14%). In all years, underweight was concentrated in poorer and rural households while overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension were concentrated in wealthier and urban households. Wealth inequity decreased over time for underweight, changed little for overweight/obesity, and increased for hypertension and diabetes among men. Increases in wealth explained 35% to 50% of the reduction in underweight and 30% to 57% of the increase in overweight/obesity.Our findings imply that double duty actions are required to sustain the decrease in undernutrition and slow the increase in overweight/obesity and NCDs across diverse socioeconomic sections of the population in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4298087577,"Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is fundamental in achieving viral load suppression and consequently attaining positive health outcomes among people living with HIV. However, ART adherence is sub-optimum among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) thus the high AIDS-related mortality even after World Health Organization (WHO) revised HIV treatment eligibility guidelines in 2010, 2013 and 2016. Consolidated trends of barriers to ART adherence among ALHIV aged 10 to 19 years in sub-Saharan countries post each eligibility guidelines revision to date are unknown. Methods and analysis We will conduct comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature databases publishing observational studies reporting data adherence and barriers to ART among ALHIV on ART. We will further search the reference lists of included studies and other relevant reviews. We will also do a citation search for included studies in the review. We will search in the following databases PubMed, Cochrane Review, Scopus on Excerpta Medica Database (Embase) and Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Furthermore WHO, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) websites, conference proceedings and country reports will be searched to identify relevant literature. Data will be extracted from eligible studies and synthesis will be through categorizing studies by year of study, barriers, and outcomes. Meta-analysis and meta-synthesis will be conducted for quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Where meta-synthesis is impossible, narrative synthesis will be conducted. We will only include studies conducted between 2010 and 2022 within sub-Saharan Africa countries. Discussion Adherence to ART at a high level is required to achieve adequate viral suppression and improve quality of life in ALHIV. The knowledge of barriers to ART among ALHV may aid in the design of interventions aimed at improving ART adherence.

https://openalex.org/W4298087880,"Background Science communication can provide people with more accurate information on pandemic health risks by translating complex scientific topics into language that helps people make more informed choices on how to protect themselves and others. During pandemics, experts in medicine, science, public health, and communication are important sources of knowledge for science communication. This study uses the COVID-19 pandemic to explore these experts’ opinions and knowledge of what to communicate to the public during a pandemic. The research question is: What are the key topics to communicate to the public about health risks during a pandemic? Method We purposively sampled 13 experts in medicine, science, public health, and communication for individual interviews, with a range of different types of knowledge of COVID-19 risk and communication at the national, regional and hospital levels in Norway. The interview transcripts were coded and analysed inductively in a qualitative thematic analysis. Results The study’s findings emphasise three central topics pertaining to communication about pandemic health risk during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway: 1) how the virus enters the human body and generates disease; 2) how to protect oneself and others from being infected; and 3) pandemic health risk for the individual and the society. Conclusion The key topics emerging from the expert interviews relate to concepts originating from multiple disciplinary fields, and can inform frameworks for interprofessional communication about health risks during a pandemic. The study highlights the complexity of communicating pandemic messages, due to scientific uncertainty, fear of risk amplification, and heterogeneity in public health and scientific literacy. The study contributes with insight into the complex communication processes of pandemic health risk communication."
https://openalex.org/W4298086429,"Plants encounter and respond to numerous abiotic stresses during their lifetimes. These stresses are often related and could therefore elicit related responses. There are, however, relatively few detailed comparisons between multiple different stresses at the molecular level. Here, we investigated the phenotypic and transcriptomic response of cultivated sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.) seedlings to three water-related stresses (i.e., dry-down, an osmotic challenge, and salt stress), as well as a generalized low-nutrient stress. All four stresses negatively impacted seedling growth, with the nutrient stress having a more divergent response from control as compared to the water-related stresses. Phenotypic responses were consistent with expectations for growth in low-resource environments, including increased (i.e., less negative) carbon fractionation values and leaf C:N ratios, as well as increased belowground biomass allocation. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under stress was greater in leaf tissue, but roots exhibited a higher proportion of DEGs unique to individual stresses. Overall, the three water-related stresses had a more similar transcriptomic response to each other vs. nutrient stress, though this pattern was more pronounced in root vs. leaf tissue. In contrast to our DEG analyses, co-expression network analysis revealed that there was little indication of a shared response between the four stresses in despite the majority of DEGs being shared between multiple stresses. Importantly, osmotic stress, which is often used to simulate drought stress in experimental settings, had little transcriptomic resemblance to true water limitation (i.e., dry-down) in our study, calling into question its utility as a means for simulating drought."
https://openalex.org/W4298087445,"Introduction Participation in lung cancer screening (LCS) trials and real-world programs is low, with many people at high-risk for lung cancer opting out of baseline screening after registering interest. We aimed to identify the potential drivers of participation in LCS in the Australian setting, to inform future implementation. Methods Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with individuals at high-risk of lung cancer who were eligible for screening and who had either participated (‘screeners’) or declined to participate (‘decliners’) in the International Lung Screening Trial from two Australian sites. Interview guide development was informed by the Precaution Adoption Process Model. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using the COM-B model of behaviour to explore capability, opportunity and motivation related to screening behaviour. Results Thirty-nine participants were interviewed (25 screeners; 14 decliners). Motivation to participate in screening was high in both groups driven by the lived experience of lung cancer and a belief that screening is valuable, however decliners unlike their screening counterparts reported low self-efficacy. Decliners in our study reported challenges in capability including ability to attend and in knowledge and understanding. Decliners also reported challenges related to physical and social opportunity, in particular location as a barrier and lack of family support to attend screening. Conclusion Our findings suggest that motivation alone may not be sufficient to change behaviour related to screening participation, unless capability and opportunity are also considered. Focusing strategies on barriers related to capability and opportunity such as online/telephone support, mobile screening programs and financial assistance for screeners may better enhance screening participation. Providing funding for clinicians to support individuals in decision-making and belief in self-efficacy may foster motivation. Targeting interventions that connect eligible individuals with the LCS program will be crucial for successful implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4298088967,"Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) provides a process that uses spatial data and models to evaluate environmental, social, economic, cultural, and management trade-offs when siting (i.e., strategically locating) ocean industries. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector in the world. The United States (U.S.) has substantial opportunity for offshore aquaculture development given the size of its exclusive economic zone, habitat diversity, and variety of candidate species for cultivation. However, promising aquaculture areas overlap many protected species habitats. Aquaculture siting surveys, construction, operations, and decommissioning can alter protected species habitat and behavior. Additionally, aquaculture-associated vessel activity, underwater noise, and physical interactions between protected species and farms can increase the risk of injury and mortality. In 2020, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was identified as one of the first regions to be evaluated for offshore aquaculture opportunities as directed by a Presidential Executive Order. We developed a transparent and repeatable method to identify aquaculture opportunity areas (AOAs) with the least conflict with protected species. First, we developed a generalized scoring approach for protected species that captures their vulnerability to adverse effects from anthropogenic activities using conservation status and demographic information. Next, we applied this approach to data layers for eight species listed under the Endangered Species Act, including five species of sea turtles, Rice's whale, smalltooth sawfish, and giant manta ray. Next, we evaluated four methods for mathematically combining scores (i.e., Arithmetic mean, Geometric mean, Product, Lowest Scoring layer) to generate a combined protected species data layer. The Product approach provided the most logical ordering of, and the greatest contrast in, site suitability scores. Finally, we integrated the combined protected species data layer into a multi-criteria decision-making modeling framework for MSP. This process identified AOAs with reduced potential for protected species conflict. These modeling methods are transferable to other regions, to other sensitive or protected species, and for spatial planning for other ocean-uses."
https://openalex.org/W4298086638,"We investigated the impact of dietary patterns on the gut microbiota and concentration of short-chain fatty acids in the feces of Korean elementary school students. The dietary intake and ADHD assessment of 40 Korean elementary school students were analyzed using a dish-based semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Analysis of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids composition were performed using the real-time polymerase chain reaction, metagenomics, and gas chromatography methods. The dietary patterns of participants were divided into four groups: healthy, processed food, fish and shellfish, and meat. The participants were also divided into two groups according to their ADHD scores: 0–30, control group; over 30, ADHD group. The ADHD score of the processed food group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group. The processed food and ADHD groups showed significantly higher abundance of harmful bacteria, such as the Enterobacter , Escherichia coli , and Clostridium strains, and markedly lower abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as the Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus strains, than the control group. The heat maps of metagenomics indicated that each group was separated into distinct clusters, and the processed food and ADHD groups showed significantly lower α-diversity of gut microbiota than the control group. In these groups, the concentration of acetate or butyrate in the feces was significantly lower than that in the control group. These results may indicate that imbalanced diets can disturb the colonic microbial balance and are likely to become a potential risk factor for the prevalence of ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W4298086689,"The resistance variant faults (RVFs) observed in the mine ventilation system can utterly restrict mine safety production. Herein, a machine learning model, which is based on multi-label k-nearest neighbor (ML-KNN), is proposed to solve the problem of the rapid and accurate diagnosis of the RVFs that occur at multiple locations within the mine ventilation system. The air volume that passes through all the branches of the ventilation network, including the residual branches, was used as the diagnostic model input after the occurrence of multiple faults, whereas the label vector of the fault locations was used as the model's output. In total, seven evaluation indicators and 1800 groups of randomly simulated faults at the typical locations in a production mine with 153 nodes and 223 branches were considered to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed model to solve for multiple fault locations diagnostic and verify the model's generalization ability. After ten-fold cross-validation of the training sets containing 1600 groups of fault instances, the diagnostic accuracy of the model tested with the air volume of all 223 branches and the 71 residual branches' air volume as input was 73.6% and 72.3%, respectively. On the other hand, To further evaluate the diagnostic performance of the model, 200 groups of the multiple fault instances that were not included in the training were tested. The accuracy of the fault location diagnosis was 76.5% and 73.5%, and the diagnostic time was 9.9s and 12.16s for the multiple faults instances with all 223 branches' air volume and the 71 residual branches' air volume as observation characteristics, respectively. The data show that the machine learning model based on ML-KNN shows good performance in the problem of resistance variant multiple fault locations diagnoses of the mine ventilation system, the multiple fault locations diagnoses can be carried out with all the branches' air volume or the residual branches' air volume as the input of the model, the diagnostic average accuracy is higher than 70%, and the average diagnosis time is less than one minute. Hence, the proposed model's diagnostic accuracy and speed can meet the engineering requirements for the diagnosis of multiple fault locations for a real ventilation system in the field, and this model can effectively replace personnel to discover ventilation system failures, and also lays a good foundation for the construction of intelligent ventilation systems."
https://openalex.org/W4298087352,"The neuroendocrine tumours paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma (PPGLs) are commonly associated with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene variants, but no human SDH-related PPGL-derived cell line has been developed to date. The aim of this study was to systematically explore practical issues related to the classical 2D-culture of SDH-related human paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas, with the ultimate goal of identifying a viable tumour-derived cell line. PPGL tumour tissue/cells (chromaffin cells) were cultured in a variety of media formulations and supplements. Tumour explants and dissociated primary tumour cells were cultured and stained with a range of antibodies to identify markers suitable for use in human PPGL culture. We cultured 62 PPGLs, including tumours with confirmed SDHB, SDHC and SDHD variants, as well as several metastatic tumours. Testing a wide range of basic cell culture media and supplements, we noted a marked decline in chromaffin cell numbers over a 4-8 week period but the persistence of small numbers of synaptophysin/tyrosine hydroxylase-positive chromaffin cells for up to 99 weeks. In cell culture, immunohistochemical staining for chromogranin A and neuron-specific enolase was generally negative in chromaffin cells, while staining for synaptophysin and tyrosine hydroxylase was generally positive. GFAP showed the most consistent staining of type II sustentacular cells. Of the media tested, low serum or serum-free media best sustained relative chromaffin cell numbers, while lactate enhanced the survival of synaptophysin-positive cells. Synaptophysin-positive PPGL tumour cells persist in culture for long periods but show little evidence of proliferation. Synaptophysin was the most consistent cell marker for chromaffin cells and GFAP the best marker for sustentacular cells in human PPGL cultures."
https://openalex.org/W4298087411,"Sediment scour at downstream of hydraulic structures is one of the main reasons threatening its stability. Several soil properties and initial input data have been studied to investigate its influence on scour hole geometry by both physical and numerical models. However, parameters of resistance affecting sedimentation and erosion phenomena have not been carried out in the literature. Besides, the auxiliary-like wing walls prevalently used in many real applications have been rarely addressed for their effect on morphological change.In this study, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics model is utilized to calibrate the hydraulic characteristics of steady flow going through the culvert by comparison with experimental data, showing good agreement between water depth, velocity, and pressure profiles at the bottom of the boxed culvert. The results show that a grid cell of 0.015 m gave minimum NRMSE and MAE values in test cases. Another approach is numerical testing sediment scour at a meander flume outlet with a variety of roughness/d50 ratio (cs) and diversion wall types. The findings include the following: cs = 2.5 indicates the close agreement between the numerical and analytical results of maximum scour depth after the culvert; the influence of four types of wing wall on the geometrical deformation including erosion at the concave bank and deposition at the convex bank of the meander flume outlet; and two short headwalls represent the best solution that accounts for small morphological changes.The influence of the roughness parameter of soil material and headwall types on sediment scour at the meander exit channel of hydraulic structure can be estimated by the numerical model."
https://openalex.org/W4298087592,"Background The aim of the study was to investigate which elements of lifestyle are associated with metabolic health in adults, defined as the absence of components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) based on the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Methods Data from 10,277 individuals aged 40–65 years constituted the material of this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses with backward stepwise selection were carried out to identify the factors associated with the absence of metabolic disorders. Results No family history of cardiovascular disease increased the odds of being metabolically healthy 1.5-2-fold. Furthermore, the following factors were associated with higher odds of being metabolically healthy in men: abstinence from alcohol (healthy individuals vs. those with ≥3 [OR = 5.49 (2.23–13.52); p&lt;0.001], ≥2 [OR = 4.52 (1.87–10.91); p = 0.001], and ≥1 components of MetS [OR = 3.04 (1.41–6.56); p = 0.005]), moderate alcohol use (healthy individuals vs. those with ≥3 [OR = 3.36 (1.54–7.32); p = 0.002], ≥2 [OR = 3.28 (1.52–7.10); p = 0.002], and ≥1 components of MetS [OR = 3.93 (1.64–9.42); p = 0.002]), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) &gt;2 hours/day and sitting time of 3–6 hours/day. Drinking &gt;2 cups of coffee per day (healthy vs. those with ≥3 [OR = 2.00 (1.47–2.71)], ≥2 [OR = 1.84 (1.38–2.45)], and ≥1 components of MetS [OR = 1.72 (1.30–2.28); all p&lt;0.001]), limiting animal fats to &lt;2 servings/day, MVPA &gt;2 hours/day, and 7–8 hours of sleep per day were associated with higher odds of being metabolically healthy in women. Conclusions A healthy lifestyle increased the odds of being metabolically healthy. Some lifestyle modifications may appear effective in prevention of not only MetS, but also single metabolic risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4298088119,"Obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) are both associated with cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) and stroke risk among patients with DM in Korea since relatively few studies have analyzed this area in detail.We analyzed a total of 56,051 DM patients aged >30 years from the Korean National Health Insurance Service Cohort who had undergone at least one national health examination between 2002 and 2012. BMI scores were divided into six categories, while hazard ratios for stroke were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models.Overall stroke risk was positively associated with BMI for both men and women. For ischemic stroke, the risk was positively associated with BMI in women. However, for me, only patients with the highest BMI were at increased risk compared with patients with a BMI of 20-22.4 kg/m2. For hemorrhagic stroke, the risk was significantly associated with BMI with a U-shaped association in men. In women, only patients with the lowest BMI had an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke compared with patients that have a BMI of 20-22.4 kg/m2.BMI was positively associated with the overall risk of stroke among DM patients in Korea. The risk of ischemic stroke was higher in obese patients compared to overweight or normal-weight patients. However, the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was higher in slimmer patients compared with overweight or obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W4298088489,"Although recent regulations improved conditions of laboratory animals, their use remains essential in cancer research to determine treatment efficacy. In most cases, such experiments are performed on xenografted animals for which tumor volume is mostly estimated from caliper measurements. However, many formulas have been employed for this estimation and no standardization is available yet.Using previous animal studies, we compared all formulas used by the scientific community in 2019. Data were collected from 93 mice orthotopically xenografted with human breast cancer cells. All formulas were evaluated and ranked based on correlation and lower mean relative error. They were then used in a Gompertz quantitative model of tumor growth.Seven formulas for tumor volume estimation were identified and a statistically significant difference was observed among them (ANOVA test, p < 2.10-16), with the ellipsoid formula (1/6 π × L × W × (L + W)/2) being the most accurate (mean relative error = 0.272 ± 0.201). This was confirmed by the mathematical modeling analysis where this formula resulted in the smallest estimated residual variability. Interestingly, such result was no longer valid for tumors over 1968 ± 425 mg, for which a cubic formula (L x W x H) should be preferred.When considering that tumor volume remains under 1500mm3, to limit animal stress, improve tumor growth monitoring and go toward mathematic models, the following formula 1/6 π × L × W x (L + W)/2 should be preferred."
https://openalex.org/W4298088766,"Ethiopia enforced extremely rigorous contact tracing and mandatory quarantine for all suspected contact and travelers entering the country for a period of 14-days duration during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. Several studies investigated the experience of quarantined people because of COVID-19 or previous outbreaks. However, quarantine is often perceived differently in different cultures because of its historical association with class, gender, ethnicity, politics, and prejudices. To our knowledge, there is limited literature on quarantine experience in Ethiopia related to either COVID-19 or other infectious diseases. Therefore, this study was aimed to explore quarantine experience of people in Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples' Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia during early phase of COVID-19 pandemic.The study implemented an exploratory qualitative research design using a phenomenological approach. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted with purposively recruited 29 respondents. Digitally recorded audio files have been listened to several times and verbatim transcriptions were done. The transcribed narratives were examined independently and content analysis was carried out through reading and re-reading the verbatim several times, open coding, grouping, categorizing, and abstracting the final themes.Three broad themes were identified and characterized the experiences of quarantined people due to COVID-19. These themes were a) handling of the suspected person, b) adverse effects of quarantine and c) coping strategies. In addition, quarantine refusals; injustice in quarantine; quarantine errors; psychological distress; physiological changes; social effects; financial losses; personal and social coping strategies were the emerged sub-themes.This study explored a range of complex experiences of quarantined people because of the COVID-19 outbreak in SNNPR. The quarantined people included in this study were adversely affected psychologically, physiologically, socially, and economically. They also experienced quarantine errors and injustice. There is a need to gather clear justification for close contact before forcing the suspect for mandatory quarantine. In addition, there is a need to develop risk communication strategy to approach suspected contacts for quarantine. Moreover, assessing psychological, physiological, social, and economic impacts of quarantine on the individuals while they are in quarantine and after release could be important. The use of personal and social coping strategies including psychosocial support may lessen the adverse impacts of the quarantine."
https://openalex.org/W4298088953,"Although Ethiopia has improved access to health care in recent years, quality of care remains low. Health worker motivation is an important determinant of performance and affects quality of care. Low health care workers motivation can be associated with poor health care quality and client experience, non-attendance, and poor clinical outcome. Objective this study sought to determine the extent and variation of health professionals' motivation alongside factors associated with motivation.We conducted a facility based cross-sectional study among health extension workers (HEWs) and health care professionals in four regions: Amhara, Oromia, South nations, and nationalities people's region (SNNPR) and Tigray from April 15 to May 10, 2018. We sampled 401 health system workers: skilled providers including nurses and midwives (n = 110), HEWs (n = 210); and non-patient facing health system staff representing case team leaders, facility and district heads, directors, and officers (n = 81). Participants completed a 30-item Likert scale ranking tool which asked questions across 17 domains. We used exploratory factor analysis to explore latent motivation constructs.Of the 397 responses with complete data, 61% (95% CI 56%-66%) self-reported motivation as ""very good"" or ""excellent"". Significant variation in motivation was seen across regions with SNNPR scoring significantly lower on a five-point Likert scale by 0.35 points (P = 0.003). The exploratory factor analysis identified a three-factors: personal and altruistic goals; pride and personal satisfaction; and recognition and support. The personal and altruistic goals factor varied across regions with Oromia and SNNPR being significantly lower by 0.13 (P = 0.018) and 0.12 (P = 0.039) Likert points respectively. The pride and personal satisfaction factor were higher among those aged > = 30 years by 0.14 Likert scale points (P = 0.045) relative to those aged between 19-24years.Overall, motivation was high among participants but varied across region, cadre, and age. Workload, leave, and job satisfaction were associated with motivation."

https://openalex.org/W4298055519,"Background Utilization of antenatal care services in Ghana has substantially increased over the years, but the rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is still high. The high burden of HIV among pregnant women has serious implications for mother-to-child transmission. The main objective of this study was to assess the compliance of HIV testing and counseling provided at antenatal care clinics in two rural districts in northern Ghana by comparing reported practices to the national guidelines. Methods This study was a descriptive qualitative study conducted in the Kassena-Nankana Districts of northern Ghana. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 midwives, 10 mothers, and 2 public health nurses who were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed into English, and imported into NVivo 12.0 software for open, axial, and selective coding. Results The findings indicate that not all pregnant women were informed prior to testing nor informed of their test results. Many mothers indicated that pre-test counseling is limited although the midwives claimed to provide it. Post-test counseling is primarily given to those who test positive, and several midwives agreed that there is no need to counsel HIV-negative women. Perceptions of the lack of confidentiality and privacy were pervasive among mothers despite the emphasis placed on its importance by the midwives. There were conflicting reports on whether HIV testing during antenatal care is voluntary or compulsory. The challenges with HIV testing and counseling that were mentioned by midwives include lack of adequate infrastructure, language barriers, and insufficient training. Conclusions HIV testing and counseling provided at antenatal care is not uniform across all health facilities and does not strictly adhere to national guidelines. Future interventions that focus on standardization, monitoring, privacy, and capacity building are likely to prove valuable in ensuring quality services are provided."

Remission of hemiplegia upon sleep is a clinical diagnostic feature of AHC. We investigated whether: 1) Hemiplegic events are associated with spectral EEG changes 2) Sleep in AHC is associated with clinical or EEG spectral features that may explain its restorative effect.We retrospectively performed EEG spectral analysis in five adults with AHC and twelve age-/gender-matched epilepsy controls. Five-minute epochs of hemiplegic episodes and ten-minute epochs of four sleep stages were selected from video-EEGs. Arousals were counted per hour of sleep.We found 1) hemispheric differences in pre-ictal and ictal spectral power (p = 0.034), during AHC hemiplegic episodes 2) 22% reduced beta power (p = 0.017) and 26% increased delta power (p = 0.025) during wakefulness in AHC versus controls. There were 98% more arousals in the AHC group versus controls (p = 0.0003).There are hemispheric differences in spectral power preceding hemiplegic episodes in adults with AHC, and sleep is disrupted.Spectral EEG changes may be a potential predictive tool for AHC hemiplegic episodes. Significantly disrupted sleep is a feature of AHC."
https://openalex.org/W4298086912,"Introduction In geriatric patients, hypotension is often reported after general anesthesia induction using propofol. Remimazolam is a novel short-acting sedative. However, the incidence of hypotension after general anesthesia induction using remimazolam in geriatric patients remains unclear. This study aims to compare the incidence of hypotension associated with remimazolam and propofol in patients aged ≥80 years. Methods This single-center, double-blind, randomized, two-arm parallel group, standard treatment-controlled, interventional clinical trial will include 90 patients aged ≥80 years undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia who will be randomized to receive remimazolam or propofol for induction. The primary outcome is the incidence of hypotension after general anesthesia induction, occurring between the start of drug administration and 3 min after intubation. We define hypotension as mean blood pressure &lt;65 mmHg. The primary outcome will be analyzed using the full analysis set. The incidence of hypotension in the two groups will be compared using the Mantel-Haenszel χ2 test. Subgroup analysis of the primary outcome will be performed based on the Charlson comorbidity index, clinical frailty scale, hypertension in the ward, and age. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the Fisher’s exact test, Student’s t test, and Mann–Whitney U test, as appropriate. Logistic regression analysis will be performed to explore the factors associated with the incidence of hypotension after anesthesia induction. Discussion Our trial will determine the efficacy of remimazolam in preventing hypotension and provide evidence on the usefulness of remimazolam for ensuring hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia induction in geriatric patients. Trial registration The study has been registered with UMIN Clinical Trials Registry ( UMIN000042587 ), on June 30, 2021."
https://openalex.org/W4298086951,"Background Androgen receptor (AR) is a potential therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We aimed to elucidate the association of AR expression with glucose metabolic features in TNBC. Methods Two independent datasets were analyzed: FDG PET data of our institution and a public dataset of GSE135565. In PET analysis, patients with TNBC who underwent pretreatment PET between Jan 2013 and Dec 2017 were retrospectively enrolled. Clinicopathologic features and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max ) of tumors were compared with AR expression. In GSE135565 dataset, glycolysis score was calculated by the pattern of glycolysis-related genes, and of which association with SUV max and AR gene expression were analyzed. Results A total of 608 female patients were included in the PET data of our institution. SUV max was lower in AR-positive tumors ( P &lt; 0.001) and correlated with lower AR expression ( rho = –0.26, P &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, AR was a deterministic factor for low SUV max ( P = 0.012), along with other key clinicopathologic features. In the GSE135565 dataset, AR expression also exhibited a negative correlation with SUV max ( r = –0.34, P = 0.001) and the glycolysis score ( r = –0.27, P = 0.013). Conclusions Low glucose metabolism is a signature of AR expression in TNBC. It is suggested that evaluation of AR expression status needs to be considered in clinical practice particularly in TNBC with low glucose metabolism."

Elasmobranchs and sea turtles have likely suffered recent declines in this region, although data on their distribution and biology are severely lacking, especially on the eastern side of the basin in Saudi Arabian waters. Here, we present sightings of elasmobranchs and sea turtles across the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba collected through a combination of survey methods. Over 455 survey hours, we recorded 407 sightings belonging to 26 elasmobranch species and two sea turtle species, more than 75% of which are of conservation concern. We identified 4 species of rays and 9 species of sharks not previously recorded in Saudi Arabia and report a range extension for the pink whipray ( Himantura fai ) and the round ribbontail ray ( Taeniurops meyeni ) into the Gulf of Aqaba. High density of sightings of conservation significance, including green and hawksbill sea turtles and halavi guitarfish were recorded in bay systems along the eastern Gulf of Aqaba and the Saudi Arabian coastline bordering the north-eastern Red Sea, and many carcharhinid species were encountered at offshore seamounts in the region. Our findings provide new insights into the distribution patterns of megafaunal assemblages over smaller spatial scales in the region, and facilitate future research and conservation efforts, amidst ongoing, large-scale coastal developments in the north-eastern Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba."

OGG1 gene involved in base repair mechanism, for excision of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from DNA formed as a result of accumulation of ROS in cell. HPRT gene encode transferase enzymes involved in purine recycling mechanism. The main focus of the study was to evaluate the expression variation in HPRT, OGG1 gene expression, and DNA damage of industrial workers. Blood samples of 300 occupational workers were collected from welding, brick kiln, furniture, pesticide, and paint industry (n = 60/industry) to evaluate the expression variation in HPRT, OGG1 gene expression, and DNA damage in blood cells by comet assay along with age and gender matched 300 control individuals. Blood arsenic content was higher (P<0.001) in an industrial group compared to the control. OGG1 and HPRT expression were (P<0.05) downregulated in exposed workers compared to controls. Spearman correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between HPRT vs OGG1 (P< 0.0001) in exposed workers compared to controls. Altered expression of both genes was observed between workers with <25years and >25years of age as well as between workers with <10years and >10year exposure. Reduced expression (P<0.05) of both genes and a high extent of DNA damage was evident in exposed smokers compared to respective non-smokers. DNA fragmentation was higher (P<0.05) in the furniture, welding and brick kiln group compared to control, and other industries. The present study suggests that altered expression of OGG1 and HPRT gene induce oxidative stress, showed a negative impact on the recycling of purines leading to DNA damage which increase the vulnerability of workers to carcinogenicity."

G1 and G2 were blinded to the application of real or placebo US guidance by turning the monitor of US imaging out-of-view from participants' vantage points. The effectiveness of blinding was evaluated by asking the participants whether they had received real-US guided DN. The responses were assessed by Chi-square test. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Knee injury, and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales (KOOS-pain, KOOS-symptoms, KOOS-quality-of-life (QoL)) were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks by a blinded assessor. Data were analyzed by mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction.Eighty-four participants (61.26±5.57 years) completed the study.

https://openalex.org/W4298087827,"The HIV pandemic continues to contribute significantly towards childhood mortality and morbidity. The up-scaling of the Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) access has seen more children surviving and sanctions great effort be made on ensuring adherence. Adherence is a dynamic process that changes over time and is determined by variable factors. This necessitates the urgency to conduct studies to determine the potential factors affecting adherence in our setting and therefore achieve the 90-90-90 goal of sustainable viral suppression.To assess the magnitude and associated factors of ART adherence among children (1-14 years) attending HIV care and treatment clinics during the months of July to November 2018 in Dar es Salaam.A cross-sectional clinic-based study, conducted in three selected HIV care and treatment clinics in urban Dar es Salaam; Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), Temeke Regional Referral Hospital (TRRH), Infectious Disease Centre- DarDar Paediatric Program (IDC-DPP) HIV clinics during the months of July to November 2018. HIV-infected children aged 1-14 years who had been on treatment for at least six months were consecutively enrolled until the sample size was achieved. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Four-day self-report, one-month self-recall report and missed clinic appointments were used to assess adherence. Frequencies and percentages were used to describe categorical data. The odds ratio was used to analyse the possible factors affecting ART adherence Logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with ART adherence. Analysis was conducted using SPSS version 20.0 and p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.333 participants were recruited. The overall good adherence (≥95%) was approximated to be 60% (CI-54.3-65.1) when subjected to all three measures. On multivariable logistic regression, factors associated with higher odds of poor adherence were found to be caregivers aged 17-25 years [AOR = 3.5, 95%CI-(1.5-8.4)], children having an inter-current illness [AOR = 10.8, 95%CI-(2.3-50.4)], disbelief in ART effectiveness [AOR = 5.495; 95%CI-(1.669-18.182)] and advanced clinical stage [AOR = 1.972; 95% CI-(1.119-3.484)]. The major reasons reported by caregivers for missing medications included forgetfulness (41%), high pill burden (21%), busy schedule (11%) and long waiting hours at the clinic (9%).In the urban setting of Dar es Salaam, ART adherence among children was found to be relatively low when combined adherence measures were used. Factors associated with poor ART adherence found were younger aged caregivers, and child intercurrent illness, while factors conferring good adherence were belief in ART effectiveness and lower HIV clinical stage. More attention and support should be given to younger aged caregivers, children with concomitant illness and advanced HIV clinical stages. Educating caregivers on ART effectiveness may also aid in improving adherence."

https://openalex.org/W4298087937,"The collection of biographical information (biodata) through CVs and application forms has many advantages, namely easiness of collection, acceptable validity, less prone to faking, and the fulfilment of legal requirements. However, its systematic use among practitioners is scarce. Two of the mains reasons is the overlap with other constructs like personality and the lack of validated biodata scales in articles and public repositories. Aimed to fill this gap, García-Izquierdo and colleagues developed an 8-item scale able to generate positive applicant reactions, but they did not provide empirical evidence that their scale is able to predict job performance. The present paper was developed for this purpose, investigating the scale’s relationship with four different dimensions of job performance (i.e., task performance, contextual performance, counterproductive behaviors, and adaptive performance) and its incremental validity with respect to Big Five and Dark Tetrad personality traits. The study comprises 528 employees from different organizations ( M age = 39.51, SD = 14.25; 52.8% women, M experience = 17.06, SD = 13.27) which voluntarily agreed to participate filling a questionnaire with the variables of interest. Results provide evidence of the predictive validity of the biodata scale in a multi-occupational sample; identify that these biodata contribute to predicting two specific types of job performance: contextual performance and adaptive performance; shows that a brief job-related biodata scale achieves results comparable to those of most personality traits in predictive models of job performance dimensions; and provide evidence of the incremental predictive validity of biodata over the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. As a whole, these results provide support for the use of the scale in researcher and applied settings, and contributes to the advance the knowledge of biodata for personnel selection."
https://openalex.org/W4298088342,"Introduction Poor health seeking behaviour continues to be major challenge in accessing healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa despite the availability of effective treatment for most childhood illnesses. The current study investigated the barriers to healthcare access and health seeking for childhood illnesses in Burundi. Methods The study utilized data from the 2016–17 Burundi Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS). A total of 2173 children under five of childbearing women were included in our study. The outcome variable for the study was healthcare seeking for childhood illnesses (diarrhea and fever/cough). Barriers to healthcare access were the explanatory variables and maternal and child factors were the control variables. Chi-square test of independence and a binary logistic regression modelling were carried out to generate the results. Results Overall, less than 50% of children in Burundi who were ill two weeks before the survey obtained healthcare. We found that children of mothers who perceived getting money for medical care for self as a big problem [aOR = 0.75; CI = 0.60–0.93] and considered going for medical care alone as a big problem [aOR = 0.71; CI = 0.55–0.91] had lower odds of getting healthcare, compared to those of mothers who considered these indicators as not a big problem. The results also showed that children of mothers who had three [aOR = 1.48; 1.02–2.15] and four [aOR = 1.62; 1.10–2.39], children were more likely to get healthcare for childhood illnesses compared to those whose mothers had one child. Children of mothers with single birth children were less likely to get healthcare compared to those whose mothers had multiple births. Conclusion Findings of the low prevalence of healthcare for childhood illnesses in Burundi suggest the need for government and non-governmental health organizations to strengthen women’s healthcare accessibility for child healthcare services and health seeking behaviours. The Burundian government through multi-sectoral partnership should strengthen health systems for maternal health and address structural determinants of women’s health by creating favourable conditions to improve the status of women and foster their overall socioeconomic well-being. Free child healthcare policies in Burundi should be strengthened to enhance the utilization of child healthcare services in Burundi."

Semantic segmentation research focuses on fully acquiring and effectively fusing spatial detail with semantic information. This paper proposes a multiscale feature-enhanced adaptive fusion network named MFEAFN to improve semantic segmentation performance. First, we designed a Double Spatial Pyramid Module named DSPM to extract more high-level semantic information. Second, we designed a Focusing Selective Fusion Module named FSFM to fuse different scales and levels of feature maps. Specifically, the feature maps are enhanced to adaptively fuse these features by generating attention weights through a spatial attention mechanism and a two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of FSFM, we designed different fusion modules for comparison and ablation experiments. MFEAFN achieved 82.64% and 78.46% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC2012 and Cityscapes datasets. In addition, our method has better segmentation results than state-of-the-art methods."

Participants (n = 291) were 49% female with a mean age of 47 years (SD = 14). A 34-item food frequency questionnaire assessed consumption of foods traditional and nontraditional to the regional Alaska Native diet. A novel measure, termed the ""traditional foods index"", was computed as weekly servings of culturally traditional food consumption divided by total foods reported. Overall, the sample's traditional foods index averaged 21%±16%, with higher values reported by participants assessed in summer (23%±17%) than winter (19%±15%, p<0.05); by women (22%±16%) than men (19%±16%, p < .05); and by residents of smaller communities (22%±17%) than the comparatively larger community of Nome (17%±14%, p<0.05). The traditional foods index was correlated with age (r = .26, p < .01), as well as the cultural variables of community connectedness (r = .19, p < .01), community standing (r = .15, p < .01), and traditional language comprehension (r = .19, p < .01).

Understanding these compensatory mechanisms allows for informed treatment strategies, and could lead to the development of improved therapeutics. To this end, studies were performed to determine whether Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, also exhibits genetically-encoded responses to the commonly prescribed antibiotics doxycycline and amoxicillin. After culturing for 24 h in a sublethal concentration of doxycycline, there were significant increases in a substantial number of transcripts for proteins that are involved with translation. In contrast, incubation with a sublethal concentration of amoxicillin did not lead to significant changes in levels of any bacterial transcript. We conclude that B. burgdorferi has a mechanism(s) that detects translational inhibition by doxycycline, and increases production of mRNAs for proteins involved with translation machinery in an attempt to compensate for that stress."

Patients were randomized based on whether they underwent ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein catheterization using the combined or long-axis in-plane approach. Posterior wall penetration rates, first-attempt success rates, overall success rates within 20 min; scanning, puncture, and procedure durations; and number of attempts were compared between the groups. In the combined and long-axis in-plane groups ( n = 55 per group), the posterior wall penetration rates were 5.5% (3/55) and 3.6% (2/55) ( P = 0.65), the first-attempt success rates were 94.5% (52/55) and 92.7% (51/55) ( P = 0.70), and the overall success rates within 20 min were 100% (55/55) and 98.2% (54/55) ( P = 0.32), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4298087082,"‘Breadfruit’ is a common tree species in Taiwan. In the indigenous Austronesian Amis culture of eastern Taiwan, ‘breadfruit’ is known as Pacilo , and its fruits are consumed as food. On Lanyu (Botel Tobago) where the indigenous Yami people live, ‘breadfruit’ is called Cipoho and used for constructing houses and plank-boats. Elsewhere in Taiwan, ‘breadfruit’ is also a common ornamental tree. As an essential component of traditional Yami culture, Cipoho has long been assumed to have been transported from the Batanes Island of the Philippines to Lanyu. As such, it represents a commensal species that potentially can be used to test the hypothesis of the northward Austronesian migration ‘into’ Taiwan. However, recent phylogenomic studies using target enrichment show that Taiwanese ‘breadfruit’ might not be the same as the Pacific breadfruit ( Artocarpus altilis ), which was domesticated in Oceania and widely cultivated throughout the tropics. To resolve persistent misidentification of this culturally and economically important tree species of Taiwan, we sampled 36 trees of Taiwanese Artocarpus and used the Moraceae probe set to enrich 529 nuclear genes. Along with 28 archived Artocarpus sequence datasets (representing a dozen taxa from all subgenera), phylogenomic analyses showed that all Taiwanese ‘breadfruit’ samples, together with a cultivated ornamental tree from Hawaii, form a fully supported clade within the A . treculianus complex, which is composed only of endemic Philippine species. Morphologically, the Taiwanese ‘breadfruit’ matches the characters of A . treculianus . Within the Taiwanese samples of A . treculianus , Amis samples form a fully supported clade derived from within the paraphyletic grade composed of Yami samples, suggesting a Lanyu origin. Results of our target enrichment phylogenomics are consistent with the scenario that Cipoho was transported northward from the Philippines to Lanyu by Yami ancestors, though the possibility that A . treculianus is native to Lanyu cannot be ruled out completely."

Concerns that increasing SP resistance in some areas of SSA may have compromised IPTp-SP efficacy prompted this contemporaneous study, designed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of sub-microscopic infection in parturient women during the low transmission season in Mutengene, a rapidly growing semi-urban area in Southwest Region, Cameroon. Pregnant women originally reporting for the establishment of antenatal clinic care during the dry season were followed-up to term and their pregnancy outcomes recorded. About 2 ml of venous blood was collected for malaria diagnosis using PfHRP2/pLDH malaria rapid diagnostic kit and light microscopy. DNA was extracted from dried blood spots by the Chelex-100 method and the Plasmodium falciparum status detected by nested PCR amplification of the 18SrRNA gene using specific predesigned primers. Of the 300 women enrolled, the proportion of malaria parasite infected as determined by microscopy, RDT and PCR was 12.9%, 16.4% and 29.4% respectively, with 39.9% overall infected with P. falciparum by microscopy and/or RDT and/or PCR and a very low-density infection, averaging 271 parasites per microliter of blood. About 25.0% (68/272) of women who were negative by microscopy were positive by PCR (submicroscopic P. falciparum infection), with primigravidae and IPTp-SP non usage identified as independent risk factors for submicroscopic P. falciparum parasitaemia while fever history (aOR = 4.83, 95% CI = 1.28-18.22, p = 0.020) was associated with risk of malaria parasite infection overall. IPTp-SP use (p = 0.007) and dosage (p = 0.005) significantly influenced whether or not the participant will be malaria parasite negative or carry submicroscopic or microscopic infection. Although Infant birthweight and APGAR score were independent of the mother's P. falciparum infection and submicroscopic status, infant's birthweight varied with the gravidity status (p = 0.001) of the mother, with significantly lower birthweight neonates born to primigravidae compared to secundigravidae (p = 0.001) and multigravidae (p = 0.003). Even in holo-endemic dry season, there exists a large proportion of pregnant women with very low density parasitaemia. IPTp-SP seems to be relevant in controlling submicroscopic P. falciparum infections, which remains common in pregnant women, and are hard to diagnose, with potentially deleterious consequences for maternal and fetal health. Future studies should be carried out in hyperendemic malaria foci where the parasitemia levels are substantially higher in order to confirm the efficacy of IPTp-SP."

Mean SADP days/year was higher among CCS (40-50 days/year), particularly in CNS tumor survivors (76-83 days/year), compared to references (12-18 days/year). Most SADP days were DP days. CCS had more mean outpatient visits (1.6-1.8 visits/year) and inpatient days (0.8-1.7 days/year) than references (0.8-1.2 visits/year and 0.6-0.75 days/year, respectively). The main healthcare use and SADP diagnoses were neoplasms and psychiatric disorders among all CCS, along with nervous system and endocrine conditions among CNS tumor survivors. The risk of SADP >90 days in 2018 was higher among female compared to male CCS (OR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.67-3.32), those with elementary schooling compared to high school/university education (OR = 6.52, 95% CI 4.49-9.49), and survivors of CNS tumors compared to other malignancies (OR hematological versus CNS = 2.88, 95% CI 1.95-4.28; OR hematological versus non-CNS solid tumors = 0.71, 95% CI 0.45-1.09).Most CCS did not have SADP as young adults; nevertheless, their risk of SADP was higher than among matched references. CNS tumor survivors were at particularly high risk of SADP."

In a traditional relational society such as China, it remains unclear how social network affects tourism consumption by households. Here, we evaluated the impact of the social network on tourism consumption by Chinese households using the data of 3254 samples from the China Family Panel Studies. The empirical results from the ordinary least square method showed that the social network promotes tourism consumption, which can be projected to increase by about 28% for every 1% increase in social network strength. This was further confirmed using the instrumental variable method to address the issue of endogenous social network formation, as well as other robustness checks. The impact of the social network on tourism consumption was heterogeneous. Compared with other residents, there were higher positive effects for high-income families, households with a head aged 35–44 years, urban families, and households in eastern China. The quantile regression results revealed that the impact of the social network was weakened with increasing tourism consumption by households. These results are crucial for policymakers, in that they could form good habits of tourism consumption and strengthen tourism market management, especially for the management of tourism negative events in the context of new media."

Trajectory tracking and prediction of table tennis is an important technology for table tennis robots, and its estimation accuracy is also disturbed by non-Gaussian noise. In this paper, a novel Kalman filter, called minimum error entropy unscented Kalman filter (MEEUKF), is employed to estimate the motion trajectory of physical model of a table tennis. The simulation results show that the MEEUKF algorithm shows outstanding performance in tracking and predicting the trajectory of table tennis compared to some existing algorithms."

The study aimed to explore how some hospital-related characteristics were associated with incidence rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections reported by community hospitals in California from January to December 2019. This retrospective, cross-sectional study used combined data from records submitted to the California Department of Public Health, California Open Data Portal, the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal, and the American Hospital Directory by community hospitals in California with central line-associated bloodstream infections in 2019. Results showed that CLABSIs are significantly associated with bed capacity, health care system affiliation, ownership, and hospital accreditation status ( p &lt; 0.0001). CLABSI remains a relevant threat to patient safety and quality of care, even more so in the community hospital setting. Understanding if a relationship exists between institutional factors and CLABSI rates might better prepare leaders in healthcare organizations to reduce HAIs."
https://openalex.org/W4298087972,"Scoliosis is one of the most common pediatric spinal diseases that leads to a three-dimensional deformity of the spine and has a high risk of progression during growth. Regular clinical monitoring and follow-up X-rays are needed to providing proper treatment at that time. Repetitive X-rays can results in an increased risk of radiation related health problems. We present a non-invasive, ionizing radiation-free method for assessing scoliosis and its progression from the 3D images of the body torso, captured by a body scanner. A new concept is introduced based on a mathematical method in polar coordinate system to quantify and characterize the deformities in the torso from 2D transverse cross-sections of the 3D torso images at example cases for a healthy individual and for two patients with scoliosis. To capture quantitatively the characteristics of scoliosis, and to verify them at the example cases two asymmetry parameters and a linear fitting parameter are calculated: a) back side area asymmetry, b) left right area asymmetry, and c) coefficient of determination (R2). Within the analyzed patients, both the area asymmetries are maximum at the apex of scoliosis, and increase with the severity of scoliosis. R2 values are smaller in the case of patients compared with the healthy. Furthermore, the parameters show a trend when compared with the Cobb angle from the X-ray and the findings match with clinical examination. Therefore, the quantities are able to capture, certain characteristics associated with scoliosis. These quantities can be compared as a measure of deformities of torso, during the follow-up examinations in the future, without ionizing radiations."
https://openalex.org/W4298088308,"Curve face gear pair and noncircular bevel gear pair are collectively referred to as spatial noncircular gear pair (SNCGP). Different from the traditional gear transmission with fixed shafts, spatial noncircular gear (SNCG) compound transmission can realize compound motion with variable transmission ratio between intersecting axes, and has a broad engineering application prospect. It includes two categories named speed reduction and speed increase. Based on the gear meshing theory, screw theory and calculus, a screw analysis method of SNCG compound transmission was proposed, which directly and comprehensively reflected the compound motion characteristics of rotation and axial movement. Firstly, a unified coordinate system was established. The screw geometric characteristics of compound motion were discussed, including instant screw axis, axode, pitch surface and its normal equidistant surface. The screw principle of compound motion was revealed. Then, according to this method, combined with the motion process of generator with different tooth profiles, the tooth surface of each SNCG was obtained. Finally, gear machining, tooth surface measurement, transmission ratio measurement and axial displacement measurement were carried out, which verified the correctness of this screw analysis method for SNCG compound transmission, and laid a foundation for further study and application."
https://openalex.org/W4298088417,"Reward based learning is broadly acknowledged to underpin the development and maintenance of addictive behaviour although the mechanism in sexual compulsivity is less understood. Using a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task we tested whether the motivational aspect of conditioned Pavlovian conditioned stimulus invigorated instrumental responding in relation to specific compatible monetary rewards. Performance on the task was analysed between two groups of males based on Low (N = 38) and High (N = 41) self-report online sexual behaviour (OSB). Psychometric tests including sexual compulsivity scale and behavioural activation/behavioural inhibition (BIS/BAS) were also administered to determine the relationship between OSB and general reward sensitivity. We show clear evidence of acquisition in the Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning phases. Specific transfer effect was greater in the High-OSB group although the difference compared to the Low-OSB group was non-significant. OSB negatively correlated with both BIS and BAS indicative of introversion and low reward sensitivity. OSB positively correlated with sexual compulsivity although it is unclear whether individuals in the High-OSB group considered their behaviour either excessive or problematic. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the nature of problematic OSB. Fundamental differences in motivational characteristics and mechanism contributing to compulsive behaviour in relation to high-OSB might indicate incompatibility with behavioural addiction models. PIT was not enhanced in high-OSB by appetitive conditioning, although problematic OSB could stem from failure to inhibit actions. Further research should investigate whether aversive conditioning differentially affects responding in high-OSB individuals, potentially explaining perseverant behaviour despite negative consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4298088704,"To gain insights into the molecular interactions of an intracellular pathogen and its host cell, we studied the gene expression and chromatin states of human fibroblasts infected with the Apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We show a striking activation of host cell genes that regulate a number of cellular processes, some of which are protective of the host cell, others likely to be advantageous to the pathogen. The simultaneous capture of host and parasite genomic information allowed us to gain insights into the regulation of the T. gondii genome. We show how chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiling together permit novel annotation of the parasite's genome, including more accurate mapping of known genes and the identification of new genes and cis-regulatory elements. Motif analysis reveals not only the known T. gondii AP2 transcription factor-binding site but also a previously-undiscovered candidate TATA box-containing motif at one-quarter of promoters. By inferring the transcription factor and upstream cell signaling responses involved in the host cell, we can use genomic information to gain insights into T. gondii's perturbation of host cell physiology. Our resulting model builds on previously-described human host cell signalling responses to T. gondii infection, linked to induction of specific transcription factors, some of which appear to be solely protective of the host cell, others of which appear to be co-opted by the pathogen to enhance its own survival."
https://openalex.org/W4298088751,"To assess and classify all private and government schools located in a northern city of India for accreditation as health promoting schools and comparative health profile assessment of selected higher accredited schools with lower accredited and non-accredited schools.Quasi experimental study with pre and post assessment with comparison of higher with lower accredited schools.The current study was conducted in 206 schools of Chandigarh City of Northern India. Comparative health profile assessment was undertaken in 8 schools with 754 children from higher accredited (platinum, gold, silver) and 8 schools with 700 children from lower accredited (bronze) and non-accredited (below bronze) schools.Multicomponent and multilevel intervention was undertaken with self-quality improvement by schools with help of a manual of accreditation of school as health promoting schools. Key intervention included capacity building, technical visits, supportive supervision, sensitization of policymakers and key stakeholders, implementation of policy initiatives, use of social media, technical support and monitoring of activities.Accreditation levels (bronze, silver, gold and platinum levels) as health promoting schools after pre and post intervention.Out of 206 schools, 203 participated in the baseline assessment and 204 in the endline assessment. The response rate was 99%. Two schools which refused participation were excluded and not assessed. Schools (N = 17) which participated in the 2011-2013 study were excluded from analysis. There was a statistically difference (p = 0.01) in the improvement of accreditation level of the baseline and endline assessment after intervention(p<0.05). Overall, the proportion of schools at the gold level increased from 1(0.5%) in 2016 to 71(38%). Silver level from 9(5%) to 57 (31%) of schools after intervention. The response rate in health profile assessment in higher(8) and lower(8) accredited schools was 95.9% and 92.7% respectively. The health profile of children higher accreditation level schools (N = 754) were found better in hygiene practices protective factors (peer support at school, parental or guardian supervision), handling stress and less prone to injury as compared to lower accreditation level schools (N = 700),(p<0.05).The health promoting school programme was found to be feasible and effective and lead to significant improvement in accreditation level as compared to baseline assessment after continuous self-quality improvement by schools(p<0.05). The health profile of children studying in higher accredited schools was better as compared to lower accredited schools."
https://openalex.org/W4298088763,"National mental health surveys have demonstrated increased stress and depressive symptoms among high-school students during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but objective measures of anxiety after the first year of the pandemic are lacking.A 25-question survey including demographics, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7) a validated self-administered tool to evaluate anxiety severity, and questions on achievement goals and future aspirations was designed by investigators. Over a 2-month period, all students from grade 9-12 in a single high-school (n = 546) were invited to complete an online survey after electronic parental consent and student assent. Bi-variate and chi-square analyses examined demographic differences in anxiety scores and the impact on outcomes; qualitative analyses examined related themes from open-ended questions.In total, 155/546 (28%) completed the survey. Among students with binary gender classifications, 54/149 (36%) had GAD-7 scores in the moderate or severe anxiety range (scores≥10), with a greater proportion among females than males (47% vs 21%, P<0.001). Compared to students with GAD-7<10, those with ≥ 10 were more likely to strongly agree that the pandemic changed them significantly (51% vs 28%, p = 0.05), made them mature faster (44% vs 16%, p = 0.004), and affected their personal growth negatively (16% vs 6%, p = 0.004). Prominent themes that emerged from open-ended responses on regrets during the pandemic included missing out on school social or sports events, missing out being with friends, and attending family events or vacations.In this survey of high school students conducted 2 years after the onset of COVID-19 in the United States, 47% of females and 21% of males reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms as assessed by the GAD-7. Whether heightened anxiety results in functional deficits is still uncertain, but resources for assessment and treatment should be prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W4298089136,"Influenza vaccination is recommended in Canada for older adults and those with underlying health conditions due to their increased risk of severe outcomes. Further research is needed to identify who within these groups is not receiving influenza vaccine to identify opportunities to increase coverage.We aimed to 1) estimate influenza non-vaccination prevalence and 2) assess factors associated with non-vaccination among Canadian adults aged ≥65 and adults aged 46-64 with ≥1 chronic medical condition (CMC) due to their high risk of severe influenza outcomes.We conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected from 2015-2018 among participants of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. For both groups of interest, we estimated non-vaccination prevalence and used logistic regression models to identify factors associated with non-vaccination. We report adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the investigated variables.Overall, 29.5% (95% CI: 28.9%, 30.1%) of the 23,226 participants aged ≥65 years and 50.4% (95% CI: 49.4%, 51.3%) of the 11,250 participants aged 46-64 years with ≥1 CMC reported not receiving an influenza vaccination in the past 12 months. For both groups, lack of recent contact with a family doctor and current smoking were independently associated with non-vaccination.Influenza vaccination helps prevent severe influenza outcomes. Yet, half of adults aged 46-64 years with ≥1 CMC and more than one-quarter of all adults aged ≥65 years did not receive a recommended influenza vaccine in the year prior to the survey. Innovation in vaccination campaigns for routinely recommended vaccines, especially among those without annual family doctor visits, may improve coverage.Influenza vaccination coverage among Canadian adults aged 46-64 years with ≥1 CMC and adults aged ≥65 years remains suboptimal. Vaccination campaigns targeting those at high risk of severe outcomes without routine physician engagement should be evaluated to improve uptake."
