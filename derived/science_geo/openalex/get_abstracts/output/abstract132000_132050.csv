https://openalex.org/W1988097332,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor whose expression is dramatically induced by hypoxia due in large part to an increase in the stability of its mRNA. Here we show that HuR binds with high affinity and specificity to the element that regulates VEGF mRNA stability by hypoxia. Inhibition of HuR expression abrogates the hypoxia-mediated increase in VEGF mRNA stability. Overexpression of HuR increases the stability of VEGF mRNA. However, this only occurs efficiently in hypoxic cells. We further show that the stabilization of VEGF mRNA can be recapitulated in vitro. Using an S-100 extract, we show that the addition of recombinant HuR stabilizes VEGF mRNA markedly. These data support the critical role of HuR in mediating the hypoxic stabilization of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia."

To elucidate the mechanism of pro- and antiapoptotic action of proteasome inhibitors, their effects on U937 lymphoid and 293 kidney human tumor cells were tested. Treatment with peptidyl aldehyde MG132 and other proteasome inhibitors led to a steady increase in activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, JNK1, which is known to initiate the apoptotic program in response to certain stresses. Dose dependence of MG132-induced JNK activation was parallel with that of apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway strongly suppressed MG132-induced apoptosis. These data indicate that JNK is critical for the cell death caused by proteasome inhibitors. An antiapoptotic action of proteasome inhibitors could be revealed by a short incubation of cells with MG132 followed by its withdrawal. Under these conditions, the major heat shock protein Hsp72 accumulated in cells and caused suppression of JNK activation in response to certain stresses. Accordingly, pretreatment with MG132 reduced JNK-dependent apoptosis caused by heat shock or ethanol, but it was unable to block JNK-independent apoptosis induced by TNFα. Therefore, proteasome inhibitors activate JNK, which initiates an apoptotic program, and simultaneously they induce Hsp72, which suppresses JNK-dependent apoptosis. A balance between these two effects might define the fate of cells exposed to the inhibitors.

Mammalian cells respond to various stressful conditions by activation of stress kinase signaling cascades. Activation of a stress-kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; aLLN, N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal. by strong oxidants, UV irradiation, and some other stressful conditions proceeds through a signal transduction pathway that involves small GTP-binding proteins and a cascade of kinases (1Kyriakis J.M.

Prolonged activation of JNK is harmful, since it initiates a special program that leads to cell death, apoptosis (3Chen Y.-R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Indeed, overproduction of dominant negative mutants of JNK or other components of the kinase cascade inhibits programmed cell death in response to heat shock, UV irradiation, oxidative stress (5Verheij M.

Many stressful conditions also induce heat shock proteins, including Hsp72, which increases a cell's tolerance to stresses. Therefore, the cell's decision to die or to survive is determined by the fine balance of these two systems. In cells affected by stresses, Hsp72 binds to damaged and misfolded polypeptides and can either facilitate their repair or target nonreparable polypeptides for degradation by the ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent pathway (see Refs. 9Kabakov A.E. Gabai V.L. Heat Shock Proteins and Cytoprotection: ATP-deprived Mammalian Cells, Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholarand 10Sherman M.

Our recent findings demonstrate, however, that the cell-protective action of Hsp72 may be unrelated to its activity in protein refolding or degradation. In fact, Hsp72 interferes with the activation of stress kinase JNK, and thus prevents apoptotic signaling during certain stresses (11Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D. Caron A.W. Rits S. Shifrin V.I.

This suppression of JNK appears to be responsible for Hsp72-mediated protection of cells from apoptosis induced by heat shock, ethanol, and some other stresses (11Gabai V.L. Meriin A.B. Mosser D.D.

In fact, incubation of cells with potent proteasome inhibitors, namely peptide aldehydes and lactocystin, either facilitated apoptosis caused by TNF or Fas-ligand (14Fujita E. Mukasa T. Tsukahara T. Arahata K. Omura S. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or was alone sufficient to induce apoptosis (13Drexler H.C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Since many important regulatory proteins, e.g. p53, are the substrates of proteasome, it was suggested that inhibition of the breakdown of these proteins could result in their accumulation, thereby leading to apoptosis (16Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 17Shinohara K. Tomioka M. Nakano H. Tone S. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). On the contrary, other laboratories reported that treatment with inhibitors of proteasome-dependent protein breakdown protected cells from apoptosis triggered by growth factor withdrawal, ionizing irradiation, exposure to glucocorticoids, or phorbol ester (19Grimm L.M. Goldberg A.L. Poirier G.G. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3835-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 20Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerez A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M. Tschopp J. Martinou J.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Such protection was observed with quiescent cells, while induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors was demonstrated mainly with proliferating cultures. This led to the idea that inhibition of protein degradation has much more severe effects on cells progressing through the cell cycle. However, there are some examples where exposure of quiescent cells to inhibitors also activated apoptosis (16Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 20Sadoul R. Fernandez P.-A. Quiquerez A.-L. Martinou I. Maki M. Schroter M. Becherer J.D. Irmler M.

Effects of the inhibition of proteasome-dependent proteolysis on apoptosis could provide new insights into the mechanisms triggering programmed cell death. Furthermore, information about the nature of the inhibitor's cytotoxicity could also be helpful in drug development, since some of the proteasome inhibitors are currently in use as lead compounds for drug design. In this work, we have studied effects of proteasome inhibitors on the activation of JNK and the role of this kinase in cytotoxicity of such inhibitors. We also investigated the role of induction of Hsp72 in the antiapoptotic effects of the proteasome inhibitors. U937 human lymphoid tumor cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were used for experiments while in the midlog phase (3–7 × 105 cells/ml). 293 human cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and were used in transient transfection experiments while at 40% of confluence. MG132 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory, Inc.N-Acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (aLLN) was purchased from Sigma. MG132 analogs were synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Anti-hsp72 antibody (SPA810) was from StressGene Biotechnologies Corp. (Canada), and anti-p53 antibody (PAb1801) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. JNK activity was assayed using GST-c-Jun protein as a substrate after immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK1 antibodies (sc-474, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-HA antibody for transfected JNK (Berkeley Antibody Company, Richmond, CA). Briefly, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a 25 μg/ml concentration each of aprotenin, pepstatin, and leupeptin). After immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK1 or anti-HA antibody and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and washing, a kinase reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmNa3VO4, and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 10 min. Then the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane and autoradiography. This membrane was later used for immunoblot with anti-JNK1 antibody to ensure that equal amounts of the kinase were immunoprecipitated. p38 kinase activity was determined by Western blot with polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs) specifically recognizing the phosphorylated (active) form of p38. Later the same blot was treated with anti-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs) to ensure equal loading of the kinase on different lanes. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation was followed by Western blotting with anti-PARP monoclonal antibodies (C2–10; G. Poirier, Montreal, Canada). Apoptosis of 293 cells was detected by cleavage of a truncated form of U1 70-kDa protein d12 (21Romac J.M.-J. Graff D.H. Keene J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4662-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate method with a plasmid encoding d12 tagged with the T7 epitope alone or together with a dominant-negative mutant form of SEK1 (K/R) or c-Jun (TAM67). After 48 h, cells were either treated with 10 μm MG132 or subjected to heat shock at 45 °C for 15 min. After an additional 24 h, cells were lysed, and cleavage of d12 was detected by Western blot with anti-T7 epitope antibody. U937 cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in RPMI 1640 without leucine and with dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and incubated for 40 min. Proteins were then labeled for 1 h with 10 mCi/ml of [14C]leucine. Cells were washed once and chased in regular RPMI 1640 media with 0.2 mg/ml unlabeled leucine, 150 mm cycloheximide (to inhibit protein synthesis and reincorporation of a labeled leucine), and 20 mm chloroquine (to inhibit lysosomal protein degradation) in the presence of different concentrations of MG132 (preincubation of cells with MG132 for 3 h did not change the level of inhibition of degradation). At the end of the chase period, 10% trichloroacetic acid was added, and samples were left for 30 min on ice. Then samples were spun down in Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured. A percentage of degradation was calculated as a ratio of trichloroacetic acid-soluble and total radioactivity in a sample. To assay for inhibition of I-κB degradation by MG132, cells were incubated for 45 min with different concentrations of the inhibitor, and then TNFα (5 ng/ml) was added. Samples were collected 10 min later and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot with anti-I-κB antibody (sc-847, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and quantitated with a laser scanner. To dissect the mechanisms of induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors, we tested their effects on activation of JNK, a stress kinase required for initiation of the apoptotic program in response to a variety of stressful conditions. Effects of a very potent proteasome inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132), on the U937 cell line were studied (Fig. 1 A). The degree of apoptosis was followed by the cleavage of PARP and the appearance of an 86-kDa fragment of PARP, which is the hallmark of this process. A fraction of cleaved PARP correlated with a fraction of cells that underwent shrinkage and nuclear condensation (not shown). The first signs of apoptosis were seen at 4–5 h of incubation with 50 μm of MG132, and after 7 h of incubation, more than 50% of cells underwent apoptosis. Prolonged exposure to the inhibitor (20 h) caused programmed cell death in almost 100% of the cell population. Similar results (100% apoptosis) were observed upon titration of MG132 down to 1.5 μm (Fig. 2 A). Therefore, dose dependence of apoptosis on MG132 covered a narrow range of concentrations between 0.2 and 1.5 μm.Figure 2Dose dependence of MG132-mediated induction of apoptosis and activation of JNK. A, dose dependence of MG132-induced PARP cleavage. PARP cleavage was measured after a 16-h incubation with the indicated concentrations of MG132. B, dose dependence of JNK activation by MG132. Samples from the experiment showed in panel A were taken after a 4.5-h incubation with the indicated concentrations of MG132 for measurement of JNK activity. C, quantitation of data from panels A and B by laser scanner. The dose dependence of JNK activation strongly correlates with the dose dependence of PARP cleavage.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Apoptosis caused by MG132 closely correlated with activation of JNK. JNK1 activity steadily and strongly increased during incubation with the inhibitor (Fig. 1 B) and preceded PARP degradation (Fig. 1 A). In addition, the dose dependence of apoptosis was almost parallel with that of activation of JNK (Fig. 2). In fact, incubation of the cells with 1.5 μm MG132 activated JNK1 to the maximal level. This saturation plateau of the activity curve covers the range of MG132 concentrations capable of causing 100% of apoptosis (Fig. 2 C). The 0.5 μm concentration of MG132, which lies on the steep portion of the curve, resulted in an intermediate activation of JNK1. These data suggested that JNK activation may play a causative role in apoptosis induced by the proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, after screening several cell lines, we have found that in COS-7 cells (in contrast to other lines) MG132 did not activate JNK, which correlated with the inability of this proteasome inhibitor to induce apoptosis (not shown). To test directly whether JNK activation is essential for apoptosis induced by MG132, we studied whether such apoptosis could be suppressed by a dominant-negative mutant form of SEK1, one of JNK's activators. As shown previously, transient transfection of cells with the dominant-negative SEK1 mutant suppresses activation of JNK in response to heat shock, irradiation, oxidative stress, etc., which led to repression of apoptosis (3Chen Y.-R.

Since efficiency of transfection of U937 cells is very low, we used the 293 human kidney cell line for these experiments. MG132 was cytotoxic for 293 cells and activated JNK similarly to that in U937 cells (not shown). As an indicator of apoptosis in transfected cells, we followed cleavage of a recombinant fragment of U1 70-kDa ribonucleoprotein (d12), which is caused by the same apoptosis-activated protease that degrades PARP (22Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected either with d12 plasmid alone or together with the plasmid encoding the dominant-negative SEK1 mutant. Fig. 3, A and B, show that expression of the mutant SEK1 dramatically reduced activation of JNK and suppressed d12 cleavage caused by the incubation of cells with MG132. In line with previously reported data (5Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N.

Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), transfection with the mutant SEK1 also reduced activation of JNK and suppressed d12 cleavage induced by strong heat shock (Fig. 3, A and B). To obtain independent data on the critical role of JNK in MG132-induced apoptosis, we studied if a dominant-negative mutant form of c-Jun, an immediate downstream component of JNK cascade, suppresses such apoptosis. Cotransfection of c-Jun dominant-negative mutant (TAM67) together with d12 strongly suppressed d12 cleavage induced by MG132 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, inhibition of JNK signaling pathway either immediately upstream or immediately downstream of JNK suppressed MG132-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that MG132-induced apoptotic pathway involves SEK1, JNK, and c-Jun. In U937 cells, reduction of the amount of JNK by incubation of cells with an antisense oligonucleotide covering the 5′-translated region of JNK1 coding sequence (23Seimiya H. Mashima T. Toho M. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4631-4636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) also suppressed MG132-induced apoptosis. This effect was modest (about 50%), since even after prolonged incubation of cells in the presence of the oligonucleotide, cellular content of JNK1 decreased only about 50% (not shown). It is noteworthy that exposure of cells to MG132 also led to an activation of another stress-kinase p38 (Fig. 4). This kinase had been shown to participate in production of interleukin-6, activation of phospholipase A2, regulation of phosphorylation of Hsp27, and other processes (24Waterman W.H. Molski T.F.P. Huang C.-K. Adams J.L. Shaafi R.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Berghe W.V. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The pattern of activation of p38 kinase by 1.5 μm MG132 was similar to that of JNK activation (Fig. 4 A), but a high concentration of this proteasome inhibitor (50 μm) caused much faster activation of p38 (not shown). Although p38 was reported to be critical for certain types of apoptosis (4Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 136: 1326-1331Crossref Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), activation of this kinase appeared not to be involved in MG132-induced apoptosis. In fact, incubation of cells with the specific inhibitor of p38, SB203580, did not suppress, and even slightly facilitated, this apoptosis (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 activates two distinct stress kinases (JNK and p38), but only one of them (JNK) is essential for apoptosis. We cannot exclude, however, the possibility that isoforms of p38 insensitive to SB203580 could be involved MG132-induced apoptosis. To examine whether the JNK-activating and cytotoxic effect of MG132 is related to inhibition of proteasome, two other proteasome inhibitors were tested. Lactacystin-β-lacton, a very specific covalent proteasome inhibitor, and aLLN, a weaker noncovalent inhibitor, both activated JNK (Fig. 5) and caused apoptosis (not shown). The onset of JNK activation and of apoptosis lagged behind those induced by MG132, probably because of a slower accumulation of these inhibitors in cells or because of a lower rate of inhibition of a proteasome. Another strong covalent inhibitor of the proteasome, NIP-L3VS (26Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), also induced apoptosis in U937 cells. By contrast, less active or inactive analogs of MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucine, benzyloxycarbonyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvaline or benzyloxycarbonyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-amide) did not cause detectable PARP cleavage in the cells even when added at up to 50 μm concentrations (not shown). Therefore, there was a strong correlation between the cytotoxicity of MG132-like compounds and their ability to inactivate proteasome. It was suggested that inhibition of proteasome leads to accumulation of certain otherwise short lived proteins, providing a cytotoxic effect (13Drexler H.C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 16Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 317: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoptosis caused by proteasome inhibitors was shown to be dependent on accumulation of p53 (16Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, U937 cells used in our work express negligible amounts of p53, which is undetectable by Western blot with anti-p53 antibody (27Danova M. Giordano M. Mazzini G. Riccardi A. Leuk. Res. 1994; 14: 417-422Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Dou Q.P. An B. Will P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9019-9023Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, incubation of cells with a high concentration of MG132 (50 μm) for up to 20 h did not cause any detectable accumulation of p53 in our experiments (not shown). Therefore, in the U937 cell line, apoptosis induced by the proteasome inhibitor is clearly p53-independent. To our surprise, MG132 at concentrations that activated JNK and apoptosis showed only little effect on the breakdown of the bulk of short lived proteins. To measure nonlysosomal (mostly proteasome-dependent) protein degradation, cell proteins were labeled with [14C]leucine and chased with an excess of unlabeled leucine in the presence of an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation. The proteolysis was followed by an appearance of label in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction. In these experiments, 0.5 μm of MG132, which provided about half-maximal activation of JNK and apoptosis (Fig. 2), showed almost no inhibition of degradation of the bulk of short lived proteins (Fig. 6). Moreover, 1.5 μm of MG132, which caused maximal activation of JNK and resulted in 100% of apoptosis (Fig. 2), provided only about 25% inhibition of proteolysis. A further increase in concentration of MG132 allowed much stronger reduction in protein breakdown, and 50 μm provided up to 85% inhibition. The extent of the inhibition did not change significantly after longer exposure of the cells to MG132 (not shown). Although the active concentration of MG132 (0.5 μm) was too low to affect degradation of the bulk of short lived proteins, there is a possibility that the breakdown of distinct unstable polypeptides (including a hypothetical protein(s) that controls JNK activity) could selectively be more sensitive to this inhibitor. To test this possibility, as a model unstable protein we have chosen I-κB, which becomes extremely short lived after exposure to TNFα. Indeed, 0.5 μm of MG132 was sufficient to strongly reduce the ubiquitin-dependent breakdown of I-κB (Fig. 6). Therefore, the proteasome-dependent degradation of certain unstable proteins could selectively be inhibited by MG132 even at concentrations that do not affect the breakdown of the bulk of short lived proteins. Defining such unstable protein(s) that regulates JNK is an important goal for future research. Recent publications indicate that under certain conditions, inhibition of proteasome-dependent protein breakdown prevents apoptosis triggered by harmful stimuli (19Grimm L.M. Goldberg A.L.

Aβ is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic cleavage. APP is subject to N- and O-glycosylation and potential tyrosine sulfation, following protein synthesis, and is then thought to be cleaved in an intracellular secretory pathway after or during these post-translational modifications. Studies utilizing agents that affect a series of steps in the protein secretory pathway have identified the possible intracellular sites of APP cleavage and Aβ generation within the protein secretory pathway. In the present study, using cells with normal protein metabolism, but expressing mutant APP with defectiveO-glycosylation, we demonstrated that the majority of APP cleavage by α-, β-, and γ-secretases occurs afterO-glycosylation. Cells expressing the mutant APP noticeably decreased the generation of the intracellular APP carboxyl-terminal fragment (αAPPCOOH), a product of α-secretase, and both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in medium, a product of β- and γ-secretases. Furthermore, we found that the cells accumulate the mutant APP in intracellular reticular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum. Agents that could ambiguously affect the function of specific intracellular organelles and that may be toxic were not used. The present results indicate that APP is cleaved by α-, β-, and γ-secretases in step(s) during the transport of APP through Golgi complex, where O-glycosylation occurs, or in compartments subsequent to trans-Golgi of the APP secretory pathway. β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ) is a principal component of parenchymal amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease.

However, these procedures are toxic, and it is possible that these agents interfere with intracellular protein metabolism through nonspecific and unpredictable mechanisms. To identify potential intracellular compartments involved in the cleavage of APP by secretases without utilizing toxic metabolic inhibitors, we prepared cells expressing mutant APP (APPmut) which is not subject to O-glycosylation. In such cells, all other intracellular protein metabolism is thought to be normal. Taking advantage of the property of the cells expressing APPmut, we examined the processing of APP in healthy cells. Cells expressing the APPmut noticeably decreased the generation of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP (αAPPCOOH), a product of cleavage by α-secretase, and also failed to generate Aβ40 and Aβ42, products of cleavage by both β- and γ-secretases. The present study shows that, without utilizing metabolic agents which nonspecifically interfere with protein degradation and secretion, APP is cleaved after, or possibly during, maturation (O-glycosylation). These results indicate that APP cleavage occurs in compartment(s) subsequent to trans-Golgi of the protein secretory pathway or possibly during the transport of APP through Golgi complex, where O-glycosylation occurs (34Danphy W.G.

The 3′ recessed termini were filled with dNTP and ligated in frame (pΔAPP770wt) (Fig. 1 a (i)). To produce EcoO65I site in the cytoplasmic domain of pΔAPP770wt, site-directed mutagenesis was introduced with PCR as follows: primer 1, 5′-GCCGCGGTCACCCCAGAGGAGCGCCACACCTGTCC-3′ (the nucleotide underlined were changed to produce EcoO65I site (T to G)), and primer 2, 5′-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAG-3′ (SP6 promoter primer), were used in PCR with PWO DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of plasmid pΔAPP770wt. Primer 3, 5′-TCTGGGTGACCGCGGCGTCAACCTCCACC-3′ (the nucleotide underlined was changed to produce EcoO65I site (A to C)), and primer 4, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ (T7 promoter primer), were used in PCR with PWO DNA polymerase in the presence of plasmid pΔAPP770wt. Both PCR products were digested with EcoO65I, ligated, and then inserted into pcDNA3 atHindIII/XbaI sites. Production of the EcoO65I site does not change the amino acid sequence in the APP protein, and this PCR procedure with PWO DNA polymerase did not induce nucleotide mutations. The position and direction of primers is indicated in Fig. 1 a (i). The pΔAPP770wt that introduced EcoO65I site was further amplified between primers 3 and 4 with Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Co., Kyoto, Japan). The Taq DNA polymerase introduces nucleotide mutations on newly synthesized DNA strands with a frequency of one base per approximately 400 bases (36Fromant M.B. Blanquest S. Plateau P. Anal.

The constructs for mutant pΔAPP770, pΔAPP770mut, were subcloned and transfected into 293 cells (human transfected primary embryonal kidney) with Lipofectin, and cell lines that expressed stably-transfected pΔAPP770mut were isolated. Among the cell lines isolated, cells displaying aberrant APP metabolism were further characterized.

The mutation was also introduced into APP695cDNA to construct pAPP695mutby exchanging the HindIII/XcmI fragment from APP695cDNA with that from pΔAPP770mutwhich carries the mutation (Fig. 1 b (ii)). Cell lines that express stably-transfected pAPP695mut were also isolated and analyzed for APP metabolism.

Three monoclonal antibodies that recognize distinct portions of Aβ were used for quantification of Aβ species in medium. 2D1, raised against Aβ1–27, recognizes a human-specific epitope FRH600–602 between the β- and α-secretase sites. 4D1, raised against Cys + Aβ32–40, recognizes APP derivatives truncated at Aβ40 but not Aβ42. 4D8, raised against Gly-Gly + Aβ37–42, recognizes APP derivatives truncated at Aβ42 but not Aβ40. All monoclonal antibodies were purified with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) from the ascites. Purified 2D1 was biotinylated with ECL protein biotinylation module (Amersham, RPN 2202). Conditioned media from cells (2 × 106 cells) were collected 18–20 h after medium change. Wells were coated with the monoclonal Aβ end-specific antibody, 4D1 or 4D8 (0.3 μg of antibody in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2))), washed with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (washing buffer, WB), blocked with bovine serum albumin (3% (w/v) in PBS), washed with WB, and then a sample (100 μl) diluted suitably with WB containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (dilution buffer, DB) was incubated together with a standard of synthetic Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 peptides (synthesized at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). After washing, wells were treated with biotinized 2D1 (12.5 ng in DB), washed, and incubated with 100 μl of a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (1:2000 dilution: Amersham RPN1051). The plate was further washed, and 100 μl of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate solution (KPL 5062-01, Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was added to wells and then incubated at room temperature. Reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS, and the absorbance at 405 nm was determined. This procedure can quantify >0.4 ng of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in 100 μl of medium. To estimate the level of APP695 expression, APP from cells that expressed stably-transfected plasmids was immunoprecipitated from the same amount of protein lysate, detected by immunoblot with UT-421 following SDS-PAGE, and quantified using a Fuji BAS 2000 Imaging Analyzer. The level of APP695mut expression was normalized to the level of APP695wt expression, which was assigned a reference value of 1.0 and was indicated as a relative ratio. Quantity of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (fmol/100 μl of medium) was divided by the relative APP695 ratio and was indicated as an Aβ/APP ratio. To differentiate exogenous transfected APP from endogenous APP in 293 cells, a cDNA (pΔAPP770wt) was constructed, encoding APP770 lacking 287 amino acids (APP770379–666: numbering for APP770 isoform) of the extracellular domain (Fig. 1 a) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An immunoblot with UT-421 showed that 293 cells, expressing pΔAPP770wt, presented two isoforms (Fig. 2 a). The deleted region contains two potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1 and Refs. 13Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Master C.L. Beyreuther K.

Morell A.G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1974; 41: 99-128PubMed Google Scholar and 40Muramatsu T. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 50: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Treatment of ΔAPP770wt with endoglycosidase H, isolated from cells which expressed it stably, did not alter the mobility of ΔAPP770 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 a). This confirms thatN-glycosylation sites are deleted from the pΔAPP770 cDNA, and the resulting ΔAPP770wt is not subject to N-glycosylation in 293 cells. On the other hand, we found that ΔAPP770wt is modified by O-glycosylation with a terminal neuraminic acid of O-glycan because the treatment of ΔAPP770wt, isolated from the cell, with neuraminidase and a combination of neuraminidase and O-glycanase increased the mobility of ΔAPP770 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 a). The treatment of ΔAPP770wt with O-glycanase alone had no effect because the sialic acid first needs to be removed to release O-glycan from the protein (data not shown). We tentatively assigned different ΔAPP770 species as follows: a high molecular weight O-glycosylation form is ogΔAPP770, and a low molecular weight non-glycosylated form is nonΔAPP770. The ΔAPP770wt treated with a combination of neuraminidase and O-glycanase does not show identical mobility with nonΔAPP770 on SDS-PAGE (compare Neu. +O-gly. with Control in Fig. 2 a). The ΔAPP770 may be subject to further unidentified modification. We also define, in a broad sense, this ΔAPP770, which may be carrying only the unidentified modification, as nonΔAPP770. When O-glycosylation and degradation of ΔAPP770wt were compared with those of endogenous APP in a pulse-chase study (Fig. 3 a), we found that the respective metabolic rate of nonΔAPP770 and endogenous imAPP and that of ogΔAPP770 and endogenous mAPP were identical (Fig. 4, a and b). These results indicate that the intracellular metabolism of ΔAPP770wt is normal.Figure 4Intracellular metabolism of ΔAPP770wt and ΔAPP770mut1. The relative ratios of mature endogenous APP (mAPP), immature endogenous APP (imAPP), O-glycosylated ΔAPP (ogΔAPP770), and naked ΔAPP770 (nonΔAPP770) are indicated relative to maximum levels, which were assigned a reference value of 1.0. a, metabolism of imAPP and nonΔAPP770wt. b, metabolism of mAPP and ogΔAPP770wt. c, metabolism of imAPP and nonΔAPP770mut1.d, metabolism of mAPP and ogΔAPP770mut1.

The PCR fragments were substituted for a fragment from HindIII/EcoO65I digestion of pΔAPP770wt and subcloned into pcDNA3 vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The plasmid carrying a potential mutation (denoted as × in Fig. 1 a(ii)), pΔAPP770mut, was transfected into 293 cells, and approximately 100 independent clones of cells expressing ΔAPP770mut stably were tested for intracellular APP metabolism with immunoblot using UT-421 antibody. A cloned cell line that expresses pΔAPP770mut1 presented with abnormal APP metabolism (Fig. 2 b). The cells contained large amounts of nonΔAPP770 and relatively little ogΔAPP770. Treatment with glycosidases of APP recovered from the cells using UT-421 does not affect its mobility on SDS-PAGE when detected by immunoblot using UT-421 (Fig. 2 b). The mobility is identical to that of ΔAPP770wt treated with a combination of neuraminidase and O-glycanase (compare Neu. + O-gly in Fig. 2 a with Control in Fig. 2 b). These results indicate that ΔAPP770mut1 is not subject to O-glycosylation. DNA sequence analysis of pΔAPP770mut1 revealed that Ser-124 (all numbering for amino acid positions is for the APP695 isoform) was substituted for cysteine (Ser-124 → Cys), and Leu-172 was substituted for proline (Leu-172 → Pro) (Table I). It is reasonable to assume that either or perhaps both mutations interfere with the O-glycosylation of APP. Pulse-chase studies also confirmed aberrant metabolism of ΔAPP770mut1 (Fig. 3 b). Very small amounts of APP770mut1 wereO-glycosylated, and the majority of nonAPP770mut1accumulated intracellularly without O-glycosylation (Figs.3 b and 4 c). However, once ΔAPP770mut1 is O-glycosylated, ogΔAPP770mut1 is degraded in a process similar to that for endogenous mAPP (Fig. 4 d). The results indicate that ΔAPP770mut 1 is metabolized normally if it is modified with O-glycan, although the cellular content of ogΔAPP770mut1 is extremely low (Figs. 2 b and3 b). Identical results were obtained when the mutation was carried on the APP695 isoform. To construct pAPP695mut1, a fragment containing the mutations, Ser-124 → Cys and Leu-172 → Pro, which was derived from HindIII/XcmI digestion of pΔAPP770mut1, was substituted for a fragment from HindIII/XcmI of pAPP695 wild type (pAPP695wt) and subcloned (Fig. 1 b). pAPP695mut1 encodes the entire amino acid sequence including the N-glycosylation sites, except for the two amino acid mutations (Fig. 1 b (ii)). When 293 cells stably expressing pAPP695mut1 were selected and analyzed for APP metabolism with immunoblot, a result identical to that for pΔAPP770mut1 was observed (Fig. 5). Because 293 cells do not endogenously express APP695, a neuron-specific APP isoform, it is easy to identify exogenous APP695mut1. In the cells expressing APP695mut1, imAPP695 accumulated in large quantities, whereas only very small amounts of mAPP695 were detected (Fig. 5). The results confirm that the mutation, mut1, inhibitsO-glycosylation of APP. ΔAPP770mut1 and APP695mut1 contain two amino acid substitutions, Ser-124 → Cys and Leu-172 → Pro. To determine whic"

Cl−/HCO3− exchange mediated by the AE1 anion exchanger in the basolateral membrane of type A intercalated cells is thought to be an essential component of lumenal H+ secretion by collecting duct intercalated cells. We evaluated the AE1 gene as a possible candidate gene for familial dRTA. We found in three unrelated families with autosomal dominant dRTA that all clinically affected individuals were heterozygous for a single missense mutation encoding the mutant AE1 polypeptide R589H. Patient red cells showed ∼20% reduction in sulfate influx of normal 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid sensitivity and pH dependence. Recombinant kidney AE1 R589H expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed 20–50% reduction in Cl−/Cl− and Cl−/HCO3− exchange, but did not display a dominant negative phenotype for anion transport when coexpressed with wild-type AE1. One apparently unaffected individual for whom acid-loading data were unavailable also was heterozygous for the mutation. Thus, in contrast to previously described heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in AE1 associated with red cell abnormalities and apparently normal renal acidification, the heterozygous hypomorphic AE1 mutation R589H is associated with dominant dRTA and normal red cells.

To maintain systemic acid/base balance, human kidneys must excrete 40–70 milliequivalents of H+/day. This acid excretion is mediated in substantial part by type A (acid-secreting) intercalated cells (IC) 1The abbreviations used are: IC, intercalated cell(s); dRTA, distal renal tubular acidosis; vH+-ATPase, vacuolar form of the H+-ATPase; kAE1, kidney isoform of AE1 (band 3); eAE1, human erythroid AE1; CAII, carbonic anhydrase II; HS, hereditary spherocytosis; wt, wild-type; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpolino)propanesulfonic acid; SSCP, single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis; SAO, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis; contig, group of overlapping clones; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s). of the renal collecting ducts. Failure of this distal acidification mechanism early in life leads to chronic metabolic acidosis (often with hypokalemia) and growth retardation. Later in life, nephrocalcinosis and hypercalciuria are variable concomitants. The clinical diagnosis of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) of the “complete form” is established by less-than-maximal urinary acidification in the presence of pre-existing acidosis. An “incomplete form” of dRTA in individuals without spontaneous acidosis has been defined as less-than-maximal urinary acidification following administration of a standard acid load. Complete dRTA can be successfully treated by chronic oral supplementation with bicarbonate or its metabolic precursor, citrate (1Dubose Jr., T.D. Alpern R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 3655-3689Google Scholar). Defects in any one of several transporters of the type A IC required for transepithelial acid secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption might cause heritable dRTA (1Dubose Jr., T.D. Alpern R.J.

Although mutations in the multiple genes encoding the subunits of the vH+-ATPase have not yet been reported in familial dRTA, absence of immunoreactive vH+-ATPase has been noted in kidney biopsy specimens from patients with acquired dRTA secondary to Sjogren's syndrome (14Cohen E.P.

In most reported HS cases, heterozygosity for wild-type (wt) AE1 was associated with the presence in patient red cells of immunoreactive AE1 polypeptide and anion transport function at levels 60–70% of those in wt family members (17Jarolim P.

In this article, we report the presence in three unrelated families of heterozygosity for a singleAE1 missense mutation in all clinically affected individuals. Microsatellite haplotypes within families also showed linkage with disease phenotype and with AE1 genotype, but differed among families. Functional analysis of AE1-mediated sulfate uptake into red cells and of recombinant AE1-mediated Cl−/HCO3− exchange in Xenopus oocytes revealed a mild partial loss-of-function phenotype for the mutant AE1 polypeptide. Co-expression of wt and mutant polypeptides in Xenopus oocytes did not reveal dominant negative properties of the mutant polypeptide. In addition, one apparently unaffected at-risk child also shows heterozygosity for the mutation, but has not undergone acid-load testing for incomplete dRTA. Thus, heterozygosity for the hypofunctional AE1 R589H allele is associated with dRTA and may contribute to its pathogenesis, whereas heterozygosity for null AE1 alleles in most HS patients has no evident renal phenotype.

The AE1 locus (SLC4A1) has been previously mapped to human chromosome 17q21-q22 in tight linkage with the gene encoding nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) (25Stewart E.A. Kopito R. Bowcock A.M. Genomics. 1989; 5: 633-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Included among the ordered polymorphic markers on chromosome 17q that are tightly linked to NGFR on the WC17.6 YAC contig 2Information is available via the World Wide Web (http://www.gdb.org). are the following: centromere-D17S1814-D17S800-D17S934-D17S920-D17S1861-telomere. Microsatellite polymorphisms amplified by PCR in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP using standard conditions. Amplified products were separated on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography. Two-point linkage analyses were performed using the LINKAGE package, version 5.1 (26Lathrop G.M. Lalouel J.M. Julier C. Ott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3443-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). Gene frequency was set as 0.00001 with a penetrance of 100% for affected individuals and 0% for unaffected family members. In addition, haplotypes were constructed from the genotype data. The most likely haplotypes were inferred by minimizing the number of crossover events in each sibship. The plasmid encoding human erythroid AE1 (eAE1) has been previously described (27Lux S.E. John K.M. Kopito R.R. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9089-9093Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 28Chernova M.N. Jarolim P. Palek J. Alper S.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The eAE1 R589H plasmid was constructed by four primer PCR (29Zhang Y. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5741-5749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The flanking primers were F1 (5′-TCCCGCTATACCCAGGAG-3′, nt 1660–1677) and F2 (5′-GGATGACCCAGCCCCGGG-3′, nt 2062–2045). The internal mutagenic primers were M1 (5′-CATGATGCTGCACAAGTTCAAGA-3′, nt 1866–1888) and M2 (5′-TCTTGAACTTGTGCAGCATCATG-3′, nt 1888–1866). The 402-base pair PCR fragment was then cleaved at its internal BclI sites, and the internal 230-base pair fragment encompassing the mutant site was cloned into the similarly cleaved human eAE1 pBluescript KS plasmid (Stratagene). Mutant and wild-type subclones were defined by restriction digestion, and their integrity confirmed by DNA sequencing. Human kAE1 versions of the wild-type and mutant eAE1 cDNAs were constructed by KpnI digestion of the wt and R589H eAE1 cDNAs to remove the 5′-most 311 nt, yielding constructs in which the next downstream ATG corresponded to the kAE1 initiator ATG. kAE1 constructs were inserted into the pXT7 vector (Promega) containing as 5′- and 3′-flanking regions the corresponding untranslated regions from Xenopus β-globin mRNA. cRNA was transcribed from linearized plasmid template with the Megascript kit (Ambion). cRNA was injected into defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes of stages V-VI. Oocytes were maintained in ND-96 buffer at 19 °C for 2–3 days.36Cl− influx studies were performed as described previously (29Zhang Y. Chernova M.N. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Jiang L. Alper S.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Isotopic influx periods were 10 or 15 min. Some influx experiments were performed at 37 °C and/or in extracellular solutions of pH 5.5 or 9.0, as indicated. Hypertonic influx medium contained ND-96 (212 mosm) supplemented with NaCl to a final osmolarity of 280 mosm (30Humphreys B.D. Jiang L. Chernova M Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C201-C209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 36Cl− efflux studies were performed as described previously (31Chernova M.N. Jiang L. Vandorpe D.H. Hand M. Crest M. Strange K. Alper S.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity was measured by ratiometric video imaging of oocytes (32Jiang L.W. Chernova M.N. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C191-C202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) loaded with 2,7-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)carboxy-fluorescein acetoxymethyl ester. Family pedigrees are shown in Fig. 1 (panels A–C). Propositi (arrows) presented to medical attention with histories of growth retardation, in one case accompanied by repeated urinary tract infections. All affected individuals (filled symbols) were short of stature. The complete form of dRTA was diagnosed by the combined detection of urinary pH values > 5.5; the absence of glucosuria (indicating normal proximal tubular function), and by the presence of metabolic acidosis without concomitant gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses (such as might result from diarrhea). Nephrocalcinosis (radiologically detected renal calcification) was present in all affected individuals except for family L members IV:3 and IV:4, who were diagnosed with incomplete dRTA before 1 year of age and then treated successfully with oral citrate (metabolized to bicarbonate). Unaffected individual IV:2 underwent an acid-challenge test at 9 months of age with normal results. Clinical variability among affected individuals within families was evident. In family L, individual III:2 has had >30 kidney stones without severe hypokalemia, whereas her sibling III:4 has had persistent refractory hypokalemia but few kidney stones. Among propositi, only individual III:2 of family B was hypokalemic at presentation. Genomic DNA previously prepared from the available members of family L was subjected to SSCP analysis of exons 11–20, encoding the anion-transporting transmembrane domain of the AE1 polypeptides. Only exon 14 showed reproducible polymorphism among family members. Fig. 1 A(inset) shows that of the 12 genomic DNAs tested, an identical exon 14 polymorphism was present in all five members of family L with dRTA. The polymorphism was absent from unaffected individual IV:2, in whom the absence of incomplete dRTA was confirmed by acid-loading test, and in all other apparently unaffected individuals except for one. The polymorphism was present in apparently unaffected individual IV:1, who has been unavailable for an acid loading test that would could diagnose incomplete dRTA. Although not acidotic, individual IV:1 has been and remains short of stature. DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified exon 14 from all affected individuals in family L revealed the heterozygous mutation G1766A (numbering from the initiator codon ATG), encoding the amino acid substitution R589H. The heterozygous mutation was also present in apparently unaffected individual IV:1, whose exon 14 displayed the conformational polymorphism. Absence of the heterozygous G1766A substitution was confirmed by exon 14 DNA sequencing in three individuals without clinical dRTA: III:3, III:5, and IV:2. The mutation abolished a restriction site recognized by FspI and HhaI.FspI digestion of PCR-amplified DNA confirmed the heterozygous presence of the mutation in all individuals with the conformational polymorphism, and its absence in the DNA of those without the polymorphism. In family K (Fig. 1 B), heterozygous loss of the HhaI restriction site in exon 14 cosegregated strictly with disease (inset). This was confirmed in all individuals by FspI digestion and by exon 14 DNA sequences, portions of which are shown in Fig. 1 D for affected individual II:2 and for unaffected individual III:1. Unaffected individual II:1 has had a normal acid challenge as an adult. In family B, heterozygous loss of the HhaI restriction site also cosegregated with disease (inset), and was confirmed by exon 14 DNA sequences in all individuals (data not shown). This mutation was not detected by SSCP analysis among 224 normal and affected inidividuals from families with hereditary ovalocytosis or hereditary spherocytosis (data not shown). The AE1 gene of individual II:2 of family K was completely sequenced through all coding exons and exon-intron splice junctions, without detection of additional mutations. The DNA sequence of individual II:5 of family L was obtained for exons 4, 5, and 10–20 (encoding the juxtamembrane region and the transmembrane ion transport domain) of the AE1 gene. Except for homozygosity for the previously described (19Jarolim P. Murray J.L. Rubin J.L. Ballas S.K. Chrobak L. Melrose W.D. Brabec V. Palek J. Blood. 1996; 88: 4366-4374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) silent polymorphism CTG → CTA in codon 441 (Leu) of exon 12, no other mutations were detected. The AE1 Memphis I polymorphism (33Yannoukakos D. Vasseur C. Driancourt C. Blouquit Y. Delaunay F. Wacjman H. Bursaux E. Blood. 1991; 78: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was absent in all three families. Intron 3, which includes at least part of the kidney-specific promoter for the kidney band 3 isoform, kAE1, was also sequenced in entirety in affected individuals I:1 and II:2 of family K, and in II:5 of family L. The intron 3 sequence in all these individuals conformed to family L intron 3 sequence, and were identical to the GenBank L35930 AE1 gene sequence (34Sahr K.E. Taylor W.M. Daniels B.P. Rubin H.L. Jarolim P. Genomics. 1994; 24: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), except for the homozygous absence of nt 7509–7512. These four nucleotides were similarly absent in the human AE1 (Memphis I variant) gene sequence (GenBank X77738) of Schofield et al.(35Schofield A.E. Martin P.G. Spillett D. Tanner M.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 2000-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3Additional sequencing of intron 3 in six randomly selected normal individuals showed identity in this region with GenBank X77738 (35Schofield A.E. Martin P.G. Spillett D. Tanner M.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 2000-2012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) rather than with GenBank L35930 (34Sahr K.E. Taylor W.M. Daniels B.P. Rubin H.L. Jarolim P. Genomics. 1994; 24: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This finding prompted the re-examination of intron 3 in two clonal isolates of intron 3 used in the sequencing of the non-Memphis humanAE1 gene. Both clones lacked nt 7508–7511 (numbering from Ref. 34Sahr K.E. Taylor W.M. Daniels B.P. Rubin H.L. Jarolim P. Genomics. 1994; 24: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The portion of intron 3 encompassing this region is not present in kAE1 mRNA in human kidney (36Kollert-Jons A. Wagner S. Hubner S. Appelhans H. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F813-F821PubMed Google Scholar) or mouse kidney (5Brosius III, F.C. Alper S.L. Garcia A.M. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7784-7787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Sahr K.E. Daniels B.P. Hanspal M. Blood. 1996; 88: 4500-4509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GenBank L35930 has been revised to reflect this correction. The uncertain clinical status of short-of-stature, genetically affected individual IV:1 of family L, in whom acid-loading test has not yet been performed, encouraged further testing of the hypothesis of linkage between the AE1 mutation R589H and disease phenotype by examination of linked polymorphic markers. Within each family, R589H heterozygotes shared a common allele of the bimorphic intragenic PstI restriction fragment length polymorphism in AE1 intron 3 (38Jenkins P.B. Gallagher P.G. Forget B.G. Br. J. Hematol. 1993; 85: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One shared haplotype of microsatellite markers flanking the AE1 locus (Fig. 1) was evident in all R589H heterozygotes within each family as indicated by D17S1814, D17S800, D17S934, D17S920, and D17S1861 in families L and K and by D17S800, D17S934, and D17S1861 in family B. In a set of two-point linkage analyses, the maximum LOD score calculated with the value of theta set to zero was 3.01 in favor of linkage for each of the microsatellites D17S934 and D17S1861. Moreover, the recombination event evident in individual IV:2 of family L (Fig. 1 A) refines the genetic locus of the AE1gene to a position telomeric to D17S800. The R589H mutation associated with the presence of dRTA in the three families is predicted to be present in both erythroid AE1 (eAE1) and in kidney AE1 (kAE1) polypeptides. Since multiple heterozygous AE1 loss-of-function mutations associated with Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO; Ref. 21Schofield A.E. Reardon D.M. Tanner M.J.A.

Cells from affected and unaffected family members were normocytic and had normal indices as detected by Technicon H3 autoanalyzer (data not shown). Red cell sulfate influx varied among families. However, dRTA cells showed influx values that were 86% (family L), 81% (family K), and 78% (family B) of the values of cells from related unaffected individuals (Table I). These relative values are somewhat higher than those measured in red cells from families with AE1-deficient HS (17Jarolim P. Rubin H.L. Liu S.-C. Brabec V. Derrick L. Yi S. Saad S"

The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of several of these proteins, including paxillin, tensin, and p130cas. Protein- tyrosine phosphatases, the counterparts of protein-tyrosine kinases, also presumably regulate phosphorylation of these proteins. We have tested the hypothesis that FAK intimately associates with a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity associated with the recombinant C-terminal domain of FAK in vitro and could be coimmunoprecipitated with both FAK and paxillin from lysates of chicken embryo cells. However, the interaction with FAK appeared to be indirect and mediated via paxillin. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase was subsequently identified as protein-tyrosine phosphatase-PEST, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase. The C-terminal noncatalytic domain of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-PEST directly bound to paxillinin vitro. The association of both a protein-tyrosine kinase and a protein-tyrosine phosphatase with paxillin suggests that paxillin may play a critical role in the regulation of the phosphotyrosine content of proteins in focal adhesions.

The integrins were originally identified as cell surface receptors for extracellular matrix proteins. They participate in a variety of cellular events, including adhesion, migration, invasion, cytoskeleton organization, and the generation of cytoplasmic signals (1Hynes R.O.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Engagement of the integrins with the extracellular matrix results in the formation of protein complexes termed focal adhesions. In cultured fibroblasts, focal adhesions are specialized structures that link the actin cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix (4Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M.

As a communication point between extracellular matrix and the inside of cells, focal adhesions perform both structural and signaling functions. One of the most important events after the engagement of integrins with their ligands is the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion-associated proteins (2Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Microinjection of a dominant-negative FAK protein ablated tyrosine phosphorylation in focal adhesions, yet the integrity of the focal adhesions was unaffected, and new focal adhesions could still form (28Gilmore A. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Experiments using various strategies to perturb normal FAK signaling suggest that FAK controls cell spreading, the rate of focal adhesion formation, and cell migration (7Richardson A. Parson J.T.

Recent evidence also suggests that FAK may function in the transmission of a cell adhesion-dependent signal that is required for cell survival (30Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.-Y. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The role of PTPases in the regulation of cytoskeletal structure and signaling via focal adhesions is only beginning to be addressed. Several candidate PTPases that may be involved in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation in focal adhesions have been identified; they include LAR, PTP1B, and PTP-PEST. LAR is a transmembrane PTPase expressed on the cell surface as two noncovalently associated subunits derived by cellular processing of a proprotein (33Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). LAR and an associated protein LIP.1 can be localized to focal adhesions in MCF7 cells (34Serra-Pages C. Kedersha N.L. Fazikas L. Medley Q. Debant A. Streuli M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2827-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). PTP1B and PTP-PEST are implicated in focal adhesion signaling because both associate with p130cas, a tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion-associated protein. PTP1B directly associates with the SH3 domain of p130cas, and overexpression of PTP1B leads to decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas(35Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A proline-rich sequence of PTP-PEST can also bind the p130cas SH3 domain, but in addition, the catalytic domain can directly interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated p130cas, and PTP-PEST may function to specifically dephosphorylate p130cas (36Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 37Garton A.J. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Tonks N.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 877-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, which is a bacterial pathogen, encodes a PTPase that binds and dephosphorylates both FAK and p130cas upon entry into cells (38Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This enzyme is essential for the virulence of a number of Yersiniaspecies (39Cornelis G.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 192: 243-263PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, three cellular PTPases and one bacterial PTPase have been implicated as potential regulators of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that a PTPase may be intimately associated with FAK. PTPase activity was found to specifically associate with FAK, both in vitro and in vivo. However, this interaction appeared to be indirect and was in part mediated by the focal adhesion-associated protein paxillin. The PTPase was identified as PTP-PEST and was found to directly bind to paxillin in vitro via its noncatalytic C-terminal domain. The finding that paxillin associates with both a PTK and a PTPase suggests novel models for the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation by the assembly of complexes containing both enzymes. Chicken embryo (CE) cells were prepared and maintained as described (40Reynolds A.B. Roesel D.J. Kanner S.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Swiss 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H + 10% calf serum and Cos cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H + 10% fetal bovine serum. The replication competent avian retroviral vector RCAS A (BH) (41Hughes H.S. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to express wild type FAK, dl853–963, dl965–1012, and C-tagged FAK as described previously (42Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 43Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For expression of PTP-PEST in Cos cells, the murine cDNA was engineered to encode a C-terminal epitope tag (KT3) using a PCR-based strategy. A 3′ primer that created aBamHI site and destroyed the termination codon was used, and the PCR product was inserted into the plasmid pctag (43Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (theBamHI site was engineered so the PTP-PEST and KT3 codons of pctag were in frame). The tagged cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To create a deletion mutant lacking the paxillin binding site, the sequences encoding amino acids 1–300 were amplified by PCR using a primer that created an EcoRI site at codon 300 that was in frame with the EcoRI site at codon 494 of PTP-PEST. The PCR product was substituted for the sequences encoding amino acids 1–494 of epitope-tagged PTP-PEST, then subcloned into pcDNA3. Cos cells were transiently transfected with the PTP-PEST constructs using LipofectAMINE and the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the cells were lysed 48 h later. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST)-FER (kindly provided by Dr. Shelton Earp, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) was used as a PTK source for phosphorylation of the substrate. One mg of poly(Glu,Tyr) was incubated with 10 μg GST-FER in 500 μl of reaction buffer (200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm imidizole (pH 7.2), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mmvanadate, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm cold ATP, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 4–6 h at room temperature with constant rotation as described (44Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The labeled poly(Glu,Tyr) was purified by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and chromatography through a Sephadex G-50 column. [γ-32P]ATP-labeled poly(Glu,Tyr) (1 × 106 cpm) was incorporated into a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel prior to polymerization. After separating the samples by electrophoresis, the SDS was removed, and the gel was incubated in denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine chloride and 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol) and then in renaturing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.04% Tween 20, and 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol) as described (44Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The gel was incubated in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.04% Tween 20, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, and 3 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h and then in fresh buffer overnight. After drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film overnight. Polyclonal antiserum directed against part of the noncatalytic portion of PTP-PEST was generated in rabbits using a trpE fusion protein containing amino acids 286–471 (49Davidson D. Cloutier J.-F. Gregorieff A. Veillette A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23455-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum was used to recognize FAK (BC3; a gift of Tom Parsons, University of Virginia), and commercially available monoclonal antibodies were used to recognize paxillin and p130cas (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Cells were lysed in ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl [pH 7.3], 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mm orthovanadate) or Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mmorthovanadate). The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For in vitrophosphatase assays, the cells were lysed in the absence of vanadate. For immunoprecipitations, antibodies were incubated with 0.2–1 mg of cell lysate for 1 h on ice. The immunecomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or anti-mouse IgG-coupled agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing three times in lysis buffer and twice in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), the immunecomplexes were dissociated by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed using the in gel PTPase assay (44Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (50Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies or protein A and ECL (Amersham Corp.). GST fusion proteins containing the N- and C-terminal domains of FAK have been described (45Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Additional fusion constructs were engineered using PCR to amplify C-terminal domain fragments of FAK, and the PCR products were inserted into pGEX2TK (Pharmacia). GST-H-FAK contains codons 765–1052, GST-B-FAK contains codons 858–1052, and GST-S-FAK contains codons 909–1052. Similarly, fragments of PTP-PEST were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX2TK. Fusion proteins containing residues 1–301, 297–775, 441–775, and 297–494 were engineered. The fusion proteins were expressed by incubation with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4–5 h at 37 °C, the bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified using glutathione agarose. One-half to one mg of cell lysate was precleared with 10 μg of GST bound to glutathione agarose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was then incubated with 0.1–1 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in Tris-buffered saline. The bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by either Western blotting or the in gel PTPase assay. Six to 10 μg of purified GST fusion protein was added to 40 μl of HMK buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 units of protein kinase A (Sigma) and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (NEN Life Science Products) (46Kaelin W.G.

Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). After 45 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated with HMK stop buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA). Radiolabeled GST-PTP-PEST was separated from [γ-32P]ATP by chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column. As described previously (46Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S.

Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and denatured in buffer containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The samples were renatured by incubation in serial dilutions of denaturation buffer. Filters were washed and then blocked in 5% milk as described (46Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K.

Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Radioactive probe was added (to 6 × 106 cpm/ml) and incubated for 8 h at 4 °C, and then the filter washed three times for 15 min and exposed to film. Overexpression of FAK in CE cells does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins unless the cells are treated with vanadate, a PTPase inhibitor (22Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins may be controlled by both FAK and an antagonistic, perhaps intimately associated PTPase. To test whether FAK could bind a PTPase, GST fusion proteins containing the N-terminal and C-terminal noncatalytic domains of FAK were used to pull down FAK-binding proteins from lysates of CE cells. The PTPase activity associated with these fusion proteins was examined using an in gel PTPase assay. The GST-C-terminal domain of FAK associated with four major bands of PTPase activity with molecular masses of 97, 75–80 (a doublet), and 50 kDa (Fig. 1). It is not clear whether these are different PTPases or represent breakdown products of the largest, 97-kDa PTPase. The PTPase activities specifically bound to the C-terminal domain of FAK because GST alone and GST-N-FAK failed to associate with any detectable PTPase activity. A series of GST-fusion proteins containing smaller fragments of the C-terminal domain of FAK was used to further map the FAK sequences required for association with PTPase activity. The GST-S-FAK construct contains only the focal adhesion targeting sequence, a 150-amino acid sequence that has been shown to localize FAK to focal adhesions (42Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Each of these constructs associated with PTPase activity in vitro (Fig. 1). Analysis of the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining demonstrated that equivalent amounts of each fusion protein were used in the analysis (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that FAK can associate with PTPase activity in vitro and that the focal adhesion targeting sequence is sufficient for association with the PTPase. The FAK sequences required for association with PTPase activity in vitro contain a binding site for paxillin, raising the possibility that FAK associates with a PTPase(s) via its interaction with paxillin. To determine whether paxillin associates with PTPase activity, paxillin immunecomplexes were analyzed using the in gel PTPase assay. No PTPase activity was detected in control immunoprecipitations lacking the primary antibody (Fig. 2). The paxillin immunecomplex, however, exhibited PTPase activity, and the molecular masses of the associated PTPase(s) were 97, 75–80, and 50 kDa (Fig. 2). The pattern of PTPase activities associated with GST-C-FAK was compared with the PTPase pattern coimmunoprecipitated with paxillin and found to be virtually identical (Fig. 2). Thus, paxillin associates with PTPase activities in vivo, and the molecular masses of the PTPase(s) are similar to those that associate with the C-terminal domain of FAK in vitro. To determine whether paxillin was required for the association of recombinant FAK with PTPase activity in vitro, a clearing experiment was performed. Paxillin was cleared from cell lysates by repeated immunoprecipitation. After three rounds of immunodepletion using a paxillin monoclonal antibody, the amount of paxillin remaining in the lysate was undetectable by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 3 C). After each immunoprecipitation, the lysate was incubated with GST-C-FAK, and the PTPase activity that associated with FAK in vitro was measured using the in gel PTPase assay. GST-C-FAK could no longer associate with PTPase activity after paxillin was cleared from the lysate, whereas GST-C-FAK bound PTPase activity in uncleared lysate (Fig. 3 A). Following four rounds of control immunoprecipitation using anti-mouse IgG, the amount of PTPase that associated with GST-FAK was undiminished (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that paxillin is required for the association of FAK with PTPase activity in vitro. To determine whether paxillin mediates the association of FAK with PTPase activity in vivo, mutants of FAK were expressed in CE cells, FAK was immunoprecipitated, and the immunecomplexes were analyzed using the in gel PTPase assay. A 97-kDa PTPase was coimmunoprecipitated from CE cells overexpressing FAK (Fig. 4 A). Under these lysis conditions, little PTPase activity coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous FAK (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). However, under milder lysis conditions, a 97-kDa PTPase could be coprecipitated with endogenous FAK (Fig. 4 B). The three FAK mutants analyzed, two deletion mutants and a variant in which the C-terminal 13 residues are replaced with an epitope tag, each failed to coimmunoprecipitate PTPase activity (Fig. 4 A). Western blotting of the immunecomplexes using BC3 antiserum indicated that similar amounts of each mutant were recovered (Fig. 4 A). Mutants dl853–963 and dl965–1012 are defective in focal adhesion targeting and paxillin binding (42Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 47Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Conversely, epitope-tagged FAK is defective for paxillin binding but is correctly localized to focal adhesions. Thus, paxillin binding correlates with ability of FAK to coimmunoprecipitate PTPase activity from cell lysates. These two results support the hypothesis that FAK associates indirectly with PTPase activity and that paxillin may serve as an intermediary binding protein. To determine whether PTP-PEST was the paxillin-associated PTPase, paxillin was immunoprecipitated from CE cells or Swiss 3T3 cells, and the immunecomplexes were probed with an anti-PTP-PEST antibody in a Western blot (Fig. 5 A). PTP-PEST was detected in paxillin immunecomplexes formed from each cell type. Control immunecomplexes lacking the primary paxillin monoclonal antibody did not contain PTP-PEST. Interestingly, the molecular mass of PTP-PEST differed between species. Murine PTP-PEST exhibited a molecular mass of 120 kDa, whereas avian PTP-PEST was 97 kDa. Thus, the molecular mass of avian PTP-PEST coincides with that of the major PTPase activity that associates with paxillin. In addition, PTP-PEST was immunoprecipitated from CE cells and Swiss 3T3 cells, and the immunecomplexes were Western blotted for paxillin. Control immunoprecipitations using nonimmune serum contained no paxillin, whereas PTP-PEST immunecomplexes contained detectable paxillin (Fig. 5 B). To confirm that the PTPase activity originally detected by its association with recombinant FAK was indeed PTP-PEST, CE and Swi"

Protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt), a member of the PKA/PKC serine/threonine kinase family, functions downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) in mediating effects of insulin on glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. We asked whether PKB/Akt mediates sequence-specific effects of insulin on hepatic gene expression using the model of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) promoter. Insulin lowers IGFBP-1 mRNA levels, inhibits IGFBP-1 promoter activity, and activates PKB/Akt in HepG2 hepatoma cells through a PI3K-dependent, rapamycin-insensitive mechanism. Constitutively active PI3K and PKB/Akt are each sufficient to mediate effects of insulin on the IGFBP-1 promoter in a nonadditive fashion. Dominant negative K179 PKB/Akt disrupts the ability of insulin and PI3K to activate PKB/Akt and to inhibit promoter activity. The IGFBP-1 promoter contains two IRSs each of which is sufficient to mediate sequence-specific effects of insulin, PI3K, and PKB/Akt on promoter activity. Highly related IRSs from the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and apolipoprotein CIII genes also are effective in this setting.

These observations have suggested that a common, but as yet undetermined mechanism may mediate the effects of insulin on multiple hepatic genes. Recent studies with wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, indicate that PI3K is necessary for insulin to reduce IGFBP-1 and PEPCK mRNA levels in liver-derived cells stimulated with dexamethasone and either glucagon or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, respectively (22Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 23Band C.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol.

Since multiple mechanisms involving distinct cis-acting DNA response sequences may mediate effects of insulin on gene expression in cAMP/glucocorticoid-stimulated cells (24Quinn P.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 86: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we chose to examine mechanisms mediating the effects of insulin on IGFBP-1 expression under basal conditions where specific IRSs are known to be involved (18Suwanichkul A. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this study provides the first report that PKB/Akt is necessary and sufficient to regulate gene expression through a specific response sequence, and, in this case, mediates effects of insulin on basal hepatic gene expression through a conserved IRS. TheSauI-HgaI fragment of the IGFBP-1 promoter was inserted into the pGL2 polylinker (Promega) (BP1.luc), and an NheI site was created by site-directed mutagenesis of bp −112 and −113 (BP1.Nhe), as reported previously (18Suwanichkul A. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BamHI site in pGL2 was disrupted and the IGFBP-1 promoter containing the NheI site was subcloned into this vector. Using a unique BamHI site located 3′ of IRSB in the IGFBP-1 promoter (Table I), we excised the NheI-BamHI fragment and replaced it with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides to create altered IRSs. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing.Table ISequence-specific effects of insulin, PI3K, and PKB/Akt on IGFBP-1 promoter activity in HepG2 cellsConstructLuciferase activityInsulinp110*PKB/Akt% control−116 −77BP1.LucGCTCACAAG CAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACGGGGATCC56 ± 550 ± 1039 ± 6BP1.NheGCTAGCAAG CAAAACAAACTTATTTTGAACACGGGGATCC51 ± 853 ± 356 ± 10IRS.mutGCTAGCAAGCACCGACGACCAGGCCTGAACACGGGGATCC107 ± 7149 ± 16136 ± 37ΔIRSGCTAGC––––––––––––––––––––GAACACGGGGATCC149 ± 20113 ± 18101 ± 14ΔIRS.AGCTAGCAAGCAAAACAAACCAGGCCTGAACACGGGGATCC47 ± 550 ± 749 ± 6ΔIRS.AmutGCTAGCAAGCAAAAgAAACCAGGCCTGAACACGGGGATCC101 ± 14143 ± 32124 ± 14ΔIRS.BGCTAGCAAGCACCGACGCCTTATTTTGAACACGGGGATCC42 ± 633 ± 235 ± 4ΔIRS.BmutGCTAGCAAGCACCGACGCCTTcTTTTGAACACGGGGATCC150 ± 14168 ± 43189 ± 26ΔIRS.PEPCKGCTAGCAAGCAAAACAcACCAGGCCTGAACACGGGGATCC37 ± 341 ± 347 ± 10ΔIRS.ApoCIIIGCTAGCAAGCcAAACAtACCAGGCCTGAACACGGGGATCC40 ± 1333 ± 937 ± 5−349 −315ΔIRS.331.AACCCGCAAGCAAAACAAGTACGCGTCGTTAGGT55 ± 864 ± 1058 ± 3ΔIRS.331.AmutACCCGCAAGCAAAAgAAGTACGCGTCGTTAGGT106 ± 11101 ± 13105 ± 7 Open table in a new tab The cDNA clone of human IGFBP-1 was provided by D.

HepG2 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to ∼70% confluence in Opti-MEM plus 5% BCS, rinsed, and stabilized for 24 h in 10 ml of DMEM with 1 g/liter BSA. LY294002 (Calbiochem) and wortmannin and rapamycin (Sigma) were added in dimethyl-d 6-sulfoxide (Me2SO) (0.125%, v/v) 30 min prior to addition of recombinant human insulin (Sigma). Wortmannin or Me2SO was added again 90 min later to maintain levels (22Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15501-15506Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared with TRI-Reagent-LS per the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Research) and 10 μg loaded for gel electrophoresis and transfer to Nytran membranes (Qiagen). Membranes were probed with IGFBP-1 and GAPDH cDNAs labeled with [α-P32]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming and transcripts visualized by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging. HepG2 cells (1 × 106/60-mm dish) were plated in Opti-Mem/BCS and transfected with calcium phosphate precipitates including a cytomegalovirus-driven β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression vector, as before (35Unterman T.G.

Cells were rinsed, then refed with DMEM/BSA and appropriate supplements. Lysates were prepared 18 h later with lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with an Optocomp-I luminometer (MGM Instruments) and results adjusted for β-gal activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Cell lysates were prepared in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (36Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. William L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and cleared by centrifugation. Endogenous p70S6 kinase was precipitated with anti-p70 antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein-G and kinase activity was measured as32P labeling of synthetic substrate (AKRRRLSSLRA) in the presence of PKA, PKC, and calcium-dependent kinase inhibitors using the S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Substrate-bound radioactivity was collected by binding to p81 phosphocellulose discs and quantified by scintillation counting after rinsing with phosphoric acid. Endogenous or HA-tagged PKB/Akt was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt (Santa Cruz) or mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) (Boehringer Mannheim), respectively. For Western blotting, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 8% reduced SDS/PAGE prior to transfer to nitrocellulose and analysis using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with enhanced chemiluminescence. To measure kinase activity, immunoprecipitated PKB/Akt was reacted in kinase buffer containing [γ-P32]ATP and histone 2B, as reported previously (36Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. William L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled protein was separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography, and the relative intensity of labeling was quantified by phosphorimaging. As shown in Fig. 1 A, insulin lowers IGFBP-1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells by ∼50%. Wortmannin, which directly inhibits the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, increases the level of IGFBP-1 mRNA and largely prevents the ability of insulin to lower IGFBP-1 mRNA levels. LY294002, another highly specific PI3K inhibitor that is structurally unrelated to wortmannin and more stable in solution, also increases IGFBP-1 mRNA levels and completely blocks the effect of insulin. In contrast, rapamycin reduces IGFBP-1 mRNA levels by ∼20% and does not disrupt the ability of insulin to further lower mRNA levels.In vitro kinase assays confirm that this dose of rapamycin reduces basal p70S6 kinase activity and blocks its activation by insulin for up to 20 h in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that PI3K contributes negatively to the regulation of basal IGFBP-1 mRNA levels and that insulin lowers IGFBP-1 mRNA levels through a PI3K-dependent mechanism that is not sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin. We next asked whether PI3K is required for insulin to inhibit IGFBP-1 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 1 B, insulin inhibits IGFBP-1 promoter activity by ∼50% in HepG2 cells, consistent with results obtained at the mRNA level. LY294002, which directly inhibits the activity of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K, increases IGFBP-1 promoter activity and prevents the inhibitory effect of insulin. Co-transfection with a dominant negative form of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (Δp85) (27Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitmura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), which blocks the activation of PI3K by insulin without disrupting intrinsic p110 activity, also completely disrupts the inhibitory effect of insulin but without altering basal promoter activity. In contrast, treatment with rapamycin lowers basal promoter activity by ∼20% and does not disrupt the inhibitory effect of insulin, consistent with results obtained at the mRNA level. These results indicate that PI3K contributes negatively to the regulation of basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity, and that insulin inhibits promoter activity through a PI3K-dependent mechanism that is not blocked by rapamycin. To determine whether PI3K is sufficient to mediate the effect of insulin on promoter activity, we next performed studies with constitutively active forms of the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3K created by joining the catalytic (p110) and regulatory (p85) subunits through a hinge peptide (p110*) (36Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. William L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) or by adding the Src myristoylation sequence to p110 (Myr-p110), as described previously (37Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 16: 4117-4127Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, expression of increasing amounts of either p110* or Myr-p110 inhibits IGFBP-1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion. There is no additive effect of insulin on promoter activity in cells transfected with either p110* or Myr-p110, indicating that PI3K is sufficient to mediate the full effect of insulin on basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity. Multiple effectors have been implicated in mediating downstream defects of PI3K in addition to p70S6 kinase, including the Ras-Raf-MEKK1-MAPK pathway (36Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J.

We next asked whether PKB/Akt may mediate PI3K-dependent effects of insulin on the IGFBP-1 promoter. Western blotting and in vitro kinase studies demonstrate that PKB/Akt is expressed in HepG2 cells and activated by insulin(Fig. 3 A). This effect of insulin is inhibited by LY294002, but not by rapamycin (Fig. 3 A), consistent with previous studies regarding the activation of PKB/Akt (7Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKB/Akt is sufficient to mediate effects of insulin and/or PI3K on promoter activity, we next performed studies with constitutively active PKB/Akt (Myr-PKB/Akt). As shown in Fig. 3 B, Myr-PKB/Akt inhibits IGFBP-1 promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion. This effect of Myr-PKB/Akt is not additive with the effect of either insulin or p110* (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the effects of insulin and PI3K on IGFBP-1 promoter activity may be mediated through PKB/Akt. In separate experiments, 18-h conditioned medium collected from Myr-PKB/Akt- or p110*-transfected cells had no effect on IGFBP-1 promoter activity (data not shown), indicating that the effects of PKB/Akt and PI3K on promoter activity are due to stimulation of intracellular pathways and not the generation of autocrine factors. We next performed studies with the dominant negative K179 mutant of PKB/Akt (8Songyang Z. Baltimore D. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. Franke T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11345-11350Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Initial dose-response studies showed that increasing amounts of the K179 PKB/Akt progressively block the effects of both insulin and p110* on IGFBP-1 promoter activity (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 C, K179 PKB/Akt disrupts the effects of insulin and PI3K on promoter activity without blocking the ability of Myr-PKB/Akt to signal downstream and inhibit the activity of the IGFBP-1 promoter.In vitro kinase assays and Western blotting reveal that K179 PKB/Akt prevents the activation of HA-tagged wild type PKB/Akt by insulin and p110* without altering protein levels or disrupting the activity of Myr-PKB/Akt (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that insulin and PI3K act upstream of PKB/Akt and activation of PKB/Akt is required to mediate effects of insulin and PI3K on the IGFBP-1 promoter. We next asked whether PI3K and PKB/Akt mediate their effects on promoter activity in a sequence-specific fashion through an IRS. As shown in Table I, the creation of an NheI site just 5′ from IRSA (CAAAACAA) (BP1.Nhe) does not disrupt the inhibitory effect of insulin, p110*, or Myr-PKB/Akt on promoter activity. Mutation (mIRS) or deletion (ΔIRS) of both IRSs completely disrupts the ability of insulin, p110*, and Myr-PKB/Akt to inhibit basal IGFBP-1 promoter activity. Restoring either IRSA (ΔIRS.A) or IRSB (TTATTTTG) (ΔIRS.B) is sufficient to confer the effect of insulin, p110*, and Myr-PKB/Akt on the IGFBP-1 promoter. Mutation of a single bp in either IRSA (ΔIRS.Amut) or IRSB (ΔIRS.Bmut) completely disrupts the effects of insulin, p110*, and Myr-PKB/Akt, demonstrating that these effects are sequence-specific. Placement of highly related IRSs identified in the PEPCK (CAAAACAC; ΔIRS.PEPCK) or apoCIII (CCAAACAT; ΔIRS.apoCIII) genes in the site of IRSA also confers the effect of insulin, p110*, and Myr-PKB/Akt on promoter activity. Placement of IRSA at a different site, 331 bp 5′ to the RNA cap site (ΔIRS.331.A), also fully restores the effects of insulin, p110*, and Myr-PKB/Akt on promoter activity, while insertion of a mutated IRS at this location (ΔIRS.331.Amut) is not effective. Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of insulin, PI3K, and PKB/Akt are all mediated through IRSs in a sequence-specific fashion and that highly related IRSs from other hepatic genes also can mediate the effects of insulin, PI3K, and PKB/Akt on basal promoter activity in liver-derived cells. These results provide the first report demonstrating that PKB/Akt exerts sequence-specific effects on gene expression and mediates the effect of insulin on basal hepatic gene expression through a conserved IRS. Early studies with cycloheximide revealed that insulin inhibits IGFBP-1 and PEPCK transcription through post-translational modification of pre-existing factors (41Ooi G.T. Brown D.R. Suh D.S.

We previously reported that members of the HNF-3/forkhead family of transcription factors interact with IRSs in both the IGFBP-1 and PEPCK promoter (35Unterman T.G. Fareeduddin A.

Additional studies are required to determine whether post-translational modification of HNF-3/forkhead proteins or other specific trans-acting factors mediate effects of insulin on hepatic gene expression downstream from PKB/Akt. Based on these results, we suggest that, in addition to mediating effects of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism in peripheral tissues (5Osawa H. Sutherland C. Robey R.B. Printz R.L. Granner D.K. J.

It remains to be determined whether defects in signaling through the PI3K-PKB/Akt-IRS pathway impair the ability of insulin to regulate hepatic function and contribute to the pathogenesis of some forms of diabetes mellitus.

https://openalex.org/W2071090161,"The putative role of tissue factor (TF) as a receptor involved in signal transduction is indicated by its sequence homology to cytokine receptors (Bazan, J. F. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 6934–6938). Signal transduction induced by binding of FVIIa to cells expressing TF was studied with baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably transfected with TF and with a reporter gene construct encoding a luciferase gene under transcriptional control of tandem cassettes of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) elements and one serum response element (SRE). FVIIa induced a significant luciferase response in cells expressing TF, BHK(+TF), but not in cells without TF. The BHK(+TF) cells responded to the addition of FVIIa in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no response was observed with active site-inhibited FVIIa, which also worked as an antagonist to FVIIa-induced signaling. Activation of the p44/42 MAPK pathway upon binding of FVIIa to TF was demonstrated by suppression of signaling with the specific kinase inhibitor PD98059 and demonstration of a transient p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. No stimulation of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation was observed with catalytically inactive FVIIa derivatives suggesting that the catalytic activity of FVIIa was obligatory for activation of the MAPK pathway. Signal transduction caused by a putative generation of FXa activity was excluded by experiments showing that FVIIa/TF-induced signaling was not quenched by tick anticoagulant protein, just as addition of FXa could not induce phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in BHK(+TF) cells. These results suggest a specific mechanism by which binding of FVIIa to cell surface TF independent of coagulation can modulate cellular functions and possibly play a role in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis as indicated by several recent observations. The putative role of tissue factor (TF) as a receptor involved in signal transduction is indicated by its sequence homology to cytokine receptors (Bazan, J. F. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 6934–6938). Signal transduction induced by binding of FVIIa to cells expressing TF was studied with baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably transfected with TF and with a reporter gene construct encoding a luciferase gene under transcriptional control of tandem cassettes of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) elements and one serum response element (SRE). FVIIa induced a significant luciferase response in cells expressing TF, BHK(+TF), but not in cells without TF. The BHK(+TF) cells responded to the addition of FVIIa in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no response was observed with active site-inhibited FVIIa, which also worked as an antagonist to FVIIa-induced signaling. Activation of the p44/42 MAPK pathway upon binding of FVIIa to TF was demonstrated by suppression of signaling with the specific kinase inhibitor PD98059 and demonstration of a transient p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. No stimulation of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation was observed with catalytically inactive FVIIa derivatives suggesting that the catalytic activity of FVIIa was obligatory for activation of the MAPK pathway. Signal transduction caused by a putative generation of FXa activity was excluded by experiments showing that FVIIa/TF-induced signaling was not quenched by tick anticoagulant protein, just as addition of FXa could not induce phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in BHK(+TF) cells. These results suggest a specific mechanism by which binding of FVIIa to cell surface TF independent of coagulation can modulate cellular functions and possibly play a role in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis as indicated by several recent observations. The extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation is initiated when FVIIa 1The abbreviations used are: FVIIa, activated FVII; TF, tissue factor; FVII, factor VII; FVIIai, FVIIa blocked in the active site with d-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg chloromethyl ketone; FX, factor X; TAP, tick anticoagulant protein; BHK, baby hamster kidney; SRE, serum response element; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum. circulating in plasma binds to the integral membrane protein, tissue factor (TF), exposed to the blood upon injury of the vessel wall. The biology of TF in blood coagulation has been studied extensively (see Refs. 1Camerer E. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar and 2Petersen L.C. Valentin S. Hedner U. Thromb. Res. 1995; 79: 1-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar for reviews). Initiation of coagulation as a result of FVII/TF activity is an extracellular event confined to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane on TF-expressing cells. This was firmly established when it was shown by Paborsky et al. (3Paborsky L.R. Caras I.W. Fisher K.L. Gorman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21911-21916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that truncation of the cytoplasmic C-terminal of TF did not affect its cofactor function in the coagulation process. Still a number of other observations suggested an intracellular function of TF. It was found that TF showed sequence homology to the cytokine receptor superfamily (4Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). All members of this family are involved in signal transduction. Subclass II, which includes the receptor for interleukin 10 and receptors for interferon α/β and γ, shows the highest homology to TF (5Wells J.A. De Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TF (6Harlos K. Martin D.M.A. O'Brian D.P. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Polikarpov I. Miller A. Tuddenham E.G.D. Boys C.W.G. Nature. 1994; 370: 662-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Mueller Y.A. Ultsch M.H. Kelley R.F. De Vos A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10864-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) further substantiated its structural resemblance to the cytokine receptors. This homology might imply a possible functional role for TF as a receptor involved in signal transduction. Studies on a putative intracellular activity induced by FVII/FVIIa have been elusive. Two recent studies (8Rottingen J.-A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Camerer E. Rottingen J.-A. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29034-29042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that FVIIa could induce oscillations in intracellular free calcium in various TF-expressing cells. The authors proposed that this involved activation of phospholipase C; however, they failed to demonstrate directly phosphorylation caused by activation of intracellular kinases. Other studies have provided evidence that serine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of TF can be phosphorylated in TF-transfected cells (10Zinocheck T.F. Roy S. Vehar G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3561-3564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that this domain works as a substrate for protein kinase activity when exposed to cell lysates (11Mody R.S. Carson S.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7869-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Signal transduction was also indicated in studies with cultured human monocytes (12Masuda M. Nakamura S. Murakami S. Komiyama Y. Takahashi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2529-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) showing that addition of FVIIa could induce a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of several polypeptides. Finally very recent results suggested that FVIIa induced alteration in gene expression in human fibroblasts (13Pendurthi U.R. Alok D. Rao L.V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12598-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). With these diverse observations it was of interest to characterize a putative FVIIa-induced signal transduction pathway in further detail. Ligand-induced oligomerization of receptor subunits, which juxtaposes to engage an intracellular signaling machinery, is a common element in signal initiation from cytokine receptors (14Mott H.R. Campbell I.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This may lead to rapid phosphorylation of a subset of intracellular receptor-associated proteins and mitogen-activated (Ser/Thr) kinases (MAPK) (15Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). These kinases are arranged in several parallel signaling pathways, the induction of which may eventually activate the serum response element (SRE) and lead to transcription (17Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Cytokine receptors, which like TF lack intrinsic kinase catalytic domains, may couple ligand binding to tyrosine phosphorylation by using noncovalently associated protein kinases, the Janus kinases, which phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) to induce binding to specific DNA elements and gene transcription. The JAK-STAT pathway may be engaged in cross-talk with the MAPK pathway (18Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that binding of FVIIa to cell surface TF leads to gene transcription as a result of signal transduction via the p44/42 MAPK pathway and activation of SRE and/or STAT elements. The baby hamster kidney cell line BHK-21 tk− ts13 (ATCC CRL 1632) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A human endothelial cell line ECV-304 (ATCC CRL-1998) was cultured in Medium 199 with Earle's salts containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. An epithelial-like canine kidney cell line MDCK-II was kindly provided by Professor Bo van Deurs, University of Copenhagen, Denmark and cultured in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cell lines were grown in T-75 or T-175 flasks and subcultured into 24-well tissue culture plates or 23.8-cm2 single wells. Human recombinant FVII and FVIIa was expressed and purified as described (19Thim L. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A.H. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). FVIIai was obtained by blocking of FVIIa in the active site withd-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg chloromethyl ketone as described previously (20Sørensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgård P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). FVIIa and FVIIai were iodinated by the lactoperoxidase/H2O2 method (21Marchalonis J.J. Biochem. J. 1969; 113: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) and purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. NAP 5 Sephadex G-25 with 0.1 mNH4HCO3, 0.5% (w/v) human serum albumin as the mobile phase. FX and FXa were from Enzyme Research (Lafayette, IN). Recombinant tick anticoagulant protein (rTAP) was kindly provided by Dr. G. P. Vlasuk, Corvas (San Diego, CA). The inhibitor PD98059 and the phosphospecific antibody against p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) and Western blot detection kit were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The complete human TF cDNA was cloned into the mammalian Zem219b expression vector (22Busby S.J. Mulvihill E. Rao D. Kumar A.A. Lioubin P. Heipel M. Sprecher C. Halfpap L. Prunkard D. Gambee J. Foster D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15286-15292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BHK cells were transfected with the TF expression plasmid using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure, essentially as described (23Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning. A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Cells with stably integrated constructs were selected with 1 μmmethotrexate. The KZ136 reporter construct contains an inducible firefly luciferase expression unit and the neomycin resistance gene for stable selection. Luciferase coding sequences are preceded by TATA and transcription start sequences of the human c-fos gene (nucleotides 649–747, GenBankTM accession number K00650). The luciferase promoter consists of 4 STAT binding elements and a SRE, which were synthesized as oligonucleotides. The STAT elements used were those found in the c-fos (M67 version), p21 WAF1, β-casein, and the Fcg RI genes. BHK cells with and without TF at 80% confluence were transfected with KZ136 (40 μg of DNA in a 21-cm2 culture dish), and 24 h later G418 was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. The selective pressure was changed to 0.5 μg/ml after 2 weeks. This was performed as described previously (20Sørensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgård P.-O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in white view plates (Packard, Pangbourne, Berks, UK) for approximately 2 days to obtain 95–100% confluence. Cells were washed and grown for an additional 16–24 h in medium with FCS reduced to 0.2%. The cells were again washed and exposed to FCS-free medium (100 μl/well) containing the test compounds. Following incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, 100 μl of lysis and luciferase assay buffer (Packard) was added. After an additional 30–180 min at room temperature, the luciferase activity was measured in a 1450 MicroBeta Trilux luminescence counter (Wallac, Finland) using 1 s of integration/well. The total amount of p44/42 MAPK or phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK was detected using a PhosphoPlusTM MAPK antibody kit (Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. BHK(+TF) cells were cultured in medium with 0.1% FCS for 24 h prior to the experiment. The experiment was performed by adding media with 0.1% FCS containing the various ligands for the indicated periods of time to the cells. As a positive control of cell signaling cells were treated with 15% FCS for 15 min in each experiment. Cells were lysed in 150 μl of SDS sample buffer (9.2% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 80 mm EDTA, 1.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) supplemented with 3 mm sodium orthovanadate and 24.2 mmdithiothreitol. Lysates were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A biotinylated protein marker was loaded on each gel, and fully phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK was loaded as a positive control in some experiments. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells without detectable amounts of TF were stably transfected with the TF expression vector. These BHK(+TF) cells contained approximately 3 × 106 TF/cell as revealed by a binding assay with 125I-labeled FVIIa and expressed functionally active TF working as a cofactor for FVIIa-mediated activation of FX with an EC50 = 1.0 nm. No significant activation was observed with untransfected BHK cells (results not shown). Subsequently the cells were stably transfected with the KZ136 reporter plasmid encoding a luciferase gene under transcriptional control of tandem cassettes of STAT1 and -3 and STAT4, -5, and -6 and one SRE. Serum contains a multitude of growth factors and activates several of these elements. Addition of 15% serum to starved cells transfected with the KZ136 reporter construct resulted in a 5–8-fold increase in luciferase activity independent of coexpression of TF (results not shown). Fig. 1 A shows that TF-transfected BHK cells, BHK(+TF), with the reporter construct responded to the addition of FVIIa, whereas a significant response was not observed when FVIIa was added to BHK cells without TF. This suggested that FVIIa was involved in TF-dependent signal transduction resulting in gene transcription. The FVIIa-induced response was saturable with an apparent EC50 of approximately 20 nm as indicated by the results shown in Fig. 1 B. The mobilization of Ca2+ stores in TF-expressing cells observed by Rottingen et al. (8Rottingen J.-A. Enden T. Camerer E. Iversen J.-G. Prydz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4650-4660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), as well as transient phosphorylation of intracellular monocyte polypeptides observed by Masuda et al. (12Masuda M. Nakamura S. Murakami S. Komiyama Y. Takahashi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2529-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), appeared to require the participation of catalytically active FVIIa. Hence, we have investigated whether proteolytically active FVIIa was also mandatory for TF signal transduction monitored by the luciferase reporter system. As shown in Fig. 2 the addition of zymogen, one-chain FVII, induced a luciferase response comparable with that of the activated protease, FVIIa. However, since FVII bound to cell surface TF could be activated to FVIIa (24Nakagaki T. Foster D.C. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Rao L.V.M. Williams T. Rapaport S.I. Blood. 1996; 87: 3738-3748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was impossible to exclude a response caused by generation of FVIIa. To circumvent this possibility we used an inactive FVIIa derivative, FVIIai, blocked in the active site by FFRck. In contrast to native FVII this variant did not induce a significant luciferase response. Since FVIIa catalytic activity may thus be required for TF-dependent signaling it was important to rule out that signaling occurred indirectly due to generation of FXa in trace amounts catalyzed by FVIIa bound to cell surface TF. If FXa was generated it might induce signaling through a FXa receptor (26Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3139-3142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nicholson A.C. Nachman R.L.

Ou J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) or further downstream activation of the coagulation cascade ultimately resulting in activation of the thrombin receptor (29Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.C. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar, 30Molloy C.J. Pawlowski J.E. Taylor D. Turner D.S. Weber H. Peluso M. Seiler S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this context it is important to point out that the cells were exposed to a brief EDTA wash to remove possible traces of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors before the addition of FVIIa. Further, Fig. 2 shows that FVIIa/TF-induced signal transduction was not prevented by TAP (tick anticoagulant protein) which specifically blocks the active site in FXa. Moreover, although the addition of FXa was capable of stimulating the luciferase activity, this response was not TF-dependent since a similar response was also seen in BHK cells without TF transfection (results not shown). Additionally, in contrast to the response induced by FVIIa, the response induced by FXa was fully suppressed by TAP (Fig. 2). These data strongly suggested that FVIIa/TF-induced signal transduction did not proceed via FXa or thrombin. Since FVIIai did not induce a luciferase response it was of interest to see whether a FVIIa-induced response could be inhibited by binding of FVIIai to TF. Fig. 3 shows that addition of increasing concentrations of FVIIai quenched the signal induced by 20 nm FVIIa in a manner expected when both proteins compete for the same site(s) on TF. Activation of the luciferase reporter construct might occur via one of the known MAPK pathways. Fig. 4 demonstrates that the FVIIa-induced luciferase response in BHK(+TF) cells was completely inhibited by the specific inhibitor PD98059. This inhibitor binds to the inactive form of MAPKK (MEK) preventing its transformation into an active kinase (31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and further downstream activation is thereby inhibited. The results shown in Fig. 4 thus suggested that stimulation of gene transcription by FVIIa/TF might occur via the MAPK pathway. Using a specific antibody against the phosphorylated Thr202/Tyr204 residues of p44/42 MAPK it was possible to confirm this conclusion. BHK(+TF) cells were grown to 90% confluence and then starved in 0.1% FCS for 24 h. Fig. 5 (panels A and B) shows a Western blot of cell lysates from BHK(+TF) cells exposed to 100 nm FVIIa for 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 40 min (lanes 2–7). Specific antibodies were used to visualize the amount of activated MAPK (panel A) and of total MAPK (panel B). Fig. 5 A demonstrates that the MAP kinase was transiently phosphorylated peaking at approximately 10 min, whereas the amount of total MAPK remained essentially constant (panel B). When a similar experiment was performed with nontransfected BHK cells the MAPK was not activated by FVIIa, but a phosphorylated MAPK response was obtained with 15% serum (results not shown). The results shown in Fig. 5 (panels C and D) were obtained with BHK(+TF) cells exposed to 100 nm FVII, FVIIa, FVIIai, [Ala344]FVII, or FXa for 15 min. A profound activation was seen with FVIIa, less so with FVII, and no significant activation was induced by FVIIai or an inactive FVII variant, [Ala344]FVII, in which the active site serine was changed by site-directed mutagenesis (panel C, lanes 2–5). It was interesting to note that the addition of FXa (panel C, lane 6) also failed to induce phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK. No effect on the total amount of p44/42 MAPK level was observed (panel D). These results strongly suggested that FVIIa activity was needed for this response and since FXa did not induce phosphorylation, a putative FVIIa-mediated generation of FXa could not account for p44/42 MAPK activation with FVIIa. Antibodies against phosphorylated SAPK or p38 MAPK were tested in a similar way in separate experiments; however, none of these pathways appeared to be stimulated by binding of FVIIa to TF (results not shown). FVIIa/TF-induced stimulation of gene transcription was also studied in the human immortalized endothelial cell line, ECV 304. After starvation for 24 h, ECV 304 cells expressed about 25,000 TF molecules per cell as estimated from the 125I-FVIIa binding capacity. Cells exposed to 20 nm FVIIa in fresh equilibrated media were lysed and harvested after 0, 5, and 40 min. Western blots of these lysates are show in Fig. 6, A and B. A clear enhancement of the phosphorylated p44/42 band was observed after exposure to FVIIa for 5 min followed by a decreased response at 40 min. Camerer et al. (1Camerer E. Kolsto A.B. Prydz H. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 1-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) showed that FVIIa induced relatively strong intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells constitutively expressing TF capable of binding human FVIIa. They failed, however, to observe any phosphorylation and could not inhibit the oscillations with known tyrosine kinase inhibitors. It was therefore of interest to see whether it was possible to observe FVIIa/TF-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in these cells. The results shown in Fig. 6, C and D, suggested that this was in fact the case. When approximately 80% confluent cells were exposed to 20 nmFVIIa for various time periods phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was clearly induced but appeared to be delayed compared with BHK(+TF) and ECV 304 cells. The results obtained with these cells confirmed that signaling capability was not confined to the somewhat artificial test system constituted by the transfected BHK cells. Several recent studies have provided circumstantial evidence that FVIIa/TF may be involved in signal transduction and gene transcription. The present work demonstrates that this is the case and that it occurs in a FVIIa- and TF-dependent reaction via the p44/42 MAPK pathway. The results also suggest that the catalytic activity of FVIIa is mandatory for this process and that an indirect signaling pathway via FX activation can be excluded. The target substrate for the FVIIa activity has, however, not been identified, just as it remains to be shown whether TF as such works as a transmembrane signal transducer either alone or in combination with a putative β-subunit. The experiments with the effect of PD98059 on the luciferase response (Fig. 4) showed that this specific inhibitor of the MAPK pathway inhibited the stimulation induced by FVIIa as well as the background activity. This indicates that MAPK phosphorylation is a probable route to FVIIa-induced gene transcription although the existence of parallel pathways or cross-talk between pathways cannot be excluded. Recent studies have suggested a role for TF in angiogenesis (32Zang Y. Deng Y. Luther T. Mueller M. Ziegler R. Waldherr R. Stern D.M. Nawroth P.P. J. Clin.

Our results show that only 32P-PAI-1 in complex with a proteinase binds LRP with high affinity and is efficiently endocytosed by cells, indicating that a high affinity site for LRP is generated on PAI-1 only when in complex with a proteinase. In addition, PAI-1 in complex with different proteinases is shown to cross-compete for LRP binding, demonstrating that the binding site is independent of the proteinase and therefore must reside on the PAI-1 portion of the complex. Finally, mutagenesis of PAI-1 results in loss of LRP binding, confirming that the high affinity binding site is located on PAI-1 and suggesting that the LRP binding site lays within a region of PAI-1 previously shown to contain the heparin binding domain.

PAI-1 is the most efficient in vivo inhibitor known of both tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) (1Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. High K.A. Roberts H.R. Molecular Basis of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 517-543Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions PAI-1 expression is primarily limited to smooth muscle cells and megacaryocytes. However, many cells induce PAI-1 expression in response to cytokines associated with defensive processes such as inflammation (2Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Mimuro J. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 87-115PubMed Google Scholar). The active form of PAI-1 is thought to have its reactive center loop (RCL) fully exposed and thus available for interaction with proteinases (3Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B.

Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the active conformation is unstable and decays to an inactive latent conformation which in turn can be partially reactivated by treatment with denaturants (5Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleaved PAI-1 can be generated either by deacylation of the covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex (3Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. J Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 6Wilczynska M.

Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latent and cleaved forms of PAI-1, the RCL is fully inserted into β-sheet A of the inhibitor, making these forms of PAI-1 inactive against target proteinases (8Mottonen J. Strand A.

Declerck P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Upon complex formation with a target proteinase the RCL is cleaved at the P1-P1′ reactive center bond and the amino-terminal portion of the RCL is inserted into β-sheet A (3Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D.

Although the precise extent of RCL insertion in the stable complex is not known, recent data suggest that the insertion may be less than that of the latent and cleaved forms of PAI-1 (4Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Wilczynska M. Fa M. Karolin J. Ohlsson P.-I. Johansson L.B.-Å. Ny T. Nat. Struct.

The integration of the RCL into β-sheet A is an essential step in the serpin inhibitory mechanism and results in a conversion of β-sheet A from a 5-stranded to a 6-stranded sheet, altering the conformation of PAI-1 at sites distant from the actual point of loop insertion (13Stein P. Chothia C. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This change has been shown to result in the loss of high affinity binding of PAI-1 for vitronectin (14Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The physiological implications of this conformational dependence of the PAI-1-vitronectin interaction are important since they affect the functions of both proteins. Vitronectin influences PAI-1 function by stabilizing its active conformation and converting it to a very efficient inhibitor of thrombin (15Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Preissner K.T. Keijer J.

Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13705-13710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and by blocking the binding of both integrins and the urokinase receptor (uPAR) to vitronectin. This latter interaction results in the inhibition of cell migration on vitronectin-containing matrices (18Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A.

A number of studies have examined the cellular clearance of uPA·PAI-1 complexes and established that cell surface uPA is rapidly endocytosed and degraded when in complex with PAI-1 (21Cubellis M.V.

This clearance was demonstrated to be mediated through high affinity binding to low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (25Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Møller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K.

The exact nature of the high affinity binding of uPA·PAI-1 complexes to LRP is unclear. To date, the most detailed study on the binding of uPA·PAI-1 to LRP was performed by Nykjaer et al. (29Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III R.F. van Zonneveld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who observed that active, latent, or cleaved PAI-1 as well as uPA alone could each individually inhibit the binding of uPA·PAI-1 complexes to LRP. The EC50 values for each of these competitors was approximately 100-fold higher than that obtained with the complex, and based on these results they proposed that the high affinity binding of uPA·PAI-1 complexes to LRP was due to contributions from the two low affinity sites present on the proteinase and on the inhibitor. Consistent with their data, single chain uPA and active PAI-1 have also been reported to bind to purified LRP with Kd values of 45 nm (30Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 35 nm (31Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M.M. van der Meijden P.Z. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13608-13613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), respectively. We recently demonstrated that thrombin in complex with PAI-1 was endocytosed and degraded by cells via the LRP much more efficiently than either thrombin alone or thrombin in complex with other proteinase inhibitors (32Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data led us to suspect that PAI-1 is unique among serpins and contains a specific high affinity binding site for LRP that is not present on thrombin or the other inhibitors examined. Thus in the present study we test the hypothesis that PAI-1 contains a specific high affinity binding site for LRP by analyzing the catabolism of different conformational forms of 32P-PAI-1 by mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and by direct binding to purified LRP. In addition, competitive inhibition assays and mutational analysis examine the relative contributions of both the inhibitor and proteinase in the binding of complexes to LRP. These results indicate that a high affinity binding site for LRP is generated on PAI-1 only upon complex formation with an enzyme, and that this site is not expressed on either the enzyme alone or on the active, latent or elastase cleaved forms of PAI-1. Finally, analysis of a PAI-1 variant with arginine 76 mutated to glutamic acid suggests that this cryptic site in PAI-1 is located in a region previously shown to contain the heparin binding domain.

The coding sequence for the six-residue peptide tag, Ala-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val, which contains the recognition sequence for the specific protein kinase HMK (36Blanar M. Rutter W. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) was introduced at the 5′-end of the mature PAI-1 cDNA by a polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-GAG CAT ATG GCG AGA AGA GCG AGC GTG CAC CAT CCC CCA TCC TAC G-3′, and reverse 5′-GCG GTG GCA GCA GCC AAC TC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was then restricted with NdeI and NsiI, and ligated into the pET3aPAI-1 prokaryotic vector (37Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding region indicated that no additional sequence changes were introduced during the polymerase chain reaction. The construct was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and high levels of recombinant PAI-1 containing the HMK tag at its amino terminus were produced and purified in the fully active form as described previously (38Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that HMK-PAI-1 was eluted from the heparin-Sepharose with 2.5 m NaCl in 0.05 mpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, and the active and latent forms of HMK-PAI-1 were separated on phenyl-Sepharose using a gradient of 0 to 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.6. The PAI-1 mutant, arginine 76 to glutamic acid (R76E), was constructed with the following oligonucleotide 5′-GCC CCC GCC CTC GAG CAT CTG TAC AAG-3′ using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To produce PAI-1 exclusively in the active conformation, the R76E mutant was constructed on a stable PAI-1 background, 14-1b, that has been previously shown to have significantly enhanced functional stability, but to be indistinguishable from wild-type PAI-1 with respect to inhibitory activity, heparin binding, and vitronectin binding (39Berkenpas M., B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its binding to LRP is also indistinguishable from wild-type PAI-1 (compare Figs. 3 and 5 to Figs.8 and 9). The R76E mutant was purified in two steps by hydroxylapatite chromatography (40Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J.

The reaction mixture was brought to 200 μl with water followed by addition of HMK (250 units in 40 μl of water), 20 μl of BSA (1% in water), and 25 μl of [γ-32P]ATP. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 60 min, after which the radiolabeled protein was separated from unreacted nucleotides using a PD-10 column equilibrated with TBS containing 1% boiled BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2. The specific activity of the HMK-PAI-1 labeled by this procedure was typically 1–5 × 106 cpm/μg. Latent 32P-PAI-1 was generated from active 32P-PAI-1 as described by Sancho et al. (41Sancho E. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sample was concentrated by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 55% followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.

The reaction was stopped by the addition of PMSF in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 1 mm. Complexes of32P-PAI-1 with H-uPA and L-uPA are made by incubating the proteins at a 1/1.5 molar ratio (PAI-1/uPA) for 30 min at room temperature in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% boiled BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 followed by the addition of 5 μm APMSF. Complexes of trypsin 32P-PAI-1 were made by incubating the proteins in a 3/1 molar ratio (PAI-1/trypsin) for 30 min at room temperature in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% boiled BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 followed by addition of 5 μm APMSF. Complex formation with125I-labeled trypsin, H-uPA, and L-uPA in complex with wtPAI-1 and PAI-1 mutants was performed using a molar ratio of 2/1 (PAI-1/PA) and 4/1 (PAI-1/trypsin) followed by addition of 5 μm APMSF. Solid phase binding assays were performed by either adding increasing concentrations of radiolabeled ligand to immobilized receptor (direct binding assays) or incubating trace concentrations of radiolabeled ligand with immobilized receptor in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand or inhibitor (competition binding assays) (33Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified LRP or BSA (3 μg/ml) were coated onto microtiter wells and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. Plates were then blocked with TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% boiled BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 16–18 h at 4 °C or 2 h at 37 °C. Direct binding assays were performed by adding increasing concentrations of 32P-PAI-1 conformers or proteinase complexes to immobilized LRP or BSA coated plates in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% boiled BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2. Competition binding assays were performed by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor to wells containing 2.5–5 nm32P-PAI-1 conformers or proteinase complexes in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1% boiled BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Wells were washed three times with TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 5 mm CaCl2. Binding of 32P-PAI-1 to native vitronectin was performed using competition assays. Vitronectin was coated onto microtiter wells (1 μg/ml) for 18 h at 4 °C followed by blocking unoccupied sites with TBS, pH 7.5, containing 3% BSA. The binding of32P-PAI-1 conformers or proteinase complexes were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of corresponding unlabeled PAI-1 conformers or proteinase complexes. For all assays, bound ligand was removed from wells using 0.1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH prior to liquid scintillation analysis. Binding of 32P-PAI-1 conformations and proteinase complexes to BSA-coated plates was subtracted from the values obtained for native vitronectin or LRP.Kd values for the solid phase binding of proteinase·32P-PAI-1 complexes to immobilized LRP were calculated using the following forms of the standard binding equation. Equation 1 was used for a single binding site model y=Cap(L/(Kd+L))Equation 1 where y is the amount of bound ligand Cap is the capacity for binding, and L is the concentration of ligand added. Equation 2 was used for a two binding site model y=Cap(L/(Kd+L))+Cap2(L/(Kd2+L))Equation 2 where y is the amount of bound ligand, Cap and Kd are the capacity and dissociation constant of binding site 1, Cap2 and Kd2 are the capacity and dissociation constant of binding site 2, and L is the concentration of ligand added. Inhibition constants (Ki) for receptor-ligand interactions were calculated using a four-parameter logistic fit (42Ukraincik K. Piknosh W.

LRP-deficient fibroblasts derived from an LRP null mouse embryo (PEA-13) and normal MEF were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), penicillin, and streptomycin. For the endocytosis and degradation assays, cells were plated for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 on 24- or 12-well tissue culture plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin to exclude any effects of serum vitronectin (43Seiffert D.

Prior to addition of radiolabeled ligand, the cells were washed twice in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% BSA and 0.5% casein (assay medium). 32P-PAI-1 conformers or proteinase complexes were added to cell layers in assay medium and incubated for 4–6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Where indicated, RAP (1 μm) was added to the assay 30 min prior to addition of radiolabeled ligands. Quantitation of endocytosis and degradation was done essentially as described (45Stefansson S.

Briefly, following the incubation period, the assay medium was removed from cells and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Cell-mediated degradation was determined by subtracting trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in cell media from trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in media in the absence of cells. Cell layers were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in medium containing trypsin (0.5 mg/ml), proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml), and 0.5 mm EDTA for 2–5 min at 4 °C. The cells were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 2 min, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet was taken to represent the amount of endocytosed ligand. In experiments following the metabolic fate of 32P-PAI-1 in tissue culture, MEF cells were seeded onto 6-well tissue culture plates in the presence of 10% serum and allowed to adhere for 16 h. Cells were washed and incubated with active 32P-PAI-1 (5 nm) in assay medium for 30 min. After washing away unbound 32P-PAI-1, the cells were incubated either with assay medium alone, medium containing RAP (1 μm), medium containing H-uPA (200 nm), or medium containing uPA and RAP (200 nmand 1 μm, respectively). After 1 h the medium was removed, and cell layers were washed and incubated with 1 ml of trypsin, EDTA, and proteinase K, and both cell pellet (internalized ligand) and trypsin/proteinase K soluble supernatant (matrix bound ligand) were recovered and counted. LRP-mediated cellular endocytosis and degradation of 125I-trypsin, in complex with PAI-1 and mutant PAI-1, were prepared as described above for the32P-PAI-1 complexes, and the experiments were performed as described previously (32Stefansson S.

https://openalex.org/W1966947732,"Active transport of proteins into the nucleus is mediated by interaction between the classical nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of the targeted proteins and the NLS receptor (importin) complex. This nuclear transport system is highly regulated and conserved in eukaryotes and is essential for cell survival. Using a fragment of BRCA1 containing the two NLS motifs as a bait for yeast two-hybrid screening, we have isolated four clones, one of which is importin α. Here we characterize one of the other clones identified, BRAP2, which is a novel gene and expressed as a 2-kilobase mRNA in human mammary epithelial cells and some but not all tissues of mice. The isolated full-length cDNA encodes a novel protein containing 600 amino acid residues with pI 6.04. Characteristic motifs of C2H2 zinc fingers and leucine heptad repeats are present in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively. BRAP2 also shares significant homology with a hypothetical protein from yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, especially in the zinc finger region. Antibodies prepared against the C-terminal region of BRAP2 fused to glutathione S-transferase specifically recognize a cellular protein with a molecular size of 68 kDa, consistent with the size of the in vitro translated protein. Cellular BRAP2 is mainly cytoplasmic and binds to the NLS motifs of BRCA1 with similar specificity to that of importin α in both two-hybrid assays in yeast and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays in vitro. Other motifs such as the SV40 large T antigen NLS motif and the bipartite NLS motif found in mitosin are also recognized by BRAP2. Similarly, the yeast homolog of BRAP2 also binds to these NLS motifs in vitro. These results imply that BRAP2 may function as a cytoplasmic retention protein and play a role in regulating transport of nuclear proteins.

The passage of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm occurs through nuclear pores. Small macromolecules can diffuse through the nuclear pores at a rate inversely proportional to their mass. Proteins with molecular masses greater than 40–60 kDa are actively transported through the nuclear pores. To be transported into the nucleus, the protein must either contain a nuclear localization signal or, if not, be bound to another protein that does (1Dingwall C. Sharnick S.V. Laskey R.A.

This process requires at least four different factors acting in two distinct steps. The first step is mediated by importin α (also termed karyopherin α) and importin β (also termed karyopherin β). The α subunit is primarily responsible for NLS 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; BRCA1, the breast cancer 1 gene product; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein. recognition, whereas the β subunit appears to mediate docking to the nuclear pore complex.

The presence of a nuclear localization signal may not be sufficient to direct nuclear import. The target efficiency of NLS motifs can be modified by the presence of multiple NLS motifs within a protein, by modifications of the flanking sequences, and by the accessibility of the NLSs to the import machinery (14Rihs H.P.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). These regulatory mechanisms provide for delicate control over the transport of many nuclear proteins. Failure of such control can have profound effects on the cells (18Küssel P. Frasch M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Loeb J.D.J. Schlensted G.

Several tumor suppressor genes encode nuclear proteins, the correct nuclear localization of which is critical to their function. For example, the tumor suppressor p53 is ordinarily a nuclear protein. However, wild-type p53 has been shown to be mislocated in the cytoplasm of several different cancer cells, whereas mutant p53 remains in the nucleus (20Moll U.M. Riou G. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7262-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Such aberrant localization of wild-type p53 implicates its functional inactivation and reflects its importance in carcinogenesis. Similarly, BRCA1 is also a nuclear protein in normal breast epithelial cells and is mislocated to the cytoplasmic compartment of many advanced breast cancer cells, such as established cell lines, cancer cells from malignant pleural effusions, and some primary breast cancer specimens (21Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal P.A. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C. Bennet L.M. Ding W. Bell R. Rosenthal J. Hussey C. Tran T. McClure M. Frye C. Hattier T. Phelps R.

This suggests that the aberrant subcellular localization of BRCA1 may be responsible for its inactivation in some sporadic breast cancers. Recently, the WT1 tumor suppressor has also been shown to be mislocated in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells (23Silberstein G.B. Horn K.V. Strickland P. Roberts Jr., C.T. Daniel C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8132-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that BRCA1 contains two functional NLS motifs that direct its transport into the nucleus (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In an attempt to elucidate mechanisms that might regulate this process, we used a fragment of BRCA1 containing both nuclear localization signals as a bait for a yeast two-hybrid screen. Several interacting proteins were identified. One of these is importin α, which interacts specifically with the NLS motifs of BRCA1 (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this communication, we characterize BRAP2, which is a cytoplasmic protein that binds to the two functional NLS motifs of BRCA1. These results suggest that BRAP2 may serve as a cytoplasmic retention protein for regulating nuclear targeting. The plasmid pAS-BRCA3.5 (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J.

Science. 1986; 231: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 26Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) fused to BRCA1 (amino acids 1–1142), was used as the “bait” for screening a cDNA library prepared from human B lymphocytes as described previously (27Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). To isolate the full-length BRAP2 cDNA, a 0.8-kb XhoI-digested cDNA fragment derived from the original clone was labeled by random priming and used to screen a fibroblast cDNA library (28Chen P.-L. Ueng Y.-C. Durfee T. Chen K.-C. Yang-Feng T. Lee W.-H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). The longest cDNA clones were subcloned into pBSK (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Sequences were analyzed with the computer program DNASTAR (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Total RNA was extracted by the guanidine isothiocyanate-CsCl method (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). Total RNAs from T47D and HBL100 cells were then used to prepare poly(A)+ RNA using the poly(A) Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI). About 10 μg of total RNA or 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was denatured in 50% formamide, 2.2 m formaldehyde, 1 × MOPS (0.2 m MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.5 m sodium acetate, 0.01 m EDTA), and analyzed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995Google Scholar). The RNA was then transferred to Hybond paper (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), and immobilized by UV cross-linking. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in 40% formamide, 10% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.25 mNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA per ml. The 32P-labeled 0.8-kb BRAP2 cDNA was used to probe the blot at 42 °C for 18 h. The 1.0-kb Gβ-like cDNA was also used as a probe to serve as a control for RNA quality. This gene is ubiquitously expressed at a relative high level in most mouse tissues (31Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.-L. Durfee T. Yang Y. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5620-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). 2S. Li, C.-Y. Ku, A. A. Farmer, Y.-S. Cong, C.-F. Chen, W.-H. Lee, unpublished data. The initial washing was done with 2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and the final washing was done with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion system was used to generate fusion proteins (32Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Several expression plasmids were constructed: GST-BRAP2N (encoding amino acids 12–291); GST-BRAP2C (encoding amino acids 455–570); GST-BRAP2 (encoding amino acids 343–524); GST-importin α (encoding amino acids 12–529); GST-T (containing the SV40 large T antigen NLS: PKKKRKV); GST-mitosin (encoding amino acids 2927–3113); GST-BRCA1Bgl (encoding amino acids 341–748); GST-BRCA1 (encoding amino acids 762–1315). Expression of the fusion proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm in an exponentially growing bacteria culture at 30 °C. After a 3 h incubation, bacteria were collected and lysed as described previously (31Shan B. Zhu X. Chen P.-L. Durfee T. Yang Y. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5620-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose beads. Purified proteins were then used for in vitro binding assays, as described below or to generate antibody, as described previously (28Chen P.-L. Ueng Y.-C. Durfee T. Chen K.-C. Yang-Feng T. Lee W.-H. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). To identify endogenous protein synthesized in vivo, about 5 × 106 HBL100 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h and subsequently lysed in ice-cold lysis 250 buffer. The clarified lysate was incubated with anti-BRAP2C antibody at 4 °C for 1 h, then protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h with constant rotation. After washing extensively with lysis 250 buffer, the beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For double immunoprecipitation, the immunoprecipitates were boiled in 200 μl of dissociation buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and the denatured proteins were diluted with 1 ml of lysis 250 buffer and re-immunoprecipitated with other antibodies. The protocols to separate membrane, nuclear, and cytoplasmic fractions were adapted from those previously published (22Chen Y. Chen C.-F. Riley D.J. Allred D.C. Chen P.-L. Von Hoff D. Osborne C.K. Lee W.-H. Science. 1996; 270: 789-791Crossref Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 33Abrams H.D. Rohrscheider R. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1982; 29: 427-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All three fractions and total cell lysate were then assayed for p84 and BRAP2 by immunoprecipitation subsequently as described above. The same fractions were also incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Blue to detect endogenous GST. For in vitrotranscription and translation of BRCA1, either wild-type BRCA1 containing amino acids 303–701 or the same fragment containing the KLP, KLS, KLN, or KLP + KLS mutations (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pBSKF vector translationally in frame with the flag epitope. The flag epitope in the vector additionally provides the first methionine for the proteins. For in vitro transcription and translation of importin, the PstI fragment of the importin cDNA (encoding amino acids 64–529) was cloned into the PstI site of pBSKF. For in vitro transcription and translation of the yeast BRAP2 homolog, the full-length yeast BRAP2 cDNA was cloned from yeast genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction into pBSK under the control of the T3 promoter. Glutathione-Sepharose beads containing about 20 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins were preincubated with Tris-buffered saline-bovine serum albumin buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 10% bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/ml of protease inhibitors including leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin) for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The beads were then incubated with an equal amount of in vitro translated products in standard lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. Complexes were washed extensively with the standard lysis buffer, boiled in protein loading buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detected by fluorography. Quantitation of binding efficiency was done using the personal densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were transfected using the standard calcium phosphate precipitation protocol with expression vectors for either green fluorescent protein (GFP) alone, GFP fused to full-length BRAP2, or flag-tagged full-length BRAP2. After transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated on coverslips in a tissue culture dish. 24 h after transfection, the cells were either observed directly for fluoresence under a fluoresence microscope or prepared for immunostaining as follows. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. After treating with 0.05% saponin in water for 30 min and washing extensively with PBS, cells were blocked in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. The cells were then incubated with M2 anti-flag monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 h, followed by three washes with PBS. They were then incubated with Texas red-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody (Amersham) for 1 h. After washing extensively in PBS with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, cells were further stained with the DNA specific dye 4, 6-diamidino-2 phenylindole and mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunonon, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). As described previously, BRAP2 is the strongest binding clone isolated by a yeast two-hybrid screen for BRCA1-associated proteins (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To determine the size of the full-length mRNA for BRAP2 and its expression profile in breast epithelial cells and mouse tissues, the 0.8-kb cDNA insert of the original clone was prepared as a probe for RNA hybridization. Initially, poly(A) selected RNA from the breast epithelial cell line, HBL100, and breast cancer cell line, T47D, were used for RNA blotting, and a single 2.0-kb mRNA was detected (Fig. 1 A). This suggests that the isolated cDNA contains only a partial sequence of BRAP2 and that it is expressed in breast epithelial cells. The expression pattern of BRAP2 in adult mouse tissues was also examined by the same method. As shown in Fig. 1 B, BRAP2 is abundantly expressed in testis and detectable in other tissues such as kidney, lung, liver, and brain. This transcript is expressed at very low levels in spleen, thymus, and small intestine. As with the cell lines analyzed, only a single 2.0-kb mRNA was detected in mouse tissues. The biological significance of the varied expression level in different tissues has yet to be explored. To obtain the full-length cDNA, the 0.8-kb cDNA was used as a probe to screen a human fibroblast cDNA library. Two overlapping clones were isolated, which together defined a cDNA of about 2.0-kb, consistent with the mRNA size. The full-length cDNA was sequenced completely, and the longest open reading frame was found to encode a protein of 600 amino acid residues with pI 6.04 (Fig. 2). A termination codon was found prior to the first initiation codon, indicating that the 5′-coding sequence is within the cloned cDNA. A computer-assisted homology search of GenBankTM at the National Center for Biotechnology Information found the predicted protein to be novel. Characteristic motifs of C2H2 zinc fingers and leucine heptad repeats were identified in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively. Interestingly, this protein shares significant homology (23.7% overall similarity) with a hypothetical 585 amino acid protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 3, GenBankTM accession numberP38748). In particular, the zinc finger region (amino acids 317–389) shares 62% homology with the yeast protein (amino acids 301–378). These results suggest that BRAP2 encodes a novel protein that is conserved in yeast.Figure 3Amino acid sequence comparison between human BRAP2 and a hypothetical 67.5-kDa S. cerevisiaeprotein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the cellular protein encoded by BRAP2, we prepared two specific antibodies that recognize either the N-terminal region (amino acids 12–291) or the C-terminal region (amino acids 455–570) of BRAP2. Purified GST fusion proteins encoding these regions served as antigens for immunizing mice. The antibodies generated were used to immunoprecipitate the in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled BRAP2 protein. As shown in Fig. 4, the anti-BRAP2C antibody, but not pre-immune serum, immunoprecipitates the in vitro translated BRAP2 protein (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). When metabolically [35S]methionine-labeled HBL100 cells were used for immunoprecipitation, anti-BRAP2C antibody recognized a 68-kDa protein that was absent in the immunoprecipitates of the same cell lysates brought down by pre-immune serum (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5). Depletion of the antibody by preincubation with GST-BRAP2C fusion protein abolished the specific immunoprecipitation, whereas incubation with GST alone had no effect (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7). Specificity of the antibody for the 68-kDa protein was further confirmed by reimmunoprecipitation of proteins obtained from the first immunoprecipitates following their recovery by denaturation (Fig. 4, lane 8). The cellular BRAP2 detected by anti-BRAP2C antibody migrates as two major bands, the higher form of BRAP2 may represent a posttranslational modification and is marked by an asterisk (Fig. 4, lane 8). Similar results were also obtained with the other polyclonal antibody, anti-BRAP2N (data not shown). The size of the protein translated in vitro from the full-length cDNA is identical to that of the cellular protein immunoprecipitated by the anti-BRAP2C antibody (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 5), suggesting that the 68-kDa protein is the authentic gene product of BRAP2. To explore its potential function, the subcellular localization of BRAP2 was examined by both biochemical fractionation and epitope-tagged expression. HBL100 cells were biochemically fractionated into nuclei, cytoplasm, and membrane components as described previously (33Abrams H.D. Rohrscheider R. Eisenman R.N.

It was found that BRAP2 distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, including membrane and cytosolic fractions, but was not detected in nuclei (Fig. 5 A). p84, a nuclear matrix protein (34Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and glutathione S-transferase, a cytoplasmic protein (35Chen C.-F. Chen Y. Dai K. Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Lee W.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4691-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) served as controls for the fractionation procedure (Fig. 5 A). Since the currently available anti-BRAP2 antibodies are not suitable for immunostaining, an alternative method to confirm the biochemical fractionation results was needed. For this purpose, an expression plasmid containing the full-length BRAP2 cDNA fused in-frame with the flag epitope was constructed under the regulation of the CMV immediate early gene promoter (CEPF-BRAP2), permitting detection of exogenous protein using the anti-flag monoclonal antibody M2 (Kodak). By this method, flag-tagged BRAP2 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm when the plasmid was transfected into Saos2 cells (Fig. 5 B). Cells transfected with the control plasmid containing the flag-epitope without BRAP2 did not show any staining (data not shown). To further confirm BRAP2 localization, the BRAP2 cDNA was fused to a GFP reporter construct. This expression vector also contains amyc-epitope at the 5′ end of GFP to permit specific detection of the exogenous protein. HBL100 cells transfected with the GFP construct (CHPL-GFP) alone or CHPL-GFP-BRAP2 were observed directly under a fluorescence microscope. Expression of GFP was observed both in nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig. 5 C, panel b), whereas expression of GFP-BRAP2 was seen only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 C, panel d). Similar results were also observed when other cell lines such as T47D and Saos2 were used for the transfection (data not shown). When the transfected cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody, and then immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibody, bands of the expected molecular weights were detected, confirming the authenticity of the expressed proteins (Fig. 5 D). Together, these results indicate that BRAP2 is a cytoplasmic protein. The idea that BRAP2 may bind to the NLS motifs of BRCA1 was based on two considerations. First, the BRCA1 bait used for screening contains two functional NLS motifs (a third potential NLS motif was found to be nonfunctional). Second, one of the other interacting clones is importin α (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, either the wild-type BRCA1 cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–1142 (BRCA3.5) or the same region containing one of the three mutated NLS sequences (KLP, KLS, and KLN) as described previously (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), was used in a yeast two-hybrid assay with BRAP2 (Fig. 6 A). Importin α (amino acids 220–529) and one other BRCA1 associated protein, BRAP12, isolated from our original two-hybrid screen (24Chen C.-F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Both BRAP2 and importin α bind to BRCA3.5 or the KLN mutant, but not to the KLP mutant (Fig. 6 B). Previously, we have shown that the NLS deleted in the KLP mutant is required for nuclear transport of BRCA1. The interaction between importin-α and the KLS mutant was decreased about 6-fold compared with the wild-type, whereas BRAP2 interacts well with the KLS mutant (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, BRAP12 binds equally well to the wild-type and all three mutants. To further confirm this interaction, an additional in vitroGST pull-down assay was also performed. The wild-type BRCA1 cDNA encoding amino acids 303–701 or the same region containing the mutated NLS sequences (KLP, KLS, KLN, and KLP + KLS) was translationally fused with the flag epitope in the pBSK vector. These constructs were used for in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The in vitro synthesized BRCA1 proteins were then tested for binding to GST-BRAP2 (amino acids 343–524) or GST-importin α (amino acids 12–529). As shown in Fig. 7, both importin α and BRAP2 bind efficiently to the wild-type and the KLN mutant (Fig. 7 A, lanes 1–3 and 10–12; and Fig. 7 C, lanes 1–3 and 10–12, respectively). However, a significant reduction was observed in binding to both the KLP and the KLS mutants (Fig. 7 A, lanes 4–6 and 7–9; and Fig. 7 C, lanes 4–6 and 7–9, respectively). The KLS mutant seems to interact well with BRAP2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, but has decreased affinity for BRAP2 in the GST pull-down assay. Since different fragments of BRCA1 were used in t"

The vascular wall is constantly exposed to mechanical forces of hemodynamic origin. The tensile stress resulting from transmural pressure activates a contractile mechanism, which confers a mechanistic basis for autoregulation of blood flow (1Harder D.R. Circ.

Recent studies also reveal that mechanical stretch exerts regulatory influences on gene expression and thereby influences vascular tone and remodeling. We recently demonstrated that cyclic stretching of vascular smooth muscle dramatically increases the expression of the gene for the vasorelaxant parathyroid hormone-related peptide (3Noda M. Katoh T.

It is not yet known how mechanical force affects the activity of JNK/SAPK cascade in vascular smooth muscle. While investigating the mechanisms by which stretch induces parathyroid hormone-related peptide gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, we noted that stretch induces a marked increase in the mRNA level of c-jun. This prompted us to examine the possibility that stretching of vascular smooth muscle cells might activate JNK/SAPK. The results in the present study demonstrate that stretch induces potent activation of JNK/SAPK. Further, the present study provides evidence for the involvement of autocrine ATP and purinoceptors in stretch-induced JNK/SAPK activation. Primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells were obtained from an 18-week-old Wistar rat by the explant method (3Noda M. Katoh T. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Kurokawa K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17911-17917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Commonwealth Serum Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) under an atmosphere of 95% air plus 5% CO2. Before each experiment, confluent cells were serum-deprived by incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) for 24 h. RASM cells were subjected to repetitive cycles of mechanical stretch and relaxation with a Flexercell strain unit (FX-2000, Flexcell Corp., McKeesport, PA) as described previously (3Noda M. Katoh T.

The negative pressure to the flexible bottoms was set to provide a maximum elongation of 3, 7, 15, or 20% of the silicone rubber and cells. All experiments were carried out using alternation cycles of 0.5-s stretch and 0.5-s relaxation at a rate of 60 cycles/min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified air. Total RNA, isolated from RASM cells by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method, was separated by formaldehyde, 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Life Science) and hybridized by cDNA probes with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) by the random priming method as described (3Noda M.

The radioactivity of corresponding bands was quantitated by Fuji BAS 2000 bio-image analyzer (Fuji Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The rat c-jun, human junB, and mouse junDcDNAs were obtained from RIKEN Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). The human c-fos and c-myc cDNAs were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). The solid phase JNK assay was performed as described in Ref. 13Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T.

JNK was recovered by incubation of cell lysate with 10 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(5–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The pelleted beads were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli's SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were analyzed as described (30Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4904-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).

The immune complex JNK activity was determined as described (14Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

The immunoprecipitate was incubated with 30 μl of the JNK assay buffer containing 3 μg of GST-c-Jun-(5–89) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated and analyzed as described for the solid phase JNK assay. The immune complex ERK assay was carried out as described (31Lubinus M. Meier K.E. Smith E.A. Gause K.C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9822-9825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 were immunoprecipitated using a mouse monoclonal anti-MAPK antibody that recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 03-6600). The ATP concentration in culture media was measured with the Enlighten ATP assay system using luciferase and luciferin (Promega). Briefly, culture media were collected, mixed with trichloroacetic acid (a final concentration of 0.3%), and kept at 4 °C for 30 min. The media were then neutralized by adding four volumes of 250 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.75), and mixed with the ATP assay reagents. Luminescence was measured with a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The standard curve was generated by using known concentrations of ATP. We first determined whether cyclic stretching (60 cycle/min) of vascular smooth muscle cells causes any change in the expression of immediate-early genes. Northern blot analysis revealed that all of the five immediate-early genes examined (c-jun, junB, jun D, c-fos, and c-myc) showed increased expression in response to mechanical stretch (a maximal elongation of 15%) (Fig. 1 A). Among them, the induction of c-jun mRNA was most prominent with a maximal 6-fold increase by 30 min. The induction of c-jun mRNA increased with increasing strength of stretch and became maximal at 15% stretch (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, stretch hardly changed the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level. We next examined whether stretch activated JNK/SAPK in vascular smooth muscle cells. Stretch caused a rapid and sustained activation of JNK. The JNK activity, measured with a solid phase kinase assay (13Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), was increased significantly over the basal value by 5 min, reached a maximal value of 6-fold at 30 min, and then declined to a lower level of 3-fold at 60 min (Fig. 2 A). Measurement with a immune complex kinase assay using anti-JNK C-terminal antibody gave similar results (data not shown). The JNK activation was dependent on the magnitude of stretch applied to cells (Fig. 2 B). The relationship between the extent of the stretch and the changes in JNK activity was quite similar to that observed for c-jun mRNA expression (Fig. 1 B). The vasoconstrictor AII, at a maximal concentration in terms of its Ca2+ mobilizing activity, also activated JNK, but provided a much weaker stimulus than stretch (Fig. 2 A). We also examined the effect of stretch on the activity of ERK, another MAPK family member. As shown in Fig. 3, the application of stretch stimulated the ERK activity with a maximal stimulation of approximately 2-fold over the basal activity at 30 min. AII induced activation of ERK to a comparable extent as stretch (Fig. 3).Figure 3Time-dependent activation of MAPK/ERK by stretch or angiotensin II. Upper panel, autoradiograms. The arrow indicates the position of myelin basic protein (MBP). Lower panel, quantitation of the MAPK/ERK activities. Cells were subjected to stretch (a maximal elongation of 15%) or angiotensin II (A II) (10−8m) stimulation for 5 to 60 min. The MAPK/ERK activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The MAPK/ERK activities (means of duplicate determinations) were expressed relative to the activity in non-stretched cells, which was given an arbitrary value of 1. Two other experiments showed similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined how vascular smooth muscle cells convert mechanical stimuli into signals for activating JNK. Knowing that stretch causes activation of stretch-activated (SA) cation channels in a variety of cell types (32Yang X.C. Sachs F. Science. 1989; 243: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 33Ubl J. Murer H. Kolb H. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we sought to determine if SA cation channel activation is involved in stretch-induced JNK/SAPK activation, by examining the effect of Gd3+, a specific inhibitor of SA cation channel function (34Naruse K. Sokabe H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1037-C1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Sigurdson W. Ruknudin A. Sachs F Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1110-H1115PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, Gd3+ failed to suppress stretch-induced activation of JNK/SAPK in vascular smooth muscle cells. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ was also without any effect on stretch-induced activation of JNK/SAPK (Fig. 4). Thus, SA cation channels or any other Ca2+ channels are not likely to be involved in stretch-induced JNK activation. The possible involvement of autocrine factors in stretch-induced JNK activation was next examined. Conditioned media from cells subjected to stretch for varied time periods were collected and applied to non-stretched cells. The conditioned media from stretched cells did cause the activation of JNK/SAPK (Fig. 5). In this assay, the JNK/SAPK activating “factor” in conditioned media was detectable by 2 min, and accumulated with time to reach a plateau value by 10 min. Previous studies have shown that imposing flow on vascular endothelial cells (36Bodin P. Bailey D. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1203-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and mechanical deformation of the cell membrane in mast cells (37Osipchuk Y. Cahalan M. Nature. 1992; 359: 241-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and in mammary epithelial cells (38Enomoto K. Furuya K. Yamagishi S. Oka T. Maeno T Pflügers Arch. 1994; 427: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) induces release of ATP. It is also known that vascular smooth muscle cells express cell surface receptors for ATP and its hydrolyzed product, adenosine (39Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Circ. Res. 1986; 58: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that ATP might be the autocrine factor involved in stretch-induced JNK activation. The application of stretch induced a rapid and sustained rise in the ATP concentration in the extracellular medium (Fig. 6 A). The ATP concentration in the medium reached a maximal level of 50-fold increase over the basal value by 5 min, and remained elevated over the basal value for at least 30 min. When the magnitude of stretch was increased, the ATP concentration in the medium also increased (Fig. 6 B), like the activity of JNK and c-jun mRNA expression (Figs.1 B and 2 B). To determine whether or not released ATP is indeed involved in stretch-induced activation of JNK, we examined the effects of agents that reduce the ATP concentration in media. Apyrase is a well known ATP- and ADP-hydrolyzing enzyme. Hexokinase catalyzes phosphorylation of glucose to generate glucose 6-phosphate at the expense of ATP (51Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). The addition of apyrase or hexokinase nearly completely inhibited stretch-induced rise of the ATP concentration in the medium (Fig. 7 A). Both apyrase and hexokinase also substantially, but not completely, inhibited stretch-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 7 B). Apyrase or hexokinase were without inhibitory effects on basal JNK activity (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of hexokinase on stretch-induced JNK activation was likely not due to depletion of medium glucose, because increasing glucose concentration up to 20 mm had no effect on the ability of hexokinase to inhibit stretch-induced JNK activation (data not shown). Furthermore, apyrase, when added to the conditioned medium harvested from stretched cells, inhibited its JNK-stimulating activity (Fig. 8). These observations support the notion that ATP acts as a mediator of stretch-induced JNK activation.Figure 7Inhibition of stretch-induced ATP release and JNK/SAPK activation by ATP-trapping agents.

The A1subtype-selective P1 receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) (46Bruns R.F. Fergus J.H. Badger E.W. Bristol J.A. Santay L.A. Hartman J.D. Hays S.J. Huang C.C.

Sci. 1993; 14: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar), also inhibited JNK activation (Fig. 9 A). These results suggest that both RB-2-sensitive P2 and DPCPX-sensitive P1 receptors are involved in stretch-induced JNK activation. By contrast, these antagonists were without any effect on AII-induced JNK activation (data not shown). Moreover, RB-2 and DPCPX both inhibited the JNK-stimulating effect of the conditioned medium harvested from stretched cells (Fig. 9 B). We examined the ability of exogenous purinoceptor agonists to activate JNK in vascular smooth muscle cells. ATP, ADP, adenosine, and UTP induced a time-dependent activation of JNK (Fig. 9 C). ATP, ADP, and adenosine each activated JNK with similar dose-response relationships (Fig. 9 D). UTP was the most potent in activating JNK. Thus, ATP, adenosine, and presumably ADP appear to mediate stretch-induced JNK activation. The present study demonstrates for the first time that mechanical stress causes potent activation of JNK/SAPK in vascular smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2). Stretch also induces modest activation of MAPK/ERK (Fig. 3). Although stretch and the receptor agonist AII are similar in that either stimulus can activate both JNK/SAPK and MAPK/ERK in vascular smooth muscle cells, stretch activates JNK/SAPK much more strongly than AII (Figs. 2 and 3). Stretch-induced JNK activation is transient in the continued presence of stretch stimuli. This transient nature might be explained by possible up-regulation by stretch of JNK-inactivating phosphatase such as MKP-1, possible inactivation of JNK kinase by phosphorylation, or other mechanisms. The JNK/SAPK pathway is a recently identified downstream mediator linking extracellular stimuli to nuclear events (27Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar, 48Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). c-Jun, ATF-2, and Elk1 are well characterized substrates for JNK/SAPK, and JNK/SAPK-mediated phosphorylation activates these transcription factors (13Hibi M.

These transcription factors appear to be essential for transcriptionally activating a variety of genes in response to external stimuli. Thus, JNK/SAPK likely acts as a mediator for stretch-induced regulation of gene expression. The activation of JNK/SAPK is induced by a variety of bioactive substances including growth factors, cytokines, and G protein-coupled receptor agonists. Accordingly, we pursued the possibility that a factor released from vascular smooth muscle cells upon stretching might act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to activate JNK/SAPK. The present study demonstrates that the conditioned medium harvested from stretched cells contains a factor that activates JNK/SAPK (Fig. 5) and that ATP is released in large quantities from cells upon stretching (Fig. 6). The results shown in the present study imply that ATP is an autocrine/paracrine factor to activate JNK/SAPK. First, when released ATP was scavenged by the addition of the ATP-trapping agents, apyrase and hexokinase, stretch-induced JNK/SAPK activation was considerably suppressed (Fig. 7, A and B). Second, the P2 receptor antagonist RB-2 inhibited stretch-induced JNK/SAPK activation (Fig. 9 A). The partial inhibition of stretch-induced JNK activation by RB-2 might be explained by its weak antagonistic potency and/or the partial contribution of P2receptor (see below). Third, the JNK-stimulating effect of the conditioned medium from stretched cells was suppressed by apyrase treatment or the addition of RB-2 (Figs. 8 and 9 B). Fourth, the addition of exogenous ATP caused activation of JNK/SAPK in vascular smooth muscle cells (Fig. 9 C). However, the magnitude of JNK/SAPK activation by exposure to the conditioned medium from stretched cells was considerably smaller that induced by stretch (compare Figs. 2 and 5). These differences might imply that stretch activates JNK/SAPK through both autocrine-dependent and autocrine-independent mechanisms. This notion is supported by the findings showing that nearly complete inhibition of stretch-induced increase in extracellular ATP by apyrase or hexokinase could not totally abolish stretch-induced JNK activation (Fig. 7, A and B). However, the incomplete inhibition of stretch-induced JNK activation by hexokinase and apyrase could also be because ADP, AMP, and adenosine in the presence of hexokinase, and AMP and adenosine in the presence of apyrase still could activate purinoceptors in vascular smooth muscle cells (see below) (Fig. 9, C and D). Exogenous ATP at the concentration slightly higher than the maximal medium concentration of ATP in stretched cells gives approximately 2–3-fold increase in the JNK activity (Fig. 9 D), while stretch usually causes more than 5-fold increase in the JNK activity. The difference may suggest the contribution of the hydrolyzed products of ATP, i.e. ADP, AMP, and adenosine, besides ATP, as mentioned above. Second, it is known that extracellular nucleotides are subjected to active hydrolysis by ectonucleotidases existing on the plasma membrane (49Pearson J.D. Gordon J.L. Nature. 1979; 281: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 50Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration of ATP in the medium might have been rapidly reduced by avid hydrolysis, although much attention was paid for allowing for quick collection and transfer of conditioned media. It is also possible that the ATP concentration in the bulk media may be lower than that in the vicinity of ATP transporters on the plasma membrane where purinoceptors also exist. In airway epithelial cells, it was suggested that an ATP transporter and a P2 receptor were present in close proximity on the plasma membrane (51Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 1063-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that medium concentrations of autocrine peptides endothelin-1 and angiotensin II in stretched cardiomyocyte cultures are lower than those of exogenous peptides required for activation of MAPK (11Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Mizuno T. Takano H. Hiroi Y. Ueki K. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Nagai R. Yazaki Y. J. Clin.

The A1 subtype-selective P1 receptor antagonist DPCPX inhibited stretch-induced activation of JNK/SAPK (Fig. 9 A). Further, the addition of exogenous adenosine caused activation of JNK/SAPK (Fig. 9 C). Consistent with this, the addition of DPCPX to the conditioned medium inhibited its JNK-stimulating effect (Fig. 9 B), like the addition of apyrase (Fig. 8). These findings, taken together, show that adenosine as well as ATP are involved in stretch-induced activation of JNK/SAPK through P1 and P2 receptors, respectively. Adenosine may be either released directly from the inside of cells, or derived from hydrolysis of released ATP by ectonucleotidases, or both (49Pearson J.D. Gordon J.L. Nature. 1979; 281: 384-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It is of note that UTP was a more potent agonist to induce JNK activation (Fig. 9 D). Rat vascular smooth muscle cells employed in the present study express at least two subtypes (P2Y2 (=P2U) and P2Y6) (53Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Dubyak G.R. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A.

It is an interesting possibility that uracil nucleotides also contribute to stretch-induced JNK activation.

Caligiuri, unpublished results. suggesting that a similar production of IL-12 during initial proliferation of EBV+ B cell in patients may affect the reactivity of their immune cells against the infected cells. Although any extrapolation to the in vivo situation from data observed with established cell lines should be taken with caution, it is tempting to speculate that, in healthy individuals, IL-12-producing EBV+ cells would be easily rejected by immune response and thus only cells that have lost the ability to produce IL-12 would be able to give rise to Burkitt's lymphomas; in immunodeficient AIDS patients, these protective mechanisms would be inefficient and their IL-12-producing EBV-transformed cells could give rise to lymphomas in a relatively high proportion of patients. The key role of IL-12 in inflammation and in the immune response, and the importance of this cytokine in anti-tumor resistance, have raised considerable interest in the mechanisms of IL-12 gene transcription. We (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) have shown previously that, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and IFN-γ-treated human monocytes, the expression of IL-12 p40 and p35 is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level. In a luciferase reporter gene construct, a 3300-bp genomic DNA fragment including the upstream sequences of the human p40 gene largely recapitulates its cell type specificity and transcriptional regulation (13Ma X.

The cis elements in the p40 promoter region responsible for the inducible activation of the genes have been studied extensively in phagocytic cells, but no information is available for the elements controlling the constitutive expression of the gene in EBV+BCL. We have previously localized a DNA sequence spanning nucleotides −292 to −196 (relative to the transcription start site) responsible for induced promoter activity (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The core element at position −212 binds a series of IFN-γ- and LPS-induced nuclear proteins (termed the F1 complex) including Ets-2, IFN-regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), c-Rel, and Ets-related factors (14Ma X.

The C/EBP element exhibits functional synergy with the upstream NFκB site, although no physical interactions between C/EBP and Rel proteins were observed (16Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H.M. Hsu S.

Together, these results suggest that in myeloid cells a complex interplay exists between multiple inducible transcription factors contributing to the regulation of IL-12 p40 gene activation. In this study, we focused upon the role of cis-acting regulatory elements in the transcriptional activation of the human IL-12 p40 gene in EBV+ BCL. In these cells, we showed constitutive binding of multiple transcription factors to the NFκB and Ets sites of the p40 promoter. We found that cotransfection of NFκB and Ets-2 transcription factors strongly and specifically synergized in the induction of p40 promoter activity in EBV+ BCL as well as in both inducible IL-12-producing macrophage cell lines and IL-12-nonproducing EBV− and T cell lines. Human EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line (EBV+), RPMI-8866, PA682BM-2, and AS283A (9Benjamin D. Sharma V. Kubin M. Klein J.L. Sartori A. Holliday J. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1626-1637PubMed Google Scholar), EBV− Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BJAB (a gift from E. Kieff, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), T cell line Jurkat, and murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were all grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). All tissue culture media and supplements were endotoxin-free. All polyclonal antibodies used in supershift experiments were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant murine (rmIFN-γ) was a gift from Dr. G. Garotta (Human Genome Sciences, Inc., Rockville, MD). Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3, ascites) was produced from cells obtained from America Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). LPS from Escherichia coli and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma. Untreated RPMI-8866 cells, TPA-treated BJAB cells (50 ng/ml, 4 h), and TPA- and anti-CD3-treated Jurkat cells (OKT3, ascites 1:1000, 4 h) were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Isolation of nuclei and in vitro transcription in the presence of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/nmol, DuPont) were performed as described (17Weintraub H. Groudine M. Science. 1976; 93: 848-883Crossref Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 18Groudine M. Peretz M. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). A 3300-bp fragment of the human IL-12 p40 promoter was cloned into the luciferase reporter construct pXP2 (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) at the PstI site. All deletion mutant constructs were generated by PCR and fully sequenced for verification as described previously (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). NFκB expression vectors were a gift from Dr. K. M. Murphy (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The CMV-based murine Ets-2 expression vector was a gift from Dr. R. Maki. The TNF-α promoter was obtained from a TNF cosmid library (ATCC, catalog no. 57590) by PCR amplification of a 1294-bp fragment. The sequence of the 5′ primer used is 5′-TCTCTGAAATGCTGTCTGCTTGT-3′ and the 3′ primer used is 5′-CCTCTTAGCTGGTCCTCTGC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pXP2 expression vector. All plasmids were banded twice in cesium chloride and verified by restriction mapping. DNA transfection experiments were performed by electroporation as described (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.4 ml of the cell suspension was mixed with 60 μg of DNA (10 μg of p40-luc/3.3 kb plus 3 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (transfection efficiency control) and 47 μg of BS/KSII+) and electroporated in 0.45-cm electroporation cuvettes (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 960 microfarads and 250 V for BJAB and Jurkat cells, 300 V for RPMI-8866 cells, and 350 V for RAW264.7 cells. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Lysates were used for both luciferase and β-galactosidase assay (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Where indicated, RAW264.7 cells were treated with 1.2% Me2SO for 24 h and with rmIFN-γ (1000 units/ml) for 8 h, stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 8 h, and harvested. For cotransfection studies, pRSV-β-galactosidase was used instead of pCMV-β-galactosidase, and the molar ratio between the reporter plasmid (luciferase p40 promoter constructs) and expression vector was 1:2.5 for Rel family members and 1:1 for the Ets-2. Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing to the measured β-galactosidase value. Nuclear extracts were isolated from RPMI-8866 as described (19Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-194PubMed Google Scholar) and from RAW264.7 also described (20Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). EMSA and supershift were performed as described previously (14Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides −292/−196, −243/−196, and −222/−196 have been described (14Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide −135/−99 used as a probe has the following sequence (plus strand): 5′-AAACAAAAAAGGAACTTCTTGAAATTCCCCCAGAAGG-3′ and encompasses the potential PU.1 and NFκB sites (underlined) of the human IL-12 p40 promoter found, respectively, in positions −143 and −132 of the murine IL-12 p40 promoter (15Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide −135/−99 m differs from oligonucleotide −135/−99 by a CC → GG transversion at position −108 and −107. Oligonucleotide −123/−99 has the following sequence: 5′-AACTTCTTGAAATTCCCCCAGAAGG-3′. An IRF-1 repeated consensus binding sequence was used as nonspecific oligonucleotide in competition assays (21Fujita T. Sakakibara J. Sudo Y. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Taniguchi T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3397-3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). NFκB oligonucleotide is a high affinity binding site for NFκB/c-Rel homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes (22Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). Based on our previous observation that EBV+ BCL constitutively produce IL-12 protein (1Kobayashi M. Fitz L. Ryan M. Hewick R.M. Clark S.C. Chan S. Loudon R. Sherman F. Perussia B. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 827-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar, 6D'Andrea A. Rengaraju M. Valiante N.M. Chehimi J. Kubin M. Aste-Amezaga M. Chan S.H. Kobayashi M. Young D. Nickbarg E. Chizzonite R. Wolf S.F. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1387-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 9Benjamin D. Sharma V. Kubin M. Klein J.L. Sartori A. Holliday J. Trinchieri G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1626-1637PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether the p40 and p35 genes were also constitutively transcribed in nuclear run-on assays performed with unstimulated EBV+ BCL (Fig. 1 A). Nascent p40 transcripts were constitutively present in RPMI-8866 (Fig. 1 A) and in all other EBV+ BCL tested (PA682BM-2 and AS283A), and expression was not further enhanced by TPA treatment (data not shown). Jurkat T cells and BJAB EBV− BCL, which do not express p40 mRNA or protein, were used as negative controls (Fig. 1 A). Transcription of the IL-12 p40 gene, unlike that of the TNF-α gene, was not detectable in unstimulated cells or in the EBV− BCL or T cell lines stimulated with TPA alone or TPA in combination with α-CD3, respectively. However, TNF-α transcription was shown to be further up-regulated by TPA treatment of all cells examined. Nascent p35 transcripts were present in all cell lines and under all conditions tested. Thus, the IL-12 p40 gene appears to be constitutively transcribed in EBV+ but not in EBV− BCL or T cells. We then analyzed the IL-12 p40 promoter activity in the same EBV+, EBV− and T cell lines using a full-length promoter construct linked to a luciferase reporter gene (−3300/+108) in a transient transfection assay. The promoter construct was active in EBV+ BCL, but poorly or not active at all in EBV− and T cell lines (Fig. 1 B), confirming that the construct contains adequate sequence information for appropriate cell type-specific expression (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). To delineate the cis-acting elements regulating the constitutive IL-12 p40 expression in EBV+ B cells, we first examined the activity of the full-length promoter (−3300/+108) and a series of nested 5′ deletion constructs (Fig. 2) in EBV+ BCL. Luciferase activity of the −3300/+108 construct was 65-fold that of the parental, promoterless pXP2 control vector (Fig. 3). Promoter activity was progressively decreased when the full-length promoter was deleted from the 5′ end at position −471 (32-fold over pXP2 control vector), −292 (38-fold), −265 (28-fold), and −243 (29-fold). Surprisingly, the activity of −222 bp plasmid was only slightly reduced compared with the full-length promoter. An additional 100-bp deletion to −position 122 abolished half of the full-length promoter activity. Truncation of the promoter to −28 bp (containing the TATA box) markedly diminished the constitutive promoter expression to a level only 10-fold greater than the promoterless control plasmid pXP2. These data suggest that the region between nucleotide positions −222 and −28 is most critical for constitutive promoter activity in the EBV+ BCL.Figure 3Deletion analysis of the human IL-12 p40 promoter in EBV+ BCL. Luciferase activity, in untreated EBV+ BCL RPMI-8866, induced by transient transfection of the indicated constructs, was measured in the cell lysate, and values were normalized against the internal control (CMV-β-galactoside construct). Activity is expressed as -fold above the background of cells transfected with the promoterless control plasmid pXP2. Data here are mean (± S.E.) of four independent assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since the −222/+108 promoter region was shown to exhibit significant promoter activity, we analyzed the activity of this construct in further detail. To evaluate the functional role of the putative NFκB half-site at −117 and the Ets site at −212, we prepared a series of additional promoters with defined mutations. The −222NFκBm construct has a substitution of the core −109CC−108 with−109GG−108. The −222ets-2Δ construct has a 5-bp deletion that eliminates the−211TTTCC−207 sequence (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The same mutations were made in the context of the −3300/+108 full-length promoter and were designated respectively, −3300NFκBm and −3300ets-2Δ. Analysis of the activity of these constructs in transiently transfected EBV+ BCL (RPMI-8866) (Fig. 4 A) revealed a dramatic decrease in the luciferase activity of promoter constructs mutated at the NFκB site (−3300NFκBm and −222NFκBm) (80–88% less than their corresponding wild-type constructs), but only a 50% decrease for the Ets-2 deletion mutants. In contrast, analysis of these constructs in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (Fig. 4 B) demonstrated that the mutations of both the NFκB and Ets sites almost completely abolished the inducibility of the p40 promoter by IFN-γ and LPS (reduced to 12–20% of the −3300/+108 wild-type promoter activity), the latter result being consistent with our previous finding that the Ets site plays an important role in this system (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the B cells may use the same ciselements and transcription factors as do macrophages, but the relative contribution of each factor may vary. To establish the relationship between promoter activity and specific DNA-protein interactions at the NFκB site (−117/−107) in EBV+ BCL, EMSA were performed using a 37-mer oligonucleotide probe (−135/−99) encompassing the putative NFκB and PU.1 sites. Three DNA-protein complexes were observed via EMSA (Fig. 5 A); two of them indicate specific binding to nuclear proteins since they were competed by an excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the probe −135/−99, but not by an unrelated (NS) oligonucleotide competitor. Competition of the slower mobility complex was observed using a 25-mer oligo (−123/−99) containing the NFκB site, but not the putative upstream PU.1 site located at −127 of the promoter. Use of an oligonucleotide with recognized binding activity for members of the NFκB/Rel family (22Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar) as competitor resulted in complete disappearance of the top band, indicating that this DNA-protein complex likely involves members of the NFκB/Rel family. Further characterization of the NFκB protein members bound to the −135 to −99 promoter region (Fig. 5 B) revealed a slowly migrating supershifted complex in the presence of NFκB anti-p50 and anti-c-Rel antibodies. The appearance of this supershifted band was accompanied by a partial disappearance of the upper complex. Thus, p50 and c-Rel-containing complexes constitutively bind to a transcriptionally active 6B site in the IL-12 p40 gene in EBV+ BCL. Anti-PU.1 antibody decreased the intensity of the faster-migrating band, suggesting the presence of PU.1 in this complex. No supershifted bands were detected with anti-c-Fos used as a control. We then examined the ability of nuclear extract from IFN-γ- and LPS- treated RAW264.7 macrophages to bind the probe −135/−99. In unstimulated cells, a series of three rapidly migrating complexes were observed (group III, Fig. 6A). However, only the slowest migrating complex of the three was consistently seen, suggesting that the faster migrating complexes may be proteolytic products of the upper complex. IFN-γ treatment did not yield any additional binding, in contrast to an earlier report that IFN-γ treatment of the murine macrophage cell line J774 resulted in augmented NFκB binding to this region of the murine p40 promoter (15Murphy T.L. Cleveland M.G. Kulesza P. Magram J. Murphy K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS, however, induced two major complexes (I and II). Pretreatment with IFN-γ did not affect the binding activity of these two complexes. Competitive EMSA to assess the specificity of the three complexes showed that each of the three groups of complexes was abolished specifically by an excess of nonradiolabeled oligomer −135/−99, but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide (NS). The smaller oligonucleotide −123/−99 and an NFκB consensus oligonucleotide completely blocked the formation of complexes I and II (Fig. 6 B), but had little effect on complex III. An anti-p50 antibody inhibited the formation of complexes I and II (Fig. 6 C). Neither two distinct antibodies against the amino terminus (N) or the carboxyl terminus (C) of RelA (p65), nor an anti-c-Rel antibody affected the formation of the doublet band, although the combination of an anti-RelA and anti-c-Rel partially reduced the formation of complex I. Therefore, complex I appears to include mixed heterodimers p50/c-Rel and p50/RelA (p65) as well as c-Rel/RelA, while complex II is composed predominantly of p50. The faster-migrating complex (complex III) was decreased following IFN-γ and LPS stimulation (Fig. 6 A) and was competed by an anti-PU.1 antibody (Fig. 6 C), thus confirming the presence of PU.1 in complex III. We previously demonstrated the functional predominance of the Ets site at −212/−207 in macrophage cells and the characteristics of the nuclear complexes formed around this site in response to stimulation (13Ma X.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To extend this analysis to EBV+ BCL with respect to differences in the relative importance of the Ets site between EBV+ and macrophage cells, we performed EMSAs using the same probe (spanning −292 to −196) as in our previous studies (14Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract from IFN-γ- and LPS-stimulated macrophage (RAW264.7) cells formed the previously characterized complex F1, whereas extract from EBV+ BCL (RPMI-8866) formed a slightly faster migrating complex, designated F1a. F1a was efficiently competed by a 50-fold molar excess of the −292/−196 DNA (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, F1a was supershifted by an anti-Ets-2 and an anti-c-Rel affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (Fig. 7 B), as observed previously for the F1 complex (14Ma X. Neurath M. Gri G. Trinchieri G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, formation of the F1a complex was blocked by an anti-IRF-2 antibody and not, as in the case of the F1 complex, by an anti-IRF-1. These data suggest that Ets-2, c-Rel, and IRF-2, but not IRF-1, may be constituents of the F1a complex in EBV+ BCL. To assess the ability of several NFκB proteins and the Ets-2 protein to activate the p40 promoter, we transfected EBV+ BCL with the luciferase-based p40 reporter construct (−3300/+108) together with an expression vector for either NFκB RelA (p65), NFκB c-Rel, NFκB p50, or Ets-2. No transactivation of the −3300/+108 construct was detected by c-Rel, RelA, and p50, alone or any combination. Ets-2 alone was able to activate the promoter 4-fold, similarly to its actions in macrophages (13Ma X. Chow J.M. Gri G. Carra G. Gerosa F. Wolf S.F. Dzialo R. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Interestingly, co-expression of Ets-2 and c-Rel, but not RelA or p50, synergistically enhanced the p40 promoter activity (Fig. 8 A). The decreased activity seen in Ets-2 and p50 cotransfection may have been due to the formation of the p50/p50 homodimer, which acts as a repressor, and may be a default method of regulation, as we have obser"

The protein-coding region is highly conserved compared with its L. major homologue, while 5′- and 3′-flanking DNA sequences display considerable divergence. The encoded mRNA has an unusually long 5′-leader sequence typical for RNAs, which are translated preferentially under heat stress. The gene product, a 100-kDa heat shock protein, Hsp100, becomes abundant only during sustained heat stress, but not under common chemical stresses. Hsp100 associates into trimeric complexes and is found mostly in a cytoplasmic, possibly membrane-associated, localization as determined by immune electron microscopy. Hsp100 shows immediate early expression kinetics during axenic amastigote development. In its absence, expression of at least one amastigote stage-specific protein family is impaired.

Protozoa of the genus Leishmania parasitize the tissue macrophages of their mammalian hosts, where they survive and proliferate inside the phagosome. This intracellular proliferation is the key for their survival inside the mammalian host. Leishmania parasites encounter heat stress as a regular feature of their digenic life cycle during the transmission of the promastigote stage from poikilothermic sandfly vectors into mammalia. The elevated temperatures they encounter within a mammalian host serve as a key trigger for the development from the promastigote into the intracellular stage, the amastigote (1Zilberstein D. Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In someLeishmania species, elevated temperatures alone can induce stage development (2Pan A.A. Duboise S.M. Eperon S. Rivas L. Hodgkinson V. Traub-Cseko Y. McMahon-Pratt D. J. Eukaryotic Microbiol. 1993; 40: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Bates P.A. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 143-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, in Leishmania donovani, a heat shock alone is insufficient and must be complemented by a shift of pH into the acidic range similar to the conditions inside the phagosomes of mammalian macrophages to induce cellular differentiation toward the amastigote (1Zilberstein D. Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A temperature upshift similar to the one encountered during host invasion can indeed induce heat shock protein synthesis, and it has been proposed that such elevated Hsp synthesis may protect the parasite against the adverse effects of elevated temperature (4Hunter K.W. Cook C.L. Hayunga E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 755-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5van der Ploeg L.H.T. Giannini S.H. Cantor C.R. Science. 1985; 228: 1443-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses have shown, however, that the transient induction of Hsp synthesis does not result in significant changes of most of the Hsp's steady state concentrations. Moreover, the major Hsps such as Hsp70 and Hsp83 (Hsp90) are highly abundant in Leishmaniapromastigotes under all culture conditions and thus not likely to play amastigote stage-specific roles during infection (6Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A newly identified heat shock protein, Hsp100, member of the ClpB family of heat shock proteins (7Gottesmann S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalrymple B. Kuramitsu H. Shiroza T. Foster T. Clark W.P. Ross B. Squires C.L. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3513-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), is, in contrast, barely detectable in unstressed promastigotes of several Leishmania species, but its concentration increases severalfold during a heat stress (8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is also highly abundant in Leishmania major amastigotes isolated from infected lymph node tissue. Replacement of the L. major clpB alleles that encode Hsp100 dramatically reduces the virulence in L. major (9Hübel A. Krobitsch S. Hörauf A. Clos J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5987-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We are interested in the L. donovani clpB gene and its product, Hsp100, mainly because expression of Hsp100 is more tightly regulated in L. donovani than in L. major (8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and because L. donovani promastigotes readily differentiate into axenic amastigotes in vitro, which allows to study the role of Hsp100 in this process. In this article, we report the cloning and sequence analysis of the L. donovani clpB gene. We show the expression kinetics and the intracellular organization of Hsp100, and demonstrate its impact on amastigote differentiation. Promastigotes of L. donovani were cultivated in M199 medium supplemented with 25% fetal calf serum and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. For cultivation under acidic conditions, the medium was buffered with 40 mmMES 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). buffer (pH 5.0) and pH was adjusted to 5.5. L. donovani strains MHOM/IN/80/DD8 (DD8 strain), obtained from D. Evans, and MHOM/IN/??/Lo8 (Lo8 strain), gift from D. Zilberstein, were both used in our analyses. For animal passage, 4 × 108 Lo8 strain promastigotes were injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. After 8 weeks of incubation, the animals were sacrificed, and parasites were grown as promastigotes from spleen tissue and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. For in vitro amastigote development, frozen promastigotes fresh from passage were brought back into liquid culture and subjected within 2 weeks to the stage differentiation regimen; cells were first heat-shocked for 24 h at 37 °C, harvested by mild centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh medium at pH 5.5. Cultivation was continued at 37 °C for 4 days, and stage development was monitored by microscopy and by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using antibodies against the amastigote-specific A2 proteins (10Charest H.

Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A cosmid DNA library of L. donovani strain Lo8 was prepared by cleavage of the shuttle cosmid vector pcosTL (12Kelly J.M. Das P. Tomás A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with SmaI and BamHI and ligation with size-selectedSau3AI partial digest products of L. donovanistrain Lo8 genomic DNA. After packaging using the Gigapack Gold II kit (Stratagene), the complexity of the library was tested, 2C. Hoyer, unpublished observations. and the library was amplified and stored in liquid nitrogen. clpB-positive clones were isolated from both phage and cosmid libraries by screening with digoxigenin-labeled L. major clpB DNA probes. Two λFIX clones were isolated from the phage library, which showed identical clpB-positive band patterns in Southern blot analysis after restriction digests with several restriction endonucleases. The clpB locus was reconstituted from two BamHI subfragments derived from one clone (clone 3). Both BamHI subfragments were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The plasmids that carried the twoBamHI subfragments were subjected separately to a Nested Deletion reaction (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The deletion mutants were size-selected and used as templates for automated sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems model 130A system using a Dye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems). The use of specifically synthesized oligonucleotide primers in automated sequencing served to bridge the gaps between partial sequences obtained from individual deletion products. We also isolated several clones from the cosmid DNA library. One of these cosmids, cos100.4A, was also used as template in the sequence analysis. By using specific primers, we analyzed the 450 bp located immediately upstream of the 5′ BamHI subfragment. The cosmid cos100.4A was purified from the E. coli host strain using a Qiagen Maxiprep kit. Plasmid DNA was extracted by alkaline lysis and purified over twice by density gradient centrifugation (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar). Linear DNA for homologous recombination was excised from pL.m.clpB-NEO or pL.m.clpB-HYG (9Hübel A. Krobitsch S. Hörauf A. Clos J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5987-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) by a single XbaI digest. Single-stranded overhangs were removed by nuclease S-1 treatment. Electrotransfection of Leishmania promastigotes was carried out as described (14Laban A. Wirth D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9119-9123Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested during late log phase of growth, washed twice in ice-cold PBS and once in prechilled electroporation buffer, and suspended at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in electroporation buffer. Chilled DNA was mixed with 0.4 ml of the cell suspension, which was immediately used for electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus. Electrotransfection of linear DNA was carried out at 3.000 V/cm and 25 microfarads in a 4-mm electroporation cuvette whereas circular DNA was transfected at 3.750 V/cm and 25 microfarads. Mock transfection of L. donovani wild type was performed in identical fashion, however without plasmid DNA, to obtain positive control strains for phenotypical analyses.After electroporation, cells were kept on ice for 10 min before being transferred to 10 ml of drug-free medium. The appropriate drugs for selection of transfectants were added after 24 h. Recombinant strain Lo8 (cos 100.4A) was cultivated at 37 °C for 24 h and harvested by centrifugation. Total RNA was prepared following standard procedures (16Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For mapping of the poly(A) site, first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia) with the enclosed (dT)18 primer and 5 μg of total RNA. The cDNA was then amplified enzymatically using the primers Ld100–52 (GCACGGTGAAAGTGACTCTC) and NOT-18 (GGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCAG), which anneal immediately upstream of the Hsp100 stop codon and to the 5′ half of the (dT)18 primer, which bears sites for NotI and EcoRI. Amplification was carried out with 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Beckman) in the first strand synthesis mix at 95 °C (1 min), 52 °C (1–2 min), and 72 °C (1–2 min) with 40 cycles. The product was digested with NarI and EcoRI and ligated into pBluescript cut with EcoRI and ClaI. After transformation plasmid minipreps were carried out and restriction analysis was performed using enzymes expected to cut within the 3′-untranslated region of the clpB gene. Candidate plasmids were sequenced. The sequences were aligned to the clpB DNA sequence. RT-PCR of the 5′ leader sequence was carried out in an analogous way. cDNA was prepared from 5 μg of RNA from the Lo8 (cos100.4A) strain using the First Strand synthesis kit but with 100 ng of primer Ld100–56 (GGGAATTCTAACGCTATATAAGTATCAG). After cDNA synthesis, 40 pmol of primers Ld100.71 (TGGATACGGGAGAGTTCAAG), directed against the 5′ end of the noncoding strand of the ClpB open reading frame, and SL-20 (GGGAATTCTAACGCTATATAAGTATCAG), directed against the spliced leader sequence, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase were added, and amplification was carried out at 95 °C (1 min), 50 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min) with 40 cycles. Negative controls that lacked either of the primers or were carried out with RNA from wild type Lo8 strain were included. The products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2.5% Small DNA Agarose (Biozym). A 420-nucleotide band absent from the controls was purified from the gel using the Gene Clean II Kit (BIO 101). The gel-purified PCR product was then ligated into plasmid pOCUS-T (Novagen) overnight in a refrigerator at 4–8 °C using T4 ligase (MBI Fermentas). The subcloned PCR product was then sequenced using primers directed against the T3 and T7 promoters of the vector. The sequences were aligned with the clpB gene sequence. SDS-PAGE and Western transfer were performed as described (6Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were treated with blocking buffer (0.25% iBlock (Tropix) and 0.1% Tween 20 in Dulbecco's PBS), with IgY (IgG from chicken egg yolk) raised againstLeishmania heat shock proteins (8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in blocking buffer, and with anti-chicken IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Dianova, 1:2500 in blocking buffer). Blots were stained with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Anti-A2 monoclonal antibody was used at 1:50 dilution and with rabbit anti-mouse Fab/AP (Dianova) at 1:2500. Quantification of Hsps in the immunoblot was carried out as described (6Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant Hsps carrying a 20-amino acid amino-terminal extension were mixed at defined concentrations with L. donovani lysates, and the mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Band intensities for natural and recombinant protein were compared densitometrically for each lane, and those recombinant protein concentrations were determined that matched the staining intensity of the natural protein. The amount of each Hsp per cell was calculated from the number of cells used in the analysis, and the number of molecules per cell was deduced using Avogadro's number. A linear sucrose gradient (5–20%) was overlayered with sample and spun at 20 °C and 200,000 × g for 18 h in a Beckman SW-41 rotor. The gradient was fractionated from the bottom using a peristaltic pump. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining or by immunoblot analysis. A Sephacryl S-400 column (10 mm × 400 mm) was packed at 15 ml h−1. The column was equilibrated with running buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 75 mm KCl). V o was determined as 12 ml using blue dextran. V t was 28 ml. The column was calibrated with the HMW calibration kit (Pharmacia) at a flow rate of 4.5 ml h−1. Crude cytoplasmic extracts from L. donovani (cos100.4A) were applied and eluted at 4.5 ml h−1. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-Hsp100 antibodies. Relative signal intensities were quantitated by using NIH image software on an Apple Power PC computer with a UMAX Vista-S8 flatbed scanner. Cross-linking was performed with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, Pierce). Promastigotes or amastigotes (2 × 107) were washed once in PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. DSP was added to 1 mm, and the suspension was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was then added to stop the reaction; the mixture was incubated for another 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in SDS loading buffer. Cross-linking was reversed by boiling the sample with 50 mmDTT in SDS sample buffer. Cross-linking products were analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. L. donovanipromastigotes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, harvested by gentle centrifugation, washed twice, and fixated for 24 h at 37 °C in 200 mm sodium cacodylate buffer with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixated cells were dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in LR-White. Ultrathin sections were prepared on an Ultracut E (Reichert) and placed on 200-mesh Ni grids. Anti-Hsp100 antibodies (1:500) or preimmune antibodies (1:500) were incubated with the grids for 1 h at 37 °C and then overnight at 4 °C. The sections were then treated for 1 h each with rabbit anti-chicken antibody (1:300, Jackson Immunolab) and with protein A-gold (10 nm, 1:100, Biocell). Staining of subcellular structures was performed in 1% UO2 in water and Pb-citrate (Reynolds' procedure). Electron micrographs were taken on a Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope. Halftone images were digitalized on a flatbed scanner. Digital images were cropped and juxtaposed using Adobe Photoshop™ software, version 3.0.5, on an Apple Power PC™ computer. Line drawings were generated and combined with halftone images using Claris Draw™ software, version D 1.5. We isolated two bacteriophage clones from a λFIX genomic DNA library of L. donovani strain MHOM/IN/80/DD8 using the L. major ClpB gene (8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as hybridization probe. We subcloned twoBamHI subfragments, which were positive for hybridization into pBluescript and analyzed the sequence of both inserts. OneBamHI subfragment of 3.6 kb represents 2.1 kb of 5′-flanking DNA and 1.5 kb of the open reading frame. The other BamHI fragment comprises 1.1 kb of the open reading frame plus 2.6 kb of 3′-flanking DNA. The recombined open reading frame is 2601 bp long and encodes 867 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 97,100. We also isolated clones from the L. donovani strain MHOM/IN/??/Lo8 cosmid library. One cosmid, cos100.4A, was included in the sequence analysis to analyze sequences beyond the 5′-BamHI site. We thus obtained 7.7 kb of sequence spanning the entire clpB locus with 2.6 kb of coding sequence, 2.5 kb of 5′-flanking DNA, and 2.6 kb of 3′-flanking DNA. The sequence of the L. donovani ClpB gene (GenBank accession no. Z94053) was compared with its L. major homologue (Ref.8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, GenBank accession no. Z35058) (data not shown). The sequence of the Hsp100-coding region is well conserved between both species with 96% sequence identity. The flanking regions are less conserved with sequence identities of 87% both for the 5′- and 3′-flanking DNA. The sequence mismatches result mostly from short insertions or deletions, while long stretches are almost perfectly conserved (data not shown). We attempted to map the 5′ end of the L. donovani Hsp100 mRNA by primer extension analysis and by RT-PCR but did not succeed, probably due to the very low abundance of Hsp100 mRNA (8Hübel A. Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore transfected L. donovani Lo8 strain with the cosmid cos100.4A, which contains the clpB gene locus in a cosmid shuttle vector and selected for recombinant parasites in G418-supplemented medium. The recombinant strain produces 5–10-fold more Hsp100 compared with wild type L. donovani as estimated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (see Fig. 2 B). We isolated RNA from this strain after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h and performed RT-PCR using primers directed against the spliced leader and against clpB gene sequences immediately upstream of the coding region. We observed a PCR product of 420 nucleotides, which was absent from the controls and from a reaction with wild type L. donovani RNA (data not shown). The RT-PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript, and DNA from several bacterial clones was sequenced. The sequence of the RT-PCR products map the trans-splicing donor site to an AG consensus at position −379 (Fig. 1 A).Figure 1Sequence alignment of L. donovani clpB gene and RT-PCR products.

The numbering on top is nucleotides downstream of the stop codon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next performed RT-PCR to map the polyadenylation site again using RNA from the Hsp100-overproducing strain and primers against the poly(A) tail and a sequence immediately upstream of the stop codon. We amplified a 725-bp DNA, which again was subcloned and subjected to sequence analysis. The products map the polyadenylation site to a position 691 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon (Fig. 1 B). We measured Hsp100 synthesis in heat-shocked promastigotes of L. donovani by metabolic pulse-labeling with [35S]Met and immune precipitation (Fig. 2 A). Within 30 min after the onset of a heat stress, Hsp100 synthesis increases 8-fold as determined by PhosphorImager analysis (data not shown). The synthesis rate decreases only slightly after 2 h and remains well above the noninduced rates for at least 30 h. Unlike induction of Hsp70 and Hsp83 synthesis (6Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we find that induction of Hsp100 synthesis is not transient but persists for the duration of the temperature stress. In prokaryotes and in eukaryotes, the heat shock response is inducible not only by heat but also by a variety of physiological or chemical stresses, i.e. low pH, ethanol, heavy metal ions, and arsenite (17Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 417-455Google Scholar). The response to these stresses is usually mediated by the activation of a heat shock transcription factor, which, upon activation, binds to the promoters of heat shock genes and activates transcription (17Morimoto R.I. Jurivich D.A. Kroeger P.E. Mathur S.K. Murphy S.P. Nakai A. Sarge K. Abravaya K. Sistonen L.T. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones.

Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 395-416Google Scholar). Since transcription of heat shock genes is not inducible in Leishmania (6Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Argaman M. Aly R. Shapira M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we tested whether chemical stresses affect Hsp100 expression. We determined the LD50for several chemicals and exposed L. donovani promastigotes to 50% of the respective LD50 for 24 h. We also subjected promastigotes to acidic pH 5.5 and to 37 °C for the same period. The promastigotes were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-Hsp100 antibodies. The result, shown in Fig. 2 B (lanes 1–7), suggests that Hsp100 levels are inducible only by heat stress. The small induction observed with arsenite (lane 7) is not always reproducible and probably not significant. It appears from this that the lack of transcription control in Leishmania forestalls chemical induction of the heat shock response. We also analyzed the Hsp100 concentration in the recombinant strain Lo 8 (cos100.4A) before and after heat stress (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8 and 9). The protein is overexpressed from the episome in unstressed cells. Nevertheless, a heat stress still induces Hsp100 synthesis. We conclude from this that Hsp100 does not participate in a feedback regulation of its own synthesis. The heat-inducible synthesis rates observed correspond to a significantly increased intracellular concentration. We quantitated Hsp100 in L. donovani promastigotes from 25 °C culture and after 24 h of 37 °C using a calibrated immunoblot analysis (6Brandau S. Dresel A. Clos J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The result is shown in Fig. 3 A and displayed graphically in Fig. 3 B. We observe a 6–7-fold increase of Hsp100 during the first 24 h of heat stress. Longer incubation at 37 °C further increases Hsp100 numbers to approximately 2.5 × 105 molecules/cell after 36 h (data not shown). Some Hsp100 family members have been shown to form multimeric complexes in solution (20Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,21Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When we performed a density gradient sedimentation analysis with extracts from the strain L. donovani (cos100.4A), we found Hsp100 to co-sediment with the catalase standard, indicating a native size of approximately 230,000 or 11.3 Svedberg units (Fig. 4 A). Gel filtration analysis of Hsp100 on a Sephacryl S-400 resin yielded a Stoke's radius of 65 Å (Fig. 4 B), corresponding to an apparent size of approximately 410,000. By applying the algorithms described by Siegel and Monty (22Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), we calculated the native size of Hsp100 to 302,400 (Table I). Given a calculated monomeric molecular weight of 97,100, this native size assessment indicates a trimeric organization of Hsp100 in L. donovani. The frictional ratio (f/f 0 = 1.47) indicates a deviation of the Hsp100 complex from a pure spherical shape. This may account for the observed discrepancies of apparent size in gel filtration and sedimentation analysis.Table INative molecular weight of L. donovani Hsp100Sucrose gradient Approximate molecular weight230,000 S value (× 10−13s)11.3Gel filtration Approximate molecular weight410,000 Stokes radius (Å)65Corrected molecular weight1-aCorrected molecular weight (M r) was determind following the algorithm described in (22):M r = 6πηNR(s 20)/1υρ), whereM r = molecular weight, η = viscosity of medium (= 1.0019 cP), N = Avogadro's number, R = Stokes radius [m] (= 6.5 × 109), s 20 = sedimentation coefficient [10−13S], υ = partial specific volume (= 0.725 cm3g−1), and ρ = density of medium (= 0.99823 g ml −1).

The muscle-specific kinase is thought to be part of an agrin receptor complex, although the recombinant protein does not bind agrin with high affinity. To specify its function, we induced phosphorylation and activation of this kinase in the absence of agrin by incubating myotubes with antibodies directed against its N-terminal sequence. Antibody-induced dimerization of the muscle-specific kinase but not treatment with Fab fragments was sufficient to trigger two key events of early postsynaptic development: acetylcholine receptors accumulated into aggregates, and their β-subunits became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Heparin partially inhibited receptor aggregation induced by both agrin and anti-muscle-specific kinase antibodies. In contrast, it did not affect kinase or acetylcholine receptor phosphorylation. These data indicate that agrin induces postsynaptic differentiation by dimerizing the muscle-specific kinase. They also suggest that activation of the kinase domain can account for only part of agrin's effects. Dimerization of this molecule appears to activate an additional signal, most likely by organizing a scaffold for other postsynaptic proteins.

In rapsyn-deficient mice, agrin is not able to induce the concentration of AChRs and other synaptic components (16Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies suggest an important role of tyrosine phosphorylation in this pathway (17Wallace B.G. J.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether this modification is necessary for AChR aggregation. α-Dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, has been identified as the most abundant agrin-binding protein on the myotube surface (19Hoch W.

However, the analysis of a series of agrin fragments has revealed no correlation between their binding to α-dystroglycan and their capability of inducing AChR aggregation (20Henry M.D. Campbell K.P.

Genetic experiments have demonstrated an essential role in the agrin pathway for a muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), which has recently been identified in different species (23DeChiara T.M.

In mice, deletion of this gene prevents the concentration of AChRs and other proteins at the contact site between motoneuron and muscle fiber and is therefore lethal (23DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C.

MuSK is highly expressed in rat embryonic muscle and in the C2C12 mouse muscle cell line and colocalizes with AChRs at the neuromuscular junction (25Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E.

Several observations suggest an important role of MuSK in the agrin pathway (28Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J.

This reaction, a characteristic response of receptor tyrosine kinases to binding of their ligand (29Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Hoch, submitted for publication. 2C. Hopf and W. Hoch, submitted for publication. In addition, agrin can be cross-linked to MuSK expressed on myotubes (28Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Upon transfection into the quail cell line QT-6, MuSK is concentrated in microaggregates together with rapsyn (31Gillespie S.K.H. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the extracellular domain of the MuSK molecule is required for this interaction, which therefore must be indirect. It has been suggested that a hypothetical rapsyn-associated transmembrane linker (RATL) bridges these proteins (32Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Agrin does not directly bind to recombinant MuSK (28Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, a MuSK-accessory specificity component (MASC) has been postulated, mediating its activation by agrin (28Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To assess the role of MuSK in the agrin signaling pathway, it is important to activate this molecule independent of agrin. In an earlier attempt, a chimeric molecule consisting of the extracellular domain of the neurotrophin receptor TrkC and the intracellular domain of MuSK has been expressed in myotubes. The TrkC ligand neurotrophin 3 added to these myotubes induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the chimeric receptor as well as AChRs, but not AChR aggregation (33Glass D.J. Apel E.D. Shah S. Bowen D.C. DeChiara T.D. Stitt T.N. Sanes J.R. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8848-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we took a different approach to bypass agrin in activating MuSK. We artificially dimerized MuSK by incubating myotubes with bivalent polyclonal antibodies directed against its N terminus. We demonstrate that MuSK is sufficient to trigger responses normally evoked by neuronal agrin isoforms; antibody-induced activation of MuSK causes aggregation of AChRs and the tyrosine phosphorylation of their β-subunit with high efficiency. We also show that AChR aggregation but not AChR-phosphorylation is inhibited by heparin, suggesting the existence of multiple pathways activated by MuSK. The soluble rat agrin constructs s-agrin-(4,19) and s-agrin-(0,8) have been described previously (34Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Generation of the full-length MuSK construct has been reported elsewhere,2 and an expression construct coding for the extracellular part of MuSK was assembled by the addition of sequence coding for a hexahistidine tag followed by a stop codon to the appropriate site of the MuSK cDNA. 3C. Hopf and W. Hoch, unpublished results. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding soluble agrin (30 μg of DNA/15-cm dish) according to the method of Chen and Okayama (35Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar). The collection of serum-free agrin-conditioned media and calibration of agrin concentrations has been described (34Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody (pAb) Cyt-MuSK against a bacterial fusion protein comprising the first half of the cytoplasmic domain of MuSK was affinity-purified by absorption to the antigen immobilized on Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). pAb N-MuSK was purified from a crude antiserum against a peptide (N-peptide) corresponding to 14 amino acids of the putative N terminus of MuSK by affinity chromatography on an immobilized N-terminal bacterial fusion protein. Both pAbs specifically recognize MuSK in immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments.2 For the antibody specificity analysis shown in Fig. 1, membrane proteins were extracted from COS cells,2 whereas a plasma membrane fraction of C2C12 cells differentiated for 5 days in fusion medium was prepared as described (36Lin P.H. Selinfreund R. Wharton W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine antibody mAb 5E2 (37Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. A. Ullrich (Max-Planck-Institute for Biochemistry). The phosphotyrosine antibodies mAb PY20 and mAb 4G10 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Inc., respectively. mAb 124 (rat monoclonal) directed against the β-subunit of the AChR (38Gullick W.J. Lindstrom J.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3312-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. J. Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania). Purified polyclonal antibodies against extracellular epitopes of the TGFβR I and M-cadherin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Iodinated and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Corp. and Jackson/Dianova. Fab fragments of pAb N-MuSK were generated by digestion with papain conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) for 10 h at 37 °C. Fc fragments and undigested antibodies were removed by absorption to protein A-agarose (Calbiochem). Binding of the Fab fragments and pAb N-MuSK to N-peptide as well as the recombinant extracellular domain of MuSK3 was compared by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly, microtiter plates were coated with N-peptide, purified recombinantly expressed extracellular domain of MuSK, or bovine serum albumin. Thereafter, the plates were incubated with several concentrations of pAb N-MuSK or Fab fragments of these antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by extensive washing, and bound antibodies were reacted with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit-Fab-antibodies (Jackson/Dianova) followed by streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham). As the “active concentration” of Fab fragments, the concentration of pAb N-MuSK was defined that produced the same reactivity against the N-peptide in this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At this concentration, Fab fragments also showed a similar reactivity toward the extracellular domain of MuSK as the intact antibody. For staining of MuSK- or mock-transfected COS cells under native conditions, COS cells were grown on polylysine-coated slides. Medium was replaced by C2C12 fusion medium containing antibody or Fab fragments (“active concentration” 30 nm, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit-Fab-antibodies followed by Cy3 conjugated to streptavidin. C2C12 myoblasts were propagated as described previously (7Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, cells were allowed to differentiate in 2.5% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine in DMEM (fusion medium) for 4–5 days. They were switched to 0.25% horse serum in DMEM for 3–12 h prior to stimulation with agrin or antibodies in various concentrations. Immunoprecipitation of MuSK with Cyt-MuSK antiserum and enrichment of AChRs by binding to biotin-α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) followed by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads has been described previously.2 Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to Fluorotrans membrane (Pall Filtron). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent SuperSignal substrate (Pierce). Antibodies were stripped from the membranes with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40; blocked again; and reprobed with suitable antibodies. Some experiments were performed using125I-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) after 5–30 days of exposure. To assess the ability of the N-peptide or heparin to neutralize pAb N-MuSK effects, myotubes were pretreated with a 10,000-fold molar excess of N-peptide (approximately 500 μg/ml) or suitable concentrations of heparin in DMEM for 45 min prior to stimulation. Antibody was preincubated with the same excess of N-peptide for 2 h at 4 °C. C2C12 myotubes were cultured on chamber slides (Nunc). After 2½ days in fusion medium, they were stimulated with antibody preparations or agrin for 10–16 h. AChRs were visualized with rhodamine-α-bungarotoxin, and the number of AChR aggregates in at least 12 microscopic fields was quantitated as described previously (34Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Many small AChR clusters were observed when formation of aggregates was induced with pAb N-MuSK. These were not included in our quantitation, since only clusters >5 μm in length were counted. In experiments with heparin or N-peptide, the cells were pretreated with these agents as outlined above. All experiments were performed 2–6 times. The number of AChR aggregates is displayed as the mean of 3–5 determinations ± S.E. Statistical significance of the observed differences was verified by t test analysis (p < 0.05). Ligand-induced dimerization is an essential step for activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and in many cases is sufficient to activate these kinases (29Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar, 30Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 39Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to artificially dimerize and activate MuSK in the absence of agrin using a peptide antiserum directed against the N terminus of the MuSK protein.2 Polyclonal antibodies (pAb N-MuSK) affinity-purified from this serum recognized a single band in detergent extracts from COS cells transfected with a MuSK expression construct (Fig. 1 A). A band of corresponding size was recognized by these antibodies in a plasma membrane preparation of the muscle cell line C2C12 (Fig. 1 B). At least a subset of these antibodies was able to react with undenatured MuSK protein, since intact antibodies as well as Fab fragments bound to MuSK-transfected unfixed COS cells but not to mock-transfected controls (Fig. 1 C). MuSK was concentrated in small patches on the surface of transfected COS-cells. Similar immunoreactive patches were observed when cells were fixed by incubation with paraformaldehyde prior to exposure to antibodies or Fab fragments (data not shown). This suggests a tendency for MuSK to self-aggregate. In a first set of experiments, we assessed the ability of these antibodies to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK by incubating differentiated C2C12 myotubes for 1 h. After this stimulation, MuSK was immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of the cells using a fusion protein antiserum directed against its intracellular domain.2 Phosphorylation of the MuSK molecule on tyrosine residues was detected by probing of Western blots with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. Incubation of myotubes with two concentrations of pAb N-MuSK indeed significantly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase (Fig. 2 A). Several control experiments indicated that antibody-induced phosphorylation was specific: 1) phosphorylation was greatly reduced in the presence of a 10,000-fold molar excess of the N-peptide, against which the antiserum had been raised; 2) high concentrations of control antibodies directed against an intracellular region of MuSK (pAb Cyt-MuSK)2 did not cause phosphorylation of MuSK; 3) Fab fragments derived from N-MuSK antibodies had no effect, although they bound similar amounts of antigen as compared with pAb N-MuSK (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). This observation indicated that bivalency of the antibodies was necessary to induce phosphorylation of MuSK, suggesting that pAb N-MuSK was able to dimerize the kinase. Reprobing the blot with MuSK-specific antibodies demonstrated that variations in the amounts of MuSK protein that had been precipitated did not account for the differences in tyrosine phosphorylation. Agrin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the AChR in chick and C2C12 myotubes cultures (18Wallace B.G. Qu Z. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1991; 6: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Ferns M. Deiner M. Hall Z. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether antibody-induced dimerization of MuSK had similar effects. We isolated AChRs from detergent extracts of myotubes treated with pAb N-MuSK or from control preparations. Antibody-induced dimerization of MuSK caused a significant and dose-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR β-subunit (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that dimerization of MuSK induced not only kinase autophosphorylation but also the phosphorylation of a downstream target. Only bivalent N-MuSK-antibodies were able to induce AChR phosphorylation; Fab fragments or control antibodies had no effect. Reprobing of the blot with a monoclonal antibody directed against the β-subunit showed that comparable amounts of AChR were precipitated from the detergent extracts in all samples. Next, we asked whether activation of MuSK alone is sufficient to induce not only phosphorylation but also clustering of AChRs. We incubated C2C12 myotubes with pAb N-MuSK or with soluble nerve agrin (s-agrin (4Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) for 12 h, visualized AChRs with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin, and analyzed their distribution. Agrin caused the redistribution of AChRs into large aggregates on the surface of myotubes (Fig. 3 A). Strikingly, N-MuSK antibodies were able to trigger a similar aggregation in the absence of agrin (Fig. 3 B), whereas untreated myotubes rarely bore AChR clusters (Fig. 3 C). The effect of anti-MuSK antibodies was specific; antibodies against an extracellular region of M-cadherin (pAb M-cadherin), which stains the neuromuscular junction in adult mouse skeletal muscle (41Cifuentes-Diaz C. Goudou D. Padilla F. Facchinetti P. Nicolet M. Mège R.-M. Rieger F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), did not induce a significant number of AChR clusters (Fig. 3 D). Antibodies directed against TGFβR I and a cytoplasmic region of MuSK also had no effect (data not shown). Typically, upon extended incubation, agrin induced long AChR patches (>5 μm in length) on C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 3 A). In addition to these aggregates, pAb N-MuSK treatment often induced small AChR-rich patches that were not included in our quantitative analysis of antibody-induced AChR clustering. The aggregating activity of pAb N-MuSK was specific (Fig. 4 A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 4 B). Even higher concentrations of antibodies directed against extracellular domains of M-cadherin and TGFβR I, an unrelated receptor protein of the muscle surface, had no effect on the distribution of AChRs. An excess of N-peptide abolished the AChR-aggregating effects of pAb N-MuSK. As in our MuSK and AChR phosphorylation experiments, dimerization of the MuSK molecule was required for AChR clustering, Fab fragments of pAb N-MuSK did not induce AChR aggregation (Fig. 4 A). The experiments described above demonstrated that MuSK activation alone mimics effects normally triggered by agrin. However, they could not exclude the possibility that interactions of agrin with components of the myotube surface not connected to MuSK (e.g. α-dystroglycan) play a synergistic role in initiating AChR aggregation. To set a limit for the potential effects of such MuSK-independent effects of agrin, it was important to compare the ability of agrin and anti-MuSK antibodies to induce different effects more quantitatively. C2C12 myotubes were stimulated with various concentrations of pAb N-MuSK and s-agrin (4Hoch W. Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,19Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or with DMEM (control). From one aliquot of the cell lysates, MuSK was immunoprecipitated; from another, AChRs were affinity-purified. In both preparations, tyrosine phosphorylation evoked by the two effectors was measured by quantitative Western blot analysis. In the concentration range used in this experiment, pAb N-MuSK induced a higher degree of MuSK phosphorylation than agrin, whereas AChR phosphorylation was triggered with reversed efficiencies (Fig. 5). For example, 40 pm agrin induced a comparable level of MuSK phosphorylation as 24 nmpAb N-MuSK, but 3-fold higher antibody concentrations were required to match the ability of 40 pm agrin to cause AChR phosphorylation. Similarly, 3-fold higher concentrations of antibody were required to induce AChR aggregation in comparison with MuSK phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, a potential activation of MuSK-independent receptors by agrin can at best play a small synergistic role in the agrin signaling pathway. The possibility of activating AChR aggregation in the absence of agrin allowed us to further delineate a target for the action of heparin, a well known inhibitor of nerve- as well as agrin-induced clustering of AChRs (42Wallace B.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43Hirano Y. Kidokoro Y. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor could prove useful in studies aiming at an understanding of the mechanisms by which MuSK activation triggers AChR aggregation. While heparin directly binds to a subset of agrin isoforms (21Hopf C. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 44Campanelli J.T. Gayer G.G. Scheller R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 1663-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this direct binding to agrin only accounts for part of its inhibitory effects. Recently, we showed that heparin acts as an inhibitor at an additional step in the agrin pathway (34Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which has not been identified. To narrow down this second target of heparin, we investigated whether heparin differentially affects AChR aggregation induced by agrin or anti-MuSK antibodies. High concentrations of heparin reduce the amount of AChR aggregates induced by a non-heparin-binding agrin isoform by 55–75% (34Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Upon inducing AChR aggregation by incubation of myotubes with anti-MuSK antibodies, we observed an ∼80% reduction in the number of AChR clusters (Fig. 6 A), demonstrating that the target mediating this heparin inhibition is not localized up-stream of MuSK. Next, we assessed whether heparin blocks phosphorylation of MuSK and AChRs to a similar extent as it inhibits AChR aggregation. We incubated C2C12 myotubes with a non-heparin-binding agrin isoform or MuSK antibodies in the presence of different concentrations of heparin. Then we precipitated MuSK by incubation with our fusion protein antiserum and AChRs by absorption to biotin-α-bungarotoxin and analyzed their phosphotyrosine content (Fig. 6 B). Surprisingly, neither MuSK nor AChR phosphorylation was significantly affected by the presence of heparin. Similar results were obtained with lower concentrations of agrin and pAb N-MuSK (data not shown). These experiments provided additional evidence that heparin acts downstream from MuSK. In addition, they identify heparin as the first agent that selectively affects AChR aggregation but not its phosphorylation. The goal of our study was to specify the role of MuSK in the assembly of the postsynaptic apparatus induced by agrin. We have shown that incubation of myotubes with antibodies against MuSK triggers the tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK. More importantly, we have demonstrated that this antibody-induced cross-linking is sufficient to induce similar effects as treatment of myotubes with agrin; AChRs started to aggregate, and their β-subunits became phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Fab fragments of pAb N-MuSK did not trigger similar effects, although they bound to MuSK to a similar extent as bivalent antibodies in several control experiments. We found no evidence for binding of our antibodies to other cell surface proteins besides MuSK. Furthermore, the small size of the N-peptide (14 amino acids) against which N-MuSK antibodies are directed makes it very unlikely that more than one antibody at a time bound to MuSK's N terminus. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the observed AChR aggregation is caused by a selective dimerization of MuSK and cannot be attributed to extensive cross-linking of this molecule. In comparison with agrin, anti-MuSK antibodies displayed slightly different efficiencies of MuSK phosphorylation versus AChR phosphorylation and aggregation. These differences could indicate the synergistic participation of a hypothetical MuSK-independent signal, which is triggered by agrin but not by the antibodies. However, in a detailed study of the ligand specificity of agrin-induced effects, no evidence was found for the existence of such a signal.2Alternatively, the reduced level of AChR phosphorylation and aggregation in our experiments was due to a slightly altered conformation of the agrin receptor complex in response to antibody-induced but not agrin-induced MuSK dimerization and/or an incomplete activation of the kinase domain of MuSK (Fig. 7). While the mode of activation of MuSK has not been analyzed so far, a stepwise autophosphorylation and activation process has previously been described for other receptor tyrosine kinases, e.g. the insulin receptor (45White M.F. Shoelson S.E. Keutmann H. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2969-2980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While this manuscript was in preparation, another report described the activation of MuSK by a single chain antibody (46Xie M.-H. Yuan J. Adams C. Gurney A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In agreement with our results, this activation was sufficient to trigger the phosphorylation and aggregation of AChRs, although these effects were not studied quantitatively. In contrast to our antibodies directed against the N terminus of MuSK, several monovalent antibodies directed against unknown regions of the extracellular domain of MuSK caused the activation of the kinase. Surprisingly, bivalency of these antibodies was not required, suggesting a different mode of activation (47Wallace B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 721-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The effects of antibody-induced activation of MuSK described here demonstrate that anti-MuSK antibodies are a useful tool for elucidating MuSK's role in the agrin pathway. The comparison of our results with those of other attempts to activate MuSK agrin-independently (33Glass D.J. Apel E.D. Shah S. Bowen D.C. DeChiara T.D. Stitt T.N. Sanes J.R. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8848-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) highlights a major difference between MuSK and other receptor tyrosine kinases: the crucial role of the extracellular domain of MuSK. Glasset al. (33Glass D.J. Apel E.D. Shah S. Bowen D.C. DeChiara T.D. Stitt T.N. Sanes J.R. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8848-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) stimulated a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of TrkC and the intracellular domain of MuSK with neurotrophin 3 and thereby efficiently induced phosphorylation of the chimera and the AChR. However, activation of TrkC/MuSK did not lead to the aggregation of AChR on the surface of C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 7). Clearly, stimulating the kinase activity of MuSK alone cannot account for AChR aggregation. In addition to the MuSK/TrkC chimera, antibody-induced dimerization of the full-length MuSK molecule and concomitant redistribution of putative MuSK-associated proteins was able to induce not only the phosphorylation of AChRs but also their aggregation. This functional difference directly points at an essential role of the extracellular domain of MuSK. An inherent organizing function has previously been suggested by cotransfection experiments in a quail fibroblast cell line (31Gillespie S.K.H. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this system, a kinase-defective mutant of the Torpedo MuSK ortholog (31Gillespie S.K.H. Balasubramanian S. Fung E.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 953-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and a MuSK fragment in which most of the cytoplasmic domain had been deleted (32Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) were aggregated by cotransfected rapsyn. In muscle cells, a kinase-defective mutant of rat MuSK suppressed AChR clustering (33Glass D.J. Apel E.D. Shah S. Bowen D.C. DeChiara T.D. Stitt T.N. Sanes J.R. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8848-8853Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), demonstrating the requirement of tyrosine kinase activity for this process. Our data complement the suggestion that two signals are necessary to induce the aggregation of AChRs in myotubes (Fig. 7) (32Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 48Glass D. Yancopoulos G.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); the first signal is the kinase activity of MuSK, and the second signal appears to originate from the physical association of other proteins with MuSK. It is neither known in which way this scaffolding depends on MuSK activation nor which proteins associate with MuSK. The most likely candidate appears to be RATL, which might directly tether rapsyn and the stoichiometrically complexed AChRs to MuSK (32Apel E.D. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the passive redistribution of MASC induced by MuSK dimerization could be important for AChR aggregation. This second possibility appears less likely, since our data showed that a direct activation of MASC by the binding of agrin is not essential for this pathway. Any signal that might be triggered by the binding of agrin to MASC can be bypassed by the dimerization of MuSK. Two types of inhibitors of the agrin pathway have been characterized so far. Staurosporin, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, blocks both phosphorylation and aggregation of AChRs (17Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and apparently inhibits the first signal in the pathway (Fig. 7); our data suggest that heparin represents a second type of inhibitor, which interferes with the second signal. Heparin treatment caused a MuSK/TrkC-like “phenotype”; it inhibited AChR aggregation induced by a non-heparin-binding agrin isoform (34Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by anti-MuSK antibodies by more than 80%. Strikingly, it did not affect the phosphorylation of either MuSK or AChRs. This selective interference with receptor aggregation would be expected from a reagent interfering exclusively with the second signal in the agrin pathway. The extracellular domain of MuSK, which is involved in this step, is accessible to heparin and other polyanions added into the medium. The protein directly interacting with heparin has not been identified so far, but RATL is an interesting candidate. The availability of specific activators and inhibitors of the agrin signaling pathway should be useful in the future to identify the missing players and understand how they interact with the already identified components.

https://openalex.org/W1966307757,"The bifunctional P-protein, which plays a central role in <i>Escherichia coli</i> phenylalanine biosynthesis, contains two catalytic domains (chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase activities) as well as one R-domain (for feedback inhibition by phenylalanine). Six genes coding for P-protein domains or subdomains were constructed and successfully expressed. Proteins containing residues 1–285 and residues 1–300 retained full mutase and dehydratase activity, but exhibited no feedback inhibition. Proteins containing residues 101–386 and residues 101–300 retained full dehydratase activity, but lacked mutase activity. Fluorescence emission spectra and binding assays indicated that residues 286–386 were crucial for phenylalanine binding. The mutase (residues 1–109), dehydratase (residues 101–285), and regulatory (residues 286–386) activities were thus shown to reside in discrete domains of the P-protein. Both the mutase domain and the native P-protein formed dimers. Deletion of the mutase domain diminished phenylalanine binding to the regulatory site as well as prephenate binding to the dehydratase domain, both through cooperative effects. Besides eliminating feedback inhibition, removal of the R-domain decreased the affinity of chorismate mutase for chorismate."

To define the components necessary for plasmin generation on group A streptococci we used strain AP53 which exposes an M-like protein (“PAM”) that contains a plasminogen-binding sequence with two 13-amino acid residues long tandem repeats (a1 and a2). Utilizing an Escherichia coli-streptococcal shuttle vector, we replaced a 29-residue long sequence segment of Arp4, an M-like protein that does not bind plasminogen, with a single (a1) or the combined a1a2 repeats of PAM. When expressed in E. coli, the purified chimeric Arp/PAM proteins both bound plasminogen, as well as plasmin, and when used to transform group A streptococcal strains lacking the plasminogen-binding ability, transformants with the Arp/PAM constructs efficiently bound plasminogen. Moreover, when grown in the presence of plasminogen, both Arp/PAM- and PAM-expressing streptococci acquired surface-bound plasmin. In contrast, plasminogen activation failed to occur on PAM- and Arp/PAM-expressing streptococci carrying an inactivated streptokinase gene: this block was overcome by exogenous streptokinase. Together, these results provide evidence for an unusual co-operation between a surface-bound protein, PAM, and a secreted protein, streptokinase, resulting in bacterial acquisition of a host protease that is likely to spur parasite invasion of host tissues.

Plasminogen is a single chain 92-kDa glycoprotein present in plasma (∼200 mg/liter) and in extracellular fluids. The protein contains five characteristic kringle domains that mediate interactions with multiple ligands, such as fibrin(ogen), α2-antiplasmin (α2AP), 1The abbreviations used are: α2AP, α2-antiplasmin; Arp4, IgA-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; IgA, immunoglobulin A; PAM, plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction;ska, streptokinase gene. 1The abbreviations used are: α2AP, α2-antiplasmin; Arp4, IgA-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; IgA, immunoglobulin A; PAM, plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction;ska, streptokinase gene. and cellular plasminogen receptors (1Castellino F.J.

In vivo, two specific activators, the tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase, convert the single-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme, plasmin, by cleavage at a single site (4Robbins K.C. Summaria L Hsieh B. Shah R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2333-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin efficiently degrades fibrin and probably also participates in the breakdown of soft tissue glycoproteins (5Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The plasma concentration of active plasmin is normally low, due to its rapid inactivation by proteinase inhibitors, primarily α2AP. Under pathophysiological conditions some pathogens, including group A, C, and G streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, secrete highly specific and potent plasminogen activators such as streptokinase and staphylokinase, respectively (1Castellino F.J. Semin. Thromb. Haemost. 1984; 10: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolys. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Other bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Yersinia pestis, express surface-bound plasminogen activators (6Leytus S.P.

Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Evidence suggest that plasmin generated by bacterial plasminogen activators contributes to virulence, possibly by facilitating bacterial penetration through host barriers (7Sodeinde O.A. Subrahmanyam Y. Stark K. Quan T. Bao Y. Goguen J. Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar).It has been known for some time that many virulent bacterial species express surface proteins capable of binding plasmin(ogen) without causing its activation (8Boyle M.D.P. Lottenberg R. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Some of these can also contribute to bacterial dissemination (9Coleman J.L. Gebbia J.A. Piesman J.

For Streptococcus pyogenes(group A streptococci), a major causative agent of both mucosal and skin infection in humans, four major types of surface proteins have been forwarded as candidate plasmin(ogen)-binding proteins. Of these the dehydrogenase-like Plr protein (10Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D.P. J. Biol.

Some members of the M protein family, a well known class of surface-exposed streptococcal virulence determinants (14Fischetti V.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), have been shown to capture plasmin(ogen) indirectly, through fibrinogen (15Wang H. Lottenberg R. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 18: 153-166Google Scholar, 16Christner R. Li Z. Raeder R. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, a set of group A streptococcal strains, associated with skin infection (17Martin D.R.J. Voss L.M. Walker S.J. Lennon D. Pediatr. Infect. Dis.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carlsson Wistedt A. Ringdahl U. Müller-Esterl W. Sjöbring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For one of these proteins, PAM (plasminogen-binding group Astreptococcal M-like protein) from type 53 group A streptococci, a plasminogen-binding sequence characterized by two 13-amino acid residues long repeats (a1 and a2), has been identified in its surface-exposed variable NH2-terminal domain. Similar motifs are also present in M-like proteins from the other “skin” strains (21Carlsson Wistedt A. Ringdahl U. Müller-Esterl W. Sjöbring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Here we have set out to study the molecular requirements for the binding and activation of plasminogen by PAM-expressing bacteria. We demonstrate a joint role for the plasminogen-binding motif in PAM and streptokinase in the acquisition and exposure of plasmin at the surface of group A streptococci.DISCUSSIONGroup A streptococci elaborate at least two classes of plasmin(ogen)-binding proteins, i.e. secretory proteins such as streptokinase and streptococcal cysteine proteinase (38Poon-King R. Bannan J. Viteri A. Cu G. Zabriskie J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and surface attached proteins such as PAM (20Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Plr (10Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 45-kDa protein (13Pancholi, V., Fischetti, V. A., XIIIth Lancefield International Symposium on Streptococcci and Streptococcal Diseases, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, Sep. 16–20, 1996, 1996, 87, (abstr.).Google Scholar). Moreover, group A streptococci can capture plasmin(ogen) indirectly through fibrinogen which in turn binds to M-like proteins (15Wang H. Lottenberg R. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 18: 153-166Google Scholar). Such a multiplicity of interactions with the key player of the fibrinolytic pathway suggests that the plasmin(ogen)-binding property carries a selective advantage to streptococci, motivating an analysis of the relative importance and biological role of the different mechanisms.In the present work we have focused on the role of protein PAM, a member of the streptococcal M family of surface proteins. To assess the contribution of the PAM a-repeats for in vitro plasmin acquisition by group A streptococci, we grafted them on the plasmin(ogen) non-binding protein Arp4, another member of the M protein family. We chose Arp4 as the “recipient” molecule since this protein and PAM are similar in many ways. Thus, both proteins are anchored to the bacterial cell wall through their highly conserved COOH-terminal segments, they contain three conserved C-repeats in the COOH-terminal half of the protein, and have surface-exposed variable NH2-terminal regions. Moreover, both PAM and Arp can be predicted to form α-helical coiled coil dimers as a consequence of their high contents of characteristic heptad repeats (39Nilson B.H.K. Frick I.-M. Åkesson P. Forsén S. Åkerström B. Björck L. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13688-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, the binding patterns of PAM and Arp resemble one another: (i) both proteins bind C4bp with high affinity through a site in the NH2-terminal hypervariable domain (40Johnsson E. Thern A. Dahlbäck B. Hedén L.-O. Wikström M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3021-3029PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) they do not bind fibrinogen; (iii) a unique binding property (i.e. plasminogen-binding for PAM and IgA-binding for Arp4) is for both proteins located in the central region of their NH2-terminal domains. The experiments showed that replacement of the IgA-binding site of Arp by the a-repeats of PAM was necessary and sufficient to endow group A streptococci expressing two (JRS145) or three (JRS4) of the other putative plasmin(ogen)-binding surface proteins (10Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pancholi, V., Fischetti, V.

Lottenberg R. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 18: 153-166Google Scholar) with the capacity to bind plasmin and plasminogen, thereby emphasizing the power of the PAM motif in relation to other structures believed to contribute to group A streptococcal plasmin(ogen) acquisition. Moreover, the data establish PAM as the most well characterized cell-surface receptor for plasminogen and the a1 repeat of 13 residues as the smallest and best defined internal plasminogen acceptor site known, making it a candidate for analyses of structural requirements for interactions between kringles and sequences lacking carboxyl-terminal lysines.The binding to PAM is mediated through the lysine-binding site(s) of a plasminogen fragment comprising its first three kringle domains (20Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal physiological regulator of plasmin, α2AP, binds to related site(s) (41Wiman B. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Given the high affinity for the interaction with plasmin(ogen), this protease is likely to be protected from regulation by α2AP when bound by PAM-expressing streptococci. Our finding that absorption and activation of plasminogen on PAM- and Arp/PAM-expressing streptococci can take place in plasma supports such a notion. Since the binding is mediated through lysine-binding site(s), the catalytic domain of plasminogen remains accessible by the major streptococcal plasminogen activator, streptokinase. Indeed, streptokinase binds to PAM-expressing bacteria or to PAM-coated polyacrylamide beads only when they have been pre-absorbed with plasminogen. 2U. Sjöbring, unpublished observation. This suggests that streptokinase might bind and activate PAM-bound plasminogen although our present experiments do not entirely rule out the possibility that a cycle of dissociation from and association with PAM is required to allow plasminogen activation in solution. Unlike plasmin in solution, neither the plasminogen-streptokinase complex nor the plasmin-streptokinase complex can be inactivated by α2AP (42Cederholm-Williams S.A. De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore the finding that PAM- and Arp/PAM-expressing bacteria acquire active plasmin even in the presence of plasma points to the possibility that bacteria gain an unregulatable plasminogen activator due to the deposition of plasmin(ogen)-streptokinase complexes on the streptococcal surfaces.The key role of plasmin is to degrade fibrin (43Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 44Ploplis V.A. Carmeliet P. Vazirzadeh S. van Vlaenderen I. Moons I. Plow E.F. Collen D. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, due to its broad specificity, plasmin can serve a host of other functions, e.g. cleavage of connective tissue proteins and basement membrane components, and activation of latent metalloproteinases. Cells that are able to generate plasmin on their surface may therefore use it to degrade physiological barriers other than fibrin. Indeed, plasmin-induced matrix degradation has been shown to facilitate the tissue penetration of tumor cells exhibiting an increased surface-associated plasminogen activation (45Mignatti P. Robbins E. Rifkin D.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 46Vassalli J.-D. Sappino A.-P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The present results as well as data published by other investigators suggest that bacteria and certain mammalian cells may use similar mechanisms to cause pericellular proteolysis. Recent results using in vivomodels suggest that surface-bound plasmin(ogen) can contribute to bacterial invasion. Thus, expression of a surface-bound plasminogen activator vastly increased the virulence of Y. pestis by facilitating their dissemination from the site of infection in the skin of mice (7Sodeinde O.A. Subrahmanyam Y. Stark K. Quan T. Bao Y. Goguen J. Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasminogen boosted spirochtemia in mice infected with the plasminogen-binding bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi (9Coleman J.L. Gebbia J.A. Piesman J. Degen J.L. Bugge T.H. Benach J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 1111-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that plasmin bound to the streptococcal surface may also function as a means to break tissue barriers, thereby promoting the spreading of these bacteria. The results presented here emphasize the unique property of some group A streptococci to expose a surface protein that binds plasminogen with high affinity, and at the same time to secrete a highly potent plasminogen activator that likely activates the surface-bound plasminogen. The joint role for protein PAM and streptokinase in the acquisition of surface-bound plasmin by group A streptococci associated with skin infections is yet another facet of the complex interplay that governs host-parasite relationships. Plasminogen is a single chain 92-kDa glycoprotein present in plasma (∼200 mg/liter) and in extracellular fluids. The protein contains five characteristic kringle domains that mediate interactions with multiple ligands, such as fibrin(ogen), α2-antiplasmin (α2AP), 1The abbreviations used are: α2AP, α2-antiplasmin; Arp4, IgA-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; IgA, immunoglobulin A; PAM, plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction;ska, streptokinase gene. 1The abbreviations used are: α2AP, α2-antiplasmin; Arp4, IgA-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; IgA, immunoglobulin A; PAM, plasminogen-binding group A streptococcal M-like protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction;ska, streptokinase gene. and cellular plasminogen receptors (1Castellino F.J.

In vivo, two specific activators, the tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase, convert the single-chain zymogen to a two-chain enzyme, plasmin, by cleavage at a single site (4Robbins K.C. Summaria L Hsieh B. Shah R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2333-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin efficiently degrades fibrin and probably also participates in the breakdown of soft tissue glycoproteins (5Saksela O. Rifkin D.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 93-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The plasma concentration of active plasmin is normally low, due to its rapid inactivation by proteinase inhibitors, primarily α2AP. Under pathophysiological conditions some pathogens, including group A, C, and G streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, secrete highly specific and potent plasminogen activators such as streptokinase and staphylokinase, respectively (1Castellino F.J. Semin. Thromb. Haemost. 1984; 10: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Ponting C.P. Marshall J.M. Cederholm-Williams S.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolys. 1992; 3: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Other bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Yersinia pestis, express surface-bound plasminogen activators (6Leytus S.P.

Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Evidence suggest that plasmin generated by bacterial plasminogen activators contributes to virulence, possibly by facilitating bacterial penetration through host barriers (7Sodeinde O.A. Subrahmanyam Y. Stark K. Quan T. Bao Y. Goguen J. Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that many virulent bacterial species express surface proteins capable of binding plasmin(ogen) without causing its activation (8Boyle M.D.P. Lottenberg R. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Some of these can also contribute to bacterial dissemination (9Coleman J.L. Gebbia J.A. Piesman J. Degen J.L. Bugge T.H. Benach J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 1111-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). For Streptococcus pyogenes(group A streptococci), a major causative agent of both mucosal and skin infection in humans, four major types of surface proteins have been forwarded as candidate plasmin(ogen)-binding proteins. Of these the dehydrogenase-like Plr protein (10Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D.P. J. Biol.

A., XIIIth Lancefield International Symposium on Streptococcci and Streptococcal Diseases, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, Sep. 16–20, 1996, 1996, 87, (abstr.).Google Scholar) also binds plasminogen. Some members of the M protein family, a well known class of surface-exposed streptococcal virulence determinants (14Fischetti V.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), have been shown to capture plasmin(ogen) indirectly, through fibrinogen (15Wang H. Lottenberg R. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 18: 153-166Google Scholar, 16Christner R. Li Z. Raeder R. Podbielski A. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1997; 175: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, a set of group A streptococcal strains, associated with skin infection (17Martin D.R.J. Voss L.M. Walker S.J. Lennon D. Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1994; 13: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Colman G. Tanna A. Efstratiou A. Gaworzewska E. J. Med.

Dis. 1996; 173: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), expose M-like proteins that bind plasminogen as well as plasmin, directly and with high affinity (20Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Carlsson Wistedt A. Ringdahl U. Müller-Esterl W. Sjöbring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For one of these proteins, PAM (plasminogen-binding group Astreptococcal M-like protein) from type 53 group A streptococci, a plasminogen-binding sequence characterized by two 13-amino acid residues long repeats (a1 and a2), has been identified in its surface-exposed variable NH2-terminal domain. Similar motifs are also present in M-like proteins from the other “skin” strains (21Carlsson Wistedt A. Ringdahl U. Müller-Esterl W. Sjöbring U. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we have set out to study the molecular requirements for the binding and activation of plasminogen by PAM-expressing bacteria. We demonstrate a joint role for the plasminogen-binding motif in PAM and streptokinase in the acquisition and exposure of plasmin at the surface of group A streptococci. DISCUSSIONGroup A streptococci elaborate at least two classes of plasmin(ogen)-binding proteins, i.e. secretory proteins such as streptokinase and streptococcal cysteine proteinase (38Poon-King R. Bannan J. Viteri A. Cu G. Zabriskie J.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and surface attached proteins such as PAM (20Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Plr (10Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 45-kDa protein (13Pancholi, V., Fischetti, V. A., XIIIth Lancefield International Symposium on Streptococcci and Streptococcal Diseases, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, Sep. 16–20, 1996, 1996, 87, (abstr.).Google Scholar). Moreover, group A streptococci can capture plasmin(ogen) indirectly through fibrinogen which in turn binds to M-like proteins (15Wang H. Lottenberg R. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 18: 153-166Google Scholar). Such a multiplicity of interactions with the key player of the fibrinolytic pathway suggests that the plasmin(ogen)-binding property carries a selective advantage to streptococci, motivating an analysis of the relative importance and biological role of the different mechanisms.In the present work we have focused on the role of protein PAM, a member of the streptococcal M family of surface proteins. To assess the contribution of the PAM a-repeats for in vitro plasmin acquisition by group A streptococci, we grafted them on the plasmin(ogen) non-binding protein Arp4, another member of the M protein family. We chose Arp4 as the “recipient” molecule since this protein and PAM are similar in many ways. Thus, both proteins are anchored to the bacterial cell wall through their highly conserved COOH-terminal segments, they contain three conserved C-repeats in the COOH-terminal half of the protein, and have surface-exposed variable NH2-terminal regions. Moreover, both PAM and Arp can be predicted to form α-helical coiled coil dimers as a consequence of their high contents of characteristic heptad repeats (39Nilson B.H.K. Frick I.-M. Åkesson P. Forsén S. Åkerström B. Björck L. Wikström M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13688-13699Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Finally, the binding patterns of PAM and Arp resemble one another: (i) both proteins bind C4bp with high affinity through a site in the NH2-terminal hypervariable domain (40Johnsson E. Thern A. Dahlbäck B. Hedén L.-O. Wikström M. Lindahl G. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3021-3029PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) they do not bind fibrinogen; (iii) a unique binding property (i.e. plasminogen-binding for PAM and IgA-binding for Arp4) is for both proteins located in the central region of their NH2-terminal domains. The experiments showed that replacement of the IgA-binding site of Arp by the a-repeats of PAM was necessary and sufficient to endow group A streptococci expressing two (JRS145) or three (JRS4) of the other putative plasmin(ogen)-binding surface proteins (10Broder C.C. Lottenberg R. von Mering G.O. Johnston K.H. Boyle M.D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4922-4928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pancholi, V., Fischetti, V. A., XIIIth Lancefield International Symposium on Streptococcci and Streptococcal Diseases, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, Sep. 16–20, 1996, 1996, 87, (abstr.).Google Scholar, 15Wang H. Lottenberg R. Boyle M.D.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 18: 153-166Google Scholar) with the capacity to bind plasmin and plasminogen, thereby emphasizing the power of the PAM motif in relation to other structures believed to contribute to group A streptococcal plasmin(ogen) acquisition. Moreover, the data establish PAM as the most well characterized cell-surface receptor for plasminogen and the a1 repeat of 13 residues as the smallest and best defined internal plasminogen acceptor site known, making it a candidate for analyses of structural requirements for interactions between kringles and sequences lacking carboxyl-terminal lysines.The binding to PAM is mediated through the lysine-binding site(s) of a plasminogen fragment comprising its first three kringle domains (20Berge A. Sjöbring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25417-25424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principal physiological regulator of plasmin, α2AP, binds to related site(s) (41Wiman B. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 142-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Given the high affinity for the interaction with plasmin(ogen), this protease is likely to be protected from regulation by α2AP when bound by PAM-expressing streptococci. Our finding that absorption and activation of plasminogen on PAM- and Arp/PAM-expressing streptococci can take place in plasma supports such a notion. Since the binding is mediated through lysine-binding site(s), the catalytic domain of plasminogen remains accessible by the major streptococcal plasminogen activator, streptokinase. Indeed, streptokinase binds to PAM-expressing bacteria or to PAM-coated polyacrylamide beads only when they have been pre-absorbed with plasminogen. 2U. Sjöbring, unpublished observation. This suggests that streptokinase might bind and activate PAM-bound plasminogen although our present experiments do not entirely rule out the possibility that a cycle of dissociation from and association with PAM is required to allow plasminogen activation in solution. Unlike plasmin in solution, neither the plasminogen-streptokinase complex nor the plasmin-streptokinase complex can be inactivated by α2AP (42Cederholm-Williams S.A. De Cock F. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore the finding that PAM- and Arp/PAM-expressing bacteria acquire active plasmin even in the presence of plasma points to the possibility that bacteria gain an unregulatable plasminogen activator due to the deposition of plasmin(ogen)-streptokinase complexes on the streptococcal surfaces.The key role of plasmin is to degrade fibrin (43Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 794-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 44Ploplis V.A. Carmeliet P. Vazirzadeh S. van Vlaenderen I. Moons I. Plow E.F. Collen D. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, due to its broad specificity, plasmin can serve a host of other functions, e.g. cleavage of connective tissue proteins and basement membrane components, and activation of latent metalloproteinases. Cells that are able to generate plasmin on their surface may therefore use it to degrade physiological barriers other than fibrin. Indeed, plasmin-induced matrix degradation has been shown to facilitate the tissue penetration of tumor cells exhibiting an increased surface-associated plasminogen activation (45Mignatti P. Robbins E. Rifkin D.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 46Vassalli J.-D. Sappino A.-P. Belin D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The present results as well as data published by other investigators suggest that bacteria and certain mammalian cells may use similar mechanisms to cause pericellular proteolysis. Recent results using in vivomodels suggest that surface-bound plasmin(ogen) can contribute to bacterial invasion. Thus, expression of a surface-bound plasminogen activator vastly increased the virulence of Y. pestis by facilitating their dissemination from the site of infection in the skin of mice (7Sodeinde O.A. Subrahmanyam Y. Stark K. Quan T. Bao Y. Goguen J. Science. 1992; 258: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Moreover, plasminogen boosted spirochtemia in mice infected with the plasminogen-binding bacterial species Borrelia burgdorferi (9Coleman J.L. Gebbia J.A. Piesman J. Degen J.L. Bugge T.H. Benach J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 1111-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that plasmin bound to the streptococcal surface may also function as a means to break tissue barriers, thereby promoting the spreading of these bacteria. The results presented here emphasize the unique property of some group A streptococci to expose a surface protein that binds plasminogen with high affinity, and at the same time to secrete a highly potent plasminogen activator that likely activates the surface-bound plasminogen.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that very small mechanical strains interact with growth factors in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1. Human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were cultured on a precoated silicone membrane in a device that imposes a highly uniform biaxial strain. VSMCs cultured on fibronectin were treated with cyclic 1-Hz strains of 0, 1, or 4%, and MMPs were assayed by Western analysis or gelatin zymography. Small strains did not induce MMP-1 in VSMCs, but strain was a potent inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced synthesis of MMP-1. In contrast, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels were not changed by PDGF and/or mechanical strain. VSMCs strained on the 120-kDa chymotryptic fragment of fibronectin or RGD peptides suppressed PDGF-induced expression of MMP-1, indicating that this effect is not mediated by the heparin-binding domain or connecting segment-1 of fibronectin. Northern analysis of ets-1, a transcriptional activator of MMP-1 expression, showed that strain down-regulated ets-1expression, whereas c-fos expression was augmented. Thus, small deformations can selectively suppress MMP-1 synthesis by VSMCs, demonstrating the exquisite sensitivity of the cell to mechanical stimuli.

In the vessel wall as well as in other tissues, adaptation occurs through constant cellular migration, proliferation, and death and extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation. In stable normal tissues, the rates of these processes are so slow that they may appear almost dormant, whereas in injured or repairing tissues, the processes may all be greatly accelerated. In any wound repair, it is critical that the repaired tissue be sufficiently strong to withstand mechanical forces the tissue may experience. However, while the importance of biochemical mediators such as cytokines and growth factors in tissue repair and homeostasis is clear (1Ross R.

Med. 1994; 330: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), how mechanical forces may regulate tissue structure and repair is less understood. The regulation of the wound repair response by mechanical forces is particularly relevant to the cardiovascular system, which must withstand large dynamic fluctuations in strain. Several studies have shown that mechanical forces exert important regulatory effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), 1The abbreviations used are: VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FN, fibronectin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum. 1The abbreviations used are: VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; FN, fibronectin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum. including increased collagen synthesis and cell growth by mechanical strain (4Leung D.Y.M.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 8Wilson E. Sudhir K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that mechanical strain stimulates a mitogenic response in rat VSMCs through induction of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and this induction is regulated by specific extracellular matrix interactions. Thus, VSMCs may sense mechanical stimuli (mechanotransduction) and change arterial structure. One way VSMCs can change arterial structure is through the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The MMPs are members of a family of enzymes that digest specific components of the extracellular matrix and may play a critical role in tissue repair and remodeling. The enzymatic activity of MMPs is regulated at several levels, including transcription; for example, cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and PDGF induce secretion of MMP proenzymes (9Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M.K. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 10Yanagi H. Sasaguri Y. Sugama K. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Atherosclerosis. 1992; 91: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These latent proenzymes can then be activated in the extracellular space (11Kleiner Jr., D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 12Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Roswit W.T. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5886-5889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the active MMPs may be inhibited by TIMPs (tissue-typeinhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase), specific endogenous inhibitors of the MMPs. Several MMP promoters contain the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, which binds AP-1, transcription factor dimeric combinations of c-Fos and c-Jun, as well as polyoma enhancer activator sites (PEA3), which bind the Ets family of transcription factors (13Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14Tremble P. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Several recent lines of evidence suggest that mechanotransduction through the extracellular matrix may regulate secretion of MMPs. First, James et al. (15James T.W. Wagner R. White L.A. Zwolak R.M. Brickerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 427-437Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that direct mechanical wounding of a cellular monolayer of VSMCs induces MMP expression. Second, perturbing the cytoskeleton of rabbit synovial fibroblasts induces MMP expression (16Werb Z. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. Aggeler J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Third, Huhtala et al. (17Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that domains of fibronectin (FN) may interact with different integrin subunits to either induce or suppress collagenase (MMP-1) expression in rabbit synovial fibroblast cells. Finally, we and others (18Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 94: 2493-2503Crossref Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 19Lee R.T. Schoen F.J. Loree H.M. Lark M.W. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1070-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) have observed that, in vivo, MMP-1 is overexpressed at sites of mechanical overload in the diseased artery. Using a mechanical deformation device that applies a highly uniform biaxial strain field over the culture substrate, we explored the hypothesis that mechanical deformations regulate MMP-1 secretion by VSMCs. Surprisingly, we found that very small strains do not induce MMP-1, but abolish induction of MMP-1 by PDGF or TNF-α, demonstrating that mechanical stimuli may potently interact with biochemical signals in regulating extracellular matrix metabolism. DMEM and Ham's F-12 were obtained from BioWhittaker, Inc. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solution, Hanks' salt solution, fibronectin, 120-kDa chymotryptic fibronectin fragment, GRGDSP peptide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and other materials required for tissue culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Ovalbumin, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, Tris, glycine, sodium chloride, and sodium dodecyl sulfate were obtained from Sigma. PDGF- BB, IL-1α, and TNF-α were from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA), and collagen was from Cell Biomaterials (Palo Alto, CA). Prestained low molecular mass markers and acrylamide gel buffer were purchased from Bio-Rad. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Human VSMCs were derived from explants of discarded portions of saphenous vein after coronary bypass surgery from Brigham and Women's Hospital. VSMCs were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin sulfate. These conditions are selective for growth of smooth muscle cells over endothelial cells (20Gimbrone M.A. Cotran R.S. Lab. Invest. 1975; 33: 16-27PubMed Google Scholar). VSMCs were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 up to passages 6–7 for experiments. Approximately 50% of cells using these techniques stained positively for α-actin. Mechanical deformation was applied to a thin and transparent membrane on which cells were cultured, an approach that produces controlled cellular strain as well as visualization of cells. This device provides a nearly homogeneous biaxial strain profile, i.e. strains that are equal at all locations on the membrane and in all directions (21Schaffer J.L. Rizen M. L'Italien G.J.L. Benbrahim A. Megerman J. Gerstenfeld L.C. Gray M.L. J. Orthop. Res. 1993; 12: 709-719Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An advantage of this device over some commonly used systems is that it eliminates locations on the substrate that have very high strains (20–30%) in one direction. Each culture dish consists of a plastic (Kynar) cylinder and a circular silicone elastometric membrane, which is the culture surface. The membrane undergoes cyclic tensile deformation as the platen assembly moves sinusoidally with a frequency and amplitude derived by the motor speed and the cam size, respectively. We have previously measured membrane strains with a high resolution video device (22Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); the cams used for this study gave strains of 1.0 ± 0.1% and 4.2 ± 0.1% (n = 18 different locations for each). The cell culture silicone membrane itself supports negligible adhesion of VSMCs. In these experiments, three different methods of supporting adhesion were used: precoating with intact FN, 120FN (the 120-kDa chymotryptic peptide of FN that contains the RGD sequence), and RGD peptide coupled to ovalbumin or collagen. When VSMCs were plated on membranes precoated with equivalent concentrations (2 μg/ml) of FN, 120FN, and ovalbumin-coupled RGD peptide, there was no morphological difference in VSMCs. For the preparation of VSMCs to be subjected to mechanical strain, autoclaved membrane dishes were coated with 2 μg/ml FN in 13 ml of Hanks' solution for 6–12 h at 4 °C and then washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. VSMCs were plated on the coated membrane dish at a density of 400,000 cells/dish in 13 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS and incubated 16–24 h. For culturing VSMCs on the collagen, 50 μg/ml collagen was used. VSMCs were then washed four times with 10 ml of Hanks' solution to remove residual serum and incubated with 10 ml of serum-free “IT” medium (equal volumes of DMEM and Ham's F-12 supplemented with 1 μmol/liter insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin) for 48 h. Before mechanical strain or cytokine stimulation, 10 ml of fresh IT medium was exchanged. Mechanical strain was then applied at a specified constant frequency and amplitude, and control dishes received no mechanical strain. The coupling of RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides with ovalbumin was performed as described by Haugen et al. (23Haugen P.K. McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Furcht L.T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2733-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (by weight) of GRGDSP (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro) peptides and ovalbumin were solubilized and mixed with a 10-fold mass of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride dissolved in deionized water. After mixing overnight in the dark at 4 °C, the coupled samples were extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess carbodiimide and uncoupled peptides (10,000 exclusion membrane, Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc., Houston, TX). Conditioned media were concentrated by Centricon-10 miniconcentrators (Amicon, Inc.). Samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris base (pH 8.5), 0.2 mglycine, and 20% methanol. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS washing buffer (20 mmTris base (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h. For the detection of collagenase I (MMP-1), the membrane was incubated with 1:2000 diluted rabbit anti-human collagenase polyclonal antibody (generous gift of Merck Research Laboratories) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed with TBS washing buffer for 30 min. The secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to peroxidase, was diluted 1:4000 and incubated with the membrane for 30 min. After washing with TBS washing buffer for 30 min, the membrane was developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). For the detection of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, 1:4000 diluted rabbit anti-human TIMP-1 polyclonal antibody and 1:1000 diluted rabbit anti-human TIMP-2 polyclonal antibody (gift of Amgen) were used, respectively. Quantitation of Western analyses was performed by scanning densitometry using the Optimas 5.2 software package (Optimas Corp., Bothell, Washington). Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Conditioned media were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. The gel was run in Tris/glycine buffer for 4 h and then incubated in 2.5% Triton X-100 solution for 15 min twice to remove SDS. To detect gelatinase activity, the gel was incubated in reaction buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 0.05% Brij 35 overnight at 37 °C. The gelatinolytic activity was shown by staining with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, and 30% (v/v) methanol and destaining with 10% (v/v) acetic acid and 30% (v/v) methanol. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate and phenol chloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63144) Google Scholar). The full-length 1.4-kilobase pair MMP-1 and 652-base pair TIMP-1 cDNAs were used as probes (gift of Merck Research Laboratories). For the preparation of the ets-1 probe, VSMCs were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml) for 1 h after 48 h of serum deprivation. Purified RNA (2 μg) was used for the synthesis of cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Synthesis of the ets-1 cDNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The primer set for the synthesis of the ets-1 cDNA probe contained the 5′-AGC-CGA-CTC-TCA-CCA-TCA-3′ sense and 5′-TCT-GCA-AGG-TGT-CTG-TCT-GG-3′ antisense oligonucleotides. The 669-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was used as the ets-1 probe. The primer set for the synthesis of c-fos contained 5′-CTA-CGA-GGC-GTC-ATC-CTC-CCG-3′ and 5′-TAC-GGC-GTT-GGC-CTC-CTC-CCT-CGA-3′, yielding a 431-base pair cDNA. The probes were radiolabeled by the random priming method with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Stratagene). For Northern blotting, 15 μg of RNA was loaded on a 1.0% formaldehyde gel (2.0 m), transferred to a nylon membrane (Amersham Life Science, Inc.), and UV-cross-linked with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). The probe was hybridized with ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at 68 °C for 1 h. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC and 0.05% SDS solution for 30–40 min (three times at room temperature) and with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS solution with continuous shaking at 50 °C for 40 min. The membrane was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. We first evaluated the effect of mechanical strain on MMP-1 synthesis by VSMCs plated on intact FN. When cells were subjected to 0, 1, and 4% cyclic mechanical strains at 1 Hz in multiple experiments, mechanical strain did not induce MMP-1 expression, whereas PDGF-BB induced MMP-1 (9.2 ± 1.1-fold, n = 3). Surprisingly, 1% cyclic mechanical strain suppressed 76 ± 24% (n = 3) of PDGF-induced MMP-1 expression, and 4% strain suppressed 89 ± 15% of MMP-1 expression (Fig. 1 A). In these studies, no morphological changes in cells were detected following strains of 1 or 4%, and we have previously demonstrated that cellular injury and fibroblast growth factor-2 release occur only at strains above 10% in VSMCs (22Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggested that specific regulation and not merely cellular injury caused suppression of MMP-1 synthesis by mechanical deformations under these conditions. Huhtala et al. (17Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the 120-kDa chymotryptic fragment of fibronectin (120FN), which contains the RGD sequence but does not contain the connecting segment-1 of fibronectin, can induce MMP-1 secretion by rabbit synovial fibroblasts. Thus, our finding that small mechanical strains on intact FN can suppress cytokine-induced MMP-1 secretion raised the hypothesis that mechanical strains suppress MMP-1 secretion through non-RGD domains of FN. To explore this hypothesis, we plated VSMCs on 2 μg/ml 120FN, a concentration sufficient to support equivalent amounts of adhesion of cells as intact FN coating of a membrane. In contrast to previous reports on rabbit synovial fibroblasts, plating VSMCs on 120FN did not induce MMP-1, nor did mechanical strain induce MMP-1 expression by VSMCs on 120FN. PDGF induced MMP-1 in VSMCs plated on 120FN (5.2 ± 1.9-fold, n = 3), and 1 and 4% cyclic mechanical strains suppressed PDGF-induced MMP-1 by 37 ± 15% and 50 ± 23%, respectively (Fig. 1 B). This experiment indicated that strain did not inhibit MMP-1 synthesis through adhesion to the connecting segment-1 region of FN. In addition, we studied VSMCs plated on ovalbumin-coupled RGD peptide (2 μg/ml). MMP-1 expression by VSMCs on RGD peptides was similar to that by VSMCs on intact FN or 120FN (7.0 ± 3.3-fold, n = 3). Similar to the effects of FN and 120FN, PDGF induced MMP-1 expression on RGD peptides, but 1 and 4% mechanical strains also suppressed 52 ± 28% and 72 ± 28% of PDGF-induced MMP-1 synthesis, respectively (Fig. 1 C). These data further support the finding that suppression of MMP-1 by small mechanical strains does not require the connecting segment-1 domain of FN and that mechanical strain through the RGD domain is sufficient for this effect. Although many MMPs have similar promoter elements, expression of the gelatinases, particularly MMP-2, may be independent of MMP-1 expression (25Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of MMP-2 (72-kDa gelatinase) and MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase) by VSMCs in response to mechanical stimuli and PDGF treatment. Neither mechanical strain nor PDGF treatment changed constitutive MMP-2 expression (Fig. 2 A). VSMCs plated on 120FN or ovalbumin-coupled RGD peptide also expressed similar levels of MMP-2 regardless of PDGF treatment or mechanical strain (Fig. 2, B and C). We also found MMP-9 activity in VSMCs plated on FN, but the activity was very weak compared with MMP-2 activity. Neither PDGF treatment nor mechanical strain increased MMP-9 expression (Fig. 2 A). On 120FN or ovalbumin-coupled RGD peptides, MMP-9 induction was not observed compared with intact FN, and neither PDGF treatment nor mechanical strain increased MMP-9 expression (Fig. 2, B and C). These results eliminated the possibility that all MMPs were down-regulated by mechanical strain. We then explored the effects of mechanical strain on synthesis of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, endogenous inhibitors of metalloproteinases. On FN, TIMP-1 expression was constitutive, whereas PDGF induced TIMP-1 expression by 1.9 ± 0.4-fold (n = 3). Similar to the effect of mechanical strain on MMP-1 synthesis, strains of 1 and 4% modestly suppressed PDGF-induced TIMP-1 expression by 27 ± 7% and 48 ± 8%, respectively (Fig. 3 A). When VSMCs were plated on 120FN, TIMP-1 expression was similar to that of VSMCs plated on intact FN, and PDGF also induced TIMP-1 expression by 3.6 ± 2.2-fold (n = 3). On 120FN, mechanical strain alone did not affect TIMP-1 expression, but 1 and 4% strains suppressed PDGF-induced TIMP-1 expression by 23 ± 8% and 61 ± 53%, respectively (Fig. 3 B). When VSMCs were cultured on ovalbumin coupled to RGD peptides, TIMP-1 expression was not induced, but PDGF induced TIMP-1 expression by 1.7 ± 0.1-fold. On RGD peptides, 1 and 4% mechanical strains suppressed PDGF-induced TIMP-1 expression by 31 ± 11% and 41 ± 35%, respectively (Fig. 3 C). These results showed that the effect of strain on TIMP-1 regulation by VSMCs plated on intact FN, 120FN, or RGD peptides was similar to the effect of strain on MMP-1 synthesis. In contrast to the effects of mechanical strain on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 expression, the expression of TIMP-2, the specific inhibitor of MMP-2, by VSMCs cultured on FN was not changed by PDGF treatment or mechanical strain (Fig. 4 A). When VSMCs were cultured on 120FN or ovalbumin-coupled RGD peptides, TIMP-2 expression was not induced. In response to PDGF treatment and/or mechanical strain, TIMP-2 expression by VSMCs plated on FN, 120FN, or RGD peptides was unchanged (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, while mechanical strain suppressed the synthesis of TIMP-1 and MMP-1, strain did not regulate TIMP-2 and MMP-2 expression. IL-1α and TNF-α are potent inducers of MMP-1 expression by human VSMCs (26Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrisey E. Unemori E. Lark M.W. Amento E. Libby P. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). To investigate if the effect of strain on MMP-1 expression is specific to induction by PDGF, we treated VSMCs with IL-1α (10 ng/ml) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) after 48 h of serum deprivation. Cyclic mechanical strain suppressed MMP-1 synthesis induced by TNF-α, but strain did not suppress IL-1α-induced MMP-1 synthesis (Fig. 5). Extracellular matrix components may influence both MMP-1 expression and mechano-responsiveness (8Wilson E. Sudhir K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 27Tremble P. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Werb Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). VSMCs were plated on 50 μg/ml collagen, a concentration optimal for VSMC adherence to the silicone membrane. Similar to the response of VSMC plated on fibronectin, strain did not induce MMP-1 expression, but suppressed MMP-1 synthesis by PDGF induction even at 1% amplitude (Fig. 6). To explore potential mechanisms of regulation of MMP-1 and TIMP synthesis by mechanical strain, VSMCs cultured on fibronectin were subjected to 4% strain in the presence of PDGF after 2 days of serum deprivation. Northern analysis for MMP-1 showed that 4% strain suppressed steady-state MMP-1 mRNA levels, whereas TIMP-1 mRNA levels were not appreciably changed (Fig. 7). Mechanical strains can induce c-Fos, a component of the AP-1 complex that can promote transcription of MMP-1. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminalkinase) is a signaling mechanism stimulated by physical stress (28Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D. Grover-Bardwick A. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3507-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) such as UV irradiation, heat shock, and several cytokines (29Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar, 30Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Rosette C. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Google Scholar); increased JNK activity is another mechanism by which mechanical strain may stimulate AP-1 activity (32Kumoro I. Kudo S. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Yazaki Y. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To explore the potential mechanism of MMP-1 suppression by strain, cultured VSMCs on FN were subjected to 4% strain. Induction of c-fos was observed after 30 min of strain (Fig. 8). In addition, JNK activity was not significantly affected (data not shown). Members of the Ets family of transcriptional activators also regulate MMP-1 expression by interacting with the AP-1 complex (33Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 34Butticè G. Duterque-Coquillaud M. Basuyaux J.P. Carrer S. Kurkinen M. Stéhelin D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2297-2306PubMed Google Scholar, 35Basuyaux J.P. Ferreira E. Stéhelin D. Butticè G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26188-26195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Northern analysis of ets-1 demonstrated that strain suppressed ets-1 expression by PDGF (Fig. 8). Therefore, the suppression of MMP-1 by small strains may be related to suppression of ets-1, but not suppression of c-fos. Previous studies have suggested that mechanical injury to cells and cytoskeletal deformation stimulate MMP synthesis and secretion. In addition, activation of components of the AP-1 complex, a potent positive regulator of MMP-1 transcription, can occur with mechanical deformation of cells. Thus, we initially anticipated that small mechanical deformations of VSMCs would induce MMP-1 synthesis. In addition, we hypothesized that this induction would be independent of, or synergistic with, biochemical stimulation of MMP-1 synthesis, such as by PDGF. Surprisingly, we found that small mechanical deformations do not induce MMP-1 synthesis, but potently suppress MMP-1 synthesis by PDGF. These findings indicate that small mechanical deformations may be a powerful influence on cellular control of extracellular matrix degradation. Huhtala et al. (17Huhtala P. Humphries M.J. McCarthy J.B. Tremble P.M. Werb Z. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and Werb et al. (36Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) showed that intact fibronectin does not induce MMP-1, but the chymotryptic fragment 120FN containing the RGD domain induces MMP-1 synthesis by rabbit synovial fibroblasts. In addition, the ability of non-RGD domains of fibronectin to suppress MMP-1 synthesis appears to be mediated by interactions with α4β1-integrins rather than the RGD-binding classical fibronectin receptor, α5β1. In contrast, in these experiments, when human VSMCs were plated on fibronectin, 120FN, or RGD peptides, MMP-1 was not induced. The difference between these results may be due to differences between rabbit synovial fibroblasts and human vascular smooth muscle cells. For example, human VSMCs have very little α4β1by immunoprecipitation (37Lee R.T. Berditchevski F. Cheng G.C. Hemler M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), so perhaps non-RGD domains of fibronectin cannot regulate MMP-1 synthesis by VSMCs. The similarity of the strain effect on MMP-1 regulation by VSMCs on collagen implies that strain itself might be a powerful regulator of MMP-1 synthesis regardless of the type of extracellular matrix component. The matrix, integrins, plasma membrane, cytoskeleton, and nucleus are interconnected, and mechanical deformation of any cellular component may lead to a change in shape of another cellular component (38Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar, 39Wang N. Butler J.P. Ingber D.E.

Science. 1997; 276: 1345-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that integrins provide anchors to link a cytoskeleton or nuclear mechanotransduction mechanism to the extracellular space. Studies by Wilson et al. (8Wilson E. Sudhir K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) suggest that αv-integrins may regulate mechanotransduction, even when cells are adherent to matrices other than fibronectin or vitronectin. Further studies will be necessary to determine if mechanical strain through specific α- or β-integrin subunits can regulate MMP synthesis. One of the advantages of the mechanical strain device used in this experiment is that strains are precise and highly uniform. In many other types of cell-stretching devices, regions of the cell culture substrate have very high strains compared with the mean strain. For example, in one commonly used device, the strain can range from 0 to 33% depending on the location and orientation of the cell (21Schaffer J.L. Rizen M. L'Italien G.J.L. Benbrahim A. Megerman J. Gerstenfeld L.C. Gray M.L. J. Orthop. Res. 1993; 12: 709-719Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that cellular injury and fibroblast growth factor-2 release occur only when VSMCs are exposed to membrane strains higher than 10% (22Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Imposing small strains with this cellular deformation device prevents confusing paracrine effects (such as fibroblast growth factor-2 release) from non-uniform strain profiles. In addition, the precise strains imposed in these experiments eliminate the possibility that suppression of MMP-1 by strains as small as 1% was due to cellular injury. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrating that MMP-2 and TIMP-2 syntheses are not suppressed by small strains indicate that the suppression of MMP-1 is selective. These experiments explored some potential mechanisms of the suppression of MMP-1 synthesis by strain. Strain augmented c-fosexpression in the presence of PDGF, but suppressed ets-1expression. However, there are at least 30 members of the Ets-1 family, and mechanisms other than ets-1 down-regulation could play a major role. Westermarck et al. (42Westermarck J. Seth A. Kähäri V.-M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that PU.1, a member of the Ets family, can suppress MMP-1 synthesis. In our studies, however, we have not found PU.1 expression by VSMCs. Our studies suggest that direct effects of the PDGF receptor are not primarily responsible for the effects of strain, as strain could also suppress MMP-1 induction by TNF-α. We have evaluated cytoskeletal changes under these conditions using rhodamine-phalloidin staining, which demonstrated no clear effect of strains on the actin cytoskeleton (data not shown); however, we cannot exclude important cytoskeletal changes as a mechanism for mechanotransduction under these conditions. Previous reports have described mechanically mediated synthesis and release of PDGF from rat VSMCs subjected to mechanical deformation (7Wilson E. Mai Q. Sudhir K. Weiss R.H. Ives H.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In pilot studies, we have not observed induction of the PDGF-A or PDGF-B genes in human VSMCs exposed to the small mechanical deformations used in the present study. 2J.-H. Yang, W. H. Briggs, P. Libby, and R. T. Lee, unpublished observations. It is possible that species-specific responses or differences in the mechanical strain devices could explain these differences. Furthermore, mechanically mediated release of PDGF would not explain why small strains can suppress the induction of MMP-1 by exogenous PDGF. In vivo, MMPs are frequently found in tissues undergoing repair or remodeling, such as high stress locations of the human atherosclerotic lesion (18Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Lark M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 94: 2493-2503Crossref Scopus (2192) Google Scholar, 19Lee R.T. Schoen F.J. Loree H.M. Lark M.W. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1070-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 43Henney A.M. Wakeley P.R. Davis M.J. Foster K. Hembry R. Murphy R. Humphries S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8154-8158Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In these circumstances, cytokines and growth factors are generally abundant and regulate the repair process. However, cells in a repairing tissue must also produce a new tissue that can withstand mechanical forces imposed on that tissue, such as the constant tension of the skin or the pulsatile forces of blood pressure in the artery. Although strains of only 1% are imperceptible to the eye, this magnitude of cellular deformation was sufficient to suppress MMP-1 synthesis. This demonstrates the exquisite sensitivity of the cell to mechanical stimuli and the powerful influence of mechanical forces on responses to growth factors. Unraveling mechanotransduction mechanisms will likely reveal complex interactions with other systems of signal transduction."

The CreA repressor plays a major role in the control of the expression of the alc regulon, encoding proteins required for the ethanol utilization pathway. It represses directly, at the transcriptional level, the specific transacting gene alcR, the two structural genes alcA and aldA, and other alc genes in all physiological growth conditions. Among the seven putative CreA sites identified in the alcApromoter region, we have determined the CreA functional targets in AlcR constitutive and derepressed genetic backgrounds. Two different divergent CreA sites, of which one overlaps a functional AlcR inverted repeat site, are largely responsible for alcA repression. Totally derepressed alcA expression is achieved when these two CreA sites are disrupted in addition to another single site, which overlaps the functional palindromic induction target. The fact that derepression is always associated with alcA overexpression is consistent with a competition model between AlcR and CreA for their cognate targets in the same region of the alcApromoter.Our results also indicate that the CreA repressor is necessary and sufficient for the total repression of the alcA gene.

Aspergillus nidulans is a versatile organism capable of growing on a wide variety of nutrients by expressing enzymes and permeases involved in specific utilization pathways. When ethanol or a related carbon source is added to a growing culture of the fungusA. nidulans, the alc genes are expressed. They comprise not only the genes necessary for ethanol degradation, namelyalcA and aldA, encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I (ADHI) 1The abbreviations used are: ADHI, alcohol dehydrogenase I; EMK, ethyl methyl ketone. and aldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively (1Gwynne D.I.

Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but at least four otheralc genes (alcO, -M, -S, and -U), recently identified (3Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which are clustered in the same locus in chromosome VII, as are alcA and alcR. This latter gene encodes the specific transactivator of the ethanol utilization pathway, AlcR, a zinc binuclear cluster protein of the C6 class, with features that differentiate it from the other proteins of this class (4Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Sequeval D. Felenbok B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The AlcR protein is able to bindin vitro to specific DNA single sites occurring as either direct or inverted repeats (6Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An interesting aspect of AlcR activity is that in vivo, only repeated sites mediate specific transcriptional induction (6Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 8Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The alcR gene itself is subjected to a positive feedback control (9Lockington R. Scazzocchio C. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) via the binding of the AlcR protein to targets in the alcR promoter (6Kulmburg P. Sequeval D. Lenouvel F. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1932-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The strong inducible alcA promoter encompasses three clustered AlcR targets (10Kulmburg P. Judewicz N. Mathieu M. Lenouvel F. Sequeval D. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21146-21153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are responsible for the synergistic activation of the alcA gene (8Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When a favored carbon source such as glucose is added to the culture medium, transcription of the alc regulon is severely reduced (11Felenbok B. Kelly J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G. The Mycota III: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 369-380Google Scholar). This phenomenon is mediated by CreA, the repressor responsible for carbon catabolite repression in A. nidulans (12Bailey C. Arst Jr., H.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 51: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). CreA contains two Cys2-His2 fingers and is related to MIG1, the repressor responsible for glucose repression of several genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and to the mammalian Krox20/Egr and Wilm's tumor proteins (13Dowzer C.E.A. Kelly J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). CreA counterparts have also been found in other fungal species such as Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei (14Drysdale M.R. Kolze S.E. Kelly J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Strauss J. Mach R. Zeilinger S. Hartler G. Stoffler G. Wolschek M. Kubicek C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All of these proteins bind to a GC-rich motif. Binding sites for CreA, whose consensus sequence is 5′-(C/G)YGGRG-3′, have been identified in the alc regulon (11Felenbok B. Kelly J.M. Brambl R. Marzluf G. The Mycota III: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 369-380Google Scholar, 16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in the proline cluster (18Cubero B. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 405-415Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The repressor CreA exerts transcriptional repression on the trans-acting genealcR and independently on structural genes alcA and aldA (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A great number of CreA binding sites have been identified in the upstream regions of the alcR and alcA genes, and these sites are localized in the same region as the specific AlcR binding sites (16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In the alcRpromoter region, it has been shown that for at least one of the CreA binding sites overlapping the AlcR inverted repeat target, direct competition between the two regulators occurs both in vitro and in vivo. More generally, under nonrepressing physiological growth conditions (induced and noninduced), it was shown that both regulators control the expression of the alc genes (19Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Fillinger, S. (1996) Identification et Etude Fonctionnelle de Nouveaux Gènes Appartenant au Régulon Ethanol chez Aspergillus nidulans. Ph.D. thesis, University of Paris-Sud, France.Google Scholar). The interplay between these two circuits therefore regulates the expression of the ethanol regulon genes. In the alcA promoter, several CreA binding sites have been identified by sequence analysis. Three are close to or overlap AlcR binding sites. The alcA promoter is one of the strongest inducible genes in A. nidulans. Synergistic transcriptional activation by AlcR is mediated by three sets of AlcR repeat sites, which were shown to be functional in vivo and representalc upstream activating sequences (8Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The transcriptional induction of the alcA gene is absolutely dependent upon the presence of AlcR. In glucose-repressed conditions, the alcRgene is totally repressed, and as a consequence (by a cascade mechanism), alcA is not expressed (9Lockington R. Scazzocchio C. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to understand the mechanism of carbon catabolite repression in the alcA promoter. We have addressed several questions: (i) which CreA binding sites are functional in vivo; (ii) whether CreA is the only repressor responsible for alcA glucose repression; and (iii) whether there is competition between the activator AlcR and the repressor CreA for the same region in the alcA promoter in A. nidulans. The A. nidulans strain used as the host for transformation wasalcA − argB − uaZ −(alcA4951, argB2, pabaA1, yA2, uaZ11). Media and supplements were as described by Cove (21Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mycelia for Northern analyses and ADHI activities were grown for 7 h at 37 °C on 0.1% fructose as the sole carbon source. Induction was achieved by adding the gratuitous inducer ethyl methyl ketone (50 mm) or ethanol (50 mm). Cells were harvested after a further 2.5 h (induced conditions). Under repressed conditions, 1% glucose was added simultaneously with the inducer. The constitutive and derepressed pgpdA:alcR:argB plasmid (bAN8) was constructed as follows. The alcR coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the SalI–SalI (−1064 to +2848) fragment of the alcR gene, introducing an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and an NcoI site at the ATG. The EcoRI–SalI (−5 to +2848) fragment was cloned into the EcoRI–SalI sites of pBluescript SK+, resulting in plasmid bAN6. The EcoRI–NcoI fragment corresponding to the gpdA promoter was cloned into the EcoRI–NcoI sites of bAN6, resulting in bAN7. The XbaI–XbaI fragment (made blunt end), of the argB gene was cloned into the EcoRI site (made blunt end) of plasmid bAN7, resulting in plasmid bAN8. The pyrG:alcR:argB (bAN10) plasmid was constructed as follows. The pyrG promoter was amplified by polymerase chain reaction introducing an EcoRI at the 5′-end and an NcoI site at the 3′-end. The EcoRI–NcoI fragment was cloned in the EcoRI–NcoI sites of bAN6, resulting in plasmid bAN9. The argB gene was then cloned, as for bAN8, resulting in plasmid bAN10. ThealcA − argB − uaZ −strain was transformed with bAN8 or bAN10. Southern blot analysis of the selected argB+ transformants showed that the plasmids were integrated at the argB locus (data not shown). A plasmid deleted for the CreA binding sites C, D1, D2, and E was obtained by deleting the HindIII–PvuII (−738 to −423) fragment from plasmid bAuaZ, which contains the alcA gene (HindIII–KpnI (−738 to −2024) fragment) and the 3′ ClaI–XhoI fragment of the uaZgene able to complement by site-directed integration the uaZ11 translocation, resulting in plasmid bAN50. Disruption of CreA binding sites (A, B1, and B2) was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis carried out by the method of Kunkel et al. (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts D.J. Zabour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). A uracil-SK template (bANC), containing the alcA promoter from the MluI (−255) to ApaI (+19) sites, was mutagenized. Mutations in CreA sites A, B1, B2, B1B2, and AB1B2(single, double, and triple mutations) were confirmed by sequencing. Cloning of these mutated sequences was achieved by substituting the ApaI–ApaI or the MluI–ApaI fragments of bAN50 with the corresponding mutated sequences, resulting in plasmids pUA (A mutated), pUB1 (B1 mutated), pUB2(B2 mutated), pUB1B2(B1B2 mutated), and pUAB1B2 (AB1B2mutated). All of the plasmids were used to transform the gpdA:alcR(Tg) strain, resulting in the TgmA strain transformed by pUA, the TgmB1 strain transformed by pUB1, the TgmB2 strain transformed by pUB2, the TgmB1B2 strain transformed by pUB1B2, the TgmAB1B2strain transformed by pUAB1B2, and the TgΔCD1D2E strain transformed by bAN50. The pUB1B2 and pUAB1B2 were also used to transform the argB:pyrG:alcR (Tp) strain, resulting, respectively, in TpmB1B2 and TpmAB1B2 transformant strains. Southern blot analysis of the selected uaZ +transformants showed that the plasmids were integrated in a single copy at the uaZ locus (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from A. nidulans as described by Lockingtonet al. (23Lockington R.A. Sealy-Lewis H.N. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Davies R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), separated on agarose gels after denaturation by glyoxal (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and blotted on Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Corp.). Hybridization was carried out in 0.5 m sodium orthophosphate, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 65 °C for at least 14 h. The probes used were the entire genes either of alcR or alcA, cloned into Bluescript plasmids (1Gwynne D.I. Buxton F.P. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Lockington R.A. Scazzocchio C. Sealy-Lewis H.N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Felenbok B. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Sibley S. Gwynne D.I. Davies R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and labeled with [32P]dCTP using random hexanucleotide primers (Amersham). The membranes were also hybridized with aBamHI–KpnI restriction fragment containing the actin gene, isolated from the pSF5 plasmid (26Fidel S. Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), as an internal control to monitor the amount of mRNA loaded. Autoradiograms were developed at various times to avoid saturation of the film. Densitometric scanning was performed with a system Biosoft-Orkis. Experiments were repeated at least three times. The amount of specific mRNA was calculated relative to the actin signal. Observed variations among the various hybridizations were 20–30%. Gel electrophoresis and activity staining of ADHI were carried out according to the method described by Sealy-Lewis and Fairhurst (27Sealy-Lewis H.M. Fairhurst V. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Concentrations of protein from different extracts were equalized before loading onto a gel and verified by Coomassie staining. Densitometric scanning was performed. Variations of 20–30% were observed between experiments. Fig. 1 shows that seven CreA binding sites are localized in the alcA promoter. Two of them, A and B1, have been identified by footprint analysis (16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and the others, B2, C, D1, D2, and E, have been identified by sequence analysis through searching for the same consensus motif, 5′-(G/C)YGGRG-3′. We have shown previously thatin vitro CreA is able to bind to any of these sites even when the flanking DNA sequence is completely unrelated to A. nidulans, such as the polylinker region of a Bluescript plasmid (16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by in vitro analysis of CreA binding to the penicillin biosynthetic gene in A. nidulans, which is not subject to CreA control in vivo (29Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and was also suggested by Cubero and Scazzocchio (18Cubero B. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 405-415Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with the prncluster. The same conclusions were drawn after in vitrolocalization of MIG1 binding sites, the repressor responsible for glucose-repressed genes in S. cerevisiae (30Lundin M. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the alcA structural gene is under the direct control of CreA (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was important to determine which of the putative CreA sites are actually functional in the alcA promoter. The analysis of the mechanism of carbon catabolite repression of the alcA promoter has to be performed in an alcR-derepressed background. The reason already mentioned is the absolute dependence for alcA transcription on the presence of an active AlcR protein that is repressed in glucose growth medium. A constitutively derepressed alcR strain was constructed using the promoter of gpdA, encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, upstream of the full-lengthalcR gene with its own transcriptional termination signal, unlike our previous construct in which the first six amino residues and the termination signal of AlcR were deleted (4Kulmburg P. Prangé T. Mathieu M. Sequeval D. Scazzocchio C. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 280: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The gpdA promoter is very strong and drives the expression of a high amount of alcR gene. Under repressing growth conditions, alcA transcription is substantially derepressed (50%) as a consequence of AlcR synthesis. Since the level of alcA expression is dependent on that of alcR(17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it was important to set up glucose-repressing conditions in whichalcA expression could be monitored with suitable accuracy. It has been shown previously (31Creaser E.H. Porter R.L. Britt K.A. Pateman J.A. Doy C.H. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that total alcohol dehydrogenase activity in crude extracts varies considerably, depending upon the alcohols and ketones used as inducers. The best inducer was shown to be the gratuitous inducer butan-2-one (also called ethyl methyl ketone (EMK)). Transcriptional analyses of alcR and alcA and semiquantitative measurements of ADHI activity, estimated by specific staining of gels after native electrophoresis, of the gpdA:alcR strain were compared with the wild type strain after the addition of two different external inducers, ethyl methyl ketone and ethanol. Northern blots, presented in Fig. 2 A, show that both these external inducers have about the same transcriptional inducing ability for alcR in the wild type strain and in the gpdA:alcR strain, in which a higher steady state amount of alcR mRNA is also observed. As a result, an increase in alcA transcription is observed in the gpdA:alcRstrain compared with the wild type strain, which, in the presence of the inducer ethanol, is 4-fold higher and in the presence of EMK is 8-fold higher. As expected with the constitutive and derepressed gpdA:alcRpromoter, the same steady state amount of alcR mRNA is observed in mycelia grown in noninduced, induced, and glucose-repressed conditions. In agreement with our previous results (9Lockington R. Scazzocchio C. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), noalcA transcription is observed in the absence of an external co-inducer. Interestingly, in the gpdA:alcR strain, in the presence of the inducer ethanol, alcA mRNA derepression is weak (10%), whereas in the presence of EMK, it reaches 50% (Fig. 2 A). Semiquantitative evaluation of ADHI activity by native gel staining (Fig. 2 B) shows that with ethanol, only a weak ADHI derepression is observed, whereas with EMK, it is much more efficient. Therefore, this gpdA:alcR strain, when induced with ethanol, is suitable to analyze the mechanism of alcArepression. As seen in Fig. 1, seven putative CreA binding sites, sharing the consensus sequence, 5′-(C/G)YGGRG-3′, have been identified in the alcA promoter. Four of them, C, D1, D2, and E, localized in the 5′alcA promoter region, have been deleted. The resulting deleted alcA plasmid, containing the selectableuaZ gene marker, was used to transform the A. nidulans gpdA:alcR alcA − uaZ − strain. Transformants containing a single copy of the alcA gene, integrated in the uaZ locus, were selected. ADHI activity of the selected transformants (TAΔCD1D2E) was estimated by native gel staining after noninduced, induced, and glucose-repressed conditions and compared with the control strain carrying the entire alcA gene in the gpdA:alcRbackground. Similar ADHI activities were obtained in all growth conditions (results not shown). Therefore, we can conclude that CreA binding sites C, D1, D2, and E do not contribute to alcA repression. The involvement of CreA sites A, B1, and B2 in alcA repression was tested by individual site-directed mutagenesis to leave intact all the AlcR induction sites and to retain the natural distance to the alcA transcription start. Fig. 3 B shows that mutagenesis of the CreA A binding site, localized near the AlcR b target, results in an increase in ADHI activity and a slight derepression (10%) compared with the transformation control Tg. Fig. 3 A shows that individual mutations in CreA binding site B1 or B2, localized downstream of the AlcR c target, result in an increase in ADHI activities (12-fold) and a strong ADHI derepression (about 80%). Therefore, disruption of either CreA binding site, B1 or B2, is sufficient to derepress the alcA promoter. To know if alcA expression could be totally derepressed, the three active CreA binding sites A, B1, and B2 were disrupted. All mutagenizedalcA transformants were selected as single copy integrants at the uaZ locus. Interestingly, analysis of transformants in which B1 and B2 CreA binding sites are simultaneously mutagenized results in the same increase in induction and the same level of derepression as observed after the disruption of either B1or B2 CreA binding sites (Fig. 4). Therefore, it seems that CreA sites B1 and B2 are working as a pair. When the three CreA binding sites A, B1, and B2 are disrupted simultaneously, as in Tgm(AB1B2), it is clear that there is a large increase in induced ADHI activity besides an almost totally derepressed ADHI activity (Fig. 4). To verify that this total derepression did not result from the high AlcR concentration driven by the strong gpdA promoter, AlcR was expressed under the control of the pyrG promoter (pyrG encodes orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase). This promoter is not subject to carbon catabolite repression and is considered as a weak, noninducible promoter. A translational fusion between the pyrG promoter and the alcR coding sequence was constructed, and the argB auxotrophy gene was also inserted into the plasmid. A selected argB +transformant, containing pyrG:alcR, was then used as the recipient strain (TpyrG alcA − uaZ −) for plasmids carrying the mutagenized alcA gene. This strain contains the pyrG:alcR gene in addition to the alcR resident gene. As shown in Fig. 5, under induced growth conditions in the pyrG:alcR strain (Tp), the ADHI activity is higher than in the wild type strain due to the presence of the pyrG:alcR gene and the chromosomal alcR gene. In this pyrG:alcR strain, when the three CreA binding sites A, B1, and B2 in the alcA promoter are disrupted, ADHI derepression is observed along with increase in ADHI activity in induced growth conditions (Fig. 6). The ADHI derepression observed in this strain can only be accounted for by the pyrG:alcRderepressed gene, whereas in induced growth conditions, alcAexpression is driven by two alcR genes as mentioned above. This ADHI derepression is complete with regard to the pyrG:alcR gene. We can conclude that mutagenesis of the three CreA binding sites A, B1, and B2, in a context in which AlcR is moderately expressed, results in a totally derepressed alcA promoter. In other words, disrupted CreA sites have a dominant effect on AlcR concentration in the cell.Figure 6Effects of disruption of combined CreA sites in the alcA promoter on ADHI activity in the pyrG:alcR strain. TpmB1B2 is a double mutant strain in which the CreA sites B1 and B2 are mutagenized. TpmAB1B2 is a triple mutant strain in which the CreA sites A, B1, and B2 are mutagenized. Growth conditions, ADHI staining, and further details were as described in the legend to Fig. 2 B.

Each track was loaded with 50 μg of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that the repressor CreA, responsible for carbon catabolite repression in A. nidulans, acts at two different levels. First, it prevents completely the transcription of the trans-acting gene alcR, which could account for the drastic decrease of transcription of the two structural genesalcA and aldA (9Lockington R. Scazzocchio C. Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also of the other clusteredalc genes (3Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, however, direct repression of the two structural genes alcA and aldA (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and of otheralc genes such as alcS and alcO (3Fillinger S. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) also occurs via the CreA binding sites localized in the promoter regions of these genes. This was shown in a partially derepressedalcR context, obtained either by mutagenesis of one CreA binding site in the alcR promoter or by drivingalcR transcription from a constitutive (and derepressed) promoter (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Results shown here demonstrate that among seven CreA binding sites identified in the alcA promoter, two sites (B1 and B2) are largely responsible foralcA repression, with site A making a minor contribution. These three functional CreA targets have completely different flanking regions (as seen in Fig. 1), and no AT-rich region is found. The importance of a flanking AT-rich region in site recognition by MIG1 was shown by Lundin et al. (30Lundin M. Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Since the mode of recognition of MIG1 and CreA are similar, a similar role for the flanking regions may also have been expected. In vitro binding of CreA to sites in the ipnA promoter region is AT context-dependent (29Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Functional CreA targets in the alcR promoter (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in the prnB promoter (18Cubero B. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 405-415Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar) show AT-rich regions upstream from the GC consensus sequence. However, it has to be pointed out that in some physiological CreA target, as in the alcRpromoter, 2M. Mathieu and B. Felenbok, unpublished results. and in known MIG1 sites (in GAL1 and GAL4) involved in glucose repression, no AT-rich flanking sequence have been found. In the ipnA promoter, the in vitro CreA binding sites are not functional in vivo (29Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have to mention thatin vitro CreA binding sites have been localized using a dimeric GST-CreA fusion protein. We have recently shown in our laboratory (7Lenouvel F. Nikolaev I. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15521-15526Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that the utilization of GST, as an AlcR GST fusion protein, can introduce a serious bias in AlcR DNA recognition of AlcR sites in the alcR, alcA, and aldApromoters, probably as a consequence of the normally monomeric structure of AlcR. It is also expected that CreA is monomeric in solution, as demonstrated for the related Zif268 protein by crystallography studies. It is therefore possible that the use of a GST-CreA fusion protein will also introduce DNA recognition artifacts. It was postulated by Espeso and Peñalva (29Espeso E.A. Peñalva M.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and by Cubero and Scazzocchio (18Cubero B. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 405-415Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar) that the dimeric nature of GST:CreA fusions could stabilize CreA binding to sites that do not fit the GC consensus site. In this regard, physiological results should also be used when defining CreA targets. Therefore, CreA targets in the alcA promoter, localized in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis, can be considered as upstream repressing sequences. Interestingly, functional CreA binding sites are more often organized as pairs of sites directly repeated (e.g. the alcR promoter (16Kulmburg P. Mathieu M. Dowzer C. Kelly J. Felenbok B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar))2 or as inverted repeats (e.g. the alcA promoter (this work) and in the prnB promoter region (18Cubero B. Scazzocchio C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 405-415Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar)). The single CreA A site in the alcA promoter makes only a minor contribution to glucose repression. MIG1 sites are also often organized as repeats (e.g. the promoters of GAL1, SUC2(32Nehlin J.O. Carlberg M. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3373-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar)). It is well established that MIG1 recruits TUP1 and SSN6, which are general repressors, to establish repression of glucose-repressed promoters. It is possible that CreA acts in a similar way to repress the transcriptional machinery and that two CreA binding sites are necessary. Disruption of the three CreA targets, B1, B2, and A, results in totally derepressed alcA gene expression. This result indicates that CreA seems to be the only repressor acting directly on alcA during carbon catabolite repression. in S. cerevisiae, it has been shown recently that besides MIG1, another similar zinc finger repressor MIG2, which binds to the same binding sites as MIG1, is involved in glucose repression of SUC2 expression (33Lutfiyya L.L. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4790-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In fact, disruption of MIG1 relieves most of the glucose repression of GAL1 and GAL4 expression, partially relieves SUC2 repression, and has no effect on the glucose repression of other genes (34Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In A. nidulans, no carbon catabolite repressor, other than CreA, has been found. This is in agreement with our results presented here and with the complete glucose-derepressed prnB expression observed after the disruption of two CreA binding sites. 3V. Gavrias and C. Scazzocchio, personal communication. In this system, it was shown recently that CreA binding prevents the activity of a positive element on the prnB promoter (35Gonzalez R. Gavrias V. Gómez D. Scazzocchio C. Cubero B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2937-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the alcA promoter, CreA sites are very close to, and even overlap with, the AlcR binding sites. It is noticeable that there is a correlation between the level of alcA derepression and that of overexpression. In agreement with our previous results (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Fillinger S. Panozzo C. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this correlation also indicates that CreA is active under derepressing conditions. The disruption of the minor CreA A site results in a weak increase in alcA expression, whereas disruption of the pair sites, B1 and B2, playing the major role in repression, results in a drastic increase in alcAexpression. The alcA promoter region encompassing the induction target c comprises direct repeats (c1-c2) and an overlapping inverted repeat (c3) separated by 16 base pairs with respect to c2. It was recently shown that to reach fullalcA transcriptional activation, the three sites, c1, c2, and c3, are necessary (8Panozzo C. Capuano V. Fillinger S. Felenbok B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22859-22865Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The CreA B1 site overlaps the AlcR c3 site, and the CreA B2 site is localized only 17 nucleotides downstream from B1. The size of the AlcR protein is 92 kDa, and that of CreA is 47 kDa. It is possible, therefore, to imagine a steric hindrance between AlcR and CreA for their cognate targets localized in the same region of the alcA promoter. This steric competition could account for alcA overexpression when functional CreA binding sites are disrupted. The induction of alcA is correlated with the level of AlcR, as observed in contexts in which AlcR is highly (gpdA:alcR) or moderately (pyrG:alcR) expressed. Interestingly, when the functional CreA targets are disrupted in the alcA promoter, the level of derepression is independent of AlcR. This result is expected, since in the absence of CreA sites, AlcR can fully occupy its cognate targets. In the alcR promoter, which is positively autoregulated, the induction site overlaps a CreA site. Disruption of this CreA site results in an overexpression of alcR and only a partial derepression, since other CreA sites should be functional in the alcR promoter. The mechanism involved is a direct competition between the two regulators AlcR and CreA (17Mathieu M. Felenbok B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4022-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such a competition mechanism could control the expression of other clusteredalc genes, such as alcS and alcO, where promoter regions contain both AlcR and CreA sites (20Fillinger, S. (1996) Identification et Etude Fonctionnelle de Nouveaux Gènes Appartenant au Régulon Ethanol chez Aspergillus nidulans. Ph.D. thesis, University of Paris-Sud, France.Google Scholar). These results are in agreement with a regulatory mechanism whereby the relative levels of these proteins govern the degree of alcregulon expression under different growth conditions.

Cas-L contains possible multiple binding sites for the Src homology (SH) 2 domains of various signaling molecules, and appears to be involved in signal transduction through phosphorylated tyrosine-mediated protein-protein interaction. Since Cas-L is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, it is conceivable that Cas-L plays an important role in lymphocyte-specific signals.

Cas-L is transiently phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking, and tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk and C3G. Furthermore, a Cas-L mutant that lacks the SH3 domain, the binding site for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is also tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking, but not upon β1 integrin crosslinking, suggesting that FAK is not involved in CD3-dependent Cas-L phosphorylation. Taken together, the present study indicates a novel signaling pathway mediated by tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L upon the TCR/CD3 stimulation.

Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). These TCR-dependent signals are mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins including CD3δ, CD3ε, CD3γ, ZAP-70, Shc, Vav, and c-Cbl (2Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These signaling molecules appear to be involved in the phosphorylated tyrosine-mediated protein-protein interaction and the recruitment of the other signaling molecules containing Src homology (SH) 2 domains (3Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). The recruitment of these signaling molecules is essential to induce various signals to the downstream events such as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, Ca2+ influx, and transcriptional activation of various genes (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). Thus, protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role during the initial phase of TCR-mediated T cell activation. However, the essential phosphorylated molecule and the precise function of each phosphorylated molecule for these signaling pathways have not yet been clarified. Cas-L (pp105) was first identified as a 105-kDa protein that is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon β1 integrin cross-linking (4Nojima Y. Rothstein D.M. Sugita K. Schlossman S.F. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cas-L belongs to Cas-family along with p130Cas and Efs/Sin (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J.

The three proteins share the structural characteristics of an N-terminal SH3 domain, followed by multiple (8 to 15) YXXP motifs, which are putative binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain, and a conserved YDYVHL sequence that possibly binds to the Src SH2 domain. (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T.

Cas-L was shown to associate with the C-terminal domain of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is localized to focal adhesions (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 8Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the conserved YDYVHL sequence of Cas-L was phosphorylated by FAK following β1 integrin cross-linking and that an Src family tyrosine kinase is recruited to the phosphorylated YDYVHL sequence and causes further tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L (9Tachibana K.

We also reported that tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk, Nck, and SHPTP2 following β1 integrin cross-linking (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Cas-L plays an important role in the β1 integrin-mediated signaling pathway. Although the significance of Cas-L in β1 integrin-mediated signaling has been well documented, little is known about its ability in other signaling pathways. Since Cas-L is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that Cas-L may participate in lymphocyte-specific signaling pathways. Recently, Kanda et al. (10Kanda H.

However, the precise molecular mechanism for signal transduction though Cas-L remains unclear. In this study, we show that Cas-L is tyrosine-phosphorylated and forms complexes with Crk and C3G following CD3 cross-linking. We further demonstrate that FAK is not likely involved in the CD3-dependent Cas-L phosphorylation. A human T lymphoblastoid cell line, H9, a human breast cancer cell line, T-47D, and a monkey kidney-derived cell line, COS-1, were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI 1640 supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and gentamycin (50 μg/ml) (complete medium).

Ten μg of plasmid DNA was transfected into JMC-T5 cells (20–30 million) in 300 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 by electroporation at 250 V and 960 microfarad using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Cells were washed three times with Iscove's serum-free medium (Sigma), and incubated with 500 μl of Iscove's media containing 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 or anti-CD29 mAb on ice for 15 min. After a wash with cold medium, cells were incubated with 200 μl of media containing 10 μg/ml anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) at 37 °C for appropriate durations of time. The reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold Iscove's medium containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm pyrophosphate, and 0.4 mm sodium vanadate. After centrifugation, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 15 min on ice. For stimulation with the extracellular matrix, cells were incubated in plates coated with poly-l-lysine (PLL, Sigma) or human plasma fibronectin (FN, Life Technologies, Inc.), and then solubilized in the lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for precipitations with antibodies or GST fusion proteins. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB, Upssala, Sweden) for an additional 1 h. In the case of GST fusion proteins, cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB) conjugated with GST fusion proteins for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with the washing buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min.

The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (Amersham Corp.) and chemiluminescence reagents (NEN Life Science Products). Alternatively, the membranes were incubated with125I-labeled anti-P-Tyr. In previous studies, Cas-L was analyzed by conventional anti-p130Cas mAb that cross-reacts with Cas-L (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 10Kanda H. Miura T. Morino N. Hamasaki K. Nakamoto T. Hirai H Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2113-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To distinguish Cas-L from p130Cas, anti-Cas-L-specific antibody was generated by the immunization of a GST fusion protein of the Cas-L residues 419–524, which shares the lowest homology with p130Cas or Efs/Sin (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cellular lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with this antibody to determine its reactivity. As shown in Fig. 1, c-myc-epitope-tagged Cas-L from COS cells and the endogenous Cas-L from H9 cells were detected by this anti-Cas-L antibody. Two species of 110- and 105-kDa were equally expressed in COS transfectant cells, whereas a 110-kDa form of Cas-L was less expressed in H9 cells. However, c-myc-tagged p130Cas expressed in COS cells and the endogenous p130Cas protein from T-47D cells were not detected by this antibody. In contrast, anti-p130Cas mAb reacted with both p130Cas and Cas-L proteins. Therefore, this anti-Cas-L antibody that we developed specifically recognizes Cas-L but not p130Cas. We next attempted to determine whether Cas-L was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking using the Cas-specific Ab. The CD3 molecule on the H9 cell surface was cross-linked with anti-CD3 mAb and rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody for appropriate durations of time. Cellular lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. As shown in Fig. 2 A, Cas-L was tyrosine-phosphorylated 1 min and 5 min after CD3 cross-linking and then dephosphorylated 20 min after CD3 cross-linking. Similar kinetics were also observed in p59Fyn and p56Lck, which were phosphorylated 1 min after CD3 cross-linking. On the other hand, FAK was not significantly phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking. In contrast to CD3 stimulation, both FAK and Cas-L were tyrosine-phosphorylated following β1 integrin cross-linking (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that Cas-L tyrosine phosphorylation following β1 integrin cross-linking was slower (5 min) than that following CD3 cross-linking. The Cas-L tyrosine phosphorylation was still observed 20 min after β1 integrin cross-linking. To define whether or not Cas-L is phosphorylated in normal peripheral T lymphocytes upon CD3 cross-linking, a similar study was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 C, Cas-L was most strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated 5 min after CD3 cross-linking in peripheral T cells. As well as in H9 cells, no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK was observed in normal peripheral T lymphocytes (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that Cas-L is involved in the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway, and that FAK is not catalytically active upon CD3 cross-linking in T lymphocytes. Based on the finding of CD3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L, we next attempted to define binding molecules to tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L. Since Cas-L contains multiple possible binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain, we determined the Cas-L-Crk association following CD3 cross-linking. For this purpose, H9 cells were lysed 1 min after CD3 cross-linking. Then, cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk mAb and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Cas-L-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 A, CD3 cross-linking increased Cas-L coprecipitation with Crk. The co-immunoprecipitated species by anti-Crk antibody migrated slower than those by anti-Cas-L antibody. This result suggests that a large form of Cas-L could significantly bind to Crk. In addition to a 105–110-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L band, a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated molecule was immunoprecipitated by anti-Crk antibody upon CD3 cross-linking (Fig. 3 A). Since this 120-kDa protein was not observed after immunodepletion with anti-Cbl antibody (data not shown), this 120-kDa species could be Cbl (10Kanda H. Miura T. Morino N. Hamasaki K. Nakamoto T. Hirai H Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2113-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Bunday L. Khwaja A. Sipeki S. Farago A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6159-6163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We also performed a reverse experiment of Crk coprecipitation with Cas-L. As shown in Fig. 3 B, Crk was co-immunoprecipitated with Cas-L 1 min following CD3 cross-linking, whereas Crk was not coprecipitated 20 min after CD3 stimulation. The immunoprecipitated Cas-L was remarkably tyrosine-phosphorylated 1 min after CD3 cross-linking, whereas Cas-L phosphorylation was diminished 20 min after cross-linking, indicating that this association of Cas-L and Crk corresponds to tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3 C, Cas-L was precipitated by the GST-Crk SH2 domain, whereas Cas-L was not precipitated by the GST or GST-Shc SH2 proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that Cas-L associates with Crk via the Crk SH2 domain following CD3 cross-linking in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. One of the major Crk-binding proteins via the Crk SH3 domain is C3G, a guanine exchange factor for Rap1A/K-rev1 (14Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K.

Therefore, we next investigated CD3-dependent Cas-L-C3G interaction. As shown in Fig. 4, Cas-L was coprecipitated with C3G 1 min following CD3 cross-linking, whereas Cas-L was not coprecipitated 20 min after CD3 stimulation. The Cas-L species associated with C3G also migrated slower than immunoprecipitated Cas-L by anti-Cas-L antibody. Western blotting analysis with anti-P-Tyr mAb revealed that the coimmunoprecipitated Cas-L was tyrosine-phosphorylated. This result suggests that Cas-L binds to C3G possibly via the association with Crk. Cas-L is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to Crk upon both β1 integrin (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and CD3 stimulation. We next investigated the mechanism by which Cas-L is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon such stimulation. We recently found that FAK initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L following integrin stimulation (9Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, FAK is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that Cas-L may be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking in a FAK-independent manner. To elucidate this hypothesis, we studied CD3-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of a Cas-L mutant, c-myc-tagged Cas-LΔSH3, which lacks the SH3 domain and does not bind to FAK (data not shown). This mutant was expressed in JMC-T5, a Jurkat cell strain that is available for transient transfection analysis. After CD3 cross-linking, Cas-LΔSH3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc mAb and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr. As shown in Fig. 5, Cas-LΔSH3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking, whereas Cas-LΔSH3 was not phosphorylated upon FN stimulation. The CS1 region of FN also failed to induce Cas-LΔSH3 tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). In contrast, wild-type Cas-L was tyrosine-phosphorylated following the ligation of CD3 or β1 integrin. These results indicate that Cas-L tyrosine phosphorylation upon CD3 cross-linking is caused by a different mechanism from β1 integrin-dependent Cas-L tyrosine phosphorylation. It has been reported that Cas family proteins, p130Cas, Cas-L/HEF-1, and Efs/Sin are tyrosine-phosphorylated upon various stimuli, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion, growth factors, chemokines, and cross-linking of the B cell receptor (4Nojima Y.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas family proteins bind to signaling molecules containing SH2 domains (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

However, the precise nature of signaling pathways through Cas family proteins is poorly understood. Especially, since Cas-L is preferentially expressed in lymphocytes, it is conceivable that Cas-L may play an important role in lymphocyte-specific function. In this study, we have demonstrated that Cas-L is tyrosine-phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking and forms complexes with Crk and C3G. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L and its association with Crk and C3G are rapid, but transient, events following CD3 cross-linking. These results demonstrated a novel signaling pathway through Cas-L following TCR stimulation. Antigen-TCR binding induces various signals in T cells (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar, 2Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Our study raised the question as to what signal Cas-L is involved in. We showed that tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas-L binds to Crk via the Crk SH2 domain following CD3 cross-linking. Crk is an adapter protein composed of one SH2 domain and one or two SH3 domains, and binds to various proteins including C3G, Dock180, Sos, and c-Abl via the Crk SH3 domain (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibushi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 22Hasegawa H. Kiyokawa E. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This suggests that Cas-L can recruit these signaling molecules in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner via Crk. One of the major Crk SH3 domain-binding proteins, C3G, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates a small GTPase, Rap1A/K-rev1 (15Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibushi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). K-rev1 was first reported to be a protein that reverts the K-Ras transformed phenotype of NIH-3T3 cells (25Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Rap1A has been shown to inhibit the binding of Ras to Raf-1 and Ras-dependent Raf-1 activation (26Hu C.D. Kariya K. Kotani G. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11702-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that K-rev1/Rap1A competitively inhibits Ras-signaling pathway. Therefore, the recruitment of C3G to Cas-L may be involved in the regulation of Ras-mediated signaling pathways. The other putative signal downstream of C3G is the JNK/SAPK pathway. Tanaka et al. (27Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) recently reported that overexpression of Crk induces activation of JNK/SAPK and that coexpression of C3G further enhances the JNK activity. Overexpression of Crk has been shown also to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L and p130Cas, as well as the recruitment of C3G to the phosphorylated Cas proteins (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that Cas-L is one of the major Crk-binding proteins upon CD3 cross-linking. On the other hand, it has been reported that JNK is activated upon TCR stimulation and that JNK activation plays a significant role in T cell activation (28Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Cas-L is involved in TCR-mediated JNK activation through the recruitment of C3G. Ras/Raf-1 and JNK pathways have been shown to serve an important function in T cell activation (28Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 29Owaki H. Varma R. Gillis B. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Davis L.S. Geppert T.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4367-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cas-L may regulate T cell responses through such pathways. The other question raised from our study is how Cas-L is phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking. We found that FAK initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L by plural tyrosine kinases following β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion (9Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the Cas-LΔSH3 mutant lacking the SH3 domain responsible for Cas-L binding to FAK (30Law S.F. Estojak J. Wang B. Mysliwiec T. Kruh G. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3327-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon β1 integrin cross-linking. These findings indicate that FAK plays an important role in Cas-L phosphorylation in the β1 integrin-mediated signaling pathway. However, we found that FAK is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking. Since FAK phosphorylation is well correlated to its activation (31Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), FAK is not likely to be activated upon CD3 cross-linking. In contrast to our findings, Maguire et al.(32Maguire J.E. Danahey K.M. Burkly L.C. van Seventer G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2079-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) demonstrated that FAK is synergistically tyrosine-phosphorylated upon both CD3 and β1 integrin cross-linking in T cells and that anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) alone also induces low levels of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. On the other hand, Kanner et al. (33Kanner S.B. Aruffo A. Chan P-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10484-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported that FAK is not tyrosine-phosphorylated following CD3 cross-linking, which supports our results. This paradoxical observation may be caused by the difference of the cross-linking method; liquid phase cross-linking was used in our system, whereas solid phase cross-linking was used in the Maguire et al. (32Maguire J.E. Danahey K.M. Burkly L.C. van Seventer G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 2079-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) observation. However, the Cas-LΔSH3 mutant that fails to bind to FAK is demonstrated to be tyrosine-phosphorylated, as well as the wild-type Cas-L, upon CD3 cross-linking. This result strongly suggests that FAK is not involved in CD3-mediated Cas-L phosphorylation. How, then, is Cas-L phosphorylated upon CD3 cross-linking? We reported that activated p56Lck phosphorylates Cas-L (5Minegishi M. Tachibana K. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and we also found that the coexpression of ZAP-70 also phosphorylates Cas-L. 2K. Tachibana, Y. Ohashi, H. Fujita, K. Kamiguchi, and C. Morimoto, unpublished data. As both p56Lck and ZAP-70 are involved in TCR/CD3 signaling pathways (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar, 2Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), these tyrosine kinases are, therefore, likely involved in the CD3-dependent phosphorylation of Cas-L. Recently, Ingham et al. (18Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L. Barbazuk S.M. Turck C.W. Hirai H. Matsuda M. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32306-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that Cas-L is observed in the membrane fraction in B lymphocytes, suggesting a putative subcellular localization of Cas-L. Taken together, we hypothesize that Cas-L is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane by an unknown mechanism and interacts with TCR/CD3 molecules or their downstream signaling molecules, and that Cas-L is tyrosine phosphorylated by p56Lck or ZAP-70 upon cross-linking of TCR/CD3 molecules. We demonstrated Cas-L tyrosine phosphorylation not only upon β1 integrin cross-linking but also upon CD3 cross-linking. However, Cas-L is rapidly phosphorylated but dephosphorylated quickly after CD3 cross-linking, whereas Cas-L phosphorylation upon β1 integrin cross-linking is slow but stable. Such a difference in the kinetics of Cas-L tyrosine phosphorylation suggests that Cas-L may serve as a distinct regulatory function in TCR-mediated T cell responses from those mediated by β1 integrin. Cas-L has also been demonstrated to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon B cell receptor cross-linking (18Ingham R.J. Krebs D.L. Barbazuk S.M. Turck C.W. Hirai H. Matsuda M. Gold M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32306-32314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Manie S.N. Beck A.R. Astier A. Law S.F. Canty T. Hirai H. Drucker B.J. Avraham H. Haghayeghi N.

These findings indicate that Cas-L is tyrosine-phosphorylated following the interaction of lymphocyte receptors to antigens and is involved in the lymphocyte receptor-specific signaling events. In summary, TCR stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas-L by a FAK-independent manner and also the recruitment of signaling molecules, Crk and C3G, to Cas-L. These results suggest a potential role of Cas-L in TCR/CD3-mediated signal transduction that leads to cellular responses. Further biological analysis may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which Cas-L functions in lymphocytes. We thank Donny Cho for technical assistance and Lisa Wilis for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2169145132,"Recombinant yeast nucleosome assembly protein (yNAP-1) facilitates the formation of uniformly spaced nucleosomes from high molecular weight DNA and core histone octamers. No additional factors or metabolites are required. The repeat length of the chromatin produced is about 146 base pairs. To obtain the most distinct nucleosomal ladders, the core histones must preexist as an octamer complex. yNAP-1 forms complexes with core histones as judged by native gel electrophoresis, chemical cross-linking, limited histone proteolysis, and affinity blotting. A discrete complex was observed with a probable ratio of yNAP-1 to histone octamer of 4:1. Chromatin produced by salt dialysis does not contain uniformly spaced nucleosomes, but subsequent incubation with yNAP-1 creates uniform spacing. Trypsin-treated core octamers that lack amino termini, although capable of forming core particles with core-length DNA by salt dialysis, are not assembled by yNAP-1 into uniformly spaced nucleosomes on high molecular weight DNA. Proteolytic removal of the amino termini of the core histones precludes complex formation between a histone octamer and yNAP-1. Affinity blotting also demonstrates that yNAP-1 binds linker histones and high mobility group (HMG)-1/HMG-2 but not HMG-14. Competition experiments with poly-l-arginine, poly-l-lysine, and protamine reveal that yNAP-1 binds to core and linker histones more tightly despite the much higher positive charge densities of the former molecules. Naturally occurring acetylated histone H4 species show no evidence for differential yNAP-1 binding. yNAP-1 is not bound tightly to the resulting chromatin after deposition and thus could act catalytically.

In eukaryotes, chromosomal DNA encircles octamers of core histones resulting in arrays of nucleosomes which represent the first level of chromatin organization. To a first approximation, these nucleosomal arrays are spaced uniformly with characteristic repeat lengths that can vary from species to species, from tissue to tissue, and even with the transcriptional state of the chromatin under consideration (1Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the primary organization of nucleosomes along the chromatin fiber appears uniform, many studies have shown convincingly that chromatin can exist in a variety of states characterized by the sensitivity of the DNA to cleavage by chemical agents and nucleases (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. 1989; (and 360–364, Springer-Verlag, New York): 241-242Google Scholar). These states can change markedly with gene expression and are thought to be associated with nucleosome loss, disruption, or remodeling (3Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, Harcourt Brace, San Diego, CA1995: 100-166Google Scholar, 4Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev.

Core nucleosomes and chromatin can be reconstituted readily in vitro from their constituents by methods such as dialysis from high ionic strength solutions (2van Holde K.E.

A variety of factors is reported to influence the nucleosomal repeat length of these in vitro assembled chromatins. These include ionic strength and DNA topology (1Blank T.A. Becker P.B. J. Mol.

Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Furthermore, linker histones in conjunction with polyglutamic acid will under certain conditions facilitate the formation of uniformly spaced nucleosomes from core histones and plasmid DNA (18Jeong S.W. Lauderdale J.D. Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 1131-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recombinant yNAP-1 is capable of forming histone-DNA complexes and forming nucleosomes on plasmid DNA (19Ishimi Y. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7025-7029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). yNAP-1 as well as nucleoplasmin will act to facilitate transcription factor binding to a nucleosome-containing target sequence (21Walter P.P. Owen-Hughes T.A. Cote J. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently Kadonaga and co-workers (15Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) reported that both recombinant Drosophila and yeast NAP-1 will create a chromatin of uniformly spaced nucleosomes of a short repeat length from plasmid DNA and core histones. Furthermore they found that adding a Drosophila CAF-1 fraction and ATP to the assembly mixture results in the rapid formation of long arrays of uniformly spaced nucleosomes of a physiological repeat. Their results clearly demonstrate that although yNAP-1 is required to produce uniformly spaced nucleosomes, other proteins in the dCAF-1 fraction facilitate the assembly, both kinetically and qualitatively in terms of the resulting nucleosomal repeat. Immunoprecipitation of human and Drosophila cytosolic extracts with anti-NAP antibodies suggests that histones 2A and 2B are the principal molecules complexed with NAP-1 in vivo (15Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,22Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In yeast, immunoprecipitation of yNAP-1 reveals an in vivo association with the cyclin Clb2 (23Kellog D.R. Kikuchi A. Fujii-Nakata T. Turck C.W. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cell cycle-dependent changes in the subcellular distribution of yNAP-1 suggest a role in replication-dependent chromatin assembly (15Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22Chang L. Loranger S.S. Mizzen C. Ernst S.G. Allis C.D. Annunziato A.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Most of these effects require that yNAP-1 interact with the core histones. Here we report a study of the in vitro ability of recombinant yNAP-1 to assemble core histones and high molecular weight DNA into a synthetic chromatin at physiological ionic strengths. Our results indicate that the assembled chromatin is characterized by uniformly spaced nucleosomes with a very short repeat length. The short repeat is largely independent of the underlying DNA sequence but depends upon the preexistence of histone octamers and the presence of the amino termini of the core histones. Furthermore we show that yNAP-1 is able to remodel a salt dialysis-produced chromatin into a short repeat chromatin. Because the nature of the interaction of NAP-1 with core histones has not been studied in any detail previously, an analysis of the ability of recombinant yNAP-1 to bind to the histone octamer, individual core and linker histones, as well as other basic proteins was made. Our results reveal that yNAP-1 binds specifically and reversibly to the highly positively charged disordered segments of all of the histones. Chicken chromatin, poly- and mononucleosomes, and core-length DNA were prepared as described (24Chung D.G. Lewis P.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5036-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Chan S. Attisano L. Lewis P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15643-15651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chicken histone octamers were isolated from salt-stripped chicken erythrocyte chromatin (26Iovcheva C. Mladenova I. Dessev G. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1984; 10: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) by the method of Simon and Felsenfeld (27Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C in 2 m NaCl and 50% glycerol. Trypsin-treated chicken histone octamers were prepared by trypsin digestion of salt-stripped chromatin in 25 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, at a mass ratio of 1,000:1 for 5 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of a 100-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor and hydroxyapatite chromatography (27Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Chicken core and linker histones were extracted from chicken erythrocyte nuclei with 0.4 mHCl, the core histones precipitated with 7% perchloric acid, and the spun supernatant adjusted to 20% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the linker histones. The two precipitates were washed once with acidified acetone (0.1% HCl) and then with acetone and vacuum dried. Histone H5 was isolated from the linker histones by ion exchange chromatography (8Sobolewski C.H.M. Klump H.H. Lindsey G.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Extensively DMS (dimethyl suberimidate, Pierce) cross-linked chicken core histone octamer was formed by cross-linking salt-stripped chromatin with DMS in 2 m NaCl, 0.1m sodium borate, pH 9 (28Thomas J.O. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 549-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cross-linked octamer was purified further by gel filtration on Sephacryl 300 to electrophoretic homogeneity. HMG-14 was prepared as described from a 0.35 mNaCl extract of chicken erythrocyte nuclei (24Chung D.G. Lewis P.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5036-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). HeLa histones were prepared from HeLa cells grown in plain medium and a medium containing 10 mm sodium butyrate. Protamine, poly-l-lysine, and poly-l-arginine were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Chicken genomic DNA was prepared from chicken erythrocytes using the GNOME DNA isolation kit (BIO/CAN Scientific). Purified chicken genomic DNA was dissolved in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. DNA containing 2,400 bp of the PHO5gene and promoter region was prepared by polymerase chain reaction of yeast genomic DNA with a 32P-nucleotide and primers 5′-GATCAAGTCAGAGCGGCT and 5′-GTCTCAATAGACTGGCGTTG. Yeast NAP-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli from the yNAP-1 gene inserted in a Novagen pET3c expression vector. Recombinant yNAP-1 was purified by anion exchange chromatography as described (20Fujii-Nakata T. Ishimi Y. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20980-20986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments a His6 yNAP-1 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 from a Novagen pET30a expression vector containing an insert produced by polymerase chain reaction of yeast genomic DNA using primers 5′-GAGCTCGAATTCGGATCCATGACAGACCCTATCAGAACG and 5′-CTCGAGGTCGACAAGCTTTTATGACTGCTTGCATTCAGG subsequently digested with BamHI and HindIII and ligated into similarly digested pET30a vector. The His6 yNAP-1 was purified by means of Ni-NTA (Qiagen) affinity resin. Prior to use yNAP-1 was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 10 mm TE, pH 8, for 20 min at room temperature. Where necessary the residual dithiothreitol was removed by precipitating the yNAP-1 with 20% trichloroacetic acid as described below. 35S-Labeled yNAP-1 was prepared by incubating dithiothreitol-free reduced yNAP-1 (100 μg) with 0.1 mCi of acetone-washed [35S]cysteine (ICN, 1,000 Ci/mmol) in 100 μl of TE, pH 8, overnight at room temperature. The 35S-labeled yNAP-1 was precipitated by the addition of 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed with acidified acetone and dry acetone, vacuum dried, and dissolved in 100 μl of TE, pH 8. Typically the resulting yNAP-1 had a specific activity of 1.5 Ci/mmol (7 × 105 dpm/μg). Monofluorescein-labeled yNAP-1 was prepared by incubating yNAP-1 (100 μg) in 100 μl of 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8, with 6 nmol of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl-5-carboxyfluorescein at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 10 nmol of 3,3′-diamino-N-methyl dipropylamine. The fluorescein-labeled yNAP-1 was precipitated by the addition of 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed with acidified acetone, dry acetone, vacuum dried, and dissolved in 100 μl of TE, pH 8. The resulting yNAP-1 had an average of 1 mol of fluorescein per mol of yNAP-1 based onA 495 nm and ε495 = 74,000. SDS-PAGE and fluorescence imaging revealed less than 25% unbound fluorescein that runs with the dye front on SDS gels.N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl-5-carboxyfluorescein was synthesized by methods described elsewhere for the preparation of N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl acetate (29Lewis P.N. Guillemette J.G. Chan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).14C-Labeled yNAP-1 was prepared in the same way as the fluoresceinated yNAP-1 except N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidyl [14C]acetate was used. Less than 1 mol of acetate was incorporated per yNAP-1. High molecular weight chicken genomic DNA (40 μl of 0.5 mg/ml in TE) was mixed with yNAP-1/histone mixtures (125 μl of 300:150 μg/ml, respectively, premixed for at least 20 m) at physiological ionic strength (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8), incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and then subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion (Sigma, 0.75 unit/μg of DNA) for various times at 37 °C after adding CaCl2 to 5 mm. After deproteinization the DNA was resolved by 1.5% agarose electrophoresis and subsequently stained with ethidium bromide. In experiments with 32P-labeled DNA, a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager was used for visualization of the DNA. Chromatins were prepared from high molecular weight DNA and plain and trypsin-treated histone octamers according to Stein (10Stein A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 585-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) by dialysis from 1 m NaCl. Core nucleosomes were reconstituted from histones and core-length 146-bp DNA as described (24Chung D.G. Lewis P.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5036-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Histone-yNAP-1 complexes were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) as follows. Reduced yNAP-1 was dialyzed against 100 mm sodium borate, pH 8.8, for 3 h with shaking. Histones, octamer, or trypsin-treated octamer was then added, and a 0.10 volume of disuccinimidyl suberate in dimethylformamide was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Cross-linking was stopped by precipitating the protein by adding an equal volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated protein was washed with acetone-HCl, then acetone, and dried. The resulting pellet was dissolved in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by 3.5% SDS-PAGE. Histone-yNAP-1 complexes were resolved with 5% PAGE with 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8). A variety of SDS-polyacrylamide gels of different percentage of acrylamide (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) was used to resolve histones, yNAP-1, and cross-linked species. 15% acetic acid, urea, and Triton (AUT)-PAGE (29Lewis P.N. Guillemette J.G. Chan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was used to resolve acetylated histones. For the two-dimensional analysis of histone-yNAP-1 complexes a mixture of 20 μg of yNAP-1 and 10 μg of histone in 0.5 × TBE was electrophoresed in the first dimension into a nondenaturing 5% 0.5 × TBE polyacrylamide gel. The gel slice was then excised and electrophoresed into 15% (core histones) or 7.5% (cross-linked octamer) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were solution (25 mm Tris, 0.2 m glycine, pH 8) electrotransferred for 30 min at 24 V to a wetted PVDF (Immobilon, Millipore) membrane from 15% SDS- or AUT-polyacrylamide gels. In some cases the transfer followed the electrophoretic separation directly; in others the proteins in the Coomassie Blue R-stained gel were solubilized for 30 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel buffer supplemented with SDS to 1% and then electrotransferred. The blots were washed with ethanol to remove residual stain and then subjected to a renaturing Far Western protocol described by Lieberman and Berk (30Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2441-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The concentration of 35S- or fluorescein-labeled yNAP-1 in the incubation step was about 5 μg/ml. The dried blot was then imaged with a Molecular Dynamics SF PhosphorImager or STORM combined PhosphorImager and fluorescence imager. Chicken histone octamers premixed with yNAP-1 under reducing conditions and physiological ionic strength and subsequently added to an equal mass of high molecular weight (>20 kilobase pairs) genomic chicken DNA resulted in a soluble nucleoprotein complex. Digestion of this chromatin with micrococcal nuclease for various times and subsequent deproteinization and electrophoresis yielded a ladder of 5–6 DNA fragments with a repeat of 146 bp as shown in Fig. 1 B. The same experiment without yNAP-1 gave only low yields of fragments up to dimers (Fig. 1 A). Essentially the same yNAP-1-assisted assembly pattern was observed when linker histones were present during assembly or when the histone to DNA mass ratios varied from 0.4 to 0.8:1 (data not shown). Decreasing the input ratio of histone octamer to DNA did not change the repeat but did reduce the extent of the ladder, suggesting that the nucleosome spacing results from very closely spaced octamers along the chromatin fiber which may cooperatively interact. Close-packed dinucleosomes have been observed following micrococcal nuclease digestion of salt dialysis-produced chromatins (10Stein A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 585-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We have observed that many core histone preparations including those obtained by acid extraction do not produce a discrete extended ladder in yNAP-1 chromatin assembly experiments (data not shown). These same histone samples can be reconstituted readily into nucleosomes with core-length DNA following a salt dialysis regimen from strongly denaturing conditions as shown in Fig. 2. The only exception was a cross-linked histone octamer prepared by DMS-cross-linking salt-stripped chromatin in 2 m NaCl. Although homogeneous by electrophoresis and sedimentation analysis (data not shown), the cross-linked octamer failed to form a core nucleosome or a yNAP-1-assembled chromatin. In an attempt to establish the requirement for the existence of a histone octamer for yNAP-1-facilitated chromatin assembly, a chicken histone octamer sample in 2 m NaCl, TE, pH 8, was brought to 6m guanidinium HCl by the addition of solid guanidinium chloride. The guanidinium chloride was removed by dialysis of the sample against 2 m NaCl, TE, pH 8, and the renatured octamer sample was used in a yNAP-1 assembly experiment. The resulting micrococcal nuclease digestion pattern is shown in Fig. 1 C and comparative densitometric traces in Fig. 1 F. The renatured octamer ladder is very indistinct compared with the native octamer ladder even though the histone composition after assembly was unchanged as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We conclude from these results that the formation of close-packed arrays of nucleosomes facilitated by yNAP-1 requires a high proportion of structurally intact histone octamer. This is presumably not the case with many histone preparations that at one point or another become dissociated by exposure to low ionic strengths, low pH, or denaturants. Our results suggest that for yNAP-1 to assemble a uniformly spaced chromatin the histone octamer must preexist or be stabilized by other factors. The inability of the DMS-cross-linked octamer to reconstitute into nucleosomes or chromatin suggests that there may be conformational changes in the octamer structure on salt dissociation from chromatin which are not consistent with the structure of the core nucleosome. The DMS-cross-linked octamer forms a complex with yNAP-1 as does the native histone octamer (see below). This together with the fact that octamers extensively DMS-cross-linked while in the nucleosome are capable of nucleosome reconstitution (31Stein A. Bina-Stein M. Simpson R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) argues against a chemical modification explanation for absence of reconstituted product. Inclusion of a uniformly 32P-labeled 2,400-bp DNA fragment containing both the promoter and coding region for the PHO5 gene in the assembly mixture results in a digest pattern following electroblotting and PhosphorImaging which is very similar to the one observed by ethidium staining (Fig. 1, D and E, without and with yNAP-1 compared with Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). There are some indications of a greater size heterogeneity in the labeled fragment particularly in the monomer and dimer fragments which might be due to sequence or end effects. Similar experiments with smaller PHO5 fragments encompassing separately the promoter and coding regions as well as with DNase I digestion (data not shown) suggest that although the former is the most likely explanation, the sequence-specific effects are minor. These results, to a first approximation, indicate that yNAP-1-facilitated chromatin assembly is not influenced by the underlying DNA sequence even on DNA that is known to contain positioned nucleosomes and a nucleosome-free gap in vivo (32Almer A. Rudolph H. Hinnen A. Horz W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) during expression of the PHO5 gene. Chromatin produced by salt dialysis and subsequently digested with micrococcal nuclease contains few uniformly spaced nucleosomes as shown in Fig. 3 A and reported earlier by Stein (10Stein A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 585-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Addition of yNAP-1 to the undigested chromatin and subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 3 or more hours at physiological ionic strength result in a chromatin containing uniformly spaced nucleosomes (Fig. 3 B). The amount of yNAP-1 added was the same as that in a typical assembly reaction. If trypsin-treated chicken histone octamers are used no such remodeling occurs with yNAP-1 (data not shown). When core histones are mixed with recombinant yNAP-1 in solutions of moderate ionic strength, complexes can be resolved by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–7). Two main complexes a and b are observed;c represents the position of uncomplexed yNAP-1. If a DMS-cross-linked histone octamer is complexed with yNAP-1 then only complex a is observed as well as some slower moving bands (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–7). The composition and stoichiometry of 2:1 mass ratio yNAP-1 complexes with chicken core histones as well as with DMS-cross-linked histone octamer were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). The complex at position a in Figs.4 A and 5 A contained yNAP-1 and all four of the core histones. Complexes with greater electrophoretic mobility thana in Fig. 5 A contained progressively less histones H3 and H4 as shown by densitometry in Fig. 5 C. The material at b had 50% less H3 and H4 compared with complexa. Densitometry as well as double labeling experiments (data not shown) indicates a mass ratio of 2.5:1 NAP-1 to total histone for both the histones and cross-linked histone octamer in Fig. 5, A and B, respectively, corresponding to a molar ratio of 4:1 for yNAP-1 to histone octamer. A titration of a fixed amount of yNAP-1 with increasing amounts of core histones is shown in Fig. 6. The point at which no additional band a is formed lies between 3 and 4:1 yNAP-1 to histone octamer.Figure 5Composition and stoichiometry of yNAP-1 complexes with chicken core histones and a cross-linked histone octamer revealed by two-dimensional electrophoresis.

https://openalex.org/W2031461843,"M2, an acid-activated ion channel, is an influenza A virus membrane protein required for efficient nucleocapsid release after viral fusion with the endosomal membrane. Recombinant M2 slows protein traffic through the Golgi complex (Sakaguchi, T., Leser, G. P)., and Lamb, R. A. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 133, 733–47). Despite its critical role in viral infection, little is known about the subcellular distribution of M2 or its fate following delivery to the plasma membrane (PM). We measured the kinetics of M2 transport in HeLa cells, and found that active M2 reached the PM considerably more slowly than inactive M2. In addition, M2 delayed intra-Golgi transport and cell surface delivery of influenza hemagglutinin (HA). We hypothesized that the effects of M2 on transport through non-acidified compartments are due to inefficient retrieval from the trans-Golgi of machinery required for intra-Golgi transport. In support of this, acutely activated M2 had no effect on intra-Golgi transport of HA, but still slowed HA delivery to the PM. Thus, M2 has an indirect effect on early transport steps, but a direct effect on late steps in PM delivery. These findings may help explain the conflicting and unexplained effects on protein traffic observed with other perturbants of intraorganelle pH such as weak bases and inhibitors of V-type ATPases.

These findings may help explain the conflicting and unexplained effects on protein traffic observed with other perturbants of intraorganelle pH such as weak bases and inhibitors of V-type ATPases. The M2 protein is a 97-amino acid nonglycosylated integral membrane protein encoded on RNA segment 7 of influenza virus, which also encodes the M1 matrix protein (1Lamb R.A. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1981; 112: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). During synthesis, M2 is cotranslationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the plasma membrane of infected cells. The protein consists of a 24-amino acid lumenal amino terminus, a single membrane spanning domain, and a 54-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. Some of the newly synthesized M2 is post-translationally palmitoylated and phosphorylated, but these modifications appear to have no effect on ion channel activity (2Holsinger L.J. Shaughnessy M.A. Micko A. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1219-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although large amounts of M2 are synthesized in influenza-infected cells, the molecule is poorly incorporated into budding virions; only about 20–60 molecules/virion are detected (3Zebedee S.L.

Recent data have shown that M2 forms a disulfide-bonded tetramer that can conduct protons across artificial lipid bilayers and cell membranes when activated by low pH (4Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J.

This finding supported the hypothesis that the function of M2 is to modulate the pH of intracellular compartments in infected cells. The first clue came when M2 was shown to be the target of the anti-influenza drug amantadine (AMT), 1The abbreviations used are: AMT, amantadine; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; COP, coat protein; ARF, ADP ribosylation factor. 1The abbreviations used are: AMT, amantadine; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; COP, coat protein; ARF, ADP ribosylation factor. which is known to block an early step in the viral replication cycle (7Hay A.J.

Virol. 1988; 62: 1508-1512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After virions are endocytosed, M2 is thought to channel protons from the low pH endosome to the virion interior. In the absence of M2-induced virion acidification, the influenza matrix protein M1 does not dissociate from ribonucleoproteins, and viral replication is inhibited (9Zhirnov O.P. Virology. 1990; 176: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Ciampor F. Bayley P.M. Nermut M.V. Hirst E.M.A. Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition to its role during viral infection, M2 activity is also required for the proper maturation of some strains of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), such as fowl plague virus HA (Rostock strain). Newly synthesized Rostock HA is normally proteolyzed in the trans-Golgi or trans-Golgi network into two fragments (HA1 and HA2) which remain associated during transit through the secretory pathway. By contrast, other HA isotypes are cleaved at the plasma membrane or not at all, depending on cell type. HA cleavage is required for the protein to become fusogenic, but also makes the protein susceptible to inactivation and aggregation at low pH. AMT causes Rostock HA to form aggregates in the trans-Golgi and to reach the cell surface in its inactive, low pH conformation (10Ciampor F. Bayley P.M. Nermut M.V. Hirst E.M.A. Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rostock M2 may actually function to raise the pH of the trans-Golgi. The proton ionophore monensin, which alkalinizes intracellular compartments, blocks the action of AMT in infected cells, supporting the idea that proper maturation of Rostock HA requires an elevated Golgi pH (10Ciampor F. Bayley P.M. Nermut M.V. Hirst E.M.A. Sugrue R.J. Hay A.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Rostock HA maturation in various cell lines is differentially affected by AMT, suggesting thattrans-Golgi pH differs between cell types. Grambas and Hay (11Grambas S. Hay A.J. Virology. 1992; 190: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) estimated the pH of the trans-Golgi of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells to be approximately 6.0 by determining the ratio of native versus inactive HA for several influenza isotypes of known pH sensitivities in the presence and absence of the AMT analog rimantadine (11Grambas S. Hay A.J. Virology. 1992; 190: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These investigators estimated that Rostock M2 could increase the pH of this compartment by as much as 0.8 pH units, while M2 from other strains generated smaller increases (11Grambas S. Hay A.J. Virology. 1992; 190: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Rostock M2 slows several steps in intra-Golgi transport, as assayed by measuring the processing kinetics of Rostock HA. Both the acquisition of endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides and the cleavage of Rostock HA into HA1 and HA2 were significantly delayed in M2-expressing cells. Normal processing kinetics could be restored by including AMT in the medium to block M2 activity. These data suggested that M2 activity could affect early steps in Golgi transport. This result was surprising because these compartments are not thought to be acidified and therefore any M2 present in these compartments should not be activated. We have monitored the effect of Rostock M2 activity on its own intracellular distribution. Interestingly, we find that newly synthesized active M2 reaches the cell surface far less efficiently than inactive M2 (expressed in the presence of AMT). M2 also caused a delay in the surface appearance of other newly synthesized proteins. To investigate which steps in transport were affected, we monitored the transport of glycosylated marker proteins at various steps along the secretory pathway. Our results show that M2 activity affects both early and late steps in protein delivery to the cell surface. However, whereas late steps in transport appear to be directly due to M2-mediated pH changes, early effects on transport may be an indirect result of effects on downstream (acidified) compartments. We hypothesize that M2-mediated accumulation of itinerant proteins in the trans-Golgi network results in inefficient retrieval to the early Golgi of protein or membrane components required for anterograde intra-Golgi transport. Our findings may also explain the conflicting data on the role of acidification in protein transport obtained by others using different perturbants of organelle pH. The plasmids pTM3-FM2 and pSV73E/KM2-10, which encode Rostock and Udorn M2, respectively, and monoclonal antibody 5C4, which recognizes the lumenal domain of both forms of M2, were generous gifts of Dr. R. Lamb (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL). The pTM3 vector contains both the EMC leader sequence, which allows cap-independent translation of mRNA and the T7 terminator, and generates very high levels of protein expression. For experiments that required M2 coexpression with other proteins, Rostock M2 was subcloned into the Bluescript vector (pBS (SK), Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) behind the T7 promoter (pBS-M2R). The polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate a fragment containing the entire sequence of M2 flanked by BamHI from pTM3-FM2; this fragment was purified and subcloned into BamHI-digested pBS. Orientation of the inserted sequences in pBS was determined by sequencing using the T7 primer (Stratagene, Inc.). Bluescript containing M2 inserted in the reverse orientation (pBS-M2rev) was also isolated for use as a control. A BamHI fragment containing Udorn M2 was isolated from pSV73E/KM2–10 and subcloned into pBS as above to generate plasmid pBS-M2U. A HindIII-BamHI fragment encoding HA from the Japan strain of influenza virus was purified after digestion of plasmid pCB6-HA (from Dr. M. Roth, Southwestern Medical Center, via Dr. S. Sisodia) and subcloned behind the T7 promoter of pBS. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody Fc125 was a generous gift of Dr. T. Braciale (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (40–80% confluent in 35-mm dishes) were infected in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7.3 encoding the T7 RNA polymerase gene at a multiplicity of infection of 10–20 (12Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). After 30 min at 37 °C, the inoculum was replaced with serum-free medium containing 3–6 μg of DNA encoding the appropriate genes behind the T7 promoter, and 5–10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Where indicated, 5 μm amantadine (Sigma; prepared as a 5 mmstock in 95% ethanol and stored at 4 °C) was added to some dishes immediately following transfection. In coexpression experiments, 2 μg of pBS-HA and 4 μg of either pBS-M2 or pBS-M2rev were added per dish with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE. The amount of HA synthesized upon coxpression with either pBS-M2 or pBS-M2rev was comparable as assessed by immunoprecipitation. Indirect immunofluorescence of vaccinia-infected HeLa cells was performed as described previously (13Weisz O.A. Machamer C.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 137-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells transfected with pTM3-FM2 were rinsed once with PBS, fixed for 20 min at ambient temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde, then incubated briefly with PBS containing 10 mm glycine and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-G). Where indicated, cells were permeabilized for 3 min in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS-G. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.25% ovalbumin in PBS-G prior to incubation with antibodies. M2 was detected using the monoclonal antibody 5C4 at a dilution of 1:250 followed by Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (2 mg/ml, 1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Avondale, PA). Cells were viewed using a Nikon FXL microscope with an integrating 3 chip color CCD and images were captured using Optimus (Optimus, Seattle, WA). At 4–5 h postinfection, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then starved for 30 min in medium A (cysteine-free, methionine-free minimal essential medium containing 0.35 g/liter NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm MES, pH 7.0 (14Sakaguchi T. Leser G.P. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 733-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)). Cells were metabolically labeled with 50–100 μCi/ml [35S]EXPRESS (NEN Life Science Products) in the same medium, then chased in the same medium supplemented with four times the normal amount of cysteine and methionine (medium B). At the indicated times, individual dishes were rapidly chilled, rinsed with PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide (PBA), and incubated with 10 μg of 5C4 antibody in 0.3 ml of PBA for 2 h at 0 °C on a rotating platform. Cells were then washed five times with PBA, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in 0.5 ml of detergent solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 62.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin. Lysates were centrifuged briefly to remove nuclei, and SDS was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.2%. Antibody-antigen complexes (surface M2) were collected immediately from four-fifths of the sample by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C with fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Total M2 was immunoprecipitated from the remainder of the sample using 3 μg of 5C4 and collected as described above. After washing three times with RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS), bound material was eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were scanned and the amount of M2 precipitated at the cell surface at each time point was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (GS-363 Molecular Imager System, Bio-Rad). Vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells co-transfected with pBS-HA and pBS-M2R or pBS-M2rev were starved for 30 min in medium A starting at 4 h postinfection. Dishes were radiolabeled for 10 min with 50–200 μCi/ml [35S]EXPRESS, then chased in medium B for the indicated times. Dishes were rinsed with PBS, solubilized in detergent solution containing aprotinin, and HA immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody Fc125 (gift of Dr. Thomas Braciale). After collection of antibody antigen complexed using S. aureus, bound material was eluted by boiling for 3 min in 25 μl of 1% SDS in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, and the eluate was divided into two aliquots. An equal volume of 0.15 m citrate buffer, pH 5.5, containing approximately 50 units of endoglycosidase H (endo H, New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) was added to one tube, while its control received buffer only. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, Laemmli sample buffer was added and the samples were boiled and resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Cells were lysed in detergent solution and HA immunoprecipitated as described above. Antibody-antigen complexes were washed once with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 9 mm CaCl2, then resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer and divided into two aliquots. Neuraminidase (1 milliunits of Vibrio cholerae, Calbiochem) was added to one aliquot, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing once with RIPA, bound material was eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immediately after synthesis, HA migrated as a single band; however, with increasing chase times, a second, more slowly migrating band began to accumulate. Neuraminidase treatment converted all of the slowly migrating form of HA to the more rapidly migrating form. Thus the kinetics of sialylation could be determined by quantitating the percentage of total HA migrating as the mature (slowly migrating) form in the untreated samples. Cell surface delivery of HA was measured using a well characterized trypsinization assay (15Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells transfected with pBS-M2R or pBS-M2rev and pBS-HA were starved in medium A for 30 min at 37 °C starting at 4 h postinfection. Cells were metabolically radiolabeled with 100–200 μCi/ml [35S]EXPRESS for 15 min, then chased in medium B. At various times, dishes were removed, rapidly chilled to 0 °C by rinsing with ice-cold PBS, and incubated on ice for 30 min in 1 ml of medium B containing 100 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) for 30 min. Cells were then rinsed 5 times over a 30-min period with medium B containing 10% fetal bovine serum, rinsed with PBS, solubilized in detergent solution supplemented with 200 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and HA immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody Fc125. This antibody quantitatively immunoprecipitates HA as well as both of its cleavage products (HA1 and HA2, which remain associated via disulfide bonds). After electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the percentage of cleaved HA was quantitated. BL-1743 was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Krystal (Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Wallingford, CT) and prepared as a 10 mg/ml stock in ethanol. HeLa cells were infected with vTF7.3 and transfected as described above. BL-1743 (10 μm) was added to some dishes immediately following transfection and in all subsequent steps unless otherwise indicated. In some cases, BL-1743 was washed out by replacing the medium with fresh drug-free medium. At 4 h postinfection, cells were rapidly chilled, starved in medium A for 30 min, and pulse labeled for 10 min. In some experiments, BL-1743 was washed out immediately after the pulse label by incubating the cells for up to 2 h in ice-cold drug-free chase medium. The medium was then replaced with prewarmed chase medium (with or without BL-1743), the cells were returned to 37 °C, and endo H kinetics determined as described above. Our initial observation that led to the studies described here was that M2 activity potently blocked its own delivery to the cell surface. We transfected vaccinia-infected HeLa cells with plasmid pTM3-FM2 and examined total and cell surface expression of M2 at 5 h postinfection by indirect immunofluorescence. When M2 was expressed in the absence of AMT (Fig. 1, A and B), there was considerable staining of M2 in intracellular compartments; however, little M2 staining could be detected in nonpermeabilized cells, suggesting that this protein was inefficiently delivered to the cell surface (Fig. 1 B). Surprisingly, when 5 μm AMT was added to the cells immediately after transfection, considerably more M2 was detected at the plasma membrane (compare Fig. 1, B and D). These results suggest that M2 activity influences its own transport to the cell surface. Immunoprecipitation of M2 from similarly transfected cells confirmed that there was no difference in M2 expression in the presence or absence of AMT (not shown). Because M2 is not readily internalized from the plasma membrane, 2J. R. Henkel and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. the altered distribution of M2 between untreated and AMT-treated cells likely reflects a difference in cell surface delivery rate of M2. To quantify this observation, we used cell surface immunoprecipitation to measure the rate of M2 delivery to the cell surface in the presence and absence of AMT (the 24-amino acid lumenal domain of M2 contains no lysine residues and cannot be biotinylated using NHS-biotin derivatives). HeLa cells expressing M2 in the TM3 vector were metabolically radiolabeled, then chased for various times. At each time point, dishes were rapidly chilled, then incubated with anti-M2 antibody. After washing, cells were lysed and antibody-antigen complexes (surface M2) were collected and the remainder of the sample (intracellular M2) was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2). In control experiments, addition of excess unlabeled cell lysate from M2-expressing cells did not reduce the amount of radiolabeled M2 recovered at the cell surface, suggesting that antibody-antigen complexes remained stable during the lysis and recovery procedures. In addition, incubation with 3-fold more antibody did not increase the amount of M2 recovered at the cell surface. Quantitation of M2 delivery to the cell surface confirmed the qualitative results from indirect immunofluorescence. Whereas approximately 16% of the total M2 expressed using the TM3 vector reached the cell surface by 2.5 h in the presence of AMT, less than 4% was detected at the surface in untreated cells. Inclusion of AMT only during the antibody-binding step did not affect the amount of M2 recovered at the cell surface, suggesting that the affinity of antibody binding to M2 was unaffected by the presence of this inhibitor. These kinetics of delivery represent a minimum estimate of the amount of M2 present at the plasma membrane, as cell surface immunoprecipitation is unlikely to be 100% efficient. Nonetheless, this approach allows us to compare cell surface delivery of M2 in the presence and absence of AMT, and confirms our qualitative observations by immunofluorescence. Because M2 activity clearly slows its own delivery to the plasma membrane, we asked whether transport of other proteins would be similarly affected. To this end, we coexpressed a glycosylated marker protein, influenza hemagglutinin (HA, Japan strain), with M2 and examined the kinetics of its transport through the Golgi complex and to the cell surface in the presence and absence of AMT. Because the high efficiency vector pTM3-FM2 overwhelms expression from pBS-HA, we subcloned Rostock M2 into Bluescript so that expression of both proteins could be easily regulated. Expression of M2 from pBS was approximately 20-fold lower than from pTM3 (not shown). Vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells were cotransfected with pBS-HA and either pBS-M2R, or as a control, with pBS-M2rev, which contains the Rostock M2 sequence inserted into pBS in the reverse orientation. The amount of HA synthesized when coexpressed with either Rostock M2 or M2rev was very similar. As a first step in determining whether the relatively low level of M2 expressed using pBS-M2R affected protein transport through the secretory pathway, we compared HA transport to the cis/medial compartment of the Golgi complex in the presence or absence of active M2. HA transport through the early Golgi was followed by quantitating the acquisition of resistance to oligosaccharide cleavage by endoglycosidase H, an event that occurs in the cis and/or medial cisternae of the Golgi. The rate of conversion of HA to its endo H-resistant form was modestly but reproducibly inhibited when the protein was coexpressed with M2 compared with M2rev (Fig. 3 A). Inclusion of 5 μm AMT immediately post-transfection and in subsequent steps partially restored the processing kinetics, suggesting that the effect of M2 expression on HA endo H kinetics was due to its ion channel activity. These results are similar to those reported recently by Sakaguchi et al. (14Sakaguchi T. Leser G.P. Lamb R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 733-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and therefore suggest that the effect of M2 activity on this step of protein traffic is maximal even at the presumably lower expression level used here. AMT at the concentration used here is not completely effective at blocking Rostock M2 activity (16Wang C. Takeuchi K. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1995; 67: 5585-5594Crossref Google Scholar); thus it is not surprising that only a partial restoration of transport kinetics was observed. Higher levels of AMT were not tested as this compound by itself can raise intracellular pH at increased concentrations (17Ohuchi M. Cramer A. Vey M. Ohuchi R. Garten W. Klenk H.-D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 920-926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The next step along the secretory pathway that we monitored is transport of HA to the trans-Golgi, where sialylation of N-linked oligosaccharides occurs. We compared the kinetics of sialylation of HA coexpressed with either M2 or M2rev. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the rate of HA sialylation was slowed in the presence of active M2 and could be partly restored to normal by inclusion of AMT in the medium. We then examined whether M2 activity altered the rate of appearance of newly synthesized HA at the cell surface. HA was coexpressed with M2 or M2rev as above, and cell surface delivery monitored using a surface trypsinization assay (Fig. 3 C). The rate of cell surface delivery of HA was dramatically reduced in the presence of active M2, and could be partially restored by including AMT in the medium. We estimate that M2 activity caused a 70% decrease in the initial rate of HA cell surface delivery based on analysis of several individual experiments. The observation that M2 affects early steps in protein transport was surprising, as these compartments are not thought to be acidified. We hypothesized that an M2-mediated accumulation of coat proteins or other common components of the protein transport machinery in acidified regions of the Golgi complex could ultimately lead to decreased efficiency in transport through earlier compartments. If this were the case, then the first round of protein transport through the Golgi complex after activation of preaccumulated but inactive M2 should be unaffected by these downstream effects. To test this idea, we took advantage of the newly described compound BL-1743, which is a potent but rapidly reversible inhibitor of M2 (18Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of this inhibitor for M2 is comparable to that of AMT, but unlike AMT, BL-1743 rapidly dissociates from M2 (the t½ for reversal of M2 ion channel inhibition upon washout of BL-1743 is about 12 min (18Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Luo G. Shaughnessy M.A. Mullaney D. Kurtz S. Krystal M. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Because inhibition by BL-1743 has been most extensively characterized for Udorn M2, we used this isoform of M2 for these studies. Rostock and Udorn M2 had similar effects on all of the steps in protein transport measured, including intra-Golgi transport and cell surface delivery of HA, and BL-1743 had no effect on the transport rate of HA expressed in the absence of M2 (not shown). To confirm that BL-1743 was reversible, HeLa cells cotransfected with pBS-M2U and pBS-HA were incubated in the presence or absence of BL-1743. At 3 h postinfection, the medium in some dishes that had been treated with BL-1743 was replaced with fresh medium without drug, and the incubation continued for an additional 60 min. Subsequently, the cells were starved, pulse labeled, chased for the indicated times, and the kinetics of endo H resistance determined (Fig. 4). When HA was coexpressed with M2, the rate of acquisition of endo H-resistance of newly synthesized HA was markedly slowed compared with control samples in which HA was coexpressed with M2 in the presence of amantadine or BL-1743. However, when BL-1743 was washed out prior to the pulse label, the rate of acquisition of endo H resistance of HA was similar to that observed in samples expressing untreated (active) M2. Therefore, the effects of BL-1743 were completely reversible in this system. To determine whether protein transport through the early Golgi was selectively affected immediately upon M2 activation, we performed the following experiments. HeLa cells cotransfected with either pBS-M2U or pBS-M2rev and pBS-HA in HeLa cells were incubated in the presence or absence of BL-1743. At 4 h postinfection, cells were starved for 30 min prior to radiolabeling. Subsequently, the cells were rapidly chilled to 0 °C, and BL-1743 washed out of the indicated samples for 30 min. The cells were then rapidly warmed to 37 °C and the kinetics of endo H resistance (Fig. 5) and cell surface delivery (Fig. 6) of HA were determined in the continued presence or absence of BL-1743. As in Fig. 4, HA coexpressed with M2 which was active throughout the experiment had a slower rate of acquisition of endo H-resistance of newly synthesized HA compared with control samples in which HA was coexpressed with M2rev or M2 in the continued presence of BL-1743 (Fig. 5). However, when BL-1743 was washed o"

TGF-β1 has also been proposed to be an autocrine regulator of adrenocortical steroidogenesis, acting mainly by decreasing the expression of cytochrome P450c17. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 has a second target in bovine adrenocortical cells, namely the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Indeed, supplying cells with steroid precursors revealed that TGF-β1 inhibited two steps in the steroid synthesis pathway, one prior to pregnenolone production and another corresponding to P450c17. More specifically, TGF-β1 inhibited pregnenolone production but neither the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone nor P450scc activity. Thus, TGF-β1 must decrease the cholesterol supply to P450scc. We therefore examined the effect of TGF-β1 on the expression of StAR, a mitochondrial protein implicated in intramitochondrial cholesterol transport. TGF-β1 decreased the steady state level of StAR mRNA in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition occurs at the level of StAR transcription and depends on RNA and protein synthesis.

Our laboratory has shown that bovine adrenal cortical (BAC) cells from the fasciculata zone express specific high affinity TGF-β1 receptors (4Cochet C. Feige J.-J. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol.

In TGF-β1-treated BAC cells, low density lipoprotein uptake and metabolism are inhibited (8Hotta M. Baird A. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and angiotensin II binding is reduced (9Feige J.-J. Cochet C. Rainey W.E. Madani C. Chambaz E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13491-13495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 also decreases the expression of several steroidogenic enzymes. The major target has been shown to be cytochrome P450c17 which is strongly inhibited by TGF-β1 in bovine (10Feige J.-J. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), ovine (11Rainey W.E. Naville D. Saez J.M. Carr B.R. Byrd W. Magness R.R. Mason J.I.

Endocrinol. & Metab. 1994; 79: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TGF-β1 has been shown to inhibit 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerase (3β-HSD) (13Rainey W.E. Naville D. Mason J.I. Endocr. Res. 1991; 17: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) (14Naaman-Reperant E. Hales D.B. Durand P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 886-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) enzyme expressions, although regulation of these enzymes seems to differ from one species to another. The negative effect of TGF-β1 on steroidogenesis has also been observed in other cell types such as testicular Leydig cells (15Avallet O. Vigier M. Perrard-Sapori M.H. Saez J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Benahmed M. Sordoillet C. Chauvin M.A. de Peretti E. Morera A.M. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1992; 85: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is an obligatory precursor of steroid hormones in steroidogenic cells. Endogenous cholesterol is either synthesized from acetate or absorbed from blood, principally through LDLs in the bovine adrenal cortex, and is stored mainly as cholesterol esters in lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. The biosynthesis of steroid hormones upon ACTH stimulation starts with the transport of the substrate cholesterol from extramitochondrial stores to the inner mitochondrial membrane where the first enzyme in the pathway, P450scc, cleaves cholesterol into pregnenolone. The intramitochondrial transport of cholesterol is the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis and the main site for regulation by physiological stimuli during acute stimulation of steroid production. Activation of this step is known to require de novo protein synthesis (18Privalle C.T. Crivello J.F. Jefcoate C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Recently, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) has been implicated as the regulator of intramitochondrial cholesterol translocation (for a review see Ref.19Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Steroids. 1997; 62: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). StAR is synthesized as a 37-kDa labile cytoplasmic precursor that is imported into the mitochondrion, where the cleavage of the mitochondrial targeting sequence occurs, yielding a 30-kDa protein. Transfection of MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line with the mouse StAR cDNA (20Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol.

Holt J.A. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy X.-P. Hart I.M. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mutations in the StAR gene were subsequently found to be responsible for lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia, an autosomal recessive disease in which the synthesis of all gonadal and adrenal steroids is severely impaired (22Lin D.

Fifteen different mutations in the StAR gene were found, and all rendered the StAR protein inactive in functional assays (22Lin D. Sugawara T. Straus III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P.

Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Closer examination of P450c17 inhibition by TGF-β1 in bovine adrenocortical cells suggested that TGF-β1 might have an earlier target in the biosynthesis of steroids. Testing this hypothesis, we found that TGF-β1 regulated two distinct steps in steroid biosynthesis as follows: 1) the conversion of pregnenolone to 17α-hydroxypregnenolone due to the inhibition of P450c17 expression, and 2) the supply of cholesterol to P450scc, suggesting inhibition of cholesterol transport to the inner mitochondrial membrane. This prompted us to study the effect of TGF-β1 on StAR expression. We report here that TGF-β1 decreases the steady state level of StAR mRNA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and that this inhibition requires transcription and translation of an intermediate protein. Synthetic β1–24 ACTH (Synacthène Immédiat®), metyrapone, and SU10603 were obtained from CIBA-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland). Recombinant TGF-β1 was purchased from R & D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Ham's F12 medium, actinomycin D, cycloheximide, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, and pregnenolone were purchased from Sigma (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). Trilostane was purchased from Farillon (United Kingdom). The murine StAR cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Douglas Stocco (Texas Tech University, Lubbock). Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Fasciculata-reticularis cells were obtained by successive tryptic digestions, seeded in 10-cm plates or in 12-well plates, and grown in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) and 2.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France) as described previously (24Duperray A. Chambaz E.M. J. Steroid Biochem. 1980; 13: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were used at day 2 or 3 of primary culture. BAC cells were incubated for 15 h with or without TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). The medium was then removed and replaced for 2 h with fresh medium for cortisol production or fresh medium containing 10 μm trilostane (3β-HSD inhibitor) and 40 μm SU10603 (P450c17 inhibitor) to measure pregnenolone production. To study steroid production from exogenous precursors, either 25-hydroxycholesterol (50 μm), pregnenolone (20 μm), or 17α-hydroxypregnenolone (20 μm) were added to the fresh medium during the 2-h incubation. Cortisol and pregnenolone were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using [1,2,6,7-3H]cortisol (3700 GBq/mmol, Amersham, Les Ulis, France) and [7-3H]pregnenolone (780.7 GBq/mmol, NEN Life Science Products, Le Blanc Mesnil, France), respectively. The cortisol antiserum was from Endocrine Sciences (Calabasas Hills, CA), and the pregnenolone antiserum was from Biogenesis (Poole, UK). BAC cells were incubated for 15 h with or without TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml). The cells were scraped and then homogenized with a Potter-Kontes homogenizer (1200 rpm, 35 strokes) in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 275 mmsucrose. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min to remove large debris and nuclei. Mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and washed once with the same buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). 50 μg of isolated mitochondria were equilibrated at 37 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm metyrapone (11β-hydroxylase inhibitor), 10 μm trilostane, and 200 μm25-hydroxycholesterol in a final volume of 500 μl. A mix of malate/isocitrate (1:1, v/v, final concentrations 10 mm) was added to start the reaction. The reaction was carried out for 10 min and was stopped by the addition of 5 ml of dichloromethane (26Mc Namara B.C. Jefcoate C.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 73: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pregnenolone was extracted and assayed by RIA as described above. Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNAgents® kit (Promega, Charbonnières, France). 25 μg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 1.9% formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham, Les Ulis, France). Blots were sequentially probed with a full-length murine StAR cDNA and an 18 S rRNA probe that were labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP (111 TBq/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Orsay, France) using the Radprime DNA labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France). Prehybridization and hybridization at 65 °C were performed in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham, Les Ulis, France). The blots were washed twice at room temperature in 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 mNaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, once in 1× SSC and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C, and once in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 65 °C. Hybridizing bands were visualized on a β-imager (PhosphorImager, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and quantified using the ImageQuantTM program (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Values for StAR mRNA were normalized to values for the 18 S rRNA. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test for comparison of two groups. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Recently, using primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical (fasciculata-reticularis) cells, we re-examined the effects of TGF-β1 on several steps of the cortisol biosynthesis pathway. Cortisol synthesis begins with the transport of the substrate cholesterol to the first enzyme in the pathway, P450scc, which cleaves cholesterol into pregnenolone which will then be hydroxylated by P450c17 into 17α-hydroxypregnenolone. The subsequent steps involve 3β-HSD, P450c21, and P450c11β enzymes. We used a cell-permeant analog of cholesterol and some of the intermediate substrates to determine whether inhibition by TGF-β1could be overcome by skipping any of these steps. BAC cells were pretreated for 15 h with or without TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml); the medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing the steroid precursors, and cortisol production was measured after 2 h. The results shown in Table I confirm that TGF-β1 is a very potent inhibitor of basal cortisol production (81% inhibition). When the cells are supplied with either 25-hydroxycholesterol (a membrane-permeant analog of cholesterol) or pregnenolone, TGF-β1-induced inhibition of cortisol synthesis is reduced to only 39 and 33%, respectively. TGF-β1 then must act prior to the production of pregnenolone, apparently at the level of cholesterol supply to P450scc. When 17α-hydroxypregnenolone is supplied as substrate, TGF-β1 no longer significantly inhibits cortisol synthesis (3%), confirming that TGF-β1 reduces the conversion of pregnenolone into 17α-hydroxypregnenolone. This block corresponds to the inhibition of P450c17 expression that we have previously demonstrated (10Feige J.-J. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Perrin A. Pascal O. Defaye G. Feige J.-J. Chambaz E.M.

Open table in a new tab To confirm that TGF-β1 inhibits an early steroidogenic step, we measured its effect on pregnenolone accumulation using inhibitors of 3β-HSD (trilostane) and P450c17 (SU 10603) to block pregnenolone metabolism. As shown in Fig. 1, pregnenolone production is inhibited by TGF-β1 in a time-dependent manner. This inhibition occurred as early as 6 h after treatment and reached a maximum at around 12 h in both unstimulated and ACTH-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). We then measured the effect of TGF-β1 on the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol into pregnenolone. Table II shows that when this permeant cholesterol analog was supplied as a steroid precursor, TGF-β1 no longer inhibited pregnenolone production (6% inhibition in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol versus58% in its absence). These results suggest that TGF-β1decreases cholesterol accessibility to the inner mitochondrial membrane rather than directly affects P450scc. This was confirmed by measuring the level and activity of P450scc protein in mitochondria isolated from cells treated or not treated with TGF-β1. We observed no difference in either P450scc protein level (data not shown) or activity in the absence of TGF-β1 (228 ± 21 ng of pregnenolone/mg protein/h) or in its presence (241 ± 57 ng of pregnenolone/mg protein/h).Table IITGF-β 1 inhibits cholesterol delivery to P450sccSteroid precursor addedPregnenolone2-aThe values represent the mean ± S.E. of triplicates from a typical experiment.Inhibition2-bPercent inhibition of pregnenolone production observed in TGF-β1-treated cells versus untreated cells.Mean % inhibition,2-cMean percent inhibition ± S.E. of pregnenolone production by TGF-β1-treated cells from four independent experiments. n = 4CTLTGF-β1ng/mg proteins/h%None24 ± 310 ± 15858 ± 182-dp < 0.001.25-Hydroxycholesterol375 ± 44348 ± 4476 ± 92-a The values represent the mean ± S.E. of triplicates from a typical experiment.2-b Percent inhibition of pregnenolone production observed in TGF-β1-treated cells versus untreated cells.2-c Mean percent inhibition ± S.E. of pregnenolone production by TGF-β1-treated cells from four independent experiments.2-d p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab The recent cloning of the StAR cDNA has allowed us to demonstrate that the corresponding protein plays a fundamental role in the mitochondrial import of cholesterol (20Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate the effect of TGF-β1 on the steady state level of StAR mRNA. Northern blot analysis of BAC cell total RNA using either a full-length mouse cDNA (Fig. 2 A) or a partial bovine cDNA probe (data not shown) revealed two major StAR transcripts (3 and 1.7 kb) that have been previously described (28Hartung S. Rust W. Balvers M. Ivell R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and a minor transcript (1.3 kb). The 3-kb and the 1.7-kb transcripts account for 60 and 30% of StAR mRNA expression, respectively, whereas the 1.3-kb transcript accounts for 10%. All three transcripts showed coordinate induction, and therefore, the most abundant transcript of 3 kb was quantified as a representative of the three transcripts. Continuous treatment of BAC cells with TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) caused a time-dependent decrease in the steady state level of StAR mRNA in both unstimulated and ACTH-stimulated cells. This decrease was significant after 4 h of exposure to TGF-β1, and the effect was nearly maximal after 12 h and sustained for up to 24 h (85% inhibition) (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 Cshows the kinetics of StAR mRNA induction in ACTH-stimulated cellsversus control cells. We found that StAR mRNA levels in BAC cells were markedly increased within 1 h and peaked at 2 h after ACTH treatment, returning to a basal level after 12 h of stimulation. The inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 was concentration-dependent, and a 12-h exposure of BAC cells to TGF-β1 concentrations ranging from 2 pg/ml to 2 ng/ml decreased StAR transcript levels by 15–75% (Fig. 3). The EC50 for StAR inhibition was found to be 20 pg/ml TGF-β1. To determine whether the effects of TGF-β1 on StAR mRNA levels were due to changes in transcript stability, BAC cells were incubated in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) for 12 h and subsequently treated with actinomycin D (2.5 μg/ml) for 6–24 h. The half-life of StAR mRNA in transcriptionally arrested BAC cells was determined to be 12 h in both control and TGF-β1-treated cultures (Fig. 4). This suggests that TGF-β1 does not modify the degradation of StAR mRNA but rather affects its transcription rate. To determine whether the effect of TGF-β1on StAR mRNA levels was dependent on transcription and/or translation, BAC cells were treated with TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (2.5 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). We found that, in the presence of either of these two inhibitors, TGF-β1 no longer decreases StAR transcripts levels (Fig. 5). Thus, inhibition by TGF-β1 seems to depend on the synthesis of other proteins. TGF-β1 treatment of adrenocortical steroidogenic cells has been shown to result in the inhibition of steroid hormone biosynthesis, mainly attributable to a decrease in P450c17 expression (10Feige J.-J. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Rainey W.E. Naville D. Saez J.M. Carr B.R. Byrd W. Magness R.R. Mason J.I.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that TGF-β1inhibits not only P450c17 expression but also that of StAR, a recently described protein implicated in intramitochondrial cholesterol translocation. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that this inhibition occurs at the level of StAR transcription and requires the transcription and translation of new proteins. A number of studies performed on bovine and ovine adrenocortical fasciculata and glomerulosa cells (29Hotta M. Baird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7795-7799Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Rainey W.E. Viard I. Mason J.I. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Saez J.M. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1184-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), in porcine testicular Leydig cells (16Benahmed M. Sordoillet C. Chauvin M.A. de Peretti E. Morera A.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 67: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and in porcine ovarian thecal cells (17Engelhardt H. Tekpetey F.R. Gore-Langton R.E. Armstrong D.T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 85: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have led to the hypothesis that TGF-β1 modifies cholesterol accessibility to P450scc. In most of these works, TGF-β1has been shown to decrease pregnenolone synthesis, which could be restored by the addition of 22(R)- or 25-hydroxycholesterol. In the present study, we used precursor steroids, 25-hydroxycholesterol, pregnenolone, and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, to demonstrate that TGF-β1 has at least two targets in BAC cells as follows: one that lies between pregnenolone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, previously identified as P450c17 (10Feige J.-J. Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Perrin A. Pascal O. Defaye G. Feige J.-J. Chambaz E.M. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and another that seems to affect cholesterol accessibility to P450scc. Indeed, addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol fully restored pregnenolone synthesis in TGF-β1-treated cells. Pregnenolone production in isolated mitochondria from TGF-β1-treated cells in which cholesterol was allowed to accumulate was also inhibited (data not shown). Finally, we found that TGF-β1 inhibits neither the level nor the activity of P450scc. Altogether, these results clearly demonstrate that TGF-β1 decreases cholesterol accessibility to the inner mitochondrial membrane, in accordance with the studies mentioned above. The only hypothesis in the literature to explain this effect was formulated by Hotta and Baird (8Hotta M. Baird A. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) who showed that TGF-β1induces a decrease in the number of LDL receptors, which are in part responsible for cholesterol entry into the cell. However, we found that TGF-β1 still inhibits pregnenolone production in the absence of LDLs in the medium (30 ± 4% inhibition). In view of our results, we cannot completely exclude that TGF-β1might decrease the number of LDL receptors; however, it is clear that TGF-β1 hits another target. We examined the effect of TGF-β1 on the expression of StAR, a mitochondrial protein required for steroid hormone biosynthesis, which regulates cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results demonstrate that TGF-β1 strongly inhibits StAR mRNA expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, TGF-β1-induced decrease of StAR mRNA expression occurs with similar kinetics and EC50 as TGF-β1 inhibition of pregnenolone synthesis. To definitively establish a direct link between these two inhibitions, we are currently testing whether overexpression of StAR relieves the TGF-β1 inhibition of pregnenolone synthesis. It is long known that a newly synthesized protein(s) is absolutely required for the acute regulation of steroidogenesis (32Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10159-10167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Garren L.D. Ney R.L. Davis W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Several candidate proteins have been proposed, including the sterol carrier protein 2, the steroidogenesis activator protein, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor with the diazepam binding inhibitor, and a family of proteins of approximately 30 kDa that are rapidly synthesized and phosphorylated in response to corticotropic hormone (for review, see Ref. 34Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). More recently, Clark et al. (20Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cloned the cDNA encoding the 30-kDa phosphoprotein that was called StAR. A model has been proposed that dissociates the import to the mitochondrion and processing of StAR from its steroidogenic activity. It was shown both in vivo (23Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Miller W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and in vitro (35Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) that N-terminal truncated StAR proteins can increase pregnenolone synthesis without entering the mitochondria, probably by acting on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This suggests that StAR acts through its C-terminal domain to induce cholesterol import into the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is clear that StAR plays a fundamental role in steroidogenesis. This implies that the expression of such an important protein must be tightly regulated. StAR is rapidly synthesized in response to cAMP analogs in the Leydig tumor cell line MA-10 (36Clark B.J. Soo S.-C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in ovary cells (37Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Sugawara T. Straus III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and in response to angiotensin II through a Ca2+-dependent pathway in bovine glomerulosa cells (38Cherradi N. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Timberg R. Friedberg I. Orly J. Wang X.J. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7899-7907Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). StAR is regulated both at the mRNA and the protein level. In particular, it has been found that the 37-kDa StAR protein has a very short half-life of 4–6 min (39Epstein L.F. Orme-Johnson N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19739-19745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have performed Northern blot analysis to study the expression of StAR mRNA in BAC cells. We found two major transcripts (3 and 1.7 kb) that have been previously described (28Hartung S. Rust W. Balvers M. Ivell R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 40Pilon N. Daneau I. Brisson C. Ethier J.-F. Lussier J.G. Silversides D.W. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and a minor transcript (1.3 kb). This smaller transcript has not been described before in bovine cells, but this could be due to low sensitivity of Northern blots in the earlier studies, as three transcripts have also been shown in both human (21Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Driscoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy X.-P. Hart I.M. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and mouse (36Clark B.J. Soo S.-C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three transcripts are long enough to encode a full-length protein. The functional significance of the different transcripts is not yet known; however, all three are coordinately induced by ACTH in BAC cells. StAR mRNA levels in BAC cells were markedly increased within 1 h of ACTH treatment, peaked at 2 h, and returned to a basal level after 12 h. This is a little faster than in mouse cells stimulated with a cAMP analog (starting after 2 h and peaking between 4–6 h) (36Clark B.J. Soo S.-C. Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Stocco D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and much faster than in ovary cells (maximum at 24 h) (37Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Sugawara T. Straus III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We found that TGF-β1 significantly decreased StAR mRNA levels as early as 4 h, reaching a maximum at 12 h in both unstimulated and ACTH-stimulated cells. Our results show that ACTH induction of StAR mRNA expression is faster than its decrease by TGF-β1. The EC50 for this inhibition was around 20 pg/ml, which corresponds to the EC50 described for the inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation (41van Zoelen E.J.J. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1990; 2: 131-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on the steady state level of StAR mRNA was not due to an increase in its degradation, as we found a similar half-life (12 h) for StAR mRNA in both control and TGF-β1-treated cells. It can be surmised that TGF-β1 inhibition is due to a decrease in StAR gene transcription. This is the first report of a transcriptional inhibition of StAR. Reduction of StAR mRNA expression by prostaglandin F2α in the rat ovary has been reported (42Juengel J.L. Meberg B.M. Turzillo A.M. Nett T.M. Niswender G.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5423-5429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the mechanism was not elucidated. Importantly, we found that the inhibition of StAR in BAC cells is dependent upon ongoing transcription and protein synthesis, as addition of actinomycin D or cycloheximide completely abolishes the effect of TGF-β1. Thus the inhibition of StAR expression by TGF-β1 requires the production of additional intermediate regulators. TGF-β1 signals through type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors (for a review, see Ref.43Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor complex occurs when the type II receptor kinase transphosphorylates the type I receptor in response to ligand binding. This activates the type I kinase, which transiently associates with and phosphorylates Smad proteins. Phosphorylated Smads translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription of TGF-β-responsive genes. It will be interesting to see whether Smads are involved in TGF-β1 signal transduction in BAC cells, as it has not yet been demonstrated that Smads are implicated in all biological responses to TGF-β. Possible candidates for the intermediary protein include the transcription factors c-Jun and/or c-Fos that bind to AP-1 sites. Indeed, the expression of these two immediate-early genes is induced by TGF-β1 in many different cell types (44Pertovaara L. Sistonen L. Bos T.J. Vogt P.K. Keski-Oja J. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 45Takeshita A. Chen Y. Atsushi W. Kitano S. Hanazawa S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 419-426PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, phorbol myristate acetate prevents StAR mRNA induction by a cAMP analog in the human ovary and in the ovine corpora lutea (37Kiriakidou M. McAllister J.M. Sugawara T. Straus III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1996; 81: 4122-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 42Juengel J.L. Meberg B.M. Turzillo A.M. Nett T.M. Niswender G.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5423-5429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by activating protein kinase C, a kinase that is known to modulate responses through AP-1-binding sites. The StAR promoter, like that of the cytochrome P450 hydroxylases, lacks typical cAMP-responsive elements; instead, alternate cAMP-responsive sequences mediate the hormonal induction of these genes (46Waterman M.R. Bischof L.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the steroid hydroxylases and StAR are all apparently transcriptionally regulated by the orphan nuclear receptor, SF-1 (47Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 261-377Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that TGF-β1-induced inhibition of StAR and P450c17 expression may occur via the same mechanism involving a common regulator like SF-1. DAX-1, which also belongs to the orphan nuclear receptor family and has been found to inhibit SF-1 transactivation (48Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), is another potential target of TGF-β1 action. Altogether, the data reported here demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a major regulator of differentiated functions of steroidogenic cells, modifying the two rate-limiting steps in cortisol biosynthesis, StAR and P450c17 expression. We are currently investigating the possibility of a common repressive mechanism of TGF-β1 on StAR and CYP17 promoters. The present observations support the potential role of TGF-β1 as a negative regulator of adrenocortical cell-differentiated functions, in balance with the major positive agent ACTH, to control the overall homeostasis of this endocrine tissue. We are grateful to Dr. Stocco (Texas Tech University, Lubbock) for the generous gift of StAR cDNA. We thank Isabelle Gaillard for skillful help in the preparation of primary cultures of adrenocortical cells."

The RAD7- and RAD16-encoded proteins exist as a tight complex named nucleotide excision repair factor 4 or NEF4. Previously, we showed that NEF4 binds UV-damaged DNA with high specificity and with a dependence upon ATP and that inclusion of NEF4 to the reconstituted nucleotide excision repair system consisting of purified NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and replication protein A results in marked stimulation of damage-specific DNA incision. Here we show that NEF4 possesses an ATPase activity that is entirely dependent on a DNA cofactor and that double-stranded DNA is twice as effective as single-stranded DNA in activating ATP hydrolysis. Even though DNA binding is promoted by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS), damage binding is more proficient with ATP than with ATPγS. Interestingly, UV irradiation of double-stranded DNA results in a pronounced attenuation of the ATPase activity. Taken together, our results suggest a model in which ATP hydrolysis by NEF4 fuels the translocation of NEF4 on DNA in search of UV lesions and damage binding by NEF4 leads to a down-regulation of the ATPase activity. Damage-bound NEF4 could then serve as a nucleation point for the assembly of other repair components.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; NEF, nucleotide excision repair factor; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein A; APTγS, replication protein A. of ultraviolet-damaged DNA in eukaryotes is a complex process requiring the products of a large number of genes. The structure and function of the nucleotide excision repair genes are highly conserved among eukaryotes from yeast to humans (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Biochemical fractionation of yeast cell extracts have revealed the organization of the NER proteins into distinct functional subassemblies called nucleotide excision repair factors or NEFs. Specifically, we have shown that NEF1 contains the damage recognition protein Rad14 and the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease (3Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), NEF2 comprises the Rad4 and Rad23 proteins (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and that the Rad2 endonuclease and the six-subunit RNA polymerase II transcription factor TFIIH form NEF3 (5Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10718-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our biochemical studies have further demonstrated that the combination of NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding factor replication protein A (RPA) is sufficient for dual incision of UV-damaged DNA to occur (3Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Human equivalents of these yeast NER proteins also carry out the dual incision of damaged DNA (7Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7177-7186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition to the aforementioned NER factors, genetic studies have indicated a role of four additional genes, RAD7, RAD16, RAD26, and MMS19, in NER (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The MMS19-encoded protein affects cell viability and functions in RNA polymerase II transcription, probably as a regulatory component by modulating the activity of TFIIH and of proteins that function in other cellular processes (10Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Rad26 protein is a member of the Swi2/Snf2 family of proteins, possesses a DNA-dependent ATPase activity (11Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and is required for the preferential repair of the transcribed DNA strand (12van Gool A.J. Verhage R. Swagemakers S.M.A. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Troelstra C. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The RAD7 and RAD16 genes, on the other hand, are specifically required for the nucleotide excision repair of nontranscribed DNA (13Verhage R. Zeeman A.-M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Gang D.D. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6135-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Mueller J.P. Smerdon M.J.

The RAD7 gene product does not possess significant homology to any other known protein, whereas the RAD16-encoded product is another member of the Swi2/Snf2 protein family (17Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are associated in a stoichiometric complex, which we have named NEF4. NEF4 has high affinity for UV-damaged DNA, and addition of NEF4 to the reconstituted NER system consisting of NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and RPA results in marked stimulation of damage-specific incision (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Here we describe our studies demonstrating a DNA-dependent ATPase activity in NEF4. Interestingly, UV irradiation of the DNA cofactor results in a marked down-regulation of the NEF4 ATPase activity. We suggest a model in which the free energy from ATP hydrolysis is utilized to fuel the translocation of NEF4 on DNA to search for DNA lesions. Binding of NEF4 to a DNA lesion results in suppression of ATP hydrolysis, and the stable NEF4-DNA damage complex serves as the nucleation site for the assembly of other NER factors. Extract was prepared from 500 g of cells of strain LY2 co-harboring pR7.8 (2 μm, GAL-PGK-RAD7) and pR16.15 (2 μm, ADCI-RAD16) using a French press and clarified by centrifugation (100,000 ×g for 120 min). The clarified extract was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (35% saturation) to precipitate NEF4 and approximately 15% of the total protein. The precipitate was harvested by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min) and dissolved in K buffer (20 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) followed by sequential fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Mono S to yield fraction VI NEF4 (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The final yield of NEF4 was 90 μg with a recovery of ∼15%. When fraction VI NEF4 was analyzed in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue, only the Rad7 and Rad16 proteins were seen (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), indicating that the preparation was nearly homogeneous. Fraction VI NEF4 was used in all the biochemical studies described below. Purified NEF4, 120 ng, was mixed with 250 ng of φX ssDNA or 250 ng of φX double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), 0.5 mm ATP and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Life Science, Inc.) in buffer R (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min or as indicated. For quantifying ATP hydrolysis, a 0.5-μl portion of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto a polyethyleniminecellulose sheet, which was developed with 1 m formic acid containing 0.3 mLiCl. Quantification was done by phosphoimage analysis in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The substrate for the DNA helicase assay was obtained as described previously (19Guzder S.N. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). A 5′ 32P-labeled 17-base DNA fragment was hybridized to the viral (+) strand of M13mp18 to generate a partial duplex. The nonhybridized labeled DNA fragment was separated from the partial duplex DNA by gel filtration in Sepharose G-50 matrix equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl at 4 °C. Fractions containing the peak of partial duplex DNA were pooled and concentrated to a small volume. The helicase substrate, 5 ng, was mixed with the indicated amount of NEF4 protein in 10 μl of buffer R containing 2 mm ATP. After incubation for 45 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 1% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue. The reaction mixture was run in 12% polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. DNA helicase assay employing Rad3 protein was carried out as described (20Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8951-8955Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A 0.9-kilobase AT-rich DNA fragment from plasmid pS288 (21Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) was cloned into pUC19 to generate the plasmid pTB402. A 130-base pair HindIII-SalI fragment that contained eight consecutive thymines was isolated from plasmid pTB402 and labeled with 32P at the 3′ end by treatment with Klenow polymerase (22Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UV irradiation of the fragment was carried out using a germicidal UV lamp emitting at 254 nm, as described previously (22Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Purified NEF4, 60 ng, was incubated with 2 ng of the 32P-labeled DNA fragment and 20 ng of linear φX dsDNA as cold competitor in 10 μl of reaction buffer R that contained 2 mm ATP or ATPγS. After the addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (40% glycerol, 0.1 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.02% acridine orange), the reaction mixtures were run in 4% polyacrylamide gels at 30 mA and 4 °C for 1 h. The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and then exposed to Kodak MR film or subjected to phosphoimage analysis to quantify the binding reaction. By immunoprecipitation and other criteria, we have shown recently that Rad7 and Rad16 are associated in a stable complex (Kd ≤ 4 × 10−10m) termed NEF4, which has been purified to near homogeneity (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The Rad16 protein contains Walker types A and B nucleotide binding motifs (23Bang D.D. Verhage R. Goosen N. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) suggestive of an ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP. To examine whether purified NEF4 has ATPase activity, it was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by thin layer chromatography in polyethylenimine cellulose sheets using lithium chloride and formic acid as the developing solvent (11Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18314-18317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Randerath K. Randerath E. J. Chromatogr. 1964; 16: 111-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, without DNA, we did not detect significant hydrolysis of ATP (≤2%) over the pH range of 6.0–9.0 (data not shown). Since NEF4 functions in DNA repair and binds DNA, we tested whether in the presence of DNA NEF4 would hydrolyze ATP. Interestingly, the addition of either ssDNA or dsDNA resulted in substantial hydrolysis of ATP by NEF4 (see below). When the column fractions from the last step of NEF4 purification in Mono S were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Rad7 and anti-Rad16 antibodies to determine their NEF4 content and also assayed for ssDNA- and dsDNA-activated ATP hydrolysis, we found that both the ssDNA- and dsDNA-dependent ATPase activities closely paralleled the level of NEF4 in these fractions (Fig. 1). This precise co-elution of the DNA-dependent ATPase activity with NEF4 together with the high degree of purity of the NEF4 preparation (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that this activity is an intrinsic property of NEF4. We also examined the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis, and as shown in Fig. 2, the hydrolysis of ATP increased with the incubation time and was proportional to the amount of NEF4 used. From the results presented in Fig. 2, the turnover number for ATP hydrolysis was calculated to be 150 for the φX 174 ss DNA and 380 for the φX dsDNA. NEF4 hydrolyzes dATP with the same efficiency as ATP.Figure 2Characterization of the NEF4 ATPase activity.

To investigate the possibility that ATP hydrolysis seen with φX ssDNA might have been due to the presence of secondary structure in the DNA, we examined whether the single-stranded homopolymer poly(dA), which is relatively free of secondary structure, could also activate ATP hydrolysis by NEF4. As shown in Table I, poly(dA) was also effective in activating ATP hydrolysis. Taken together, these results indicate that NEF4 hydrolyzes ATP upon binding either ssDNA or dsDNA, with the latter being the preferred DNA cofactor.

All of the Swi2/Snf2 family of proteins possess the seven consensus helicase-like motifs that may be primarily involved in coordinating DNA binding, ATP binding, and the hydrolysis of ATP, as none of them has yet been shown to have DNA helicase activity (11Guzder S.N.

To determine whether Rad16 protein was an exception, we hybridized a 17-base 32P-labeled DNA fragment to circular M13 ssDNA and used the resulting partial duplex as substrate to test whether NEF4 had helicase activity. Incubation of the helicase substrate with as much as 300 ng of NEF4 for 45 min did not result in displacement of the hybridized fragment from the partial duplex (Fig. 2 C), whereas 100 ng of Rad3 protein, a known helicase (20Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8951-8955Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), resulted in >80% displacement of the hybridized fragment (data not shown). NEF4 also did not unwind a forked DNA substrate that contained 20-nucleotide-long 3′- and 5′-overhanging tails adjoining a 30-base pair duplex region (data not shown). Thus, it appears that, like the other Swi2/Snf2 family proteins that have been examined to date (11Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol.

Rad16 protein contains two potential zinc binding, DNA binding motifs, a C4 motif and a C3HC4 motif (23Bang D.D. Verhage R. Goosen N. Brouwer J. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which could confer damage-specific DNA binding activity to NEF4. C4 motifs are present in other known damage recognition factors including the Escherichia coli UvrA protein and the yeast Rad14 and human XPA proteins (22Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S.

The DNA binding activity of NEF4 was examined by a DNA mobility shift assay in which purified NEF4 was incubated with a 130-base pair DNA fragment that was end-labeled with 32P in the presence of cold φX 174 dsDNA as competitor to titrate out the nonspecific binding and then analyzing the reaction mixtures on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography of the dried gels to detect nucleoprotein complexes. As reported in our recent work (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and reiterated here in Fig. 3, in the presence of ATP, NEF4 binds specifically to UV-irradiated DNA. For instance, whereas less than 2% of the nondamaged DNA fragment was bound by NEF4 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4; Fig. 3 B), UV irradiation of the DNA fragment with doses of 2 and 10 kJ/m2 resulted in binding of about 40 and 90% of the DNA fragment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8 and 12; Fig. 3 B), respectively. The omission of ATP from the binding reaction diminished damage-specific DNA binding markedly, such that only 5 and 24% of the fragments irradiated with 2 and 10 kJ/m2 were bound by NEF4, respectively (Fig. 3). Previously, we showed that the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue ATPγS promotes damage binding by NEF4 (18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), indicating that damage recognition can occur in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. To determine if ATP hydrolysis modulates the level of damage recognition, here we examine the effect of ATP and ATPγS on the ability of NEF4 to bind DNA that had been irradiated with 2 or 10 kJ/m2 of UV light. As shown in Fig. 3, even though ATPγS promotes damage binding, the level of damage binding achieved with ATPγS (26 and 67% for the 2- and 10 kJ/m2-irradiated fragments) was lower than that seen with ATP (40 and 90% binding of the 2- and the 10-kJ/m2 irradiated fragments). These results suggest that ATP hydrolysis increases the efficiency of damage recognition by NEF4. To further analyze the relationship between damage recognition and ATP hydrolysis by NEF4, we incubated NEF4 with φX dsDNA that has been exposed to increasing doses of UV light (0.1–10 kJ/m2) and32P-labeled ATP. Unexpectedly, we found that UV irradiation of the dsDNA cofactor in fact results in a marked inhibition of the NEF4 ATPase activity (Fig. 4). For instance, irradiating the dsDNA with a dose of 500 J/m2, which introduced approximately five photoproducts per kilobase pair, resulted in 30% inhibition of the ATPase activity, with more inhibition occurring at progressively higher UV doses (Fig. 4). Thus, the results indicate that the binding of NEF4 to UV lesions is accompanied by an attenuation of ATP hydrolysis. Consistent with the presence of nucleotide binding motifs in the Rad16 protein, purified NEF4 has an ATPase activity that requires either ssDNA or dsDNA for its activation. In this regard, dsDNA is approximately twice as effective as ssDNA in activating ATP hydrolysis. NEF4 binds preferentially to UV damaged DNA (Ref. 18Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21665-21668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and this work), and ATP is required for maximal damage-specific binding. Even though ATPγS promotes damage-specific DNA binding, this reaction occurs more efficiently with ATP than with ATPγS. Furthermore, we find that UV irradiation of the dsDNA cofactor results in an attenuation of the ATPase activity. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that ATP hydrolysis by NEF4 is primarily utilized in steps before the binding of NEF4 to the UV damage in the target DNA. The strong dependence of the NEF4 damage recognition ability on ATP distinguishes it from two other known damage recognition factors, Rad14 and RPA, which are integral components of the NER machinery (4Guzder S.N. Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12973-12976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The yeast Rad14 protein and its human counterpart XPA both contain a zinc finger motif and have affinity for UV damage, but the damage binding activity of these yeast and human NER factors is not influenced by ATP (22Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 30Robins P. Jones C.J. Biggerstaff M. Lindahl T. Wood R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). RPA has also been shown to have an affinity for UV damage, but it does so in the absence of ATP (32Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). From the results of genetic and biochemical studies, we surmise that NEF4, by utilizing the free energy from ATP hydrolysis, translocates on chromosomal DNA to survey the DNA for the presence of bulky damages such as UV photoproducts (Fig. 5). Stable binding of NEF4 to the DNA lesion results in an attenuation of the ATPase activity, and the now damage-associated NEF4 serves as the nucleation site for the recruitment of other NER factors including the aforementioned damage recognition proteins to initiate the assembly of the NER machinery. This working model for NEF4 action predicts that Rad7 and Rad16 interact with one or more protein components in NEF1, NEF2, NEF3, and RPA to effect the coupling of the damage recognition process to the assembly of the basic NER machinery comprising the latter protein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2171661352,"The src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 has been implicated as an important positive regulator of several mitogenic signaling pathways. SHP-2 has more recently been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated and recruited to the gp130 component of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor complex upon stimulation with CNTF. CNTF does not, however, have a proliferative effect on responsive cells, but rather enhances the survival and differentiation of sympathetic, motor, and sensory neurons. In this study, expression of an interfering mutant of SHP-2 in the neuroblastoma cell line NBFL increased CNTF induction of a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) reporter gene, and in cultures of sympathetic neurons, it resulted in an up-regulation of endogenous VIP and substance P (SP) gene expression. Members of the CNTF family of cytokines transmit their signal by activating signaling pathways involving both STAT and Fos-Jun transcription factors. In CNTF-stimulated NBFL cells that constitutively express the SHP-2 interfering mutant, there was increased and prolonged formation of STAT/DNA complexes, but decreased AP-1 binding activity, that mirrored a down-regulation of c-<i>fos</i> expression both at the mRNA and protein level. Taken together, these data indicate that SHP-2 has dual and opposing roles in a signaling cascade triggered by the same ligand, as illustrated by its ability to differentially regulate the levels of activity of both STAT and AP-1 transcription factors."

However, little is known about the relationship between the exodomain and endodomain. It was reported that hormone binding to the exodomain was improved when the endodomain was truncated.

Endocrine. 1995; 3: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the relationship between the exodomain and endodomain. In this study, the hormone binding affinity of the truncated exodomain which lacks the endodomain is shown to be slightly and consistently higher than that of the wild type receptor. This result suggests that the endodomain influences the hormone binding at the exodomain. To identify the responsible amino acid residues the 20 amino acids of exoloop 2 in the wild type receptor, from Ser484 to Gln503, were Ala scanned. Mutant LH/CG-R cDNAs were prepared in pSELECT vector using the Altered Sites Mutagenesis System (Promega), sequenced, subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described (8Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (H.): 20851-20854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and sequenced again to verify mutation sequences. In one of mutants, a stop codon was introduced immediately after the Gly336 codon to produce the truncated exodomain, Arg1-Gly336. Mutant LH/CG receptor constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Stable cell lines were established in minimum essential medium containing 10% horse serum and 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G-418). Stably transfected cells were assayed for125I-hCG binding in the presence of 150,000 cpm of125I-hCG (9Ji I. Ji T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5465-5469Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and increasing concentrations of cold hCG. hCG, batch CR 127, was supplied by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Nontransfected cells did not show specific binding of hCG. For intracellular cAMP assay, ∼50,000 cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media and incubated in the media containing isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 μg/ml) for 15 min. Increasing concentrations of hCG were then added and the incubation was continued for 45 min at 37 °C. After removing the media, the cells were rinsed once with fresh media without isobutylmethylxanthine, lysed in 70% ethanol, freeze-thawed in liquid nitrogen, and scraped. After pelleting cell debris at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 10 μl of the cAMP assay buffer which was provided by the manufacturer (Amersham). cAMP concentrations were determined with an125I-cAMP assay kit (Amersham) following the manufacturer's instructions and validated for use in our laboratory. All assays were carried out in duplicate and repeated 4–6 times. Means and standard deviations were calculated and analyzed by Student'st test to determine the statistical significance (p 1) of repeats of the same samples. In addition, values for mutants and the exodomain were compared with the corresponding values of the wild type receptor using ANOVA with 95% confidence to determine the statistical significance (p 2) of the differences. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (buffer A). Cells were scraped on ice and collected in buffer A containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 10 mm EDTA) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min. Cells from a 10-cm plate were resuspended in 0.6 ml of buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and the above protease inhibitors (buffer B), incubated on ice for 15 min, and diluted with 5.4 ml of buffer A containing 20% glycerol plus the protease inhibitors (buffer C). The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant (500 μl) was mixed with 150,000 cpm of 125I-hCG and 6.5 μl of 0.9% NaCl and 10 mm Na2HPO4 at pH 7.4 containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled hCG. After incubation at 4 °C for 12 h, the solution was thoroughly mixed with 250 μl of buffer A containing bovine γ-globulin (5 μg/ml) and 750 μl of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8,000. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min, samples were pelleted at 1,300 × gfor 30 min and supernatants removed. Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of buffer A containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8,000, centrifuged, and counted for radioactivity. The truncated exodomain, Arg1-Gly336, was expressed in 293 cells. Since it remains within the cells and is not secreted (4Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ji I. Ji T.H.

The mean Kd value, 571 pm(p 1 < 0.01), of the truncated exodomain in solution was determined from six repeat experiments, each in duplicate. This is different from the Kd value of the wild type receptor solubilized in Nonidet P-40, 943 pm(p 1 < 0.01). To determine whether the difference in the two Kd values was statistically significant, they were examined using ANOVA with 95% confidence. The result indicates that the two Kd values and the difference between them are statistically significant (p 2 < 0.01). Furthermore, the difference could not be attributed to experimental variations due to varying receptor concentrations, since the concentrations of the truncated exodomain and wild type receptor were within the acceptable range (Fig. 1). The results are also consistent with the previous reports by several laboratories (4Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ji I. Ji T.H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2648-2650Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Zhang R. Cai H. Fatima N. Buczko E. Dufau M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21722-21728Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), although the difference was not emphasized and explored at the time. These results, taken together, demonstrate that the hormone binding affinity of the truncated exodomain is slightly and consistently better than that of the wild type receptor. There are two notable differences in the truncated exodomain and the extracellular exodomain of the wild type receptor: the location and structure. The former is present within the cell and lacks the endodomain, whereas the latter is present on the cell surface and covalently linked to the endodomain. One might raise an unlikely possibility that the location of the exodomain prior to the solubilization in Nonidet P-40 solution affected the binding affinity. To test this hypothesis, the Kd values of several LH/CG receptors with various Pro to Phe substitutions (11Hong S. Ryu K.-S. Oh M.-O. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4166-4171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were examined. These mutants are expressed both at the cell surface (extracellular) and in cells (intracellular) but the ratios of the extracellular/intracellular concentrations vary depending on which Pro is mutated (TableI). The Kd ratio of receptors on intact cells and those in Nonidet P-40 solution increases as does the intracellular receptor concentration. This result indicates that the Kd values of intracellular receptors are higher than those of extracellular receptors. Therefore, the binding affinity of intracellular receptors is worse than that of the corresponding extracellular receptors. Furthermore, it indicates that the extracellular or intracellular location of the exodomain alone is not responsible for the different Kd values.Table IComparison of receptors present on the plasma membrane and those trapped in the cellBinding to intact cellsBinding in Nonidet P-40 solutionKdReceptor (×10−3)KdReceptor (×10−3)K d ratio, Receptor in (Nonidet) P-40Receptor ratio, Intracellular R Extracellular RCellCellExtracellular RExtracellular RpmpmP562F775561,307641.670.14P463F563241,192412.110.71P591F648161,498322.311.00 Open table in a new tab Alternatively, the different Kd values of the truncated intracellular exodomain and the extracellular exodomain of the wild type receptor may come from the interaction with the endodomain. For example, the exodomain of the wild type receptor may interact with the endodomain which in turn influences the hormone binding affinity whereas the truncated intracellular exodomain does not have any exodomain to interact with. Such an influence by the endodomain on the exodomain is likely to occur at the extracellular portion of the endodomain, including the three exoloops. To determine such a region(s) and amino acid residues, the 20 amino acids of exoloop 2 were individually substituted with Ala to produce 20 substitution mutants. They are Ser484, Asn485, Tyr486, Met487, Lys488, Val489, Ser490, Ile491, Cys492, Leu493, Pro494, Met495, Asp496, Val497, Glu498, Ser499, Thr500, Leu501, Ser502, and Gln503. The resulting mutants are LH/CG-RS484A, LH/CG-RN485A, LH/CG-RY486A, LH/CG-RM487A, LH/CG-RK488A, LH/CG-RV489A, LH/CG-RS490A, LH/CG-RI491A, LH/CG-RC492A, LH/CG-RL493A, LH/CG-RP494A, LH/CG-RM495A, LH/CG-RD496A, LH/CG-RV497A, LH/CG-RE498A, LH/CG-RS499A, LH/CG-RT500A, LH/CG-RL501A, and LH/CG-RS502A, LH/CG-RQ503A (Figs. 2 and3). For the convenience of data presentation and analysis, exoloop 2 amino acids are divided into two groups, 11 upstream (Fig. 2) and 9 downstream amino acids (Fig. 3).Figure 3Ala scan of downstream residues of exoloop 2. The downstream 9 amino acids of exoloop 2, from Met495 to Gln503, were individually substituted with Ala and the resulting mutant receptors were stably expressed on human 293 cells. They were assayed and the data analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. In addition, a double substitution mutant was generated in which both Asp496 and Glu498 were replaced with Ala.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Among 11 mutant receptors with Ala substitution for the upstream amino acids, 6 were surface-expressed in reasonable receptor concentrations, 12,100–64,800 receptors/cell (Fig. 2).Kd values of these surface-expressed receptors were diverse in the range of 250 to 840 pm. LH/CG-RN485A, LH/CG-RK488A, and LH/CG-RS490A, displayed lower Kd values, indicating that their hormone binding affinities are better than that of the wild type receptor. On the other hand, the Kdvalue of LH/CG-RV489A was 2-fold higher, an indication for a low binding affinity. In contrast to these surface-expressed mutants, hCG binding to the cells transfected with the other 5 mutants was marginal or not detected. For example, hCG bound to LH/CG-RI491A on intact cells with a normal affinity but the receptor concentration was <10% of the concentration of the wild type receptor. 125I-hCG binding to intact cells was hardly detectable for LH/CG-RS484A, LH/CG-RY486A, LH/CG-RC492A, and LH/CG-RP494A. To determine whether any of these mutant receptors were trapped inside the cells or defective in hCG binding, stably transfected cells were solubilized in Nonidet P-40 and assayed for hormone binding. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, all five mutants in the detergent solution bound hCG (p 1 < 0.05) and the receptor concentrations were not significantly different from the concentrations of the wild type receptor (p 1 < 0.05). These results indicate that the five mutant receptors were expressed but not efficiently transported to the cell surface. The Kd value of LH/CG-RS484A was 2-fold lower than that of the wild type receptor, an indication of a 2-fold improved affinity for hCG binding. In contrast to the improved binding affinity, LH/CG-RP494A showed a 2-fold lower affinity as the Kd value was 2-fold higher. The other three mutants in solution showed slightly higher Kdvalues. These results indicate that the Ala substitutions somewhat impacted the hormone binding affinity of the mutant receptors, in addition to impairing their expression on the cell surface. In contrast to the diverse Kd values, EC50 values for cAMP induction by most of surface-expressed mutant receptors except LH/CG-RV489A are 3–5-fold higher than the EC50 value of the wild type receptor (Fig. 2 E). This is a significant reduction in the affinity for cAMP induction and indicates that these Ala substitutions impaired, but did not improve, the affinity for cAMP induction. In contrast to this normal binding with poor cAMP induction, LH/CG-RV489A bound hCG with a 2-fold lower affinity yet induced cAMP normally (p 1 < 0.001). All 9 mutant receptors with Ala substitution for the downstream amino acids were surface-expressed and the receptor concentrations were reasonable, being in the range of 12,200–37,000/cell (Fig. 3). Their affinities for hormone binding were generally similar to that of the wild type receptor. However, the Kd value of LH/CG-RS499A was lower (280 pm) than that of the wild type receptor. This result indicates that the S499A substitution improved the binding affinity as did the S484A, K488A, and S490A substitutions. In contrast to the improved binding affinities, the Kd values of LH/CG-RM495A and LH/CG-RS502A were higher, 840 and 630 pm, respectively. All of the mutants were capable of inducing cAMP and the EC50 values for cAMP induction were either similar to or slightly higher, up to 3-fold, than that of the wild type receptor. The maximum cAMP induction levels were similar to or lower than that produced by the wild type receptor. Surface concentrations of mutant receptors shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were diverse. To determine whether levels of surface receptor concentrations had any effect on hormone binding, cells were transiently transfected with varying concentrations of receptor plasmids and selected for those expressing ∼40,000 receptors/cell (TableII). Cells were assayed for hormone binding to intact cells. The Kd values (Table II) for the wild type receptor LH/CG-RN485A and LH/CG-RM487A, LH/CG-RK489A, and LH/CG-RD496A were similar to the Kdvalues of the same receptors which were expressed at diverse levels (Figs. 2 and 3). These results show that the surface receptor concentration did not impact the hormone binding affinity. To test whether receptor transport to the surface membrane might have had any effect on the hormone binding affinity, cells expressing the receptors were solubilized and assayed for hormone binding to solubilized receptors (Table II). The results show that the %Kd values of receptors were similar to those of receptors expressed on the cell surface, an indication for no significant effect of receptor transport on hormone binding.Table IIEffect of constant receptor concentrationsBinding on cellsBinding in solutionReceptor/cellKdReceptor/cellKdpmpmWild type41,300 ± 5,200380 ± 4045,100 ± 6,200860 ± 90N485A46,700 ± 4,100290 ± 3053,100 ± 6,500670 ± 60M487A38,200 ± 3,700480 ± 5043,200 ± 5,7001,120 ± 150K489A37,900 ± 4,100260 ± 4044,900 ± 4,800600 ± 70D496A42,500 ± 4,600360 ± 3047,600 ± 5,200810 ± 80 Open table in a new tab Ionic amino acids of the LH/CG receptor have been implicated for important roles (8Ji I.

However, the D496A substitution and E498A substitution individually had marginal effects on surface expression, hCG binding, and cAMP induction. Therefore, both Asp496 and Glu498 were substituted with Ala to produce a double substitution mutant, LH/CG-RD496A/E498A. These double substitutions substantially attenuated the surface expression of the mutant and reduced the affinity for cAMP induction. Remarkably, the hormone binding affinity improved by more than 2-fold, underscoring the importance of their potential role to attenuate the high affinity hormone binding of the natural receptor. It is not clear whether these two nearby anionic residues play an important and mutually substitutable role in the hormone binding affinity. Our site-directed mutagenesis requires a synthetic oligonucleotides with a mutant sequence for each mutation and furthermore, does not involve polymerase chain reaction. After mutagenesis, the mutant and flanking sequences are verified by sequencing. In addition, the same sequence is confirmed once more after a mutant cDNA is subcloned into the expression vector. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a mutant cDNA might have undergone an unintended mutation(s) during the mutagenesis and subcloning. To confirm this, mutant cDNAs were reverted to the wild type cDNA which was in turn used to transfect cells. All of the revertants behaved the same as the wild type receptor in surface expression, hormone binding, and cAMP induction (data not included), indicating that there were no mutations other than the intended Ala substitutions. Some Ala substitutions for exoloop 2 amino acids impacted the hormone binding affinity, noticeably enhancing or reducing the binding affinity whereas others did not have a significant effect (Fig. 4). To facilitate the comparison of these diverse effects, percent Kd values for mutants were calculated by dividing their Kd values with that of the wild type receptor (Table III and Fig. 4). Most noticeable were the S484A, K488A, S490A, S499A, and D496A/E498A substitutions. They improved the binding affinity up to 2-fold and these improvements were statistically significant (p 2 < 0.05 to p 2 < 0.001) according to ANOVA analysis. This is specific since the same Ala substitutions mostly attenuated, but never improved, the affinity for cAMP induction and other substitutions did not improve the binding affinity. It is interesting and could be significant that the extent of the improvement in the binding affinity of some of the mutant receptors is in the range of the enhanced binding affinity of the truncated exodomain as compared with the binding affinity of the extracellular exodomain of the wild type receptor. This correlation of the improvement and the extent of the improvement in the binding affinity after truncation of the endodomain and some Ala substitutions suggest that the high affinity hormone binding to the exodomain is influenced and furthermore, attenuated by the endodomain, including exoloop 2, of the wild type receptor. Exoloop 2 may interact with the exodomain or the exodomain-hormone complex to modulate the structure. If so, the exodomain may assume a structure more favorable for hormone binding in some mutants, including LH/CG-RS484A and LH/CG-RD496A/E498A. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that exoloop 2 contacts the hormone (15Couture L. Remy J. Rabesona H. Troalen F. Pajot-Augy E. Bozon V. Haertle T. Bidart J. Salesse R. Eur.

It is not clear whether there is a correlation between the three Ser to Ala substitutions and the improved binding affinities and whether there is a structural relationship of the three residues. If there are, the three Ser residues and possibly some other residues including Lys488(Fig. 4) might be arranged in the exterior of a structure to influence hormone binding and the affinity. To help envision such a structure and to test whether the structure is possible, exoloop 2 was modeled based on the observation that the Kd values of the mutant receptors vary according to their positions (Fig. 4) in putative secondary structures. Exoloop 2 was anchored to the 4th and 5th TMs of bacteriorhodopsin (16Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 259: 393-421Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar). We focused on Ser484, Asn485, Lys488, Ser490, and Ser499 for which Ala substitution improved the binding affinity. One model was developed using the program “O” (17Jones T. Zou J. Cowan S. Kjeldaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) with ideal 310 helix and β-sheet bond angles and lengths, with the most common side chain rotamers chosen for each residue (the upper models in Fig. 5). No energy minimization calculations were performed, as ideal geometry was given to the model from the outset and interactions between secondary structure elements are minimal. Here, Ser484, Lys488, Ser490, and Ser499 are present in the exterior of exoloop 2 and their side chains facing toward the same side. Asn485, however, is anomalous and orients toward the interior of the loop. Particular attention was paid to the fact that Leu493, Asp496, and Ser499 have a periodicity of 3 and the Ala substitution for them retains or slightly decreases the wild type Kd. These residues may mark one side of an α or 310 helix with periodicities of 3.4 and 3.0, respectively. Similarly, S484A, K488A, and S490A substitutions resulted in lower than wild-type Kd values and the residues might mark one side of a β-pleated sheet. However, in this case, there is an anomalous increased Kd by the Y486A substitution and a decrease by the N485A substitution. With these observations, the structure of exoloop 2 has been modeled to give a β-strand over the first seven residues of the loop followed by a short coil region and two turns of 310 helix. The loop has been constructed so that residues Ser484, Lys488, Ser490, Leu493, Asp496, and Ser499 have side chains close to each other. Therefore, all may have similar effects on the interactions of the loop with the local protein environment, but the exact nature of these interactions cannot be predicted with the available data. This simple model ignores the anomalies at Asn485 and Tyr486. Another method was developed for modeling nucleic acid loop structures (18Tung C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 876-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and incorporated the AMBER energy minimization (19Weiner S. Kollman P. Case D. Chandra-Singh U. Ghio C. Algona G. Profeta S.J. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4847) Google Scholar). Crystal structure of the seven-helix bundle from bacteriorhodopsin (16Grigorieff N. Ceska T.A. Downing K.H. Baldwin J.M. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 259: 393-421Crossref Scopus (865) Google Scholar) was used for anchoring the loop. Using a reduced-coordinates approach, random loop structures with the targeted pair of fixed ends were generated. Those loop structures with energies below a threshold were selected and subjected to a short run of energy equilibration using Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation (18Tung C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 876-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and then, 1,000 cycles of energy minimization using AMBER (19Weiner S. Kollman P. Case D. Chandra-Singh U. Ghio C. Algona G. Profeta S.J. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765-784Crossref Scopus (4847) Google Scholar). It produced a structure with Ser484, Asn485, Lys488, Ser490, and Ser499 on one side of the loop surface (the lower models in Fig. 5). Therefore, it is possible that Ser484, Asn485, Lys488, Ser490, and Ser499 are coordinated to position themselves in a specific loop structure and to influence the hormone binding affinity. In contrast to the improved binding affinities of some of the substitutions, the V489A, P494A, and M495A substitutions attenuated the binding affinity by ∼2-fold. Interestingly, these residues are clustered together in the middle of exoloop 2 in both models, suggesting their intriguing role in the binding affinity. The significant attenuation by Ala substitution of the affinity for but not maximal level of cAMP induction indicate that once the mutant receptors were activated, even if poorly, they effectively produced cAMP. Overall, exoloop 2 is more important for the affinity for cAMP induction than for the maximal cAMP induction. This further suggests distinct mechanisms for the affinity and maximal level of cAMP production. These distinct mechanisms are more obvious when percent values for Kd, EC50, and maximal cAMP production as well as their ratios are compared (Table III and Fig. 4). The ratios of percent EC50/percent Kdfor most of the mutants were <1, indicating more severe reductions in the affinities for cAMP induction than the hormone binding affinities. Our data indicate the importance of exoloop 2 for the hormone binding affinity, the affinity for cAMP induction, and the maximal cAMP production. This is probably accomplished by interaction of the exodomain and endodomain, particularly exoloop 2. The roles of exoloop 2 on each of these functions are distinct as are the mechanisms of exoloop 2 to influence them. Some of them appear to be in conflict. As a result, the hormone binding affinity, the affinity for cAMP induction, and the maximal cAMP production seem to be compromised. Ala substitutions both positively and negatively impact the hormone binding affinity and the maximal level of cAMP. However, the affinity for cAMP induction is never augmented by the substitutions. Therefore, the hormone binding affinity and the maximal level of cAMP were compromised to reach the best affinity for cAMP induction. For example, the hormone binding affinity for the exodomain reaches the maximum only when the endodomain is removed and cAMP induction is completely disengaged from the hormone binding. The C492A substitution resulted in the loss of surface expression but not the high affinity hormone binding as found in other substitutions for Cys (20Zhang R. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5755-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It indicates the importance of Cys492 in surface expression but not in hormone binding. Cys residues corresponding to Cys492 of exoloop 2 and Cys416 of exoloop 1 of the LH/CG-R have been implicated to form a disulfide bridge in the other seven TM receptors (21Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). If this is true for the LH/CG receptor, the disulfide may not be essential for hormone binding. Another possibility is that Cys492 of exoloop 2 and Cys416 of exoloop 1 may not form a disulfide or may form disulfides with other Cys residues of the exodomain. It will be of interest to see whether the putative disulfide plays a role in surface expression of the LH/CG receptor, as do disulfides of hCG in hCG processing (22Feng W. Matzuk M.M. Mountjoy K. Bedows E. Ruddon R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11851-11859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Some of the substitutions attenuated or blocked surface expression of the resulting mutants. As a result, most of LH/CG-RS484A, LH/CG-RY486A, LH/CG-RI491A, LH/CG-RC492A, LH/CG-RP494A, and LH/CG-RD496A/LH/CG-RE498A were trapped in the cells. Therefore, these amino acids are crucial for surface expression of the receptor. Our data demonstrate that exoloop 2 of the LH/CG-R distinctly influences the hormone binding affinity, the affinity for cAMP induction, and the maximal cAMP production, probably by the interaction of exoloop 2 with the exodomain and other parts of the endodomain such as TM 6 and TM 7. These distinct ways of influencing the functions are sometimes in conflict and compromised to attain the maximal affinity for cAMP induction. The high affinity hormone binding at the exodomain is constrained by some of the exoloop 2 residues, particularly, Ser484, Asn485, Lys488, Ser490, and Ser499. As a result, the exodomain attains the maximal affinity for hormone binding when the endodomain is truncated and cAMP induction is disengaged."

Six of them are diagnostic of heme-copper oxidases and are thought to bind the following cofactors: the low spin heme B and the binuclear high spin heme B-CuBcenter. The other six are FixN(CcoN)-specific and their function is unknown. To analyze the contribution of these 12 invariant histidines of FixN in cofactor binding and function of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum cbb 3-type oxidase, they were substituted by valine or alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The H131A mutant enzyme had already been reported previously to be defective in oxidase assembly and function (Zufferey, R., Thöny-Meyer, L., and Hennecke, H. (1996) FEBS Lett. 394, 349–352). Four of the remaining histidines were not essential for activity or assembly (positions 226, 246, 333, and 457); by contrast, histidines 331, 410, and 418 were required both for activity and stability of the enzyme. The last group of mutant enzymes, H420A, H280A, H330A, and H316V, were assembled but not functional. To purify the latter mutant proteins and the wild-type enzyme, a six-histidine tag was added to the C terminus of subunit I. The His6-taggedcbb 3-oxidase complexes were purified 20-fold by a three-step purification protocol. With the exception of the H420A mutant oxidase, the mutant enzymes H280A, H316V, and H331A contained normal amounts of copper and heme B, and they displayed similar visible light spectroscopic characteristics like the wild-type His6-tagged enzyme. The His6-tagged H420A mutant oxidase differed from the His6-tagged wild-type protein by showing altered visible light spectroscopic characteristics. No stable mutant oxidase lacking copper or heme B was obtained. This strongly suggests that copper and heme B incorporations in subunit I are prerequisites for assembly of the enzyme.

Terminal cytochrome c oxidases are multimeric membrane protein complexes that catalyze the 2-electron oxidation of cytochromec and the 4-electron reduction of oxygen to water. This process is usually coupled with the extrusion of protons toward the periplasm. Cytochrome c oxidases belong to the so-called superfamily of heme-copper oxidases (for a review, see Ref. 2Garcı́a-Horsman J.A. Barquera B. Rumbley J. Ma J. Gennis R.B. J.

They have in common a low spin heme moiety and a so-called binuclear center composed of a high spin heme and CuB, where the oxygen reduction chemistry occurs. These cofactors are associated with subunit I and are bound by six strictly conserved histidines (3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The fixQ gene product has a molecular mass of 6 kDa and is thought to be inserted in the membrane by its hydrophobic N terminus. This small subunit is neither essential for the function nor for assembly of the enzyme (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is still unknown whether or not this gene product is part of the cbb 3-type oxidase complex. The purified enzyme of B. japonicum as well as that of three non-symbiotic bacteria were identified as three-subunit complexes, and the presence of FixQ in such preparations has never been reported (15Garcı́a-Horsman J.A.

Subunit I of the cbb 3-type oxidase differs from the classical subunit I of terminal oxidases of the heme-copper oxidase family by two notable criteria: (i) it has a lower degree of similarity on the amino acid sequence level (20%, see Ref. 8Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and (ii) it possesses in addition to the six canonical histidines conserved in all subunits I of heme-copper oxidases a further six histidines conserved in all FixN homologues (Fig. 1). The canonical histidines His-131, His-280, His-330, His-331, His-418, and His-420 of the B. japonicum FixN protein correspond to the histidines His-94, His-276, His-325, His-326, His-411, and His-413 of the Paracoccus denitrificans aa 3-type cytochromec oxidase subunit I, which ligate the hemes and CuB cofactors, as shown unequivocally by the crystal structure of the bacterial and mitochondrialaa 3-type cytochrome oxidases (3Iwata S.

Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). All of them are located on the periplasmic face of the membrane. His-276, His-325, and His-326 (using the numbering of P. denitrificanscytochrome aa 3) are involved in complexing CuB. His-411 serves as the high spin heme ligand. The two other histidines, His-94 and His-413, bind the low spin heme. One of the CuB ligands (His-325) was proposed to be implicated in both reduction of oxygen and proton pumping (3Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). The six non-canonical histidines conserved specifically in FixN homologues are also predicted to be located on the borders of the membrane (Fig. 1; Ref. 8Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). His-246, His-333, and His-410 (using the B. japonicum numbering) are proposed to be on the periplasmic side and His-227, His-316, and His-457 on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 1). His-410 corresponds to the histidine that ligates a Mg2+ or Mn2+ metal center in many cytochrome c oxidases but not in quinol oxidases (6Lauraeus M. Haltia T. Saraste M. Wikström M. Eur. J.

In the present work, all of the conserved histidines of B. japonicum FixN were point-mutated to a neutral, smaller amino acid. These mutant variants were analyzed with respect to assembly in the membrane, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with soybean. Among these mutations, only four, H316V (conserved FixN-specific residue), H420A (putative low spin heme B ligand), H280A, and H330A (putative CuB ligands) were found to cause inactive enzymes that were assembled in the membrane. Hexahistidine-tagged derivatives of these enzymes and of the wild-type enzyme were purified to homogeneity in a three-step purification procedure, including anion-exchange and Ni2+ affinity chromatographies and a gel filtration. We determined the copper and heme B contents and performed difference visible light spectroscopy with the purified mutant proteins. All B. japonicum strains used in this work are listed in TableI. B. japonicum strains were grown at 28 °C either aerobically or anaerobically in PSY medium (8Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chromosomal DNA of B. japonicum was isolated according to Hahn and Hennecke (29Hahn M. Hennecke H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 193: 46-52Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). DNA hybridization probes were radioactively labeled using the nick-translation technique (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequence analyses were performed using the chain termination method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl.

All mutagenic primers used in this work are listed in Table I. The following mutations in FixN, H227A, H246V, H330A, and H333V (pRJ4619, pRJ4616, pRJ4564, and pRJ4612, respectively, all pSUP202pol6K derivatives (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H.

The PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing the H227A mutation was cloned as a 0.6-kbSacII-XmnI fragment, and the H246V mutation was created as a 0.42-kb PvuI-SphI fragment of fixN to replace the corresponding wild-type gene region. The 0.24-kb AvaII-SphI PCR-amplified fragments containing the H330A or the H333V mutations were ligated into the same sites of fixN. All other mutations in fixN were obtained by a two-step PCR as described by Landt et al. (31Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). H280A, H316V, H331A, H410A, and H457A mutations (pRJ4565, pRJ4558, pRJ4563, pRJ4534, and pRJ4573, respectively, all pSUP202pol6K derivatives, see below) were introduced in a 1.1-kbSacII-SphI fragment, whereas H410A and H457A were brought in a 0.36-kb SphI-NsiI fragment. In the case of H418V (pRJ4533, pSUP202pol6K derivative, see below), the phosphorothiolate-based site-directed mutagenesis for single strand vectors (32Sayers J. Eckstein F. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 49-70Google Scholar) was applied with pRJ4521 (0.36-kbSphI-NsiI fragment of fixN in M13BM21) as a template. The corresponding point-mutated DNA fragment was cloned as a 0.36-kb SphI-NsiI fragment. The insertion of six histidine codons (CAC) before the stop codon at the 3′ terminus of fixN was achieved by a two-step PCR as described by Landt et al. (31Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) with pRJ4504 and pRJ4569 (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol.

The amplified (CAC)6 insertion-containing fragment was cloned as a 0.6-kb NsiI-EcoRV fragment (3′-part of fixN′, 5′-part of fixO′) replacing the corresponding wild-type DNA region. The pSUP202pol6K (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol.

The (CAC)6 insertion was also introduced at the end of the genes with the histidine mutations H280A, H330A, H316V, and H420A by exchanging the wild-type 2.0-kb NsiI-XbaI fragment of pRJ4565, pRJ4564, pRJ4558, and pRJ4572 (see below) with the corresponding fragment containing the (CAC)6 insertion just before the stop codon of fixN, leading to pRJ4623, pRJ4622, pRJ4624, and pRJ4625, respectively. All mutations were verified by sequencing. The plasmids pRJ4533, pRJ4534, pRJ4558, pRJ4563, pRJ4564, pRJ4565, pRJ4572, pRJ4573, pRJ4612, pRJ4616, pRJ4619, pRJ4621, pRJ4622, pRJ4623, pRJ4624, and pRJ4625 carried the 4.7-kb fragment carrying ′orf277, orf141, and the fixNOQP operon in the integration plasmid pSUP202pol6K similarly as pRJ4504 (17Zufferey R.

The correct cointegrates were verified by Southern blot hybridization. Membrane fractions of anaerobically grown 10-liter batch cultures were isolated as described previously (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the membranes were solubilized (45 min, 4 °C) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% dodecyl maltoside (Sigma) at a protein concentration of approximately 3 mg/ml. The ultracentrifugation step was then repeated. The solubilized membrane fraction (supernatant) was loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Sweden) that had been equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside). All the purification steps were done at room temperature at a free flow of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer A. Then the cbb 3-oxidase was eluted with 3 volumes of buffer A in which the NaCl concentration was 250 mm. To this fraction was added 5 mm imidazole before loading it on a Ni2+ affinity column (His Bond Resin, Novagen) that had been prepared as described by the manufacturer and equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl, 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, and 5 mm imidazole). After loading, the column was washed with 3 bed volumes of buffer B. Then, the contaminants were removed with 3 bed volumes of buffer B containing 20 mm imidazole, and finally the cytochrome coxidase was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer B. The fractions containing the cbb 3-type oxidase were desalted and buffer-exchanged by passing them through a prepacked Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (PD-10 of Pharmacia, Sweden) following the instructions of the manufacturer, using 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.01% dodecyl maltoside. The purified enzyme was concentrated to 2–5 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. The cbb 3-oxidase was deprived of metal contaminants by incubating it with 5% (w/v) Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at 4 °C. This treatment did not alter the activity of the enzyme. After a short centrifugation the supernatant containing the enzyme was stored at 4 °C without any loss of activity for at least 1 month. Tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) oxidase activity, cytochrome c oxidase activity with reduced horse heart cytochrome c as the electron donor, and symbiotic nitrogen fixation activity were measured as described before (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or Schägger and von Jagow (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Western blot analyses with antibodies against FixN, FixO, FixP, and CycM were performed as described previously (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol.

Antiserum directed against a FixQ peptide (C terminus of FixQ from position 38 to 54: RNKAAFDEAAHLPLREE) was purchased from TANA Laboratories LC (Houston, TX). For immunodetection of FixQ, protein was loaded on a 12% Schägger and von Jagow gel and electroblotted (40 min for 1-mm thick gel) onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) that was underlaid by a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham, UK). Detection of FixQ was then possible with the nitrocellulose membrane. Visible light spectroscopy of purified enzymes was performed as described by Zufferey et al. (17Zufferey R. Preisig O. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Heme B extraction and the pyridine hemochrome assay were performed as described by Berry and Trumpower (36Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). The copper content of the Chelex 100-treated, purified cytochrome c oxidase was determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer, model 5000). All conserved histidines of B. japonicum FixN were changed by site-directed mutagenesis to a smaller neutral amino acid to minimize possible structural effects on the protein. His-131 had already been proposed to be the N-terminal low spin heme B ligand based on sequence homology and mutant phenotype (1Zufferey R. Thöny-Meyer L. Hennecke H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). His-316, His-246, His-333, and His-418 were changed to valine, whereas His-227, His-280, His-330, His-331, His-410, His-418, His-420, and His-457 were substituted by alanine. All plasmids containing the respective mutations were cointegrated into the chromosome of the ΔfixNOQP mutant, strain Bj4503 (14Preisig O. Zufferey R. Thöny-Meyer L. Appleby C.A. Hennecke H. J.

We performed the TMPD oxidation test with whole cells that had been grown under anaerobic conditions, because this terminal oxidase is expressed under such conditions (8Preisig O. Anthamatten D. Hennecke H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In this assay, TMPD is used as the artificial electron donor. The cbb 3-type oxidase contributes to at least 50–60% of the total cellular TMPD oxidase activity under such conditions because the ΔfixN deletion mutant Bj4526 showed about 40% residual activity as compared with the positive control strain Bj4504 (fixNOQP +, TableII). This relatively high residual activity is caused by alternativ"
https://openalex.org/W2036259493,"We have observed that cyclin D3-dependent kinase activity is increased in the late G1 phase in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts. The profile of cyclin D3-associated activity closely parallels that of cyclin D1, which is also induced after mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells. These activities correlate with the appearance of hyperphosphorylated p130, an Rb family member important in regulating E2F-4 and E2F-5 activity in fibroblastic cells. We demonstrated, however, that only the cyclin D3 activity efficiently phosphorylated p130 in an in vitro kinase assay. This apparent specificity was further demonstrated by experiments which demonstrated that cyclin D3 was physically associated with p130 at the times when D3-dependent kinase activity and p130 hyperphosphorylation were observed. Examination of E2F by electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that E2F-4 DNA binding activity existed in a p130·E2F complex at times before D3-dependent kinase activity was apparent and in a free E2F-4 complex after D3 activity developed. Thus, our data suggest that cyclin D3 preferentially phosphorylates p130 and is thereby specifically targeted to overcoming growth-suppressive control mediated through p130 pathways.

In Daudi Burkitts lymphoma cells, treatment with α-interferon results in a G0-like arrest accompanied by a loss of cyclin D3 and Cdc25A (12Tiefenbrun N. Melamed D. Levy N. Resnitzky D. Hoffman I. Reed S.I. Kimchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3934-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, cyclin D3 has also been shown to play a key role in controlling proliferation in 32D myeloid precursor cells, which self-renew when cultured in IL-3 and undergo growth arrest and terminally differentiate to granulocytes in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Growth of 32D precursor cells in IL-3 is accompanied by expression of cyclin D2 and cyclin D3, and enforced expression of either cyclin shortened G1 and blocked the ability to differentiate in colony-stimulating factor (11Ando K.

Studies on the role of cyclin D3 in other cell types has implicated this protein in a variety of decisions concerning cell fate, including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation (14Hauser P.J.

It is clear that cyclin D3 plays an important role in proliferation in multiple cell types, but specific roles have not been clearly established. The E2F transcription factor plays an important role in cell growth control by linking the activities of the cell cycle machinery with the transcriptional regulation of genes whose products are required for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle (19Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that this link is achieved through interactions of E2F with members of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) family (20Chellapan S. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1052-1061Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 21Cao L. Faha B. Dembski M. Tsai L.H. Harlow E. Dyson N.

The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (pRb) is a nuclear phosphoprotein that has been shown to serve as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression through G1-S transition (23Reed S.I. Wittenberg C. Lew D.J. Dulic V. Henze M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 61-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nevins J.R. Chellapan S.P. Mudryj M. Hiebert S. Devoto S. Horowitz J.

Sci. 1992; 17: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In quiescent cells, pRb forms complexes with E2F, thus inhibiting the E2F capacity to activate transcription and potentially converting E2F into a dominant transcription inhibitor (26Bremner R. Cohen B.L. Sopta M. Hamel P.A. Ingles C.J. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). G1 growth arrest by pRb is dependent on the sequences necessary for its physical interaction with the E2F family of transcription factors (20Chellapan S. Hiebert S. Mudryj M. Horowitz J. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1052-1061Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 27Hiebert S. Chellapan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Binding to these proteins requires the “pocket region” of pRb, which is shared by the two other members of the Rb family, p107 and p130. p130 has been shown to bind cyclin A, E, D1, D2, and D3 in vitro and to inhibit cell growth when overexpressed (28Ewen M.E. Xing Y.G. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 29Li Y. Graham C. Lacy S.M. Duncan A. Whyte P.

Grana X. Baldi A. Sang N. Hu Q. Giordano A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2561-2566PubMed Google Scholar). pRb, p107, and p130 each bind to members of the E2F family at defined but different stages of the cell cycle. pRb binds E2F 1–3, whereas p107 and p130 have preferential affinity for both E2F-4 and E2F-5 (32Sardet C. Videal M. Cobrinik D. Geng Y. Onufryk C. Chen A. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 93: 2403-2407Crossref Scopus (302) Google Scholar). E2F-4 is the most abundant E2F family member and is clearly present at high levels even in quiescent and differentiated cells (33Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), 1R. F. Kassatly and W. D. Cress, manuscript in preparation. suggesting it may be the E2F family member most relevant in growth arrest. In arrested cells, the predominant E2F species, E2F-4, appears to be complexed with hypophosphorylated p130 (22Cobrinik D. Whyte P. Peeper D.S. Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2392-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 35Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3975-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). E2F-4 associates with other Rb family members; however, pRb and p107 do not associate with E2F-4 until the cells reach the G1-to-S transition (36Schwartz J.K. Devoto S.H. Smith E.J. Chellapan S.P. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The decay of the E2F-4·p130 complex requires the action of G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity (37Smith E.J. Leone G. Degregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6965-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The presence of E2F-4·p130 complex correlates with E2F-1 gene repression, and the overexpression of p130 inhibits transcription from the E2F-1 promoter. A D-type cyclin-dependent kinase activity specifically activates the E2F-1 promoter by relieving E2F-mediated repression, suggesting that D-type cyclin-associated kinases may control cell growth through phosphorylating p130 (38Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of several Rb family members, multiple E2F transcription factors, and the preferential binding patterns that have been observed among these proteins suggests that each Rb family member protein may have a specific function(s) in each E2F pathway. Similarly, it can be noted that several D-type cyclins also exist, each capable of forming active complexes with Cdk4 and Cdk6, although specific phosphorylation of specific Rb family members has not been reported. The analysis of recombinant mice deficient for cyclin D1 or cyclin D2 revealed that the loss of either genes did not compromise viability, although cyclin D1−/− offspring were significantly smaller than littermates containing a wild type allele (39Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), and cyclin D2−/− exhibited reduced proliferation in ovarian and testicular tissue (40Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Geng Y. Parker S.B. Gardner H. Park M.Y. Robker R.L. Richards J.S. McGinnis L.K. Biggers J.D. Eppig J.J. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), indicating that the functions of these cyclins may be redundant. In an analogous fashion, loss of up to two of the three G1 cyclins (CLN) 2The abbreviations used are: CLN, G1cyclins; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CS, calf serum. in yeast does not produce a loss of viability but does severely reduce growth rate. Loss of all three CLN genes, however, results in a loss of viability due to an inability to pass START (41Richardson H.E. Wittenberg C. Cross F. Reed S.I. Cell. 1989; 59: 1127-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A recent study, which has analyzed a number of CLN alleles in more detail, revealed that there are specific functions associated with individual CLN genes, and the growth defects are the result of overlapping functions (42Levine K. Huang K. Cross F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6794-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have examined whether there are specific functions associated with cyclin D3 in BALB/c 3T3 cells during G1 traverse. We have addressed the possibility that cyclin D3 may function preferentially to relieve growth-suppressive function of a specific Rb family member. Our data reveal that cyclin D3-associated kinase activity is observed during mid-late G1 at a time when p130 is hyperphosphorylated. We have compared cyclin D1- and cyclin D3-mediated p130 phosphorylation in vitro and found that p130 is utilized as a substrate more effectively by cyclin D3 complexes. In addition, our data reveals that cyclin D3 associates with p130 in vivo when p130 becomes hyperphosphorylated. These results suggest that cyclin D3/Cdk4 is responsible for the phosphorylation of p130in vivo, leading to the hypothesis that cyclin D3 may regulate cell cycle progression by antagonizing growth suppressive functions of p130.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6314-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GST-p130 (p130 amino acids 322–1139) was constructed by cleaving pBS-(s)F-130 (a kind gift from David Johnson, University of Texas) with XbaI, filling in with Klenow, purifying the resulting 2516-base pair fragment, and ligating the fragment into SmaI-digested, alkaline phosphatase-treated pGEX3X (Amrad Corp.).

Mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts (clone A31) were maintained in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air) at 37°C. Experimental cultures were grown to confluence in 100-mm Petri dishes using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS), 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were stimulated 2–3 days after density arrest with DMEM containing 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB and 10% CS. For analysis of cell cycle distribution, monolayer cells were trypsinized, fixed in ethanol, and suspended in a 1-ml solution containing 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of RNase A. The stained cells were analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and the distribution of cells at each stage of the cycle was determined. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (45Agrawal D.K. Dong F. Wang Y.Z. Kayda D. Pledger W.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1199-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and collected by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), vortexed vigorously, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred into fresh tubes and then stored at −70 °C. Specific antisera were added to 40 μg of total protein from cell extracts in a volume of 250 μl of lysis buffer, and the mixture was rocked for 2–10 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 30 μl of 25% protein A-agarose beads and an additional 30 min of mixing. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with lysis buffer, once with 2× kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol), resuspended in 8 μl of 1× kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm cold ATP, and 1 μg of GST-Rb, GST-p130, or a mixture of GST-Rb, GST-p107, and GST-p130. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min, and 10 μl of 2× loading buffer was added. The mixture was then heated to 95 °C for 5 min and separated on an 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylated protein was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by exposure on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 40 μg of total proteins from cell extracts. Specific antisera were incubated with protein A-agarose beads in 250 μl of the lysis buffer described above at 4 °C for 60 min while shaking. The antibody-linked beads were washed once with lysis buffer, followed by the addition of cell extract. Immune complexes were allowed to form by incubating this mixture for 60 min at 4 °C. For immunoblot analysis, complexes bound to protein A-agarose were washed twice with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting was performed by using immunoprecipitated proteins or 40 μg of proteins from cell extracts. Proteins were separated on 6 or 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h followed by a 1-h incubation with a secondary antibody. The bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. E2F DNA binding assays were done as described (46Ikeda M.-A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The assays used a 32P-end-labeled HaeIII-HindIII fragment, which spanned the region from −103 to −23 relative to the dihydrofolate reductase promoter region, isolated from the dihydrofolate reductase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid (47Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol/bovine serum albumin at 30 μg/500 ng of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/0.1 ng of 32P-end-labeled probe, following by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 75:1) in TBE (50 mm Tris-borate, 1 mm EGTA) containing 5% glycerol. Supershift assays were performed in an identical manner except that the cell extracts were preincubated with antibodies against E2F-1 (sc-251), E2F-2 (sc-632), E2F-3 (sc-879), E2F-4 (2–12E8, a kind gift of J. Lees, MIT), Rb (sc-102), p107 (sc-250), or p130 (Transduction Laboratories) for 30 min before the addition of 32P-end-labeled probe. Mitogenic stimulation of density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cultures with medium containing 10% calf serum and 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB-induced G1 traverse in approximately 90% of the population, with initiation of DNA replication beginning at 12 h (Fig. 1). The majority of cells that had undergone cell cycle traverse reentered G0/G1phase between 24 and 30 h after stimulation and did not undergo further growth, as indicated by the persistence of a G0/G1 population between 30 and 48 h after stimulation. Our results demonstrated that under these conditions most of the cells were stimulated to progress through a single round of replication and reenter a quiescent state within 30 h. Using this cell cycle model, we determined whether the level of cyclin D3-dependent kinase activity varied in a periodic manner during the growth cycle. We prepared extracts from cultures of quiescent, density-arrested BALB/c 3T3 cells stimulated for various times as described in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 2 A, cyclin D3-associated kinase activity, measured by the ability of immunoprecipitated cyclin D3 to phosphorylate GST-Rb fusion protein, clearly fluctuated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The kinase activity was low in quiescent cells (hour 0) and remained low during early G1 (hours 3–6). Increased activity was first apparent by 9 h after stimulation, reached a maximum by 18 h, and declined thereafter. Cells that had completed the cell cycle and reentered quiescence (hour 27) contained activity equivalent to that seen in quiescent cells before stimulation.Figure 2The kinetics of cyclin D3- and D1-dependent kinase activities and p130 proteins during the cell cycle. Density-arrested BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts were mitogenically stimulated with DMEM supplemented with 10 ng/ml PDGF and 10% CS. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, cell extracts were prepared, and protein amounts were determined using the Bradford assay. Whole cell extracts containing 40 μg of total proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with cyclin D3 (A) or D1 antibodies (B). The kinase activities in the immunoprecipitates were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures” using GST-Rb fusion protein as a substrate. For p130 Western blot analysis, 40 μg of total proteins from the same extracts used in the above kinase assays was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was probed with p130 antibody, and p130 was detected as described under “Experimental Procedures” (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The timing of the appearance of cyclin D3 activity indicated that it was activated in mid to late G1, a timing that is similar to that observed for cyclin D1 as shown in Fig. 2 B. Therefore, the kinetics of cell cycle-dependent regulation of the kinase activities of both cyclin D1- and D3-dependent kinases are similar in mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts. In addition to cyclin D1 and D3, we also examined cyclin D2-dependent kinase activity. Cyclin D2-associated kinase activity, however, was undetectable in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts in similar conditions (data not shown). p107 and p130 are two additional Rb family members that have been identified as substrates for cyclin-dependent kinase activity (48Gibbs E. Pan Z.Q. Niu H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22847-22854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 49Herzinger T. Wolf D.A. Eick D. Kind P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2079-2084PubMed Google Scholar). p130 binds to members of the E2F family of transcription factors, resulting in the formation of a complex that is transcriptionally inert or may function as a transcription repressor. As cells traverse G0/G1, p130 becomes phosphorylated and releases free, transcriptionally active E2F-4 (50Vairo G. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 869-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We determined if phosphorylation of p130 varied after quiescent BALB/c 3T3 cells were stimulated with medium supplemented with calf serum and PDGF. Changes in the phosphorylation state of p130 can be detected by alterations in the electrophoretic mobility, and as shown in Fig. 2 C, quiescent 3T3 cells contained two distinct isoforms of p130, termed 1 and 2, that persisted through the first 6 h after stimulation. By 9 h, a distinct form, isoform 3, with a reduced electrophoretic mobility was observed. The type 3 isoform persisted until 18 h after stimulation, following which the total cellular level of p130 fell to undetectable levels. Thus, the state of p130 phosphorylation changed in a manner that correlated with the appearance of cyclin D1- and D3-associated kinase activity. To provide a direct comparison between the degree of p130 phosphorylation and alterations in E2F DNA binding activity, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with a32P-end-labeled DNA fragment derived from the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is specific for E2F binding (46Ikeda M.-A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 47Blake M.C. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4994-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) using extracts made from BALB/c 3T3 cells after various times of stimulation. Our results demonstrated that DNA binding complexes containing both E2F and p130 were present in quiescent cells and in cells after mitogenic stimulation for 6 h (Fig. 3 A). By 9 h, the abundance of E2F complexes containing p130 dramatically decreased, demonstrating that p130 phosphorylation results in a release of E2F. To confirm that the major E2F partner in quiescent cells was the p130 seen in Fig. 3 A, a quiescent cell extract was analyzed by gel mobility shift assay with antibody addition. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the majority of E2F DNA binding activity consisted of a single species in a quiescent cell extract. This species could be supershifted by a p130 antibody but not by Rb or p107 antibodies. Furthermore, it could also be supershifted by antibodies against E2F-4 but not E2F-1, -2, or -3. Taken together, these data demonstrate that this species represented the activity of a p130·E2F-4 complex. The E2F DNA binding activity present in a stimulated cell extract, shown in Fig. 3 C, demonstrated that E2F-4 was present both as a free species and in a complex with p107. These data strongly suggest that p130 serves as a major partner of E2F-4 in quiescent cells and that the phosphorylation of p130 may release a substantial amount of E2F activity during the G1/S phase transition. Because in vivo phosphorylation of p130 occurred at a time during which both cyclin D1- and D3-dependent kinase activity was induced, we determined the ability of each of these cyclins from extracts of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts to phosphorylate p130. As shown in Fig. 4, cyclin D3 immune complexes efficiently phosphorylated exogenous GST-p130 in vitro, exhibiting induction of activity identical to that obtained with a GST-pRb substrate. In contrast, GST-p130 was a very poor substrate for cyclin D1 immune complexes, despite the fact that both types of complexes are able to phosphorylate pRb efficiently in vitro. We note that cyclin D1 complexes were able to phosphorylate p130 in vitro as determined after longer exposure of the gel shown in Fig. 4 (data not shown). The level of activity, however, was less than 5% that obtained with cyclin D3 complexes. To further determine the relative substrate preference of phosphorylation of the members of Rb family protein by D-type cyclin-dependent kinases, active cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 complexes were utilized in an in vitro kinase assay using a mixture of 1 μg each of GST-Rb, GST-p107, and GST-p130 as substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the ability of cyclin D3-dependent kinase to phosphorylate GST-p107 was equal to that of cyclin D1-dependent kinase, and a comparable level of phosphorylation activity was also observed for a GST-pRb substrate. There was, however, a distinct difference in their ability to efficiently utilize GST-p130, in agreement with the results obtained in the single substrate reactions shown above. To demonstrate that the absence of p130 phosphorylation activity in cyclin D1 complexes was not a property specific for the antibody we utilized, we also measured the activity of cyclin D1 immune complexes prepared with three different cyclin D1 antibodies. Data in Fig. 4 C show that the cyclin D3 immune complex phosphorylated p107 (lane 1) and p130 (lane 5) with similar efficiency. The cyclin D1 immune complexes did not phosphorylate p130 (lane 6–8) yet transferred phosphate to p107 (lane 2–4) as effectively as the cyclin D3 immune complex (lane 1), irrespective of the antibody utilized for immunoprecipitation. It has been shown that cyclin D3 forms complexes with p130 in vitro (30Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Our data suggested that cyclin D3-dependent kinase phosphorylated p130 in vivo, implying that an association of p130 and cyclin D3 would be detectable during specific intervals of the cell cycle. We tested this hypothesis by examining p130 immune complexes derived from cells at various stages of the cell cycle for the presence of cyclin D3 protein. From the data presented in Fig. 5 it is evident that cyclin D3 was associated with p130 in a periodic fashion. It became detectable 6 h after mitogenic stimulation, reached a maximum at approximately 9–12 h, and gradually dissociated over the next 6 h, corresponding to both the induction of cyclin D3 kinase activity and the hyperphosphorylation of p130 protein observed in vivo. By 21 h after stimulation, the association was barely detectable, most likely reflecting the low levels of p130 protein present at these times. We were unable to detect the association of cyclin D1 with p130 at these same times (data not shown). Thus, we could not find evidence of association between cyclin D1 and p130 in vivo. To directly test whether the differential phosphorylation of p130·E2F4 by cyclin D1 or cyclin D3 complexes could be demonstrated to result in a functional consequence, we determined whether treatment with either kinase complex affected the ability of p130 to associate with E2F-4. Fig. 5 B clearly reveals that E2F-4 can be detected in p130 immune complexes isolated in an extract prepared from quiescent cells (lane 1). Treatment with an agarose bead linked with cyclin D1 kinase complex did not substantially alter the amount of E2F-4 from p130 immune complexes (lane 2). Treatment of this cell extract with an agarose bead-linked cyclin D3 kinase complex resulted in almost complete loss of E2F-4 from the subsequently isolated p130 immune complexes (lane 3), thus supporting the hypothesis that cyclin D3 activity is directed toward the repression of E2F-4 by p130. We have investigated the role of cyclin D3 in the regulation of cell cycle traverse in BALB/c 3T3 cells and found that this cyclin specifically phosphorylates the Rb family member, p130. Cyclin D3-associated kinase activity was undetectable in quiescent cells, however, and only became apparent after mitogenic stimulation during mid-G1. Although both cyclin D1- and cyclin D3-mediated activity exhibited a similar pattern of induction based on in vitro kinase assays utilizing a pRb substrate, only cyclin D3-associated kinase activity, derived from cyclin D3/CDK4 complex, efficiently phosphorylated p130 during the same interval. The ability of D-type cyclin-dependent kinase activity to phosphorylate Rb family members has been well documented; however, specificities between particular D-type cyclins and members of the Rb family have not been well characterized. Since we observed both cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 activity over the same interval, this system presented a unique opportunity to address this question. Our data support the hypothesis that the cyclin D3 complex is the major kinase that is specifically targeted to p130 growth-suppressive control. This idea is sustained by both in vitro and in vivo data. In vitro kinase assays clearly revealed that p130 is utilized as a substrate by cyclin D3 complexes more efficiently than cyclin D1 complexes, resulting in greater than 20-fold differences in phosphorylated product (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, kinase reactions utilizing p107 as a substrate revealed more similar levels of catalytic activity (Fig. 4 B). Data in Fig. 4 C demonstrate that the lack of p130 phosphorylation by cyclin D1 immune complexes was not due to one specific antibody interaction with the cyclin D1·Cdk4 complex. The specificity of D-cyclin complexes toward a p107 substrate was not studied further, since it complexes with E2F only after G1 phase (Fig. 3 C). Although differences in the catalytic efficiency were observed with respect to p130 phosphorylation, the apparent kinetics of the appearance of D-cyclin activity during cell cycle traverse remained comparable, with activity appearing between 9 and 12 h. In vivo, analysis of p130 immune complexes revealed that cyclin D3 protein was present (Fig. 5), whereas cyclin D1 could not be found in p130 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Furthermore, the association of cyclin D3 with p130 displayed kinetics identical to that observed for cyclin D3 activity in vitro and hyperphosphorylation of p130 in vivo (Figs. 2 and 5). Our data suggest that cyclin D3-dependent kinase is responsible for p130 phosphorylation in BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts. Our analysis of p130 protein in these murine fibroblasts during cell cycle traverse revealed a pattern similar to that previously reported for human glioblastoma T98G cells, with three distinct phosphorylated forms that could be distinguished by differences in electrophoretic mobility (51Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar). Only the two faster migrating forms were found during G0 and early G1. The slowest migrating form appeared in the interval between 6 and 9 h and increased such that by 15 h it comprised nearly all the p130 that was detectable. This abrupt transition was shown to occur concomitantly with the activation of D-type cyclin-dependent kinases. The specificity of p107/p130 to bind to a subset of E2F family members that is distinct from that observed with pRb, coupled to the fact that p130·E2F complexes are observed during G0 and early G1 whereas p107·E2F complexes are observed during entry into and traverse of S phase suggest that each Rb family contributes a unique regulatory function to cell cycle control. Similarly, multiple D-type cyclins have been demonstrated to bind and activate Cdk4/6 to provide a G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity that may phosphorylate and thereby relieve Rb- and p130-mediated growth suppression separately (38Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar); our data suggest that different D-type cyclins may preferentially phosphorylate specific Rb family membersin vivo. The phenotypes of cyclin D1−/− and cyclin D2−/− mice suggest that this specificity of D-cyclins for Rb family members may be partially overlapping and that the absence of a particular D-cyclin may be compensated by those remaining (39Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Gardner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 40Sicinski P.

Nature. 1996; 384: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that a similar redundancy has also been found for p107- and p130-deficient mice (34Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Hannon G. Mulligan G. Bronson R.T. Dyson N. Harlow E. Beach D. Weinberg R.A. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1633-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), suggesting partial redundancy may exist at multiple levels in components of the D-cyclin/Rb regulatory network. A comparison of the p130 phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 2 C) with the E2F DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 A) during the cell cycle indicated that the interval (between 6–9 h) in which the majority of the p130 is converted to a hyperphosphorylated form coincides to the loss of a detectable p130·E2F complex, suggesting that, like Rb, p130 dissociates from E2F after it is phosphorylated, a finding in accordance with previous analysis of REF52 cells (38Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1685-1692PubMed Google Scholar). The role of cyclin D3·Cdk4 complex in the regulation of p130·E2F activity is strengthened by our observation that the cyclin D3·Cdk4 activity causes the complete disruption of the p130·E2F-4 complex as determined with an in vitro assay (Fig. 5 B). The relatively short duration of the interval in which p130·E2F activity is lost suggests that p130 inactivation may occur as a result of a burst of p130-directed kinase activity at a discrete point in G1. Somewhat surprisingly, we did not observe proportional changes in p130·E2F and free E2F-4 activity. Rather, there was a loss of p130·E2F (between 6 and 9 h) followed by a delayed appearance of free E2F-4 and p107·E2F activity (between 9 and 12 h). It is unlikely that this pattern is the result of a change in E2F protein levels, since the level of E2F-4 remains constant in Balb/c 3T3 cells throughout the cell cycle. 3W. D. Cress, manuscript in preparation. Given the results that have demonstrated a repressor function for the p130·E2F complex, this observation may indicate the requirement for an additional step(s) between loss of repressor function and the appearance of transactivation function.

We have investigated several parameters characteristic of the interaction of Rad51p with ssDNA and dsDNA, particularly the effects of the nucleotide cofactors ATP and ADP and the analogs adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) and adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). Rad51p binding to both 1-N 6-ethenoadenosine and 3-N 4-ethenocytidine ssDNA (εDNA) and dsDNA requires the presence of Mg2+ and ATP; no binding occurs in the presence of ADP, AMP-PNP, or ATPγS.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD51 gene is a member of the RAD52 epistasis group, that is required for efficient DNA double strand break repair and genetic recombination (1Petes T.D. Malone R.E.

The reaction promoted by Rad51p also requires Mg2+, ATP, and a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, yeast replication protein A, being the most efficient (6Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 8Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, Rad51p-promoted strand exchange has certain striking differences compared with RecA. For example, RecA has the unique ability to pair homologous ssDNA and dsDNA to form three-stranded joint molecules, which are then resolved into heteroduplex DNA; this pairing can occur even between DNAs without ends (9Cox M.M. Soltis D.A. Livneh Z. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2577-2585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cunningham R.P. Wu A.M. Shibata T. DasGupta C. Radding C.M.

Cell. 1980; 22: 437-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the reaction promoted by Rad51p, joint molecules are formed only between ssDNA and linear dsDNA having either 3′- or 5′-overhanging complementary ends; joint molecules are not formed with linear DNA having blunt or recessed complementary ends (8Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As a consequence of being able to use either a 3′- or 5′-overhanging complementary strand to initiate joint molecule formation, the direction of strand exchange depends on which end initiates the reaction (8Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The interactions of RecA with ssDNA and dsDNA are important determinants for strand exchange (12Kowalczykowski S.C. Burk D.L. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 719-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of Rad51p-promoted strand exchange, we have examined the interactions between Rad51p and single- and double-stranded DNA, particularly the role of nucleotides and salt in these interactions. Rad51p binding to ssDNA was followed by measuring the increased fluorescence of chemically modified 1-N 6-ethenoadenosine and 3-N 4-ethenocytidine ssDNA (etheno-DNA, εDNA) that accompanies protein binding (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 15Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar); binding to dsDNA was followed by protection of the DNA against DNase I degradation (14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, in some cases, by nitrocellulose filter binding (16McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8835-8844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that ATP and Mg2+ are essential for Rad51p binding to both kinds of DNA and that ADP, adenosine 5′-O-thiotriphosphate (ATPγS), and adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) do not satisfy this requirement. The ATP analog ATPγS, which is unable to promote Rad51p binding to DNA, nevertheless causes dissociation of the Rad51p·εDNA complex. The results of dissociation of the Rad51p·εDNA complex at different temperatures indicate that ATP binding, not ATP hydrolysis, is required for Rad51p binding to DNA. Yeast Rad51p was expressed in and purified from insect cells as described previously (8Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The concentration of Rad51p was determined using an extinction coefficient (determined from amino acid composition) of 1.26 × 104 at 280 nm. Unless otherwise noted, the standard reaction buffer used in all experiments contained 40 mmK-Mes (pH 6.5), 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. In experiments testing pH dependence, K-Mes was replaced by 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 or 8.5). ATP and ADP were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and ATPγS and AMP-PNP were from Boehringer Mannheim. All reactions were carried out at 30 and 37 °C. The concentrations of the DNA substrates are expressed as nucleotide equivalents. Etheno-M13 DNA (εDNA) was prepared as described (17Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 7000 m−1cm−1 (18Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2085-2092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uniform 3H-labeled pBluescript SK+ DNA was prepared with SssI methylase and S-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-l-methionine. Linear DNA was prepared by digestion of 3H-labeled pBluescript SK(+) dsDNA with PstI restriction endonuclease. The binding of Rad51p to ssDNA was monitored by measuring the change in fluorescence of εDNA at 410 nm following excitation at 305 nm using an AMINCO-Bowman luminescence spectrometer. Sample volumes were normally 0.6 ml, and additions did not exceed 40 μl. The titrant was either Rad51p in “forward” titrations or concentrated sodium chloride solution in the “salt-back” titration. When ATP, ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP were included in the titrations, their concentrations were 100 μm each. Following the addition of each titrant, the fluorescence was measured until the value reached a stable plateau. In experiments measuring the stability of the Rad51p·εDNA complex, the complex was formed in the presence of 100 μm ATP, and the change in fluorescence was monitored after the addition of 1000 μm ADP, ATPγS, or AMP-PNP. Measurements were performed at a constant temperature, maintained by a circulating water bath. Corrections for fluorescence of the protein were made from the values obtained after adding Rad51p in the absence of εDNA. The fluorescence values observed in these control titrations were subtracted from the measured values made in the presence of εDNA. 3H-Labeled linear dsDNA (10 μm) and variable amounts of Rad51p were incubated in the standard reaction buffer containing 0.5 mmATP, ADP, ATPγS, or AMP-PNP at 30 °C for 10 min. Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were incubated with 1 μl (12 units) of pancreatic DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) under standard conditions for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of a solution containing 2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (heat-denatured) and 0.375m EDTA followed by 0.9 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples remained on ice for 30 min and then were filtered through Whatman GF/C filter discs. The filters were washed twice with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by 2 ml of 95% ethanol. The filters were dried and assayed for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. For each experiment, complete protection was equivalent to the value obtained without DNase I digestion. Complete digestion was equivalent to the value obtained after DNase I digestion when Rad51p was omitted from the binding reaction. The degree of protection was obtained by dividing the amount of acid-precipitable3H for each sample by the value obtained without DNase I digestion after the background (the value without addition of Rad51p) was subtracted from both. This background was ∼10% of the value for 100% protection. Rad51p binding to DNA was also measured by the protein-dependent retention of DNA on nitrocellulose filters (HAWP, 0.45 μm, Millipore Corp.) (19McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl) of the reaction mixtures were diluted in 1 ml of the same reaction buffer and filtered through prewashed filter discs. The filters were washed two times with 1 ml of same buffer and dried, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The ATP dependence of Rad51p binding to ssDNA was determined by measuring the increased fluorescence of εDNA in the standard reaction buffer containing 5 μm εDNA, 1 μm Rad51p, and varying levels of ATP with an ATP-regenerating system. The effect of ATP concentration on the binding of Rad51p to dsDNA was studied with the nuclease protection assay using the same reaction conditions except that the mixture contained 10 μm3H-labeled linear dsDNA and 2 μm Rad51p. Measurements of the effect of Mg2+ on Rad51p binding to εDNA were performed by varying the concentration of MgCl2in the presence of 25, 100, 750, or 3000 μm ATP. The effect of Mg2+ on Rad51p binding to dsDNA was determined by varying the MgCl2 concentration in the presence of 750 μm ATP, and binding was measured by the nitrocellulose filter binding assay. All reactions were carried out at 30 °C. ATPase activity was measured as described (20Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 1 μm Rad51p was added to 5 μm εDNA in a 90-μl reaction mixture containing 2.5 μm ATP, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 100 μm NADH in the standard reaction buffer. Oxidation of NADH was measured as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Rad51p binding to ssDNA was followed by measuring the increase in fluorescence associated with binding of the protein to chemically modified ssDNA (εDNA) (21Secrist J.A.D. Barrio J.R. Leonard N.J. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3499-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The increase in fluorescence is presumed to be a consequence of stretching the DNA and unstacking the bases in the Rad51p·ssDNA complex (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,15Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Rad51p bound to εDNA only when both ATP and Mg2+ were present (Fig. 1). Omitting ATP or replacing it with ADP or AMP-PNP eliminated the binding. ATPγS did not support Rad51p binding to εDNA at 37 °C, but did so, somewhat, at higher Rad51p concentrations at 30 °C. There was no significant difference in the quantitative or qualitative characteristics of the binding or in the requirement for ATP or Mg2+ over the pH range 6.5–8.5 (data not shown). Based on the stoichiometry of Rad51p and εDNA where the fluorescence is maximal, we estimate a binding site size of 5.5 and 7 nucleotides/Rad51p at 37 and 30 °C, respectively, a difference we do not consider significant. Within the experimental uncertainty of 0.8 nucleotide/Rad51p, we adopt 6.3 ± 0.8 nucleotides as the average size of the Rad51p binding site (n). Because of the attending complications in the titrations carried out in the presence of salt (see below), we did not determine the affinity (K ω) and cooperativity (ω) parameters for Rad51p interactions. Instead, we estimated the value of Kfrom the point of half-saturation using the average binding site size of 6.3 nucleotides for the parameter n and Equation 1 of Kowalczykowski et al. (22Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) for noncooperative binding systems; the value of K for binding at 30 and 37 °C is 9 × 105m−1. Rad51p forms a helical filament with dsDNA that is nearly identical to the structure seen by electron microscopy when RecA interacts with dsDNA (23Ogawa T. Yu X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). To characterize several physical parameters governing the interaction of Rad51p with dsDNA, two different measurements were made: protection of 3H-labeled dsDNA against degradation by DNase I and nitrocellulose filter binding. Unlike RecA (14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rad51p binding to dsDNA rendered the DNA insensitive to degradation by DNase I; protection was complete even after 1 min of incubation, and the complex was stable for at least 1 h (Fig. 2 A). As in the case of ssDNA, binding of Rad51p to dsDNA was most effective in the presence of ATP. With 1 μm Rad51p, ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP did not promote binding, but at higher concentrations of Rad51p, these nucleotides promoted some binding (Fig. 2 B). ATP was also required for Rad51p binding to dsDNA in the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (Fig. 2 C). Rad51p-mediated protection of the dsDNA against DNase I action in the presence of ATP reached a limiting value of ∼3.3 base pairs/Rad51p. Unlike RecA, which binds to dsDNA most effectively at low pH (14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McEntee K. Weinstock G.M.

Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8845-8849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rad51p bound dsDNA with the same efficiency at pH 6.5–8.5 in the presence of ATP (data not shown). Here, too, as in the case of ssDNA, we estimate an association constant for Rad51p binding to dsDNA of ∼8 × 105m−1, which is close to the value for Rad51p binding to ssDNA. Fig. 3 demonstrates the dependence of Rad51p binding to DNA on ATP concentration. The apparent Kd value for ATP for Rad51p binding to εDNA is ∼1 μm, and that for binding to dsDNA is ∼2 μm. However, because binding to ssDNA and dsDNA was measured in the presence of 1 and 2 μm Rad51p, respectively, these values may reflect the stoichiometry of binding of Rad51p and ATP rather than a Kd, which could be considerably different. The concentration of Mg2+ required for promoting Rad51p binding to εDNA varied with the amount of ATP in the reaction (Fig. 4). With 25, 100, or 750 μmATP, maximal Rad51p binding occurred with 1–2 mmMg2+. With 750 μm ATP, however, there was little or no effect of Mg2+ until its concentration reached nearly 1 mm. This shows that ATP alone is ineffective in supporting Rad51p binding to ssDNA and suggests that an ATP·Mg2+ complex is the preferred substrate for promoting binding. In the presence of 3 mm ATP, Mg2+ had little effect on Rad51p binding to εDNA until most or all of the ATP was titrated. This further emphasizes the point that ATP alone is ineffective and may even interfere with activation by the ATP·Mg2+ complex. The binding of Rad51p to dsDNA showed the same dependence on the relative amounts of ATP and Mg2+(data not shown). The data indicate that a substantial excess of Mg2+ over ATP is needed to form the active species of the ATP·Mg2+ complex, although we cannot discount the possibility that Mg2+ is also contributing to the binding in other ways, e.g. reacting with Rad51p or the DNA substrate. Once formed in the presence of 100 μm ATP and maintained in this medium, the Rad51p·εDNA complex was stable for an extended period of time (Fig. 5 A). However, if the complex was formed with 2.5 μm ATP, its half-life was ∼12–13 min at 30 °C. This is most likely due to loss of ATP by hydrolysis and not to the accumulation of ADP because even a 10-fold excess of ADP over ATP did not inhibit the binding (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, AMP-PNP, which was also unable to support complex formation (Fig. 1), also failed to destabilize the Rad51p·εDNA complex formed with ATP (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, the Rad51p·εDNA complex was rapidly dissociated in the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 5 B), even though ATPγS itself was unable to support Rad51p binding to εDNA (Fig. 1 A). We attribute the dissociation of the complex to the ability of ATPγS to compete with ATP for binding to Rad51p and the inability of the Rad51p·ATPγS complex to bind εDNA. The inability of ADP, ATPγS, or AMP-PNP to promote Rad51p binding to DNA suggests that ATP hydrolysis might be necessary for DNA binding. To test this supposition, we measured both Rad51p binding to εDNA (Fig. 6 A) and the rate of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6 B) at 30, 20, and 10 °C. At 30 °C, dissociation of the rapidly formed Rad51p·εDNA complex occurred concomitantly with ATP hydrolysis and was 70% complete after 1000 s. At 20 °C, Rad51p bound to εDNA with about the same efficiency, but dissociation of the complex occurred at one-third the rate, mirroring the slower rate of ATP hydrolysis. At 10 °C, Rad51p associated with εDNA to an even greater extent and as rapidly as at 30 °C; moreover, in the absence of appreciable ATP hydrolysis, the complex was relatively stable. These results suggest that Rad51p requires association with ATP, but not hydrolysis, for DNA binding and that hydrolysis of the bound ATP causes dissociation of Rad51p from DNA. The formation of the Rad51p·εDNA complex was inhibited by sodium chloride concentrations exceeding 100 mm (Fig. 7 A). It appears that both the rate and extent of Rad51p·εDNA complex formation are affected by salt. About 20 s were required for the formation of 95% of the complex without salt, whereas >250 s were required to form the same amount of complex in the presence of 200 mm of NaCl (Fig. 7 A). Once formed, however, the Rad51p·ε-DNA complex was more stable at particular salt concentrations than would be expected from their effects on complex formation (Fig. 7 B). Note that the time scales are different in Fig. 7 (A and B), indicating that in 400–500 mm sodium chloride, little or no complex was formed by 10 min, but ∼70% of the complex remained 10 min after the addition of 400 mm salt to the preformed complex and somewhat more than 40% after 10 min in 500 mm salt. Thus, it is clearly more difficult to dissociate the Rad51p·εDNA complex at high salt concentrations than it is to inhibit the binding. The strong sequence similarity between S. cerevisiaeRad51p and bacterial RecA proteins suggested early on that they perform similar or related functions in recombination (2Aboussekhra A. Chanet R. Adjiri A. Fabre F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3224-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Basile G. Aker M. Mortimer R.K. Mol. Cell.

Indeed, both proteins promote strand exchange between a linear duplex DNA and a homologous circular single-stranded DNA to form a double-stranded nicked circle and a linear single strand, although the mechanistic details of their actions differ somewhat (6Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 8Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We are especially interested in understanding the Rad51p-promoted reaction in greater detail, particularly the nucleotide-dependent binding of Rad51p to the two kinds of DNA substrates. To this end, we examined the binding of Rad51p to a modified single-stranded DNA, etheno-DNA (εDNA), which has been used previously to characterize RecA binding to ssDNA (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Protein binding to εDNA is readily monitored by an appreciable increase in the fluorescence of the DNA. Our results show that Rad51p binding to εDNA is strongly dependent on the presence of ATP and Mg2+. At 37 °C, ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP cannot substitute for ATP in promoting Rad51p binding to εDNA; however, at 30 °C, in the presence of high concentrations of Rad51p, ATPγS supports a low level of binding. By contrast, RecA binds to ssDNA without ATP, but ATP induces a transition to a high affinity binding form (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The nonhydrolyzable analogs ATPγS and AMP-PNP also increase the affinity of RecA for DNA, but the RecA·DNA complex is more stable in the presence of these nucleotides (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Under optimal conditions, the stoichiometry of Rad51p association with εDNA indicates a binding site size of 6.3 nucleotides/Rad51p and aK (binding affinity) of 9 × 105m−1 based on the value at half-saturated binding. This binding site size is different from the previously reported value of 3.6 nucleotides determined from studies of the strand exchange reaction (7Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 8Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5359-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The difference in the binding stoichiometry can be explained if the Rad51p monomer has two binding sites, each of which can bind ∼3 nucleotides/DNA strand. A similar difference in binding stoichiometry exists when measuring the binding stoichiometry of RecA and εDNA and the binding site size at which the DNA-dependent ATPase is maximal; these were 7.0 and 3.1 bases/RecA, respectively (17Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The greatest difference between RecA and Rad51p has been found in their ability to interact with dsDNA. RecA binds very weakly to dsDNA at pH 7.5, and the efficiency is increased substantially at low pH or with ATPγS (14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8835-8844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8845-8849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rad51p, however, binds to dsDNA equally well in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ over the pH range of 6.5–8.5. ATPγS and AMP-PNP are able to activate binding somewhat, but only at higher concentrations of Rad51p, whereas ADP is only weakly active. The binding site size estimated from the titration curve is ∼3.3 base pairs/Rad51p, with a binding affinity (K) of 8 × 105m−1; these values are about the same as those for RecA binding to dsDNA (14Pugh B.F. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1326-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Rad51p to εDNA is maximal at ∼5 μm ATP and half-maximal at 1 μm; for binding to dsDNA, the values are about two times higher, respectively. However, because binding to ssDNA and dsDNA was measured in the presence of 1 and 2 μm Rad51p, respectively, the Kd value for ATP binding could be considerably lower. The optimal amount of Mg2+ is influenced by the amount of ATP; at 25–750 μm ATP, 2 mm Mg2+ is optimal, but with excess ATP (3 mm), maximal binding requires 4–6 mm Mg2+. This suggests that the active species for promoting Rad51p binding to ssDNA and dsDNA is a specific ATP·Mg2+ complex, which requires for its formation a large excess of Mg2+ over ATP. Quite possibly, however, Mg2+ has an additional role in the binding reaction, perhaps by its association with the DNA ligand or by action on the protein itself. At NaCl concentrations >0.1 m, the binding of Rad51p to εDNA is inhibited. The degree of inhibition increases with increasing salt concentration until complete inhibition occurs at 0.5m. We have noted, but not investigated further, that other anions, e.g. phosphate and sulfate, are far more inhibitory than the chloride anion. Once formed at optimal levels of salt, the Rad51p·εDNA complex is readily dissociated as the salt concentration is increased. But at any particular salt concentration, the complex is considerably more stable than would be expected from the effect of that salt concentration on complex formation. Once formed, the Rad51p·εDNA complex is stable so long as ATP and Mg2+ are maintained. Removal of either causes the complex to dissociate. Addition of ADP or AMP-PNP at levels 10 times higher than the ATP level does not affect the half-life of the complex. However, the addition of ATPγS to a preformed Rad51p·εDNA complex at a concentration 10 times that of the ATP concentration causes a relatively rapid dissociation of the complex. We surmise that ATPγS competes with ATP for binding to Rad51p, but because the Rad51p·ATPγS complex is unable to bind to εDNA, dissociation of the Rad51p·εDNA complex ensues. The results of dissociation of the Rad51p·εDNA complex formed in the presence of 2.5 μmATP show that ATP binding, not ATP hydrolysis, is required for Rad51p binding to DNA. ATP hydrolysis serves to recycle Rad51p off the DNA. The difference in the ability of Rad51p to bind DNA in the presence of ATP and ATPγS suggests that only the interaction with ATP induces the structural change needed to bind to DNA. An ATP-induced structural transition has also been proposed to activate RecA for DNA binding (13Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar,26Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, as was the case for the strand exchange, there is only a partial similarity between Rad51p and RecA activities. Because Rad51p forms a helical filament with DNA very similar to the one formed with RecA, it is of interest to determine if ATP and Mg2+ are required to activate Rad51p for binding or to promote the formation of oligomers of Rad51p that then bind to DNA or whether ATP and Mg2+influence the successive binding of monomers to already bound clusters of Rad51p. A relevant issue that needs to be investigated further is whether, like RecA, the association and dissociation of Rad51p with DNA occurs with a unique directionality. We thank M. Campbell for providing the εDNA, I. R. Lehman for critical reading of the manuscript, and E. Tolstova for excellent technical support."

Neutrophils and other phagocytic leukocytes possess an NADPH oxidase (respiratory burst oxidase) that generates large quantities of superoxide during the respiratory burst (1Dinauer M. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 30: 329-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Upon phagocyte activation by opsonized bacteria or other inflammatory stimuli, the active NADPH oxidase complex is rapidly assembled at the plasma membrane from cytosolic and membrane components to catalyze the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen. Oxidase subunits include two polypeptides, gp91phox and p22phox, which form a membrane-bound phagocyte flavocytochrome b 558heterodimer, and three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein, Rac (1Dinauer M.

Mutations in the X-linked gene for gp91phoxaccount for the majority of cases of CGD, and the p22phoxsubunit is defective in an uncommon autosomal recessive subgroup of CGD (1Dinauer M. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 30: 329-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1993; 30: 329-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The extreme carboxyl terminus of gp91phox, which resides at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (29Rotrosen D. Kleinberg M.E. Nunoi H. Leto T. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. J. Biol.

Residues ≈400–570 of gp91phox also contain regions with sequence homologies to the NADP+-binding site of ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase flavoenzymes (17Segal A. Biochem.

An aromatic amino acid at or near the carboxyl terminus is highly conserved among members of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase flavoprotein family, including gp91phox which has a carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine (Phe570). Crystallographic analysis of the spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase has localized the carboxyl-terminal aromatic side chain to the NADP+-binding pocket, where it may interact with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD in the absence of NADP+ (35Karplus P. Daniels M. Herriott J. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Altering the aromatic character or deleting this conserved residue in the pea ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase leads to major impairments in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme (36Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Carrillo N. Ceccarelli E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19267-19273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the majority of missense mutations in gp91phoxidentified in patients with X-linked CGD result in apparent structural instability of the protein, in rare cases, gp91phox expression is preserved but the mutant polypeptide forms a non-functional flavocytochrome b 558 (37Curnutte J. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Stamoyannopoulos G. The Molecular Basis of Blood Diseases. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1994: 493-522Google Scholar, 38Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C.

These latter mutations have been informative in identifying residues critical for gp91phox function. The expression and analysis of mutant gp91phox polypeptides generated by site-directed mutagenesis has not been previously reported, at least in part due to the lack of systems in which adequate levels of functional recombinant gp91phox can be readily expressed. To undertake a more systematic analysis of structure-function relationships in gp91phox using this approach, we developed a human myeloid leukemia cell line that lacks endogenous gp91phox after targeted disruption of the X-linked gp91phox gene (39Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This “X-CGD” cell line has been a valuable tool for expression of recombinant gp91phox, which, in the case of wild-type recombinant gp91phox, assembles with p22phox to form a functional flavocytochrome b558 heterodimer (39Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40Kume A. Dinauer M.

Blood. 1996; 88: 1834-1840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to probe the role of the carboxyl terminus of gp91phox in NADPH oxidase activity. We examined both the requirements for an intact559RGVHFIF565 sequence and for a carboxyl-terminal aromatic residue in supporting superoxide production by intact granulocytic cells. Mutant gp91phox cDNAs encoding polypeptides with amino acid substitutions or deletions in the carboxyl terminus were transfected into the X-CGD myeloid cell line for analysis of expression and function. The results suggest that the distal carboxyl terminus is an important determinant for gp91phox stability, but that neither an intact559RGVHFIF565 sequence nor a carboxyl-terminal aromatic residue are absolutely essential for NADPH oxidase activity in intact granulocytic cells. Alanine substitutions had either no or only a modest effect on NADPH oxidase activity. The greatest effects on superoxide production were seen with substitution of polar or charged residues for hydrophobic amino acids in559RGVHFIF565, but these were also associated with reduced expression of gp91phox, suggesting that the overall protein structure was perturbed.RESULTSTo examine the role of the carboxyl terminus of the gp91phox subunit of flavocytochrome b 558in NADPH oxidase activity, site-directed mutations were introduced into the gp91phox cDNA (Fig. 1). Mutant forms of gp91phox that were generated included a series of alanine replacements within the559RGVHFIF565 domain at positions (Arg559, Val561, Phe563, Ile564, and Phe565) previously identified as crucial for oxidase inhibition by alanine-substituted peptides derived from this region (33Kleinberg M. Mital D. Rotrosen D. Malech H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Substitutions with a more polar or charged amino acid were prepared at positions 561, 563, and 565. Two mutants with double substitutions (R559A/V561A and I564T/F565V) were also generated. A mutant gp91phox with an alanine-substituted His562 residue was also prepared, which would be predicted to have no impact on oxidase activity based on peptide inhibition studies (33Kleinberg M. Mital D. Rotrosen D. Malech H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To investigate the requirement for a carboxyl-terminal aromatic residue for gp91phox function, the phenylalanine at position 570 was substituted with an alanine (F570A) or deleted (F570Δ) by insertion of a premature stop codon at this position. Finally, the effect of entirely deleting the last 10 residues (Δ560–570) by introduction of a premature stop codon at position 560 was examined.The mutated gp91phox cDNAs were subcloned into mammalian expression vectors under control of the EF1-α promoter, and the expression of mutant polypeptides evaluated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2) after stable transfection of a derivative of human myeloid leukemia PLB-985 cells which lack endogenous gp91phox due to targeted disruption of the gp91phox gene (X-CGD PLB-985 cells) (39Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Note that the wild-type gp91phox protein migrates as a diffuse band centered at ≈91 kDa (Fig. 2), and the heterogeity in size of immunoreactive species most likely reflects variations in glycosylation. Two related vectors were used in these studies, pEF-PGKneo and pEF-PGKpac, that differ only in the selectable marker gene upstream of the EF1-α promoter/gp91phox cDNA cassette. Using the pEF-PGKneo vector, which has a linked neomycin phosphotransferase marker gene, expression of recombinant wild-type gp91phox cDNA is 10–20% of the endogenous gp91phox level in granulocyte-induced wild-type PLB-985 cells (39Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies, we observed that higher levels of expression of recombinant wild-type gp91phox (25–50% of wild-type PLB-985) were obtainable using pEF-PGKpac,2 for reasons which remain unclear. The majority of gp91phox mutants reported here were expressed using the pEF-PGKneo vector, and their expression compared with X-CGD PLB-985 cell lines transfected with a pEF-PGKneo vector containing the wild-type gp91phox cDNA (Fig. 2, upper two panels). Several mutants prepared later during the course of this study utilized pEF-PGKpac, and expression was compared with wild-type p91phox expressed using pEF-PGKpac (Fig. 2, lower panel). One mutant, F570Δ, was expressed in both vector backgrounds, but most mutants were not re-cloned into pEF-PGKpac as it was felt that the conclusions would not be substantially altered.Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of gp91phoxexpression in PLB-985 cell lines. Cell extracts were prepared from granulocyte-differentiated PLB-985 cells and derivatives, and analyzed for gp91phox expression by immunoblotting. PLB-985, wild-type PLB-985 cells; X-CGD, X-CGD PLB-985 cells; X-CGD cells transfected with either wild-type gp91phox(WT) or mutant cDNAs are as indicated in italics. The upper two panels show results obtained using the pEF-PGKneo vector for transfection, and the bottom panel shows extracts obtained from pEF-PGKpac transfectants (asterisks). Blots were probed with a gp91phox monoclonal antibody, MoAb48. Twenty μg of protein was loaded in each lane, except for wild-type PLB-985 cells, for which 5 μg was loaded. In most cases, two independently prepared representative samples from mutant gp91phox transfectants are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A summary of the relative levels of expression of recombinant gp91phox derivatives in granulocyte-induced PLB-985 cells is shown in Table I. Several of the gp91phox mutants appeared to be unstable, with deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acids having the greatest impact on protein expression. No gp91phox was detected in immunoblots of cell extracts prepared from either undifferentiated (not shown) or granulocyte-induced cells transfected with the Δ560–570 construct, using either the monoclonal antibody MoAb48 (Fig. 2 A), directed against an uncharacterized epitope on gp91phox, or two different gp91phox polyclonal antisera (not shown). In cells expressing F563T, F565D, or FI564/F565V gp91phox mutants, very small but detectable amounts of the gp91phox polypeptide were present. More modest reductions in the relative level of gp91phox expression were seen for several other mutants (V561A, V561T, V561E, F563A, F565A, and F570Δ). The relative levels of the remaining mutants were not significantly different from wild-type recombinant gp91phox as expressed with the corresponding pEF-PGKneo or pEF-PGKpac vector. The amount of recombinant protein detected was unrelated to the abundance of the transgene-derived gp91phox mRNAs, which were all similar (not shown). As was previously observed with expression of wild-type recombinant gp91phox (39Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832-9836Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), expression of mutant derivatives of gp91phox rescued expression of the cytochrome p22phoxsubunit in X-CGD PLB-985 cells, in proportion to the relative abundance of the mutant gp91phox subunit (not shown).Table ISuperoxide generation by granulocyte-induced PLB-985 cells expressing wild-type or mutant gp91phox subunits of cytochrome bCell lineRelative level of gp91phoxV maxCumulative O·̄2Relative rate of O·̄2 formation%nmol O2· min/107 cellsnmol/30 min/107 cells%Wild-type100 ± 1853 ± 6670 ± 10100 ± 11X-CGD0000X-CGD + recombinant gp91phox Wild-type (neo)21 ± 548 ± 9698 ± 3389 ± 17 Wild-type (pac)37 ± 550 ± 17695 ± 6694 ± 34Δ560–5700000R559A13 ± 143 ± 7676 ± 6981 ± 14 R559A/V561A25 ± 937 ± 10499 ± 13170 ± 19V561A26 ± 326 ± 6444 ± 9849 ± 161-ap < 0.05 (wild-type PLB-985versus transfected X-CGD PLB-985 expressing recombinant gp91phox), using the unpaired t test.V561T7 ± 11-bp < 0.05 (wild-type recombinant gp91phox versus mutant gp91phox expressed using the same vector), using the unpaired t test.29 ± 6560 ± 10055 ± 121-ap < 0.05 (wild-type PLB-985versus transfected X-CGD PLB-985 expressing recombinant gp91phox), using the unpaired t test.V561E5 ± 11-bp < 0.05 (wild-type recombinant gp91phox versus mutant gp91phox expressed using the same vector), using the unpaired t test.11 ± 2232 ± 4821 ± 51-ap < 0.05 (wild-type PLB-985versus transfected X-CGD PLB-985 expressing recombinant gp91phox), using the unpaired t test.H562A16 ± 151 ± 17702 ± 2095 ± 32F563A(pac)24 ± 21-bp < 0.05 (wild-type recombinant gp91phox versus mutant gp91phox expressed using the same vector), using the unpaired t test.46 ± 8720 ± 2487 ± 15F563T(pac)1.0 ± 11-bp < 0.05 (wild-type recombinant gp91phox versus mutant gp91phox expressed using the same vector), using the unpaired t test.2 ± 112 ± 74 ± 21-ap < 0.05 (wild-type PLB-985versus transfected X-CGD PLB-985 expressing recombinant gp91phox), using the unpaired t test.I564A15 ± 6.532 ± 7515 ± 17560 ± 131-ap < 0.05 (wild-type PLB-985versus transfected X-CGD PLB-985 expressing recombinant gp91phox), using the unpaired t test.

Open table in a new tab To provide evidence that the wild-type and mutant gp91phox are successfully delivered to the plasma membrane when transgenically expressed in X-CGD PLB-985 cells, we stained the transfected and parental X-CGD cells with a monoclonal antibody, 7D5, and examined cell surface expression of flavocytochrome b 558 by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The 7D5 antibody reacts with an extracellular epitope on flavocytochrome b 558(49Nakamura M. Sendo S. van Zwieten R. Koga T. Roos D. Kanegasaki S. Blood. 1988; 72: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the mutant gp91phox proteins were expressed at variable levels, we chose F570Δ as an example of a mutant that was expressed at relatively high levels, comparable to the wild-type recombinant gp91phox, and F563T as an example of poorly expressed gp91phox mutant. As seen in Fig. 3, the 7D5 antibody produced a complete shift in fluorescence intensity in flow cytometry of cells transfected with wild-type gp91phox, and confocal microscopy showed immunofluorescent staining on the cell surface. Similar results were obtained for wild-type PLB-985 granulocytes (not shown), whereas no staining was seen for X-CGD PLB-985 cells (Fig. 3). Immunofluorescent staining of cells expressing recombinant F570Δ gp91phox was similar to that seen for cells expressing recombinant wild-type gp91phox. However, only weak staining of F563T gp91phox-expressing cells was seen, consistent with the results seen by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the transgenic expression of wild-type and mutant gp91phox in X-CGD PLB-985 cells results in the plasma membrane expression of flavocytochromeb 558, at levels that correlate with the amount of gp91phox seen in immunoblots of cell extracts.Figure 3Cell surface expression of wild-type and mutant gp91phox in transgenic X-CGD PLB-985 cell lines. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were performed using the 7D5 monoclonal antibody to stain X-CGD PLB-985 cells and derivative lines obtained after stable transfection with pEF-PGKpac vectors for expression of either wild-type (WT) gp91phox or the F570Δ or F563T mutants, as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W1987060127,"Previous investigators have reported the presence of two dominant proteins, tectonin I (25 kDa) and tectonin II (39 kDa), in nuclei and nuclear matrix from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. We demonstrate, by a modification of the nuclear isolation protocol and by protease sensitivity, that the tectonins are not nuclear proteins but rather are located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane.We report the sequences of cDNAs of tectonins I and II, which encode 217 and 353 amino acids, respectively. Tectonin I is homologous to the C-terminal two-thirds of tectonin II. Both proteins contain six tandem repeats that are each 33–37 amino acids in length and define a new consensus sequence. Homologous repeats are found in L-6, a bacterial lipopolysaccharide-binding lectin from horseshoe crab hemocytes. The repetitive sequences of the tectonins and L-6 are reminiscent of the WD repeats of the β-subunit of G proteins, suggesting that they form β-propeller domains. Tectonin II has an additional N-terminal domain that includes a 47-residue sequence highly similar to the galactoside-binding sequence of the B-chain of ricin. The tectonins may be lectins that function as part of a transmembrane signaling complex during phagocytosis.

The tectonins may be lectins that function as part of a transmembrane signaling complex during phagocytosis. In its plasmodial form, the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum exists as a multinucleated syncytium that feeds on bacteria and organic detritus by phagocytosis. The many nuclei within a single plasmodium progress through the cell cycle synchronously, and at the end of the G2 phase undergo closed mitosis. Because of these characteristics, several investigators have examined the P. polycephalum nuclear matrix (1Mitchelson K.R. Bekers A.G.M. Wanka F. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 247-256PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kowalska-Loth B. Staron K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1986; 11: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 3Denovan-Wright E.M. Wright J.M. Biochim.

Biochem. 1993; 212: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and reported that, as with mammalian nuclear matrix, the P. polycephalum matrix contained a number of proteins ranging from approximately 40 kDa to more than 100 kDa but that it differed from mammalian nuclear matrix by having two dominant proteins with reported molecular masses of 23–28 and 35–38 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. The same proteins have also been found associated with purified rDNA chromatin (5Amero S.A. Montoya V.L. Murdoch W.L. Ogle R.C. Keating J.L. Grainger R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10734-10744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have termed these proteins tectonins I and II, respectively.In the present study we report the cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs for the tectonins, and we use trypsin digestion of cell fractions to assess their localization in the plasmodium. We find that the tectonins are not nuclear proteins but instead are located on the plasmodial surface, and we report a method for purifying P. polycephalum nuclei not contaminated with the tectonins.The tectonins share with lectin L-6 of horseshoe crab hemocytes (6Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) six repeats of a novel consensus sequence that may form a β-propeller structure. Additionally, tectonin II contains in its N-terminal region a sequence similar to the galactose-binding domain of the B-chain of the plant toxin ricin (7Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5398-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tectonins may share with lectin L-6 the ability to recognize the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria for phagocytosis and utilize an additional affinity for galactose to expand the number of ligands that they recognize.DISCUSSIONThe amino acid sequences of tectonins I and II deduced from cloned cDNAs show that the two proteins are closely related, with 73% of the amino acid residues in tectonin I and in the C-terminal two-thirds of tectonin II being identical. The tectonin genes are transcribed to yield poly(A)-tailed mRNAs of 870 and 1200 nucleotides for tectonin I and II, respectively. The only variations within either mRNA were extension of a few nucleotides at the 5′ end for minor species of the tectonin II mRNA and isolated base changes in the untranslated leaders and 3′ regions of both mRNAs, which indicate transcription of both alleles of the genes in the diploid plasmodium that was used as the source of mRNA in constructing the cDNA library.The calculated pI for tectonin I is 6.49 and for tectonin II is 6.27. By using two-dimensional electrophoresis, we have determined pI values of 7.2 for tectonin I and 6.7 for tectonin II, whereas Denovan-Wright and Wright (3Denovan-Wright E.M. Wright J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) reported 7.4 for tectonin I and 6.70–6.85 for isoforms of tectonin II which they isolated from nuclear matrix preparations. These values all show reasonable agreement, with tectonin II being somewhat more acidic then tectonin I.The tectonin homologue lectin L-6 has been shown to have affinity for bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and it appears to participate in the anti-bacterial defense system of the horseshoe crab (6Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By virtue of the similarity between lectin L-6 and the tectonins, we suggest that the tectonins may perform a similar bacterial recognition function and thus aid P. polycephalum in identifying and phagocytosing its food.The N-terminal domain of tectonin II seems likely to have an additional lectin activity, β-galactoside binding. A segment of 47 amino acids (residues 47–94) shares 31% identity with part of the B-chain of ricin and an additional 20% conservative substitution of amino acids. The B-chain of ricin contains two similar galactoside-binding sites created by gene duplication. The two halves of the B-chain have a 32% identity in amino acids (7Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5398-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is the N-terminal half of ricin that is most similar to the tectonin II segment, but the putative galactoside-binding site in tectonin II shares features of each of the ricin B-chain sites. Specifically, x-ray crystallography of a ricin-lactose complex (20Lehar S.M. Pedersen J.T. Kamath R.S. Swimmer C. Goldmacher V.S. Lambert J.M. Blättler W.A. Guild B.C. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) has shown that the N-terminal site uses Asp, Gln, Trp, Lys, and Asn to bind galactose, whereas at the second site there is no Gln and Tyr replaces Trp. Tectonin II has Asp, Leu, Tyr, Lys, and Asn at the equivalent positions in the sequence. Lectin activity resident in this segment of tectonin II could augment its breadth of specificity or its affinity for potential foodstuff. The surface slime of P. polycephalum, which is a galactan (25Farr D.R. Amster H. Horisberger M. Carbohydr. Res. 1972; 24: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), does not appear to be a ligand of the tectonins, as we have not detected either tectonin in slime recovered from culture medium.Denovan-Wright and Wright (3Denovan-Wright E.M. Wright J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have reported that tectonin II is a glycoprotein, with up to four isomers of the protein having been detected by concanavalin A. Perhaps the apparent isomers were the result of tight binding of the tectonins to oligosaccharides. If there are covalently linked saccharide residues, their number must be low since we find that plasmodial tectonin II co-migrates with tectonin II expressed in E. coli, which should not be glycosylated.Originally described as possible nuclear matrix proteins, our results indicate that the tectonins are instead principally cell-surface proteins that are accessible to digestion by trypsin in unpermeabilized plasmodia. In other experiments using anti-tectonin antibodies for immunoelectron and fluorescence microscopy, 2J. E. Aldrich and R. Marsh, submitted for publication. we have confirmed the surface location of the tectonins and found that they also are bound to the inner surface of certain cytoplasmic vesicles. On the external membrane surface, the tectonins are concentrated in crowns similar to the structures believed to be involved in phagocytosis and macropinocytosis in Dictyostelium discoideum (27de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4097-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Hacker U. Albrecht R. Maniak M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the crowns of D. discoideum, coronin accumulates on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and interacts with actin. The crowns subsequently enclose bacteria or fluid in a vesicle for digestion. The aggregation of tectonins on the external surface of similar crowns supports a role for tectonins in such endocytoses by binding food and perhaps triggering vesicle formation.How newly synthesized tectonins are transported and bound to the plasmodial surface is not clear. Their cDNAs do not encode precursor forms with N-terminal signal sequences, and neither protein has recognizable sequences for membrane transport or attachment of lipids.We are able to isolate P. polycephalum nuclei lacking the tectonins with mild conditions, which confirms that they are not nuclear proteins. By sedimentation through buffered 14% Percoll, tectonin-free nuclei are separated from contaminating membranes, and both tectonins are found in a viscous, membranous pellicle at the top of the Percoll solution as would be expected for fragments of the plasmodial surface. Unless the tectonin-rich membranes are separated from the nuclei or nucleoli that are used to prepare matrix, we confirm that they appear as dominant components as reported by other investigators (1Mitchelson K.R. Bekers A.G.M. Wanka F. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 247-256PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kowalska-Loth B. Staron K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1986; 11: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 3Denovan-Wright E.M. Wright J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have also observed that the tectonins can contaminate mitochondrial preparations, and Amero et al. (5Amero S.A. Montoya V.L. Murdoch W.L. Ogle R.C. Keating J.L. Grainger R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10734-10744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that they were present as possible contaminants of P. polycephalum rDNA chromatin. Why are the tectonins such ubiquitous contaminants? A likely answer is that they are part of complexes on the surface of plasmodia, which are associated with the viscous polysaccharide slime that coats the exterior surface. When fragmented by homogenization, surface fragments enriched in tectonins could entrap organelles and large molecular complexes via the associated polysaccharide. The purification method of Mohberg and Rusch (10Mohberg J. Rusch H.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 66: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which relies on sedimentation through 1 m sucrose, may actually have driven the entrapment due to the sucrose concentration. The fact that tectonins can be separated from nuclei under low ionic strength and with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the buffer shows that their apparent association with nuclei is not a matter of strong interactions that must be disrupted. The buffered 14% Percoll that we used for purification of nuclei provides the density differential and low solute concentration needed to separate nuclei from tectonin-containing fragments of the cell membrane.Together with limulus lectin L-6, the tectonins establish a new family of proteins based on the repeated consensus sequence: pWpX(V/I)pGpLXpVpnX 3–5pVWGVNpXppIY⊕. Including the additional 4–7 residues that connect the six tandem repeats of this sequence in the tectonins and L-6, the repeat units are 33–38 amino acids long. Conserved residues in the consensus sequence define two blocks of 13–14 amino acids that are connected by 3–5 residues in the middle of the consensus sequence. The second or third residue at the beginning of each block is tryptophan or another aromatic amino acid, and the penultimate residue at the end of the second block is tyrosine. Valine or isoleucine is found at four rather evenly spaced intervals across the consensus sequence. In lectin L-6, a tight three-residue turn is locked in place between every other repeat of the consensus by a disulfide bond between cysteines that bracket the turn (6Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); this feature is absent from the sequences that link the tectonin repeats.Collectively, the tectonin and L-6 repeat sequences predict that each repeat is comprised of four similarly sized short β-strands connected by turns or random coils. Thus, each of the repeats appears to form a four-stranded β-sheet. This pattern of multiple repeats 23–40 amino acids long, each containing 4 short β-strands typifies β-propeller proteins (17Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tectonin consensus sequence is similar, particularly in its latter half, to the repeated WD sequences of the β-subunits of G proteins, where Y⊕ sometimes replaces the WD residues (18Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Much is known regarding the position of Gβon the inner surface of plasma membranes and its function in transmembrane signaling (26Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The apparent similarity of tertiary structure of the tectonins may reflect their proposed function as external components of a signal system for response to food. In its plasmodial form, the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum exists as a multinucleated syncytium that feeds on bacteria and organic detritus by phagocytosis. The many nuclei within a single plasmodium progress through the cell cycle synchronously, and at the end of the G2 phase undergo closed mitosis. Because of these characteristics, several investigators have examined the P. polycephalum nuclear matrix (1Mitchelson K.R. Bekers A.G.M. Wanka F. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 247-256PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kowalska-Loth B. Staron K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1986; 11: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 3Denovan-Wright E.M. Wright J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 4Eberharter A. Grabher A. Gstraunthaler G. Loidl P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and reported that, as with mammalian nuclear matrix, the P. polycephalum matrix contained a number of proteins ranging from approximately 40 kDa to more than 100 kDa but that it differed from mammalian nuclear matrix by having two dominant proteins with reported molecular masses of 23–28 and 35–38 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. The same proteins have also been found associated with purified rDNA chromatin (5Amero S.A. Montoya V.L. Murdoch W.L. Ogle R.C. Keating J.L. Grainger R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10734-10744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have termed these proteins tectonins I and II, respectively. In the present study we report the cloning and sequencing of the cDNAs for the tectonins, and we use trypsin digestion of cell fractions to assess their localization in the plasmodium. We find that the tectonins are not nuclear proteins but instead are located on the plasmodial surface, and we report a method for purifying P. polycephalum nuclei not contaminated with the tectonins. The tectonins share with lectin L-6 of horseshoe crab hemocytes (6Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) six repeats of a novel consensus sequence that may form a β-propeller structure. Additionally, tectonin II contains in its N-terminal region a sequence similar to the galactose-binding domain of the B-chain of the plant toxin ricin (7Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5398-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tectonins may share with lectin L-6 the ability to recognize the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria for phagocytosis and utilize an additional affinity for galactose to expand the number of ligands that they recognize. DISCUSSIONThe amino acid sequences of tectonins I and II deduced from cloned cDNAs show that the two proteins are closely related, with 73% of the amino acid residues in tectonin I and in the C-terminal two-thirds of tectonin II being identical. The tectonin genes are transcribed to yield poly(A)-tailed mRNAs of 870 and 1200 nucleotides for tectonin I and II, respectively. The only variations within either mRNA were extension of a few nucleotides at the 5′ end for minor species of the tectonin II mRNA and isolated base changes in the untranslated leaders and 3′ regions of both mRNAs, which indicate transcription of both alleles of the genes in the diploid plasmodium that was used as the source of mRNA in constructing the cDNA library.The calculated pI for tectonin I is 6.49 and for tectonin II is 6.27.

By sedimentation through buffered 14% Percoll, tectonin-free nuclei are separated from contaminating membranes, and both tectonins are found in a viscous, membranous pellicle at the top of the Percoll solution as would be expected for fragments of the plasmodial surface. Unless the tectonin-rich membranes are separated from the nuclei or nucleoli that are used to prepare matrix, we confirm that they appear as dominant components as reported by other investigators (1Mitchelson K.R. Bekers A.G.M. Wanka F. J. Cell Sci. 1979; 39: 247-256PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kowalska-Loth B. Staron K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1986; 11: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 3Denovan-Wright E.M. Wright J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have also observed that the tectonins can contaminate mitochondrial preparations, and Amero et al. (5Amero S.A. Montoya V.L. Murdoch W.L. Ogle R.C. Keating J.L. Grainger R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10734-10744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that they were present as possible contaminants of P. polycephalum rDNA chromatin. Why are the tectonins such ubiquitous contaminants? A likely answer is that they are part of complexes on the surface of plasmodia, which are associated with the viscous polysaccharide slime that coats the exterior surface. When fragmented by homogenization, surface fragments enriched in tectonins could entrap organelles and large molecular complexes via the associated polysaccharide. The purification method of Mohberg and Rusch (10Mohberg J. Rusch H.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 66: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which relies on sedimentation through 1 m sucrose, may actually have driven the entrapment due to the sucrose concentration. The fact that tectonins can be separated from nuclei under low ionic strength and with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the buffer shows that their apparent association with nuclei is not a matter of strong interactions that must be disrupted. The buffered 14% Percoll that we used for purification of nuclei provides the density differential and low solute concentration needed to separate nuclei from tectonin-containing fragments of the cell membrane. Together with limulus lectin L-6, the tectonins establish a new family of proteins based on the repeated consensus sequence: pWpX(V/I)pGpLXpVpnX 3–5pVWGVNpXppIY⊕. Including the additional 4–7 residues that connect the six tandem repeats of this sequence in the tectonins and L-6, the repeat units are 33–38 amino acids long. Conserved residues in the consensus sequence define two blocks of 13–14 amino acids that are connected by 3–5 residues in the middle of the consensus sequence. The second or third residue at the beginning of each block is tryptophan or another aromatic amino acid, and the penultimate residue at the end of the second block is tyrosine. Valine or isoleucine is found at four rather evenly spaced intervals across the consensus sequence. In lectin L-6, a tight three-residue turn is locked in place between every other repeat of the consensus by a disulfide bond between cysteines that bracket the turn (6Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); this feature is absent from the sequences that link the tectonin repeats. Collectively, the tectonin and L-6 repeat sequences predict that each repeat is comprised of four similarly sized short β-strands connected by turns or random coils. Thus, each of the repeats appears to form a four-stranded β-sheet. This pattern of multiple repeats 23–40 amino acids long, each containing 4 short β-strands typifies β-propeller proteins (17Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the tectonin consensus sequence is similar, particularly in its latter half, to the repeated WD sequences of the β-subunits of G proteins, where Y⊕ sometimes replaces the WD residues (18Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Much is known regarding the position of Gβon the inner surface of plasma membranes and its function in transmembrane signaling (26Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The apparent similarity of tertiary structure of the tectonins may reflect their proposed function as external components of a signal system for response to food.

Binding was evaluated using Ca2+-aggregated microsomes, which can be sedimented at low g forces.

Scatchard plots of binding data are readily fit to a simple “two-site” model, with Kd = 21 nm for the high affinity site and Kd = 2 μm for the low affinity site. Binding to the high affinity site was competitively blocked by Glc-6-P (Ki = 9 mm), whereas binding was unaffected by mannose-6-phosphate, Pi, and PPiand only modestly depressed by 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate, a poor substrate for Glc-6-Pase in intact microsomes. Thus the high affinity 3H-S 5627 binding site fits the criteria for T1. Permeabilization of the membrane with 0.3% (3-[(chloramidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) activated Glc-6-Pase and broadened its substrate specificity, but it did not significantly alter the binding of 3H-S 5627 to the high affinity sites or the ability of Glc-6-P to block binding. These data demonstrate unequivocally that two independent Glc-6-P binding sites are involved in the hydrolysis of Glc-6-P by intact microsomes. The present findings are the strongest and most direct evidence to date against the notion that the substrate specificity and the intrinsic activity of Glc-6-Pase in native membranes are determined by specific conformational constraints imposed on the enzyme protein.

Glc-6-Pase 1The abbreviations used are: Glc-6-Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; Glc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; 2-deoxy-d-Glc-6-P, 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate; Chaps, (3-[(chloramidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-pro- panesulfonate). (EC 3.1.3.9) catalyzes the terminal reaction in the glucogenic processes of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In 1951 Hers et al. (3Hers H.G. Berthet J. Berthet L. de Duve C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1951; 33: 21-41PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the hydrolysis of Glc-6-P is catalyzed by an enzyme within the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum. Since then a major research effort has been made to understand the physiological significance of this membrane association and the role of the membrane in the function of Glc-6-Pase. Two sharply contrasting models have been proposed to explain the role of the membrane in the function of Glc-6-Pase. The first, developed by Arion and co-workers (4Arion W.J. Wallin B.K. Lange A.J. Ballas L.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1975; 6: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is called substrate transport model or alternatively the translocase-catalytic unit model (6Sukalski K.A. Nordlie R.C. Adv. Enzymol. 1989; 62: 93-117PubMed Google Scholar). In the substrate transport model Glc-6-Pase is viewed as a multicomponent system in the hepatic and renal endoplasmic reticulum. Hydrolysis of Glc-6-P by intact membranes is postulated to involve the coupled functions of at least three integral proteins: 1) a Glc-6-P-specific translocase, denoted T1, that mediates penetration of the hexose phosphate through the membrane; 2) a relatively nonspecific phosphohydrolase situated with its active site facing the luminal cavity; and 3) a second translocase, denoted T2, that mediates efflux of Pi. T2 also mediates the transport of PPiand carbamoyl phosphate across the membrane (5Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of glucose efflux remains undefined (5Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The second model has its origin in Mitchell's oriented group translocation model (8Mitchell P. Nature. 1957; 180: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which posits substrate binding on one side of a membrane with release of a product (i.e. “group”) on the other side. Variations on this theme have been proposed by Stetten and Burnett (9Stetten M.R. Burnett F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 139: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Nordlie (10Nordlie R.C. Curr. Top. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14St-Denis J.-F. Comte B. Nguyen D.K. Seidman E. Paradis K. Levy E. van de Werve G. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The most recent formulation of this model of Glc-6-Pase is called the “combined conformational flexibility-substrate-transport model” (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Berteloot A. St-Denis J.-F. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21098-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The conformation-based models hypothesize a single, membrane-spanning protein whose active site is directly accessible to Glc-6-P but whose catalytic activity is conformationally “constrained” within the environment of the native (i.e.intact) membrane. More recently it was conceded (15Berteloot A. St-Denis J.-F. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21098-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that to account for all the characteristics of Glc-6-Pase of intact microsomes, other polypeptides must participate in the hydrolytic process. Whereas both models of Glc-6-Pase have their origin in the results of kinetic measurements, in each instance the respective interpretation of these data was seen as evidence against the alternative model. However, methodological problems may be at the center of the existing controversy (see “Discussion”). 2W. J. Arion and E. S. Callaway, manuscript in preparation. Considering that 25 years have passed since its postulation and T1 remains to be identified, the skepticism concerning its existence is understandable. In the present investigation we have applied methodology previously unavailable to investigations on Glc-6-Pase. Specifically, we have made direct measurements of binding to evaluate whether one or two binding sites for Glc-6-P are involved in Glc-6-P hydrolysis by intact liver microsomes. The outcome of this evaluation bears directly on whether substrate transport (two Glc-6-P binding sites) or group translocation (a single binding site) is the underlying mechanism. Although the affinities of T1 and enzyme for Glc-6-P are too low to enable direct binding measurements, we were able to exploit the recent development of a class of chlorogenic acid analogues, which function as highly specific competitive inhibitors of Glc-6-Pase activity in intact liver and kidney microsomes (16Arion W.J.

Su M.L. Burger H.-J. Hemmerle H. Schubert G. Below P. Herling A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The potency of the high affinity analogue S 3483 (Ki = 129 nm) was markedly depressed when the concentration of microsomal protein in the assay system was elevated, whereas protein concentration had no effect on the potency of chlorogenic acid (Ki = 260 μm) (18Arion W.J.

This suggested that T1 may reside in microsomes in the concentration range of 50–100 pmol/mg protein (18Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Ramos F.C. Su M.L. Burger H.-J. Hemmerle H. Schubert G. Below P. Herling A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and raised the possibility that use of a high affinity (viz. Ki≤ 100 nm) radiolabeled chlorogenic acid analogue would permit quantitative characterizations of T1 by, for example, Scatchard analysis (19Feldman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). We report here on studies with the chlorogenic acid analogue designated S 5627. 3H-S 5627 was synthesized and used in binding studies to characterize T1. S 5627 is an analogue of compound II of patent EP 95–106760 950504 (20Hemmerle, H., Schubert, G., Burger, H.-J., Herling, A., and Efendic, S.

Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 619-625Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and stored frozen at −70 °C at a concentration of 15–20 mg protein/ml. Unless otherwise indicated microsomes from 24-h fasted rats were used. Microsomal intactness, quantified from the latency of mannose-6-phosphatase (22Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Arion W.J. Ballas L.M. Lange A.J. Wallin B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4901-4907Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), was always greater than 96%. Data from assays of untreated microsomes were corrected for the contribution of enzyme residing in disrupted membranes (24Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10387-10395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lange A.J. Arion W.J. Beaudet A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8381-8384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fully disrupted microsomes were prepared by exposing microsomes (1–2 mg protein/ml) for 20 min at 0 °C to 0.1% Triton X-100 (26Arion W.J. Carlson P.W. Wallin B.K. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2551-2557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 0.3% Chaps (22Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were carried out at 30 °C in a volume of 100 μl (22Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphohydrolase activity was assayed by quantifying Pi formation as described previously (22Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). S 5627 binding was evaluated using Ca2+-aggregated microsomes (or simply calcium microsomes), which can be sedimented at low g forces. (27Ballas L.M. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8512-8518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kamath S.A. Narayan K.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To prepare calcium microsomes from control microsomes, one volume of microsomes (15–20 mg protein/ml) was thawed on ice and added to 9 volumes of an ice-cold solution containing 8.9 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm Hepes, and 14 mm sucrose, final pH 7.0. The suspension was mixed well and centrifuged at 250 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended to the original volume of microsomes in 0.25 msucrose in 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Protein recovery was usually about 75%. To prepare calcium microsomes from detergent-disrupted microsomes, microsomes were disrupted with detergent as described above and then sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 45 min. The membranes were resuspended to their original volume in 0.25 m sucrose in 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and transformed to calcium microsomes as described for control microsomes. 3H-S 5627 binding was quantified at pH 7.0 as follows. Calcium microsomes (1 mg protein/ml), S 5627 varied from 6 to 500 nm, 3H-S 5627 (2 nCi/tube), and 50 mm Hepes in 1 ml of final volume were incubated at 22 °C. After 10 min, 0.4 ml was removed for determination of total 3H-S 5627, and the remaining 0.6 ml was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fluid was counted to determine free ligand, and bound ligand was determined by difference. Regression analyses of plotted data were carried out using Microcal Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Linear regressions were unweighted. Binding parameters were obtained from Scatchard plots of binding data (19Feldman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) using a two-site, mathematical model in which the binding affinity at the higher affinity site (S1) was assumed to be 2 orders of magnitude greater than binding affinity at the second site (S2). The variables were the concentration of binding sites, [S1] and [S2], the dissociation constants for complexes of 3H-S 5627 with S1 and S2, and the Ki values for competing ligands, Glc-6-P and 2-deoxy-d-Glc-6-P. For each concentration of3H-S 5627 and competing ligand the concentration of the S1-3H-S 5627 complex was calculated assuming specific values for each of the variables. The concentration difference between total 3H-S 5627 and the amount bound to S1 was used in calculations of the amount bound to S2. In the plots “bound” refers to the sum of the binding to S1 and S2, and “free” refers to the amount not bound to S1 and S2. Calculations were made in a Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet for a broad range of concentrations of ligand, and the resulting values for “bound/free” and bound were paste linked into a Microcal Origin 5.0 worksheet and simultaneously plotted as a line graph superimposed on the scatter plot of experimental binding data. The values of the variables were adjusted until the line defined by the calculated values yielded the lowest value for the sum of the squares. In most cases a single set of parameters gave a “best fit” to all data sets in an experiment. These are noted in the figures. At the outset we were concerned with methodology for evaluating binding of S 5627 to liver microsomes. We considered the advantages and disadvantages of equilibrium dialysis, vacuum filtration, filtration under centrifugal force, and centrifugation. Our primary concern with filtration was the likelihood of a high background due to “nonspecific” binding to the filter media and trapping of label between membrane vesicles. Equilibrium dialysis and ultracentrifugation of normal microsomes is relatively slow and would markedly limit the number of measurements per experiment. Such a limitation would preclude rigorous competitive binding studies. To measure transport in microsomes, Ballas and Arion (27Ballas L.M. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8512-8518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used microsomes exposed to 8 mm Ca2+, which causes aggregation of the vesicles and enables them to be sedimented at low speeds (typically 300 × g) (28Kamath S.A. Narayan K.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The ease of separating free and bound ligand made calcium microsomes especially well suited to the present task, but before employing the Ca2+ microsomes in binding studies, it was necessary to evaluate whether aggregation with Ca2+ altered the interaction of the Glc-6-Pase system with S 5627. Fig. 1 shows the concentration dependence of inhibition of Glc-6-Pase by S 5627 in intact normal and intact calcium microsomes when assayed at 1 mm Glc-6-P. Fig. 1also shows that disruption of microsomes with 0.3% Chaps abolished the sensitivity of Glc-6-P hydrolysis to S 5627. Disruption with other detergents (e.g. 0.1% Triton X-100) or ammonium hydroxide (26Arion W.J. Carlson P.W. Wallin B.K. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2551-2557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stetten M.R. Burnett F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 128: 344-350Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was as effective as Chaps (data not shown). Thus S 5627 inhibits only in intact microsomes with about equal potency in normal and calcium aggregated microsomes. Fig. 2 shows that like chlorogenic acid (16Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Ramos F.C. Schindler P.W. Burger H.-J Hemmerle H. Schubert G. Below P. Herling A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and other chlorogenic acid analogues (17Hemmerle H. Burger H.-J. Below P. Schubert G. Rippel R. Schindler P.W. Paulus E. Herling A.W. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 18Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Ramos F.C. Su M.L. Burger H.-J. Hemmerle H. Schubert G. Below P. Herling A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) S 5627 is a linear competitive inhibitor of Glc-6-P hydrolysis in intact microsomes and Ca2+ exposure did not alter the pattern of inhibition or the potency of S 5627. Other than a modest decrease in the Kvalues for both substrate and competitive inhibitor, the Glc-6-Pase system is unaffected by Ca2+ aggregation. Fig. 3 is a Scatchard plot (19Feldman H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) of typical binding data with rat liver microsomes. The data are readily fit (seesolid lines in Fig. 3) to a two-site model in which the binding affinities of the two sites differ by about 2 orders of magnitude. Binding to S1, the high affinity site (Kd= 21 nm), was competitively reduced by the presence of Glc-6-P. The estimate of Ki for Glc-6-P (9 mm) agrees well with the expected value forKm(T1), because we expect the value forKm(T1) to be two to three times greater than the Km for Glc-6-P hydrolysis by intact microsomes (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 30Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6784-6790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, S 5627 binding was unaffected by 60 mm mannose-6-phosphate, 50 mmPi, or 50 mm PPi (data not shown). 2-Deoxy-d-Glc-6-P, which is a weak substrate for Glc-6-Pase in intact microsomes (31Arion W.J. Wallin B.K. Carlson P.W. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2558-2565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also was relatively ineffective in blocking3H-S 5627 binding (Fig. 3). Fig. 1 documents that treatment with Chaps abolished the inhibitory potency of S 5627. Thus S 5627 has no affect on Glc-6-P binding to the catalytic site on the enzyme. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 directly addressed the question of whether membrane permeabilization with 0.3% Chaps also abolished S 5627 binding or the ability of Glc-6-P to block S 5627 binding. The results are definitive; Binding to Chaps-disrupted microsomes was essentially unchanged from that observed for control microsomes, and Glc-6-P was still effective in preventing S 5627 binding. After disruption, 2-deoxy-d-Glc-6-P was hydrolyzed at a rate equivalent to Glc-6-Pase (results not shown, but see Ref. 31Arion W.J. Wallin B.K. Carlson P.W. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2558-2565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet, in contrast to Glc-6-P, 2-deoxy-d-Glc-6-P remained ineffective in preventing binding of 3H-S 5627. The combination of binding and inhibition data presented here constitute compelling proof that two independent Glc-6-P binding sites are involved in the hydrolysis of Glc-6-P by intact microsomes. In intact microsomes Glc-6-P hydrolysis is effectively inhibited when S 5627 binds to the high affinity binding site, S1. Significantly, the relative potency of the phosphate compounds in interfering with the binding of S 5627 mirrors the substrate and inhibitor specificity of the Glc-6-Pase activity in intact microsomes (4Arion W.J.

In Chaps-disrupted microsomes, Glc-6-P is hydrolyzed at a site that is unaffected by S 5627 or other chlorogenic acid derivatives (16Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Ramos F.C. Schindler P.W.

Schubert G. Below P. Herling A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In terms of the substrate transport model, Glc-6-P binding to S1 is equivalent to Glc-6-P binding to T1, and Glc-6-P binding to the S 5627-insensitive site is equivalent to to Glc-6-P binding to the enzyme. The identity and function of the lower affinity site, S2, is unknown. Proponents of the combined conformational flexibility-substrate-transport model for Glc-6-Pase have argued (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Ajzannay A. Mithieux G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that detergent treatment prevents a hysteretic transformation that is purported to occur in intact microsomes within the early seconds of the assay and that presumably involves a transformation of the enzyme from a conformer possessing the high catalytic turnover, seen in detergent-disrupted microsomes, to the lower activity conformer seen during steady-state hydrolysis in intact microsomes. The conformational model posits that Glc-6-P hydrolysis involves a single Glc-6-P binding site that may exist in a high specificity conformation in untreated microsomes under steady-state conditions (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ajzannay A. Mithieux G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and in a low specificity conformation in detergent-treated microsomes (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the early seconds of assay preceding the hysteretic transformation (32Ajzannay A. Mithieux G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus the finding that Chaps and other membrane-permeabilizing agents (see below) do not abolish either the high affinity binding site for3H-S 5627 or the ability of Glc-6-P to competitively block3H-S 5627 binding at this site allows a definitive choice between the substrate and group translocation models of Glc-6-Pase. The present data demonstrate unequivocally that the broadening of substrate specificity and increased activity that follows exposure to detergents and other membrane disruptive agents (31Arion W.J. Wallin B.K. Carlson P.W. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2558-2565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not involve a change, conformational or otherwise, in the site to which Glc-6-Pinitially binds to facilitate its eventual hydrolysis. Indeed, the properties of the binding site for Glc-6-P and3H-S 5627 and the properties of the site that imposes substrate and inhibitor specificity on Glc-6-Pase (4Arion W.J. Wallin B.K. Lange A.J.

Wallin B.K. Carlson P.W. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2558-2565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are in fact retained following Chaps exposure. Accordingly, the present results do not support the notion of a conformational transition from a catalytically constrained but highly specific enzyme to a more active but less specific conformation. Moreover, the present results gain critical support from the earlier finding that the catalytic turnover number of the enzyme is the same in intact and detergent-disrupted microsomes (33Countaway J.L. Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This earlier finding is direct evidence that under steady-state conditions no “constraint” is imposed on the hydrolytic site in intact microsomes (7Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1993; 152: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The functional effect of detergent treatment, then, is to “uncouple” the Glc-6-P phosphohydrolase activity from a required interaction of Glc-6-P with the S 5627-sensitive site, S1. Uncoupling involves abolition of the kinetic restrictions imposed by substrate transport by making the membrane freely permeable to and thereby providing the catalytic site unencumbered access to Glc-6-P or alternative substrates, like 2-deoxy-d-Glc-6-P and mannose-6-phosphate (5Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10396-10406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arion W.J. Canfield W.K. Eur. J.

In addition to the presence of two distinct binding sites for Glc-6-P, the existence of an intramicrosomal pool of Glc-6-P is a distinctive feature of the substrate transport model. In 1977 Ballas and Arion (27Ballas L.M. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8512-8518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used rapid sedimentation of microsomes through silicone fluid layers to measure the intramicrosomal pool of Glc-6-P and demonstrated that its magnitude depended in a predictable way on the activity of the enzyme, i.e. the luminal pool was “metabolically active,” as required by the substrate transport hypothesis (4Arion W.J. Wallin B.K. Lange A.J. Ballas L.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1975; 6: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Arion W.J. Lange A.J. Walls H.E. Ballas L.M. J. Biol.

This essential feature was confirmed by Banhegyi et al. (34Banhegyi G. Marcolongo P. Fulceri R. Hinds C. Burchell A. Benedetti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13584-13590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in a recent investigation in which they employed somewhat different experimental methodologies. The present findings combined with these measurements of intramicrosomal Glc-6-P provide strong direct evidence for the involvement of Glc-6-P transport during Glc-6-P hydrolysis by liver microsomes. In the face of compelling support for the role of Glc-6-P transport in the hydrolysis of Glc-6-P by intact microsomes, how do we account for the apparently strong kinetic evidence against this view (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14St-Denis J.-F. Comte B. Nguyen D.K. Seidman E. Paradis K. Levy E. van de Werve G. J. Clin.

The experimental support for the combined conformational flexibility-substrate-transport model of Glc-6-Pase rests almost entirely on the results of an examination of the kinetics of Glc-6-Pase activity during the early seconds following initiation of the hydrolytic reaction (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ajzannay A. Mithieux G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 326: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These data purport to show a “burst” in activity during the first 5–10 s, which is equal in its initial velocity to the steady-state rate observed with detergent-treated microsomes. Within 10 s the rate slows as a consequence, it is argued, of a hysteretic transition to the lower activity, high specificity conformation. This kinetic behavior is contrary to what is expected for transport-dependent hydrolysis, wherein a presteady-state delay in activity rather than the burst is predicted. We have examined in detail the kinetics of Glc-6-Pase during the early seconds of the reaction,2 and we have consistently failed to see either a burst of activity or any indication of a slowing in rate to a new steady-state, i.e. a hysteretic transformation. Moreover, the substantial difference in initial rate observed at steady-state between intact and disrupted microsomes is observed at the earliest time, i.e. by 2 s. However, in contrast to these results, which involved the use of harsh protein denaturants to rapidly stop the hydrolysis reaction (22Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 174: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Countaway J.L. Waddell I.D. Burchell A. Arion W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2673-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when the 0.3 n zinc sulfate solution used by others (13Berteloot A. Vidal H. van de Werve G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5497-5507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14St-Denis J.-F. Comte B. Nguyen D.K. Seidman E. Paradis K. Levy E. van de Werve G. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Biophys. 1996; 326: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was employed as the stop reagent, the progress curves gave the appearance of the burst in assays of intact but not disrupted microsomes. This and other observations lead us to conclude that the burst is a highly reproducible artifact caused by the relatively long quench time (viz. about 5 s) for zinc sulfate in intact microsomes. We have examined S 5627 binding following other modes of membrane permeabilization. Exposure to 0.1 n NH4OH, which also fully activates Glc-6-Pase (26Arion W.J. Carlson P.W. Wallin B.K. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2551-2557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Stetten M.R. Burnett F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 128: 344-350Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), had essentially no effect on high affinity binding. In contrast, disruption with 0.1% Triton X-100 significantly depressed the concentration of S1 binding sites and decreased binding affinity. The latter observation provides an explanation for the inhibition of Glc-6-Pase that is observed at low concentrations of Triton X-100 (9Stetten M.R. Burnett F.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 139: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), sodium taurocholate (35Wallin B.K. Arion W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and perhaps other agents such as fatty acids and long chain fatty acyl-CoA esters (36Nordlie R.C. Hanson T.L. Johns P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4144-4148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Fulceri R. Gamberucci A. Scott H.M. Giunti R. Burchell A. Benedetti A. Biochem.

The existence of a site-specific probe of Glc-6-P binding to T1 provides a valuable new tool to investigate Glc-6-Pase. Among the many potential applications of this reagent is that it provides a direct assay to follow the isolation and purification of the T1 protein, and thus it offers the hope that this evasive protein may soon be identified."

The gene encodes a protein of 566 residues (62,487 Da), with 43–44% sequence identity to the large subunit of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) from S. cinnamonensis and Propionibacterium shermanii.

Several polyketide antibiotic-producing streptomycetes have been shown to promote the interconversion of n- and isobutyrate. The best studied example is Streptomyces cinnamonensis, the producer of the commercially important polyether antibiotic monensin A (1Reynolds K.A. O'Hagan D. Gani D. Robinson J.A. J. Chem. Soc.

At the same time, ICM from S. cinnamonensiswas shown to catalyze the interconversion of isobutyryl- and n-butyrylcarba(dethia)-CoA analogues (Fig. 1). These analogues are stable toward hydrolysis, thereby facilitating estimation of the equilibrium constant for this rearrangement, which was found to be ≈1.3 in favor of isobutyrylcarba(dethia)-CoA. The reaction catalyzed by ICM is very similar to that of the well known and widely distributed MCM (3Rétey J. Dolphin D. B12. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 357-379Google Scholar). In both reactions, a COSCoA group migrates to an adjacent methyl, and a hydrogen atom is transferred in the reverse direction predominantly with retention of configuration (1Reynolds K.A. O'Hagan D.

Davis N.K. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), comprising a heterodimer with subunits of ≈65 and ≈79 kDa. The human and mouse MCMs are both homodimers with a subunit size of ≈75 kDa (8Ledley F.D. Lumetta M. Nguyen P.N. Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Like the P. shermanii MCM, the S. cinnamonensis MCM does not catalyze the interconversion of n- and isobutyryl-CoA at a detectable rate (2Brendelberger G. Retey J. Ashworth D.M. Reynolds K. Willenbrock F. Robinson J.A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1988; 27: 1089-1090Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The structure determination of the cobalamin-binding domain of methionine synthase, a member of the methyl transferase family, revealed for the first time a protein-bound form of methylcobalamin, a vitamin B12 derivative (11Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The cobalamin was shown bound to the protein with a histidine residue providing an axial imidazole ligand to Co3+, replacing the dimethylbenzimidazole appended to the corrin ring. Stupperich et al. (12Stupperich E. Eisinger H.J. Albracht S.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) had shown earlier that protein-bound cobamides can have a histidine ligand. This key histidine residue in methionine synthase is found in a motif DXHXXG, which is conserved in some (but not all) of the coenzyme B12-dependent mutases (13Marsh E.N.G. Holloway D.E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A similar coordination of coenzyme B12 by histidine was also implicated in coenzyme B12 bound to MCM (14Padmakumar R. Taoka S. Padmakumar R. Banerjee R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7033-7034Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure of the heterodimeric MCM from P. shermanii was reported (15Mancia F. Keep N.H. Nakagawa A. Leadlay P.F. McSweeney S. Rasmussen B. Bösecke P. Diat O. Evans P.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 339-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This revealed an active site, inaccessible to solvent, that is embedded along the axis of a (β/α)8-barrel domain in the large subunit. Coenzyme B12 is sandwiched on one end of the β/α-barrel, between this and a C-terminal domain with a fold similar to those of flavodoxin and the cobalamin-binding domain of methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (11Drennan C.L. Huang S. Drummond J.T. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Apart from illuminating many important aspects of substrate and coenzyme binding to MCM, this structure also confirmed the coordination of cobalt by the histidine in the conserved DXHXXG motif within the C-terminal flavodoxin-like, coenzyme B12binding domain. We report here our efforts to purify ICM from S. cinnamonensis, which have led to the cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding its large subunit, denoted here icmA. This gene was used to produce a recombinant protein in Streptomyces lividans and Escherichia coli with a His6tag fused to the N terminus. We also show that this recombinant protein can be used to isolate an additional small subunit of the enzyme present in S. lividans and S. cinnamonensis. This work has also allowed a comparison of the primary sequences of ICM and MCM large subunits, with unexpected implications regarding the mode of coenzyme B12 binding to ICM. The assay used for ICM is essentially that described previously (6Birch A. Leiser A. Robinson J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3511-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). S. cinnamonensis A3823.5 (a high yield monensin-producing strain kindly made available by Lilly (17Stark W.M. Knox N.G. Westhead J.E. Antimicrob.

J. 1989; 261: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cell paste (500–600 g per fermentation) could be stored at −70 °C over several weeks without substantial loss of ICM activity. Buffers were prepared as follows: buffer A, potassium phosphate (50 mm, pH 7.4) with EDTA (5 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (0.05% v/v), and glycerol (5% v/v); buffer B, same as buffer A with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), benzamidine (1 mm), glycerol (total 20% v/v), and activated charcoal (20 g/liter); buffer C, same as buffer A with KCl (1.0 m); buffer D, same as buffer A with KCl (0.1 m) and Tris-HCl (0.1 m); buffer E, same as buffer A but with 20% glycerol; buffer F, Tris-HCl (250 mm, pH 8.3), glycine (1.92m); buffer G, Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 8.2), NaCl (1.0 m), CaCl2 (2.0 mm), and MeCN (10%); buffer H, same as buffer A with Tris-HCl (0.15 m); buffer I, sodium acetate (0.1 m, pH 4) and NaCl (0.5m); buffer J, Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 8) and NaCl (0.5 m); buffer K, potassium phosphate (50 mm, pH 7.4), KCl (300 mm), glycerol (5% v/v), imidazole (20 mm), β-mercaptoethanol (0.05% v/v), benzamidine (1 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm); buffer L, same as buffer K except imidazole (300 mm); buffer M, potassium phosphate (50 mm, pH 7.4), β-mercaptoethanol (0.05% v/v), dithiothreitol (1 mm); buffer N, potassium phosphate (50 mm, pH 7.4), KCl (150 mm). A vitamin B12 affinity column (19Allen R.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7695-7701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yamada R.-H. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6266-6270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared as follows. Vitamin B12 (130 mg) in aqueous HCl (0.5 m, 46 ml) was stirred at 37 °C for 3 h. The solution was neutralized with aqueous NH3and applied to a column of Alumina N (2 × 36 cm, ICN, Germany). After eluting unchanged vitamin B12, partially hydrolyzed cobalamins were eluted with aqueous NH3 (0.2m). After lyophilization, these were applied in water to Q-Sepharose (1.6 × 20 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and monocarboxylic acids were separated from di- and tricarboxylic acids by elution with a gradient from 0.2 m triethylamine, pH 11, to 0.2 m triethylamine, 0.5 m acetic acid, pH 1. TLC on cellulose plates (eluting with sec-butyl alcohol/acetic acid/water (127:1:50)) was used to monitor this separation (Rf (B12) = 0.5, Rf (monocarboxylic acids) = 0.6). Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of the monocarboxylic acid fraction gavem/z = 1356.3 (M+). The monocarboxylic acids (16 mg) were then coupled over 16 h to EAH-Sepharose (5 ml, Pharmacia) usingN-ethyl, N′-(3-dimethylaminoisopropyl)carbodiimide and protocols recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia). The gel was then washed with water, with buffer I, then buffer J, and finally with water. Ultrasonic disruption of cell paste (≈500 g) in buffer B (750 ml) was carried out over 15 min at 4–10 °C, and then solids were removed by centrifugation (27,500 × g for 45 min). Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 35% saturation at 4 °C and pH 7.5. After centrifugation (47,800 ×g, 1 h) and filtration through glass wool, ammonium sulfate was added to 75% saturation. Centrifugation (47,800 ×g for 1 h) afforded a protein pellet (Table I), which could be stored at −80 °C over several months.Table IPurification of ICM from extracts of S. cinnamonensisPurification stepProtein1-aAmount of protein available following each step, starting from ∼500 g (wet weight) cell paste.Isobutyrate1-bThe concentration of isobutyrate attained at the end of the assay is calculated by comparison to the amount of n-valeric acid in the EtOAc extract.

Open table in a new tab Protein from above (≈5 g wet weight) was applied to DEAE-Sepharose (2.6 × 45 cm, Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a gradient (0–100% buffer C) over 500 ml at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. ICM appeared in the eluate at ≈ 92–100% buffer C. The active fractions containing ≈300 mg of protein were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10, Amicon). Protein from the foregoing step (in 3 batches, total ≈1.0 g) was applied to a column of Q-Sepharose (2.6 × 15 cm, Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a gradient (0–50% buffer C) over 540 ml at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. ICM eluted at ≈34–42% buffer C, whereas MCM eluted at ≈47–50% buffer C. The fractions containing ICM were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon-10, Amicon). The active protein from the preceding step (6 × 20-mg batches) was applied to a Hiload 16/60 Superdex-200 column (≈120-ml bed volume, Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with buffer D and eluted (0.3 ml/min) with buffer D. ICM eluted at ≈69–75 ml. Continuous preparative native gel electrophoresis was performed with a model 491 Prep-Cell (Bio-Rad). Protein from the preceding step (20 mg) was applied in buffer E (3 ml) to a gel comprising a stacking layer (5.25% acrylamide) followed by the fractionating gel (8% acrylamide). Electrophoresis (at 40 mA) was performed using buffer F as running buffer at 4 °C. Proteins eluted from the gel were diverted to a fraction collector. Protein from the previous step (2.5 mg) was applied to affinity resin (1 ml, see above) in buffer A. The column was then eluted with a KCl gradient (10–100% buffer C). ICM appeared from the column at ≈0.2 m KCl. This fraction showed a major protein band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), with apparent mass of ≈65 kDa and several minor components of lower mass. The ICM-containing protein from above (≈200 μg) was electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE (12%, 10 × 10-cm gel), electroblotted onto a cationic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon CD, Millipore), and visualized by negative staining (Quickstain, Zoion Research). The membrane spot containing the adsorbed protein (of ≈65 kDa) was cut out and incubated in buffer G (10 μl) with trypsin (0.3 μg, Promega) for 15 h at 37 °C. Free peptides were washed from the membrane with 10% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (1 μl) and 10% aqueous MeCN with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10 μl). The peptides were analyzed by microbore high pressure liquid chromatography (C8 column, 300 ≈ pore size, 1 × 250 mm, Vydac) eluting with a gradient of 2–80% v/v MeCN in water, with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The eluate was split; 90% was collected, and the remainder was analyzed by electrospray-mass spectrometry. Selected fractions were subjected to sequence analysis using the automated Edman method (Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer) (see legend to Fig. 4). The following oligonucleotides were designed for the PCR using peptide sequences PAYKPLSV and TQTAGVSL determined as described above (see Fig. 4): KB1, 5′-CCGGC(G/C)TACAAGCCCCTCTCGG-3′; KB2, 5′-CAGCGA(G/C)ACGCCCGCTGTCTGCGT-3′. PCR amplification was carried out in the recommended buffer (VentTM; 100 μl) under mineral oil containing the following: dNTPs (200 μm), KB1 and KB2 primers (0.5 μm), S. cinnamonensis DNA (10 ng, see below), VentTM DNA polymerase (2 units). The reactions were performed using a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermal cycler as follows: 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. After 30 cycles, the PCR product (≈310 bp) was gel-purified and cloned into SmaI-digested M13mp18 (21Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst .). 1985; 33: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) and sequenced. The S. cinnamonensis DNA was prepared by digesting genomic DNA (10 μg) with EcoRI, BamHI, PstI, BglII, and SmaI, precipitating with EtOH, and redissolving in TE (100 μl). DNA (1 μg) was then denatured in water (32 μl) by addition of 4 m NaOH, 4 mm EDTA (8 μl) for 10 min (22Agarwal R.K. Perl A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5283-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After addition of sodium acetate (3m, 7 μl, pH 4.8) and water (4 μl), the DNA was precipitated with EtOH and redissolved in water (100 μl). General DNA manipulation was performed in E. coli(23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar, 24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and in Streptomyces according to Ref. 25Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar. S. cinnamonensis genomic DNA was partially digested with Sau3A, fractionated by sucrose density centrifugation, and fragments of ≈15 kb were ligated between the BamHI/SalI sites in λEMBL4 DNA (26Frischauf A.M. Lehrach H. Poutska A. Murray N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 170: 827-842Crossref Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Recombinant λEMBL4 clones were isolated from this library by plaque hybridization using the ≈310-bp PCR product as probe DNA. A 7.6-kbBamHI fragment containing the icmA gene was isolated from one λ clone and ligated into BamHI-digested pUC18, to afford pOCI602 (Fig. 3). A 3.75-kb BamHI/BglII fragment from this region was ligated in both orientations into BamHI-cut pUC18 to afford pOCI609 and pOCI613. Similarly, a 4.1-kbBamHI/SphI fragment from pOCI602, after end-filling with PolIk, was ligated into SmaI-digested pUC18 to afford pOCI611 and pOCI612 (Fig. 3). The plasmids pOCI609, pOCI611, pOCI612, and pOCI613 were used to determine the 4.3-kb nt sequence shown in Fig. 4, on both DNA strands, by the dideoxy method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar) using dye terminator chemistry (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence information has been submitted to the EMBL-GenBankTM data base, accession number U67612. A BstEII/BamHI fragment containing the icmA gene was isolated from pOCI611, filled-in with PolIk, and cloned into the SmaI site of a pUC18 derivative lacking an SacI site, to give pOCI641. The pUC18 derivative was made by digesting pUC18 with SacI, digesting with PolI, and re-ligating. In this way, a unique SacI site is available close to the center of icmA (cf. Fig. 3 and Fig. 6). A BglII/BamHI fragment including the hygB gene was isolated from pIJ963 (28Lydiate D.J. Ashby A.M. Henderson D.J. Kieser H.M. Hopwood D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 941-955Google Scholar) and, after filling ends with PolIk, was inserted into the PolI-digested SacI site in pOCI641 to give pOCI642. In this way, hygB is inserted into the unique SacI site in icmA. The disrupted icmA gene was then recovered by partial digestion with EcoRI/HindIII, end-filled with PolIk, and cloned into the PolIk-filled BamHI site in pGM160 (29Muth G. Nussbaumer B. Wohlleben W. Pühler A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 341-348Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar), to give pOCI643. However, the resulting plasmid could not be introduced into S. cinnamonensis. To improve stability of the construct in Streptomyces, the entire E. coli sequences were deleted by digesting pOCI643 with EcoRI/HindIII, end-filling with PolIk, and religation. The resulting plasmid was passaged through S. lividans 1326, then denatured using the procedure of Oh and Chater (30Oh S.H. Chater K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 122-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and used to transform S. cinnamonensis to HmR and TsR by selection on R5 agar plates (25Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar) at 30 °C. The transformant was then grown in liquid YEME medium (25Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar) with Hm at 39 °C and then plated onto R5 agar medium with Hm at 39 °C. After sporulation, relica-plating separately to R5 with Ts, and R5 with Hm, gave several TsS HmRtransformants, one of which was selected for further investigation. Southern blotting (Fig. 6) demonstrated that the icmA gene in this transformant had been inactivated by insertion of the hygB gene. No ICM activity was observed in cell extracts of the mutant grown in the usual way. The icmA gene was amplified by PCR using the following primers (NdeI and BamHI sites are underlined): KB3, 5′-CCATGGATCCTCAGAACCCGGGCGGCTCCAC-3′; KB4, 5′-GCTACATATGGACGCTGACGCGATCGAGGAAGG-3′. A PCR was performed with primers KB3 and KB4 (1.0 μm), dNTPs (440 μm), and denatured template DNA (pOCI612, 0.5 μg), using the conditions described above. The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and cloned between the NdeI/BamHI sites in the plasmid pET3a (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) to give plasmid pOCI614. The correctness of the icmA nt sequence in this plasmid was proven by DNA sequencing. The gene was then excised by digestion with NdeI and BamHI and cloned between the NdeI/BamHI sites in the plasmids pIJ4123 (32Takano E. White J. Thompson C.J. Bibb M.J. Gene (Amst .). 1995; 166: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and pET14b (Novagen) to afford plasmids pOCI633 and pOCI640, respectively. Plasmid pOCI614 was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). After growth in LB medium (200 ml) with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 30 °C and induction atA 600 = 0.7 with 0.4 mm IPTG, cells were shaken for a further 4 h at 30 °C, then collected, washed, and sonicated in buffer A. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, IcmA was purified by chromatography on Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) with buffer A and a gradient of 0–100% KCl (0.5m). After dialysis against buffer A, gel filtration (TSK G3000SW) with buffer A afforded IcmA (4.3 mg) which was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and gave the expected N-terminal amino acid sequence. Plasmid pOCI640 was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. After growth in LB medium (4 liters) with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 30 °C and induction atA 600 = 0.6 with IPTG (0.1 mm), cells were shaken for a further 4 h at 30 °C, then collected, washed, and sonicated in buffer K. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the protein was applied in portions to Ni2+-NTA resin (3 × 1.5 cm, Pharmacia) and washed with buffer K, and His6-IcmA was eluted with buffer L and then dialyzed against buffer M. Chromatography on MonoQ with buffer M and a gradient of 0–100% KCl (1 m) afforded His6-IcmA (30 mg) which was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7). Plasmid pOCI633 was introduced into S. lividans 1362 (25Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich1985Google Scholar). After growth in YEME (5 liters) with kanamycin (5 μg/ml) at 30 °C to an A 600 of 0.7–1.0, the cultures were induced with Ts (5 μg/ml). After a further 12–15 h the cells were collected and sonicated in buffer K; cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and His6-IcmA was purified as above (yield 16 mg). S. lividans 1362[pOCI633] was grown in YEME (5 liters) and induced with Ts, as described above. The cells were sonicated in buffer K; cell debris was removed; coenzyme B12 (10 μm) was added, and the protein (∼1.6 g) was chromatographed in portions on Ni2+-NTA resin (3 × 1.5 cm) in the dark. The resin was washed with buffer K containing coenzyme B12 (10 μm), before eluting with buffer L and dialyzing against buffer M (yield 24 mg). The sample was applied to MonoQ with buffer M containing coenzyme B12 (10 μm), washed with buffer M (no coenzyme B12), and eluted with a gradient of 0–100% KCl (1 m) to give a fraction containing mainly His6-IcmA (16 mg, eluting at 270 mm KCl), followed by a pink colored protein (2.5 mg, eluting at 370 mm KCl) with high ICM activity and a UV spectrum with an absorption maximum at 525 nm. The pink colored protein was dialyzed against buffer M, applied to MonoQ, and eluted in buffer M with a gradient of 0–100% KCl (1 m). The small subunit IcmB (∼4 μg) eluted as a sharp peak at 200 mm KCl and was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 7). S. cinnamonensis was grown for 3–4 days at 30 °C in YEME (5 liters) supplemented with valine (6.6 g/liter). The cells were collected and sonicated in buffer K, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (yield 1.8 g of protein). To this was added recombinant His6-IcmA (29 mg), prepared as described above, and coenzyme B12 (10 μm). The protein was chromatographed in portions on Ni2+-NTA resin (3 × 1.5 cm) in the dark. The resin was washed with buffer K containing coenzyme B12 (10 μm), before eluting with buffer L and dialyzing against buffer M (yield 22 mg). The sample was chromatographed on MonoQ, as described above for IcmB from S. lividans. The protein fraction eluting at ∼300 mmKCl (15 mg) contained mainly His6-IcmA, whereas fractions containing the holoenzyme (4.5 mg) eluted at ∼350 mm KCl and were dialyzed against buffer M. The protein was then applied to a gel filtration column (Superose 12, Pharmacia) and eluted at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with buffer N. A peak containing IcmB (∼2 μg) eluted with an apparent mass of ∼16–18 kDa (Fig. 7). This protein showed no ICM activity until both IcmA and coenzyme B12were added (Fig. 8). The ICM assay involves hydrolyzing CoA thioesters at the end of the reaction, extraction of n- and isobutyric acids into ethyl acetate, and quantification by GC. Typical GC chromatograms from assays performed with recombinant ICM (see above) are shown in Fig. 8. To aid in the quantification of isobutyrate formed, a known amount of valeric acid was added to each assay as an internal standard. The ICM was purified as outlined in Table I. The MCM and ICM activities were separated by Q-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography, with ICM eluting in the middle and"
https://openalex.org/W2027931495,"Erythrocyte protein 4.1 has been hypothesized to link the spectrin-actin junctional complex directly to the cytoplasmic domain of glycophorin C, but this bridging function has never been directly demonstrated. Because an alternative protein-mediated bridge between the junctional complex and the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 is also plausible, we have undertaken to characterize the membrane sites to which protein 4.1 can anchor the spectrin and actin skeleton. We demonstrate that proteolytic removal of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 has minimal effect on the ability of protein 4.1 to promote125I-labeled spectrin and actin binding to KI-stripped erythrocyte membrane vesicles. We also show that quantitative blockade of all band 3 sites with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to band 3 is equally ineffective in preventing protein 4.1-mediated association of spectrin and actin with the membrane. In contrast, obstruction of protein 4.1 binding to its docking site on the cytoplasmic pole of glycophorin C is demonstrated to reduce the same protein 4.1 bridging function by ∼85%. We conclude from these data that (i) glycophorin C contributes the primary anchoring site of the protein 4.1-mediated bridge to the spectrin-actin skeleton; (ii) band 3 is incapable of serving the same function; and (iii) additional minor protein 4.1 bridging sites may exist on the human erythrocyte membrane.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, defects in the structure or level of expression of protein 4.1 in erythrocytes result in fragile, abnormally shaped cells (17Lorenzo F. Venezia N.D. Morle L. Baklouti F. Alloisio N.

More importantly, when membrane mechanical instability arises from the absence of protein 4.1, the membrane fragility can be corrected by resealing either intact protein 4.1 or its spectrin-actin binding domain into the defective erythrocytes (20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its association with spectrin and actin, protein 4.1 also interacts with at least two prominent integral proteins of the red cell membrane. The more avid of these membrane ligands is glycophorin C, which binds protein 4.1 with a KD ∼50 nm and provides up to 13 of its total anchoring sites on KI-IOVs 1The abbreviations used are: KI-IOVs, KI-stripped inside-out vesicles; IOVs, inside-out vesicles. 1The abbreviations used are: KI-IOVs, KI-stripped inside-out vesicles; IOVs, inside-out vesicles.

P55, a protein comprised of several classical signal transduction domains (24Ruff P. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 88: 6595-6599Google Scholar, 25Kim A.C. Metzenberg A.B. Sahr K.E.

Of lower affinity than glycophorin C is the interaction of protein 4.1 with band 3, the anion transport protein that also links ankyrin to the red cell membrane. Band 3 associates with protein 4.1 approximately 30-fold less avidly than glycophorin C; however, the anion transporter may also provide up to twice the number of membrane binding sites as glycophorin C (23Gascard P. Cohen C.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10990-10996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to glycophorin C and band 3, protein 4.1 is also known to interact with anionic lipids, especially phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (31Rybicki A.C. Heath R. Lubin B. Schwartz R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 32Cohen A.M. Liu S.C. Lawler J. Derick L.H. Palek J.

Nature. 1985; 318: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). With both the lipid bilayer and membrane skeletal attachment sites for protein 4.1 established, the question naturally arises as to which protein 4.1 sites can be simultaneously occupied, i.e. from which membrane sites might protein 4.1 form a bridge to the spectrin-actin skeleton. Evidence in support of a glycophorin C linkage to the membrane skeleton includes the following: (i) retention of glycophorin C in detergent-extracted membrane skeletons correlates with the content of protein 4.1 in the same skeletons under a variety of conditions (36Mueller T.J. Morrison M. Kruckenberg W. Eaton J. Brewer G. Erythrocyte Membranes: Clinical and Experimental Advances. 2. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1986: 95-108Google Scholar, 37Reid M.E. Takakuwa Y. Conboy J. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1990; 75: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) addition of protein 4.1 to protein 4.1-deficient erythrocytes converts glycophorin C from a detergent-soluble membrane protein to a skeletally linked membrane protein (37Reid M.E. Takakuwa Y. Conboy J. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1990; 75: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) migration of glycophorin C in membrane distentions of protein 4.1-deficient cells follows the behavior of a freely diffusing membrane protein, whereas migration in similar tethers of normal membranes conforms to the distribution pattern of the spectrin-actin skeleton (38Discher D.E. Mohandas N. Evans E.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data argue that some type of protein 4.1-mediated bridge between glycophorin C and the spectrin-actin skeleton must exist. Nevertheless, the hypothesized physical linkage has never been directly demonstrated in any defined biochemical system. Data exploring the possible role of band 3 in anchoring a protein 4.1 bridge to the membrane skeleton are essentially nonexistent. Analogous studies on the migration and extractability of band 3 in protein 4.1-deficient membranes are obviously meaningless, because band 3 is independently linked via ankyrin to the spectrin-actin skeleton (1Bennett V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no direct binding studies have ever been conducted to examine whether band 3-linked protein 4.1 can simultaneously bind spectrin and actin. Consequently, we have undertaken to characterize the direct protein 4.1-mediated bridging of spectrin-actin complexes to band 3 and glycophorin C in KI-stripped inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles. We report here that glycophorin C, as expected, constitutes the primary attachment site of the protein 4.1-tethered spectrin-actin skeleton. We also demonstrate that band 3 is unable to serve an analogous bridging function. Protein 4.1 was purified by a novel purification protocol (39Workman R.F. Low P.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 11 (in press)Google Scholar) based on the method of Tyler et al. (40Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W.R. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Spectrin and actin were extracted from red cell membranes using low ionic strength buffer, as described by Bennett (41Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 316-318Google Scholar), except the membranes were prepared in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Spectrin and actin were subsequently concentrated by dehydration through a dialysis membrane against polyethylene glycol, and the concentrated proteins were labeled with125I Bolton-Hunter reagent (see below). Spectrin and actin were then transferred to binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 130 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) and stored at 4 °C until used. IOVs were prepared essentially as described elsewhere (41Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 316-318Google Scholar), except during removal of spectrin and actin the IOVs were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a minimum of 100 volumes of extraction buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.0). KI-stripped IOVs were prepared, when desired, by incubating the IOVs at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 volumes of KI buffer (2 m KI, 25 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) prior to dilution with an equal volume of double distilled water and centrifugation at 23,400 × g for 1 h. The resulting membranes were washed two times with lysis buffer (5 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) before resuspension in binding buffer. Membranes showed no aggregation upon resuspension in binding buffer. All125I-labeled proteins were prepared by the method of Bennett (41Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 316-318Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, spectrin and actin were labeled in labeling buffer (20 mmNa2HPO4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) at a concentration of 8.2 mg/ml. Following labeling, the proteins were extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against binding buffer to remove unreacted label. Protein stocks of the appropriate concentration were then prepared by dilution with binding buffer just before use. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against a synthetic glycophorin C peptide comprising residues 85–98, according to published procedures (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The antibody was purified using the synthetic peptide as an affinity ligand. A monoclonal antibody (m00-10) directed against the N-terminal 10 residues of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, and polyclonal antibodies against the entire cytoplasmic domain of band 3 were also prepared, as described previously (43Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific IgG was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation of rabbit preimmune serum followed by DEAE chromatography. For determination of protein 4.1 polymerization with spectrin and actin, 30 μg/ml protein 4.1 was added to increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled spectrin and actin in binding buffer, and the solution was allowed to incubate for 3 h at 4 °C. After layering onto 0.25 ml of a 20% sucrose solution in binding buffer, the 0.4-ml microcentrifuge tubes were centrifuged at 49,000 × g for 40 min. The tubes were then frozen in liquid N2, and the tips containing the pelleted protein complexes were severed and counted in a gamma counter. Measurement of protein 4.1 binding to IOV and KI-IOV membranes was conducted as described above, only increasing concentrations of125I-labeled protein 4.1 were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 50 μg/ml membrane protein prior to separation of the free 125I-protein 4.1 from bound 125I-protein 4.1 on the above sucrose cushion. Evaluation of protein 4.1-mediated bridging of 125I-labeled spectrin and actin to KI-IOVs required a new method for cleanly distinguishing the easily pelleted spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 copolymer (that forms whenever free protein 4.1, spectrin, and actin are present together) from the membrane-associated form of the same ternary complex. Unfortunately, due to the large size heterogeneity of the copolymer population, neither sucrose gradient sedimentation nor gel filtration chromatography was found capable of quantitatively separating bound from free ternary complexes. Therefore, an assay was designed that avoided formation of free spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 copolymer, allowing the membrane-bound spectrin and actin to be quantitated by simple pelleting. For this purpose, KI-IOVs (45 μg/ml) were incubated in binding buffer for 16 h at 4 °C with or without excess competing antibody to band 3 or glycophorin C. Protein 4.1 (50 μg/ml) was then allowed to bind unoccupied sites on these membranes by incubating the protein with the blocked membranes for 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting membranes were washed 3 × in binding buffer followed each time by pelleting for 15 min at 35,000 × g to remove unbound protein 4.1. Quantitative extraction of free protein 4.1 was assured by demonstrating the inability of the final wash supernatant to promote sedimentation of any125I-labeled spectrin and actin. The washed membranes were then incubated for 4 h at 0 °C with 125I-labeled spectrin and actin, after which the membranes were washed twice by centrifugation and counted in a gamma counter to determine the content of bound skeletal complex. Because the functional properties of a protein 4.1 preparation can be measurably affected by contaminating proteins (e.g. p55, Ref. 28Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Stariocoff M.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and denatured or nonfunctional protein 4.1 domains (39Workman R.F. Low P.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 11 (in press)Google Scholar), we felt compelled to establish the functional integrity of the protein 4.1 we had purified before beginning to evaluate its membrane bridging properties. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the protein 4.1 employed in these studies actively polymerizes spectrin and actin (Fig. 1 C, lane D) into pelletable polymers, indicating that the protein 4.1 retains its affinity for the membrane skeleton. The complementary affinity of protein 4.1 for erythrocyte membrane sites is shown in Fig. 1 B, where protein 4.1 is seen to bind KI-IOVs (Fig. 1 C, lane B) with equal affinity to previously published preparations (22Shiffer K.A. Goodman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Gascard P. Cohen C.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reduced binding to nonstripped IOVs (Fig. 1 B) confirms the specificity of the protein 4.1 interaction, since many of the membrane sites in IOVs are occupied by endogenous protein 4.1. To evaluate the ability of protein 4.1 to mediate attachment of the spectrin-actin network to the red cell membrane, protein 4.1 was first allowed to bind KI-stripped IOVs, and after extensive washing to remove unbound protein 4.1, 125I-labeled spectrin and actin (Fig. 1 C, lane D) were added to measure protein 4.1-facilitated binding. As shown in Fig. 2, spectrin and actin associated much more extensively with membranes preincubated with protein 4.1 (solid diamonds) than those lacking protein 4.1 (open diamonds). These observations document biochemically that protein 4.1 can indeed function to bridge the spectrin-actin skeleton to the membrane. To identify the integral membrane protein(s) that participate in the protein 4.1-mediated tether to the spectrin-actin skeleton, several additional studies were conducted. First, the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was proteolytically removed with trypsin, and the above described protein 4.1 binding and bridging functions were again evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3, 125I-protein 4.1 association with the trypsin-cleaved KI-IOVs was reduced to 45% of normal, consistent with earlier observations that band 3 might contribute up to 60% of the sites on KI-stripped erythrocyte membranes (21Danilov Y.N. Fennell R. Ling E. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gascard P. Cohen C.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol.

Importantly, protein 4.1-mediated bridging of the spectrin-actin complex to the same digested membranes was only slightly altered, displaying somewhat reduced binding at high spectrin-actin concentrations but normal binding at lower concentrations (Fig. 2, solid squares). Since >95% of the band 3 was digested in these membrane preparations (Fig. 1 C, lane C), we conclude that band 3 is not a major participant in the protein 4.1-mediated skeletal anchor. To resolve more thoroughly the question of whether band 3 plays even a minor role in anchoring a protein 4.1 bridge to the spectrin-actin network, we directly blocked the protein 4.1 binding sites on band 3 with a monoclonal antibody to the N terminus of band 3, and then we examined the effect of this modification on the interaction of125I-labeled spectrin and actin with the opsonized KI-IOVs. The monoclonal antibody employed in this study (m00-01) has been shown previously to quantitatively prevent protein 4.1 binding to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (44Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, as observed previously for the proteolytically digested KI-IOVs (Fig. 3), the monoclonal Fab reduces 125I-labeled protein 4.1 binding to KI-IOVs to <50% of control values (Fig. 4). Despite this loss of roughly half of the protein 4.1 binding sites on the membrane, no diminution in protein 4.1-mediated attachment of125I-labeled spectrin and actin to the membrane was observed (Fig. 5 A). Rather, the protein 4.1-facilitated spectrin-actin binding to opsonized KI-IOVs matched the binding isotherm of control KI-IOVs. Similar results were also obtained with a polyclonal antibody to the whole cytoplasmic domain of band 3 (Fig. 5 B). Thus, loss of all band 3 sites can be concluded to have no impact on protein 4.1-mediated attachment of the membrane skeleton to the erythrocyte membrane.Figure 5Effect of anti-band 3 antibodies on protein 4.1-mediated binding of 125I-labeled spectrin and actin to KI-IOVs. KI-IOVs were first incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with or without excess competing antibody to the protein 4.1 binding site on band 3. The opsonized KI-IOVs were then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with or without 50 μg/ml protein 4.1, and after thorough washing, they were finally incubated for 4 h at 0 °C with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled spectrin and actin. See “Experimental Procedures” for details.

In this case, the antibody was raised against the amino acid sequence identified by two other groups (27Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 715-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Stariocoff M.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as the protein 4.1 binding site on glycophorin C (Fig. 6 A). Not surprisingly, the antibody competitively displaced ∼27% of protein 4.1 binding to KI-IOVs and ∼66% of the residual protein 4.1 binding to trypsin-digested KI-IOVs (Fig. 3). It can, therefore, be concluded that the antibody effectively prevents protein 4.1 binding to glycophorin C sites on the red cell membrane. In stark contrast to the effect of anti-band 3 antibodies, the anti-glycophorin C antibody also blocked the majority of protein 4.1-mediated 125I-spectrin and actin binding to the red cell membrane (Fig. 6 B). Indeed, ∼85% of all bridging sites on the KI-IOVs were eliminated by anti-glycophorin C opsonization. The conclusion, therefore, follows that glycophorin C serves as the primary anchoring site of protein 4.1-mediated tethers to the spectrin and actin skeleton. However, because ∼15% of protein 4.1-assisted connections to the membrane skeleton consistently survived competition with anti-glycophorin C, we also propose that an unidentified anchor for protein 4.1 may still remain on the red cell membrane. Two lines of evidence were presented to demonstrate that band 3 does not participate in a protein 4.1-mediated bridge to the spectrin-actin skeleton. First, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to band 3 reduced protein 4.1 binding to KI-IOVs by >50% but had no effect on protein 4.1-mediated association of spectrin and actin with the membrane. Second, tryptic removal of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, which reportedly does not cleave glycophorin C (22Shiffer K.A. Goodman S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but may well digest other less prominent protein 4.1 binding sites, reduced protein 4.1-promoted spectrin and actin binding to KI-IOVs only minimally. In fact, in three independent replicates of this experiment, trypsin digestion decreased spectrin and actin binding only at elevated125I-labeled spectrin and actin concentrations, suggesting an unidentified class of lower affinity sites might have been eliminated by the tryptic proteolysis. In this respect, it is interesting to note that protein 4.1-related polypeptides connect CD44 to the cytoskeleton in nonerythroid cells (45Tsukita S.A. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 46Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J.

There are major discrepancies in the literature over the distribution of protein 4.1 binding sites between band 3 and glycophorin C. Hemminget al. (28Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Stariocoff M.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) report that ∼85% of all sites on stripped IOVs reside on glycophorin C. Cohen and co-workers (21Danilov Y.N. Fennell R. Ling E. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Low and co-workers (30Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Workman R.F. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10990-10996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) measure only ∼ 13 of the total sites on glycophorin C, the remainder locating primarily on band 3. Although differences in binding assays could account for part of this variability, the majority of the discrepancy likely derives from differences in the stripping procedures used to remove endogenous protein 4.1 from the membranes. Hemming et al. (28Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Stariocoff M.A. Tanner M.J.A. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5360-5366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) employ 0.1 n NaOH to elute peripheral proteins from their IOV preparations, and although this pH 13 extraction leaves little, if any, peripheral protein on the vesicles, it simultaneously denatures band 3, rendering it incapable of binding ankyrin (47Hargreaves W.R. Giedd K.N. Verkleij A. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11965-11972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or participating in the normal dimer-tetramer association equilibrium, 3H. Van Dort and P. S. Low, personal observations. or even undergoing a normal thermal denaturation transition (48Appell K.C. Low P.S. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The advantage of NaOH stripping is that glycophorin C remains functional, and p55, a protein that enhances the affinity of protein 4.1 for glycophorin C, is quantitatively removed. The alternative stripping procedure, i.e. extraction with KI or KCl, leaves band 3 native but unfortunately fails to quantitatively remove p55. Nevertheless, when the distribution of protein 4.1 binding sites among all membrane proteins is to be measured, a nondenaturing stripping protocol must be applied to ensure that the contributions of labile membrane proteins are fairly considered. Under these conditions, a substantial fraction of the protein 4.1 binding sites on red cell membranes clearly reside on band 3. Given the inability of band 3 to anchor a protein 4.1 linkage to the spectrin-actin network, the question naturally arises as to what purpose the protein 4.1-band 3 association might serve. Our ideas on this matter concur with those of An et al. (49An X.-L. Takakuwa Y. Nunomura W. Manno S. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33187-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, both laboratories have observed that protein 4.1 competes with ankyrin for a site on band 3 (44Lombardo C.R. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9540-9546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49An X.-L. Takakuwa Y. Nunomura W. Manno S. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33187-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because the band 3-ankyrin-spectrin linkage constitutes the major attachment site of the spectrin-actin skeleton to the bilayer, any protein 4.1-mediated displacement of ankyrin might be expected to destabilize the cell. This has indeed been observed (49An X.-L. Takakuwa Y. Nunomura W. Manno S. Mohandas N. J. Biol.

In this scenario, stimuli that displace protein 4.1 from the junctional complex (e.g.cAMP, Refs. 50Eder P.S. Soong C.J. Tao M.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2209-2216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the protein 4.1 to compete with ankyrin for band 3, might be expected to weaken the membrane's structure, whereas stimuli that promote the opposite translocation would be expected to strengthen it (21Danilov Y.N.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10529-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Finally, it should be noted that ∼40% of glycophorin C is free to diffuse laterally in erythrocyte membranes, suggesting that this population of glycophorin C is not skeletally attached (40Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W.R. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Since there are maximally 150,000 copies of glycophorin C per red cell membrane (53Smythe J. Gardner B. Anstee D.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it can be calculated that at most 84,000 of the 200,000 total copies of red cell protein 4.1 will be tethered to glycophorin C. The remainder could be complexed with spectrin-actin but unattached to the lipid bilayer or could be bound to band 3 in place of the usual ankyrin bridge. It would seem, therefore, that protein 4.1 has not evolved to maximize its bridging capabilities to glycophorin C but instead to serve as a broker of membrane stability, where enhanced association with glycophorin C might be induced to increase membrane-skeletal tethers, whereas decreased association with glycophorin C coupled with a rise in interaction with band 3 might be exploited to weaken skeletal interactions. With the many kinases that regulate the association of protein 4.1 with glycophorin C (51Ling E. Danilov Y.N. Cohen C.M. J. Biol.

Insertion of two basic regions and an adjacent glutamic acid residue leads to efficient binding of HL-60 cells and sialyl-Lewisx-conjugated serum albumin. Substitution of glycine for a histidine residue known to stabilize mannose in the binding site of wild type mannose-binding protein results in dramatic loss of affinity for mannose without decreasing binding to sialyl-Lewisx.

Affinity labeling using sialyl-Lewisx in which the sialic acid has been mildly oxidized has been used to verify this switch in specificity and to show that the sialic acid-containing portion of the ligand interacts near the sequence Lys-Lys-Lys corresponding to residues 111–113 of E-selectin. The binding of sialyl-Lewisx-serum albumin is inhibited dramatically at physiological and higher salt concentrations, consistent with a significant electrostatic component to the binding interaction.

The selectin cell adhesion molecules mediate initial binding interactions between moving leukocytes and stationary endothelia (1McEver R.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The interaction of E- and P-selectins on endothelial cells with saccharide ligands on leukocytes represents a well characterized example of a carbohydrate-based cell-cell recognition mechanism. Among the best counter-receptors for the selectins that have been identified to date are derivatives of either the Lewisx trisaccharide, Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc, or of the Lewisatrisaccharide, Galβ1→3(Fucα1→4)GlcNAc, which are sialylated and/or sulfated on the 3 position of the terminal galactose residue (2Rosen S.D. Bertozzi C.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 6: 663-673Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The sugar binding activity of each selectin has been mapped to an NH2-terminal C-type carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) 1The abbreviations used are: CRD, carbohydrate-recognition domain; MBP, mannose-binding protein; sLex, 3′-sialyl-Lewisx tetrasaccharide; BSA, bovine serum albumin. that is homologous to carbohydrate-binding domains in other calcium-dependent animal lectins (3Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The structures of this module and the adjacent epidermal growth factor-like domain have been determined by x-ray crystallography (4Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). No complex with a saccharide ligand has been reported. However, complexes of sugar ligands with CRDs from two other members of the C-type animal lectin family have been deduced by x-ray crystallography (5Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A.

These studies of rat serum and liver mannose-binding proteins (MBPs) reveal that terminal mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, or fucose residues interact directly with the protein as well as indirectly through a bound Ca2+. Modification of a cluster of three lysine residues near the COOH terminus of the E-selectin CRD has been shown to decrease or abolish binding to leukocytic cells as well as to 3′-sialyl-Lewisx(sLex) test ligand (4Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Erbe D.V.

In previous studies, a gain-of-function mutation in the CRD of MBP was created by incorporation of this cluster of basic residues (11Blanck O. Iobst S.T. Gabel C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The resulting chimeric CRD binds to both mannose and to sLex on HL-60 cells and conjugated to BSA. Subsequent structural analysis (12Ng K.K.S. Weis W.I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) revealed that the fucose residue of sLex binds to this mutant CRD in much the same way as mannose binds to the wild type domain, forming direct coordination bonds to Ca2+ and hydrogen bonds to amino acid side chains that serve as additional coordination ligands for this Ca2+. The Lewisxportion of the ligand has the same conformation as observed in solution by NMR studies and in crystals of the free oligosaccharide (for review, see Ref. 13Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but the Gal and GlcNAc residues make only limited contact with the protein. The appended NeuAc residue is rotated approximately 180° from the orientation observed in solution, as predicted from previous transferred NOE analysis of ligand bound to the native E-selectin CRD (13Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This residue does not make direct contact with the protein but is located in the vicinity of the incorporated cluster of lysine residues. To probe further the mechanism of ligand binding to the selectins, additional gain-of-function mutations of MBPs have been created and analyzed. Binding and affinity labeling experiments demonstrate that a switch of preferred ligand can be achieved so that the mutants are closer to the selectins than to the parental MBPs in ligand binding specificity. The effect of changes in the lysine cluster and the sensitivity of binding to salt concentration suggests that electrostatic attractions may play an important role in initiating or stabilizing the binding interaction. Mutant cDNAs were generated by substitution of synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides, purchased from GenoSys or Applied Biosystems, for restriction fragments excised from the wild type cDNA for MBP. The mutations were created in an SacI to BamHI fragment of the cDNA in the vector pGEM-3 (14Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were then transferred into the cDNA in the expression vector pINIIIompA2 containing the wild type CRD (15Drickamer K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 13-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis using a Sequenase II kit from Amersham. Other reagents for molecular biology were purchased from New England BioLabs. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain JA221 grown in the presence of Ca2+ to allow isolation of correctly folded and disulfide-bonded CRD directly from the periplasm. LB medium (500 ml) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin was innoculated with 10 ml of an overnight culture and grown at 23 °C shaking at 200 rpm until the A 550 nm reached 0.8 (6–8 h). After the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 40 μm and CaCl2 to a concentration of 100 mm, incubation was continued at 23 °C for a further 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,600 × g for 10 min in a Beckman JS-4.3 rotor and resuspended in 40 ml of loading buffer (1.25m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8). Sonication was performed with the microprobe of a Branson model 250 sonifier for five bursts of 1 min interspersed with cooling on ice. The extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 11,000 × g in a Beckman JA-21 rotor and then 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Ti55.2 rotor. The final supernatant was passed over a 1-ml column of Man-Sepharose or invertase-Sepharose, which was washed with 5 ml of loading buffer and eluted with 5 aliquots of 0.5 ml of eluting buffer (1.25 mNaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8). Man-Sepharose was prepared by the method of Fornstedt and Porath (16Fornstedt N. Porath J. FEBS Lett. 1975; 57: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and invertase-Sepharose was prepared following exactly the same protocol but substituting a 20% (w/v) solution of yeast invertase, obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, for the mannose. Further purification was performed on a 4.6 × 75-mm C4 reverse phase column (Atlantis series from Phenomenex). Protein in the eluting buffer was loaded directly onto the column in multiple aliquots of 100 μl under starting conditions of 10% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Protein was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile increasing at a rate of 1.25%/min. Fractions were dried for 30 min in a Savant Speed-Vac concentrator to remove acetonitrile and lyophilized. Protein was adjusted to a concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/ml in loading buffer before coating into Immulon 4 Removawell strips from Dynex Technologies. Wells were coated with CRD and blocked with BSA, and HL-60 cell binding assays were conducted as described previously (11Blanck O. Iobst S.T. Gabel C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 125I-sLex-BSA was prepared by the chloramine-T method (17Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar) using 50 μg of sLex-BSA (containing 12.6 mol of conjugated oligosaccharide/mol of BSA; from Oxford GlycoSciences) and 1 mCi of Na125I from Amersham. For standard binding assays, ligand was diluted to a concentration of approximately 1 μg/ml in HEPES-buffered saline (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mmCaCl2, 19 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Ligand solution (50 μl) was incubated in CRD-coated wells for 2 h at room temperature and then removed by aspiration followed by three washes with 200 μl/well HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Separated wells were counted in a Wallac Wizard γ counter. Results reported for both HL-60 cell and S-Lex-BSA binding assays are the average ± S.D. for 3–28 experiments, each performed in triplicate. Background values obtained in the presence of 10 mm EDTA were always less than 1% of values in the absence of EDTA. sLex obtained from Oxford GlycoSciences was labeled with [3H]NaBH4 (NEN Life Science Products) and purified by washing after spotting on Whatman 3MM chromatography paper by published procedures (18Ashford D.A. Dwek R.A. Welply J.K. Amatayakul S. Homans S.W. Lis H. Taylor G.N. Sharon N. Rademacher T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). An aliquot (60 nmol) of lyophilized oligosaccharide was dissolved in 100 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6, containing 5 mm NaIO4 and reacted for 10 min on ice (19van Lenten L. Ashwell G. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 209-211Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 10 mm ethylene glycol followed by further incubation on ice for 10 min. The oxidized oligosaccharide was separated from reagent by chromatography on a 2.5-ml column (0.8 × 5 cm) of Sephadex G-10 eluted with water. Fractions of 100 μl were collected, and eluted oligosaccharide was detected by scintillation counting of 2-μl aliquots. Aliquots of pooled oligosaccharide in approximately 300 μl were mixed immediately with protein (at a concentration of approximately 50 μg/ml) in the presence of 25 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.8, containing 10 mm CaCl2. NaCNBH4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.5 volume of 30% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubation on ice for 10 min. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 ×g and washed twice with 100-μl aliquots of 50:50 ethanol:ether with intermediate spins of 2 min at 16,000 ×g. After drying under vacuum, the protein was dissolved directly in SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, incubated 5 min at 100 °C, and resolved on a 17.5% polyacrylamide gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and then treated by Amplify solution (Amersham) for fluorography. After exposure to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1–8 days, protein on the stained gel and the radioactive bands were quantified using a Bio-Rad model 620 densitometer. Data were imported into the Origin data analysis program (Microcal) for integration. For hydroxylamine treatment, protein at a concentration of approximately 0.4 mg/ml was labeled using a reagent concentration of 60 μm and precipitated as described above. The protein was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 100 mm2-mercaptoethanol and reacted for 30 min at 37 °C. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 70 mm, and alkylation was allowed to proceed for 30 min. After dialysis against two changes of 400 volumes of water, the alkylated protein was lyophilized. Hydoxylamine reagent was prepared at a concentration of 2 min the presence of 2 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.2m potassium carbonate and adjusted to pH 10 with NaOH. Reagent was added directly to the dried protein and incubated for 6 h at 45 °C (21Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Controls were performed by incubation for 6 h at 0 °C and 45 °C in 2 m guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 m potassium carbonate adjusted to pH 10. After incubation, all reactions were dialyzed against two changes of 1,000 volumes of water and lyophilized. Aliquots were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described above. The effects of incorporating three different regions of E-selectin into the CRD of MBP have been investigated previously (11Blanck O. Iobst S.T. Gabel C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The regions, two of which are shown in Fig. 1, were selected based on earlier mutagenesis studies conducted with E-selectin because changes in these regions lead to loss of binding activity (4Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger J.M. Li S. Huang K.-S. Presky D.H. Familletti P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 7Erbe D.V.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14047-14055Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Only region 5, when tested by itself, is able to confer HL-60 cell binding activity onto MBP. In an attempt to improve the binding of MBP to these cells, further chimeras have been constructed in which both regions 4 and 5 are included. Because E- and P-selectin differ substantially in this region, sequences corresponding to both were tested. The results (Table I) indicate that when the three lysine residues of region 5 are present, E-selectin region 4 improves the HL-60 cell binding activity, whereas region 4 of P-selectin actually causes a loss of binding activity.Table IEffect of selectin region 4 and residue 189 on binding activity of MBPPosition 189Region 4HL-60 cell binding125I-S-Lex-BSA binding%%HMBP15 ± 512 ± 1HE-selectin30 ± 821 ± 5HP-selectin6 ± 41 ± 0.2GMBP28 ± 720 ± 1GE-selectin29 ± 912 ± 2GP-selectin20 ± 88 ± 1 Open table in a new tab These results were confirmed using125I-sLex-BSA instead of HL-60 cells as the test ligand. Analysis of the region 5 mutant indicated saturable binding to this ligand (11Blanck O. Iobst S.T. Gabel C. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7289-7292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The limited availability of the test ligand prevented analysis of binding constants for the multiple mutants created in the current study. Instead, binding was assessed at a single, relatively low concentration of ligand in the linear region of the binding curve. Expression of the resulting binding activity as a fraction of the input ligand makes the value independent of fluctuations in test ligand concentration and gives values analogous to those obtained in the HL-60 cell assay. The relative activities of mutants containing the three different sequences in region 4 correspond reasonably well in the two assays (Table I). Structural analysis of the original MBP mutant containing just region 5 revealed that the β-carbon of His189 contacts the fucose that is bound near Ca2+ site 2 much as it interacts with terminal mannose bound to wild type MBP and that the imidazole ring makes contact with the GlcNAc portion of the ligand (12Ng K.K.S. Weis W.I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The position of the His189 side chain in this mutant is illustrated in Fig. 2. The conformation of MBP in the loop containing this residue differs substantially from the corresponding segment of E-selectin such that sugar bound to E-selectin in the observed orientation would not contact this portion of the protein at all. To eliminate the possibility that this contact affects the binding of sLex, the histidine side chain was removed by mutation to glycine. In previous studies with MBP, this change was found to decrease affinity for Man-BSA and α-methyl mannoside (14Iobst S.T. Wormald M.R. Weis W.I. Dwek R.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15505-15511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changing this residue in the mutants containing region 5 also results in loss of mannose binding activity as shown by loss of binding to Man-Sepharose. This loss of activity makes it difficult to purify mutations containing His189 → Gly mutations on Man-Sepharose. However, yeast invertase immobilized on Sepharose retains these mutants effectively. A comparison of wild type and mutant behavior on Man-Sepharose and invertase-Sepharose columns is shown in Fig. 3.Figure 3Gel analysis of wild type and selectin-like mutant of MBP purified on Man- and invertase-Sepharose.Purification of wild type MBP (left) and mutants containing region 5 of E-selectin in the presence of Gly189(right) are shown. Starting material for each preparation was extract prepared from a 500-ml bacterial culture that was applied to 1-ml columns. Columns were eluted with 5 aliquots (0.5 ml) of eluting buffer. Aliquots (20 μl) of fractions 2, 3, and 4 from each column were combined with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (80 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 15% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.006% bromphenol blue), heated to 100 °C, and resolved on a 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) that was visualized with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) CRDs prepared on invertase-Sepharose bind HL-60 cells poorly when these CRDs are coated onto polystyrene. The possibility that some immobilized ligand might be released from the affinity columns 2K. Drickamer, unpublished observations. suggested that such released material could inhibit binding. Therefore, further purification of the CRDs was undertaken by reverse phase chromatography. This approach has been used previously as a final purification step to prepare active forms of other C-type CRDs (24Weis W.I. Crichlow G.V. Murthy H.M.K. Hendrickson W.A. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20678-20686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repurified material does exhibit HL-60 cell binding activity. Comparison of the His189 and Gly189 proteins containing the wild type MBP sequence in region 4 shows that removal of the histidine side chain results in a roughly 2-fold increase in binding of both HL-60 cells and sLex-BSA (Table I). This finding suggests that some portion of the histidine side chain at position 189 might hinder sLex binding. In the presence of Gly189, region 4 of E-selectin does not provide significant enhancement of HL-60 cell binding and actually decreases sLex-BSA binding (Table I). Region 4 of P-selectin supports less binding than the wild type MBP sequence in both assays, although the presence of Gly189 improves binding compared with His189. These results suggest that the ability of E- and P-selectin regions 4 to assume an optimal sLex binding conformation in the MBP background is influenced differentially by the residue at position 189. Additional changes that appear to enhance formation of the correct conformations of the selectin-like parts of the CRD in the presence of Gly189 are discussed below. The failure of the mutants containing glycine at position 189 to bind to Man-Sepharose suggested that the combination of this change with the insertion of lysine residues in region 5 results in a change in the preferred ligand for the CRD of MBP from mannose to sLex. The limited quantities of sLex and related ligands available make competition binding assays in the usual format impractical, so an alternative approach using affinity labeling to compare affinities was developed. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interaction between L-selectin and its ligand can be stabilized by mild oxidation of the ligand resulting in removal of C-8 and C-9 of NeuAc and generation an of aldehyde group at C-7 (25Norgard K.E.

Upon binding, this group forms a Schiff's base with lysine residues in the selectins, which can then be stabilized by reduction with cyanoborohydride. To create an affinity label, this approach was applied to sLex oligosaccharide labeled reductively in the GlcNAc moiety with [3H]NaBH4. The results of incubating oxidized 3H-sLex with mutant CRD containing Gly189 plus regions 4 and 5 of E-selectin are shown in Fig. 4. Concentration-dependent labeling can be detected after gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Controls in the presence of EDTA at a concentration of 25 mm show no labeling, confirming that the binding is Ca2+-dependent (data not shown). The location of the covalently attached affinity label was determined by treatment of the labeled protein with hydroxylamine to cleave at the single Asn-Gly sequence located at positions 201–202 of MBP (Fig. 1), thus removing the COOH-terminal 20 residues of the protein. The presence of the expected predominant cleavage product of 20 kDa is observed below the remaining intact 22-kDa starting polypeptide on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (Fig. 4). A minor cleavage product, at 18 kDa, probably results from double cleavage at positions 201–202 and at the Asn-Met sequence 22 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the expressed fragment of MBP. Low efficiency cleavage of such bonds with hydroxylamine has been reported (21Bornstein P. Balian G. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Fluorography reveals that the NH2-terminal 20-kDa fragment visible on the gel is not radioactively labeled, indicating that the label must be attached in the COOH-terminal 20-residue segment, which migrates off the end of the gel. Stability of the label under cleavage conditions is evident from the mock cleavages and the fact that remaining intact polypeptide in the hydroxylamine reaction retains bound radioactivity. The only lysine residues in the COOH-terminal segment are the three lysine residues inserted in region 5, so one or more of these residues must be labeled. The COOH-terminal 20-residue fragment of the peptide was isolated by a combination of gel filtration and reverse phase chromatography. The NH2-terminal sequence of this fragment confirmed that cleavage occurs at the predicted Asn-Gly bond. Attempts to localize the labeled residue(s) more specifically using Edman degradation were unsuccessful. However, the labeling observed is consistent with binding of sLex in the orientation seen in co-crystals with the region 5 chimera. Localization of the NeuAc residue in proximity to the region 5 lysine residues would lead to enhanced and selective reactivity with the affinity reagent. The structure of the sLex-region 5 complex suggests that the reactive aldehyde group derived from the glycerol side chain of NeuAc would be oriented away from the region 5 lysine residues in the final bound conformation (Fig. 2). The reaction observed may reflect the presence of a portion of the ligand in the solution phase conformation, which would place the reactive group closer to these lysine residues. Such ligand might represent a kinetic intermediate in the association or dissociation process. Alternatively, selective reactivity might result from a local concentration effect as ligand binds and dissociates from the binding site. The affinity labeling approach was used to obtain semiquantitative information about the relative affinity of this mutant for different saccharide ligands. Radioactive labeling in the presence of competing sugars was quantified and normalized to the protein recovered after gel electrophoresis. The small volumes used for the labeling reaction made it practical to test sLex and 3′-sulfo-Lewisxoligosaccharides and compare them with mannose (Fig. 5 A). The results confirm that the Lewisx derivatives are substantially better inhibitors of binding than is mannose. The results shown in Fig. 5 Bdemonstrate that the absence of either the terminal Fuc or NeuAc acid residues of sLex results in loss in inhibitory potency. These experiments provide further evidence that the modified CRD mimics the ligand binding behavior of authentic selectins. The importance of the three lysine residues in region 5 was explored further in two ways. First, the roles of individual lysine residues in this region were examined. Mutations with single lysine residues in the absence of region 4 did not display any Ca2+-dependent binding activity (data not shown). Therefore, mutations containing one, two, or three lysine residues in each possible combination were created in the presence of region 4 (Table II). The results indicate a cumulative effect of the lysine residues, with particularly the first and third residues capable of supporting some binding. The very limited effect of the middle residue may correlate with the disposition of this side chain furthest from the sialic acid portion of the bound ligand (Fig. 2). The HL-60 cell binding data suggest that the only combination of two residues which supports maximal binding is the second and third. However, the results using 125I-sLex-BSA as test ligand, which has relatively narrower error margins, suggest that any combination of two lysines supports full binding. The data indicate that no one residue is essential for binding activity and reveal a partial correlation of binding with total positive charge in this region. These findings are consistent wit"

Using luciferase reporter constructs driven by the human aggrecan promoter or the cytomegalovirus promoter, the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the human aggrecan gene were found to regulate gene expression transcriptionally in a promoter- and/or cell type-specific manner. Independent of cell type, the 5′-untranslated region was inhibitory with respect to the cytomegalovirus promoter, but it was stimulatory to the human aggrecan promoter. The 5′-untranslated region inhibited the cytomegalovirus promoter by approximately 60% in both chondrocytes and NIH 3T3 cells, but it stimulated the activity of the human aggrecan promoter about 8-fold in chondrocytes and 40-fold in NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast, the 3′-untranslated region inhibited the activities of the human aggrecan promoter by 40–70% in both cell types, but it stimulated the cytomegalovirus promoter activities by 50–60% in NIH 3T3 cells and inhibited its activity by 70% in chondrocytes. The differential effects of the untranslated regions on the two types of promoters may be a reflection of differences in regulation of TATA-less promoters, such as the human aggrecan promoter, and TATA-containing promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus promoter.

Expression of aggrecan by chondrocytes is subject to modulation by several factors, including cytokines, growth factors, and mechanical stimuli. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α both suppress aggrecan gene expression and synthesis, whereas insulin-like growth factor I and transforming growth factor-β stimulate aggrecan gene expression and synthesis. Mechanical loading of cartilage has been shown to modulate (increase and decrease) aggrecan gene expression and synthesis depending on the type and extent of the load imposed (1Bachrach N.M.

Mutations that preclude the proper synthesis and deposition of aggrecan into the extracellular matrix are often lethal.

Despite these observations, the molecular mechanisms governing the regulation of aggrecan gene expression and synthesis remain obscure. The core protein of aggrecan consists of an amino-terminal globular domain (G1) that binds hyaluronan, an interglobular domain, a second globular domain (G2) whose function is yet unknown, an extended glycosaminoglycan attachment region, and G3, which is located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule (19Hardingham T.E.

We hypothesize that the UTRs of the aggrecan gene are involved similarly in regulating expression of the gene, potentially in concert with the promoter. Thus, in this study we have cloned and investigated the regulatory activities of the promoter and the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the human aggrecan gene. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ca2+/Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, 50 × minimal essential amino acids, 100 × nonessential amino acids, 1 m Hepes, 0.75% sodium bicarbonate, and antibiotic solution (5,000 IU/ml penicillin, 5,000 μg/ml streptomycin) were obtained from Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). Fetal bovine serum and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. The Wizard Midi-prep DNA isolation kit, Taq polymerase, deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix (100 mm each), restriction enzymes, the ProFection calcium phosphate mammalian transfection kit, and the luciferase assay system were purchased from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI). The pGEM-luc, pSV-β-galactosidase, pGL3-basic, and pGL3-enhancer plasmids were also from Promega. The pcDNA3 and pCR II vectors were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation (Carlsbad, CA), and the Galacto-Light β-galactosidase reporter gene assay system was from Tropix (Bedford, MA). The human genomic PromoterFinder kit was from CLONTECH. The Elongase Enzyme Mix was purchase from Life Technologies, Inc. Gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Oligos, Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). 5,6-Dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem International. All other reagent-grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. For investigation of the activities of the human aggrecan 5′- and 3′-UTRs independent of the human aggrecan promoter, luciferase constructs containing the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the human aggrecan mRNA (Fig. 1 A) were prepared in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector. The luciferase gene cassette of the pGEM-luc plasmid was first subcloned into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 to generate the control luciferase reporter plasmid pLUCneo. The previously cloned 5′-UTR of the human aggrecan mRNA (27Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem.

The underlined sequences indicate restriction sites for HindIII and BamHI, respectively. To preserve the Kozak sequence (36Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the human aggrecan mRNA, TRP-2 was designed from nucleotides +78 to +54 of the published human aggrecan cDNA sequence (23Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amplified product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned in the HindIII/BamHI site immediately upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pLUCneo to generate the human aggrecan 5′-UTR construct pCMV/5UTR. Exon 19 (containing the 3′-UTR and two polyadenylation signals) of the human aggrecan gene was amplified from the genomic cosmid cosHA-G3 (27Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.F.

The construct pCMV/5_3UTR was generated by cloning, respectively, the 5′-UTR and exon 19 in the HindIII/BamHI and XhoI/ApaI sites of pLUCneo. Constructs pCMV/5UTR-US and pCMV/3UTR-US, containing the UTRs immediately upstream of the CMV enhancer/promoter, were prepared by individually cloning the 5′- and 3′-UTRs upstream of the CMV enhancer/promoter in the BglII/MluI site of pLUCneo. The suffix -US denotes the upstream position of the UTRs relative to the CMV promoter. All inserts were cloned, by design, in the sense orientation. The β-galactosidase (β-GAL) gene cassette of the pSV-β-galactosidase expression vector was subcloned into the HindIII/XhoI site of pcDNA3 for use as transfection efficiency control. A 1.05-kb fragment (containing 0.7 kb of the proximal promoter and 0.35 kb of exon 1) of the upstream region of the human aggrecan gene was amplified by PCR using the human genomic PromoterFinder kit and the Elongase Enzyme Mix according to the suppliers' instructions. The PCR product was cloned in the pCR II TA cloning vector and sequenced in both directions. The promoter/exon 1 fragment was then digested with MluI (located in the PromoterFinder adaptor) and BsrBI (located at +25 of the human aggrecan exon 1 or 5′-UTR). The digested human aggrecan promoter (−701 to +25) was ligated to the 5′-UTR at the BsrBI site and subcloned, in place of the CMV promoter, in pCMV/5UTR and pCMV/5_3UTR to generate the chimeric luciferase constructs pAGC1(−701)/5UTR and pAGC1(−701)/5_3UTR (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, constructs pAGC1(−701) and pAGC1(−701)/3UTR were prepared by cloning the aggrecan promoter fragment into the MluI/BamHI site immediately upstream of the luciferase gene in pLUCneo and pCMV/3UTR. The aggrecan gene symbol AGC1 here denotes the human aggrecan promoter. Primary bovine articular chondrocytes (1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) or NIH 3T3 cells (2 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were maintained in monolayer cultures at 37 °C for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, amino acids (0.5 × minimal essential amino acids, 1 × nonessential amino acids), buffering agents (10 mm Hepes, 10 mm sodium bicarbonate, 10 mm TES, 10 mm BES), and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The cells were transiently transfected, using the ProFection calcium phosphate mammalian transfection kit, with 5 μg of each luciferase construct and 2–5 μg of β-GAL cotransfection plasmid/60-mm dish for 48 h. Within experiments, all dishes were transfected with the same amount of β-GAL cotransfection plasmid. At the time of harvesting, each dish was rinsed twice with 5 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline on ice, and the cells were lysed in 0.3 ml of 1 × Promega reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase activity in each lysate was assayed using a LKB-Wallac liquid scintillation counter and the Promega luciferase assay system. β-GAL activity was assayed using the Galacto-Light β-GAL assay system. Luciferase activities were normalized to β-GAL activities, and the data were subjected to analysis of variance as well as the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple range comparison test. To assess the effects of the UTRs on stability of the luciferase mRNA, primary bovine articular chondrocytes were transfected with 10 μg each of the control luciferase plasmid pLUCneo and the pCMV/5UTR and pCMV/3UTR constructs. 45 h later (t = 0), the cells were treated with 65 μm DRB, an RNA synthesis inhibitor specific for RNA polymerase II (37Chodosh L.A.

Total RNA was subsequently isolated from the cells at 30-min intervals, starting att = 0, and the luciferase mRNA levels were quantified by PCR (39Re P. Valhmu W.B. Vostrejs M. Howell D.S. Fischer S.G. Ratcliffe A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The human aggrecan mRNA contains a G/C-rich 382-bp leader sequence and a relatively short 3′-UTR (27Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Computer analysis predicts a complex secondary structure for the 5′-UTR which could influence the rate of translation of the aggrecan gene (40Ratcliffe A. Fischer S. Valhmu W.B. Vostrejs M. Saed-Nejad F. Ebara S. Palmer G. Am. J. Therapeut. 1996; 3: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, no information is available on how the aggrecan UTRs influence expression of the aggrecan gene. Thus, to determine whether the UTRs of the aggrecan gene have regulatory roles, the activities of the human aggrecan 5′- and 3′-UTRs were first investigated, independent of the aggrecan promoter, using chimeric luciferase constructs driven by the CMV promoter/enhancer. In bovine articular chondrocytes, the activity of the control pLUCneo luciferase plasmid was 1.84 × 104 ± 0.86 × 104 units of LUC/unit β-GAL. Relative to the activity of pLUCneo, the luciferase activity of chondrocytes transfected with pCMV/5UTR was inhibited by 61%, whereas that of the pCMV/3UTR-transfected chondrocytes was inhibited by 71% (p < 0.05, n = 18) (Fig. 2 A). When the luciferase reporter gene was flanked by both UTRs, the enzyme activity was reduced by 92%. The results demonstrated that the human aggrecan UTRs contain regulatory activities. Transfection of chondrocytes with pCMV/5UTR-US and pCMV/3UTR-US, which contained the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR immediately upstream of the CMV promoter/enhancer, respectively, reduced the expression of luciferase activities by 59 and 61% (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that transcription of the UTRs, and therefore their physical presence in the luciferase transcript, is not required for their regulatory activities. Assessment of the effects of the UTRs on luciferase mRNA stability indicated that the presence of the UTRs in the luciferase transcripts did not alter mRNA stability significantly, as assessed by measurement of mRNA half-lives (Fig. 3). The half-lives of the luciferase transcripts ranged from 39 to 47 min, with or without the UTRs.Figure 3Half-lives of luciferase mRNA transcripts in chondrocytes. Monolayer cultures of bovine articular chondrocytes were transiently transfected (see “Experimental Procedures”) with 10 μg of pLUCneo, pCMV/5UTR, or pCMV/3UTR per 60-mm dish for 45 h and then treated with the RNA synthesis inhibitor DRB at a concentration of 65 μm. At the indicated times after initiation of DRB treatment, total RNA was isolated from the transfected cells and analyzed for luciferase mRNA levels using quantitative PCR (39Re P. Valhmu W.B. Vostrejs M. Howell D.S. Fischer S.G. Ratcliffe A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Each set of data was fitted by linear regression, and the half-lives of the respective luciferase transcripts were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the regression lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activities of the CMV promoter-driven constructs were also investigated in NIH 3T3 cells. In these cells, the activity of pLUCneo was 5.34 × 104 ± 1.04 × 104 units of LUC/unit β-GAL. The luciferase activities expressed by pCMV/5UTR and pCMV/5UTR-US were, respectively, 40 and 39% lower than the activity of pLUCneo (p < 0.05, n = 15) (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, pCMV/3UTR and pCMV/3UTR-US luciferase activities were higher than control activities by 64 and 50% (p < 0.05), respectively. The activity of the pCMV/5_3UTR construct was 15% lower than control activities, but the difference was not significant. The proximal promoter (701 bp) and exon 1 (375 bp) of the human aggrecan gene have been cloned and sequenced in the forward and reverse directions. The current sequence of exon 1 differs from that obtained previously by cDNA cloning (27Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) at two nucleotide positions. At position +1, the current sequence reads as a C (Fig. 4), whereas it was determined as a G previously. Also, at position +7 the genomic sequence is a C compared with an A at the same position in the cDNA sequence. To verify the accuracy of these sequences, two separate clones containing the promoter and exon 1 were sequenced. The genomic sequence at position +7 is consistent with those reported for the rat and mouse aggrecan gene (25Watanabe H. Gao L. Sugiyama S. Doege K. Kimata K. Yamada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Doege K.J. Garrison K. Coulter S.N. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29232-29240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence was analyzed for promoter motifs and transcriptional factor binding sites using the TSSG 3V. V. Solovyev and A. A. Salamov, manuscript in preparation. and MatInspector (41Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) programs at the Baylor College of Medicine Search Launcher site. The promoter region is highly G/C-rich and lacks canonical TATA and CAAT motifs (Fig. 4). However, a search of the promoter data base predicted a TATA box at −31, which coincides with the beginning of the TATGTATG sequence (reverse font). This sequence is conserved in the rat and mouse aggrecan promoters (25Watanabe H. Gao L. Sugiyama S. Doege K. Kimata K. Yamada Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Doege K.J. Garrison K. Coulter S.N. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29232-29240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not in the chick aggrecan promoter (42Pirok III, E.W. Li H. Mensch Jr., J.R. Henry J. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11566-11574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site of the human aggrecan gene was predicted by TSSG to be at +6, 5 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 4) determined previously by PCR-based cDNA cloning (27Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Rivers P.A. Ebara S. Cheng J.F. Fischer S. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Several putative binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factors SP-1, AP-2, and AP-4 were found in the promoter and exon 1 (Fig. 4). A glucocorticoid/progesterone response element-like sequence is found at position −663. Two s is/PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)-inducible factor (SIF) binding sites are located at −583 and −39. AP-1/CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) binding sites are found in both the promoter and exon 1 at −599 and +107, respectively. Also located in the promoter and exon 1 are four shear stress response elements (SSREs) (43Resnick N. Collins T. Atkinson W. Bonthron D.T. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4591-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The SSRE in the promoter is located at −655; those in exon 1 are located at +73, +124, and +284. Only the SSRE at +284 is in the sense orientation. STAT (signal transducer andactivator of transcription) and NF-κB as well as Gfi-1 (growth factorindependence) and δEF1 (δ-crystallin/E2-box factor 1) recognition sequences are also found in the promoter and exon 1. The STAT and NF-κB binding sites may confer cytokine responsiveness to the gene, whereas Gfi-1 and δEF1 are likely to function as negative regulators of transcription. To investigate the roles of the human aggrecan promoter and the UTRs in expression of the aggrecan gene, chimeric luciferase constructs containing the human aggrecan promoter 5′-UTR (exon 1) and/or 3′-UTR (exon 19) (Fig. 1 B) were prepared and used in transient transfection assays. The level of expression induced by the promoter was 89-fold higher than that of the promoter-less luciferase vector (data not shown), indicating that this was a functional promoter. In the following experiments the activity of pAGC1(−701), containing the proximal promoter region (−701 to +25) of the human aggrecan gene, served as base-line activity. The presence of the 5′-UTR immediately downstream of the aggrecan promoter, construct pAGC1(−701)/5UTR, significantly stimulated the expression of luciferase activity 7.7-fold relative to the activity of pAGC1(−701) (Fig. 5 A). The expression of luciferase activity was suppressed by 68% (p < 0.001, n = 6) when cells were transfected with pAGC1(−701)/3UTR, the construct containing the human aggrecan exon 19 (3′-UTR) immediately downstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The activity of pAGC1(−701)/5_3UTR, with the UTRs flanking the luciferase gene, was 45% lower than that of pAGC1(−701) and 93% lower than the activity of pAGC1(−701)/5UTR (Fig. 5 A). In NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the aggrecan promoter/UTR constructs, a pattern of luciferase expression similar to that in chondrocytes was observed (Fig. 5 B). Relative to the activity of the pAGC1(−701) construct, expression of luciferase activity in fibroblasts transfected with pAGC1(−701)/5UTR was 39.6-fold higher (p < 0.001, n = 12). However, there was no significant difference between the activities of pAGC1(−701)/3UTR and pAGC1(−701)/5_3UTR compared with that of pAGC1(−701). To determine regions of the promoter which are essential for promoter activity, unidirectional deletion of the aggrecan promoter in pAGC1(−701)/5UTR was performed using endogenous restriction enzyme sites. Deletion of segment −701 to −452 moderately stimulated luciferase activity by 47% (p < 0.001) compared with the activity of pAGC1(−701)/5UTR (Fig. 6 A). Further deletion of the promoter down to −179 resulted in luciferase activity that was approximately the same as that of pAGC1(−701)/5UTR. Removal of all bu"

This enhancer activity can be divided into myoblast-specific and myotube-specific activation domains. The myotube-specific region contains a MyoD and MEF2 sites, whereas the myoblast-specific region contains Sp1, Krox, and Mb sites. In the present study, we designed mutations in the conserved portion of the myotube-specific region; transfection analysis of these mutations showed that a novel site located between the MyoD and MEF2 sites, named Mt (GGTATTT), is required for full transcriptional activity of the desmin enhancer in skeletal muscle. Although gel mobility shift assays demonstrate that myotube, myoblast, fibroblast, and HeLa nuclear extracts contain a nuclear factor that binds specifically to Mt, four copies of the Mt site function as the native enhancer only in myotubes. Functional synergism among the MyoD, MEF2, and Mt sites in myotubes has been demonstrated. These results show that the novel Mt site cooperates with MyoD and MEF2 to give maximal expression of the desmin gene.

Skeletal muscle commitment, differentiation, and maturation are largely controlled by the transcriptional regulation of a large battery of unlinked muscle-specific genes. A variety of different DNA sequence motifs that are required for muscle-specific gene transcription have been identified in many genes. These include the E-box (CANNTG), MEF2 site (CTA(A/T)4TAG), M-CAT-box (CCATCCT), and CArG-box (CC(A/T)4GG) that serve as binding sites for the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix MyoD1 family proteins (1Davis R.L.

The aim of the present study is to find new elements necessary for desmin gene expression in skeletal muscle. Desmin, a muscle-specific member of the intermediate filaments protein multigene family, is encoded by a single gene (19Pieper F.R. Slobbe R.L.F. Ramaekers C.S. Cuypers H.T. Bloemendal H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3611-3618Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Li Z. Lilienbaum A. Butler-Browne G. Paulin D. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 78: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Desmin is located at the level of the Z-disc in striated muscles. It has been proposed that desmin maintains the integrity of muscle tissues upon stress. Cardiovascular lesions and skeletal myopathies have been found in mice lacking desmin (21Li Z. Colucci-Guyon E. Pinçon-Raymond M. Mericskay M. Pournin S. Paulin D. Babinet C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Desmin is expressed at early stages of myogenesis, such as in replicating myoblasts and satellite cells and at high levels in differentiated myotubes (22Kaufman S.J. Foster R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Fürst D.O. Osborn M. Weber K. J. Cell.

Paulin D. Development. 1993; 117: 947-959PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that the sequence including 228 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); sTnI, slow troponin I; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; tk, thymidine kinase; MCK, muscle creatine kinase. upstream of the transcription initiation site is sufficient to confer low level muscle-specific expression. A negative region was located between −693 and −228 bp. High level expression of the gene depends on a 280-bp muscle-specific enhancer located between −693 and −973 bp (28Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6562-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enhancer can activate either the desmin promoter or heterologous promoters in myogenic cells and can function not only in myotubes but also in myoblasts via the action of two independent activating regions (18Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the myoblast-specific domain, four regions are protected by nuclear factors from myogenic cells; three of these contain a GC-rich sequence sharing homology with the Krox binding site (29Lemaire P. Vesque C. Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Frank R. Charnay P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3456-3467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion and site-directed mutation experiments demonstrated that at least two Krox-like sequences are required for enhancer activity in myoblasts. In addition, another GC-rich sequence, designated Mb, sharing some homology with an Ets binding site, is also required for full enhancer activity in myoblasts. In the myotube-specific region, one MyoD site and one MEF2 site are necessary for full enhancer activity in myotubes. In the present study, we demonstrate that a novel site Mt (GGTATTT) is necessary for maximal expression of desmin in myotubes. We show that this novel Mt site cooperates with MyoD and MEF2 sites to give maximal expression of desmin. Mutation of Mt in the myotube-specific enhancer resulted in the decrease of the transactivation level by the MyoD family in nonmyogenic cells in the cotransfection experiments. Four Mt motifs arranged in a palindrome could function as a strong enhancer in myotubes. Finally, gel shift experiments show that the Mt site could specifically bind nuclear factors. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human desmin enhancer was performed according to the method described by Kunkel (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide MuMyoD was used to change the MyoD site from CAGCTG to aAtCTG, and oligonucleotide MuMt1 was used to mutate the Mt site from GGTATTT to GGgATcc. Previous experiments involving transfection of the deletion mutants in myotubes have demonstrated that 70 bp (−919 to −850) of the human desmin myotube-specific enhancer gives an activity similar to that of the complete enhancer in myotubes (18Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We synthesized this 70-bp fragment by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide 1, with aHindIII linker (5′-AAGCTTCTCCTCTATAAATACC-3′) corresponding to −919 to −901 bp, and oligonucleotide 2, with XbaI linker (5′-TCTAGAGTCAACCCAACCATCT-3′) corresponding to −834 to −850 bp. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment was inserted into the HindIII–XbaI sites of pBLCAT2, which contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promotor and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (31Lucknow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). To obtain the mutation in the MEF2 and Mt sites, the following oligonucleotides were used, respectively, as primers in combination with oligonucleotide 2 in a polymerase chain reaction: MuMEF2, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCgagAAATACC-3′; MuMEFMt*, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCTAggccTACCCGC-3′; MuMt*, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCTATAAATAggaGCTCTGG-3′; MuFL1, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCTATAAATACCCGCcgcGGTATTT-3′; MuMt2, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCTATAAATACCCGCTCTGGTAccTGGGG-3′; MuMt3, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCTATAAATACCCGCTCTGagATcTGGGG-3′; MuFL2, 5′-GAAAGCTTCTCCTCTATAAATACCCGCTCTGGTATTTaaaGTTGG-3′. Mutated nucleotides are presented in lowercase letters. Mt* indicates a sequence (AAATACC) complementary to the Mt site that overlaps with the MEF2 site. FL indicates the flanking sequence around the Mt site. The polymerase chain reaction products were inserted 5′ to the tk-CAT in the pBLCAT2 plasmid (31Lucknow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), and the resulting constructs are listed in Fig. 1. To study the transcriptional activity of the Mt motif, the oligonucleotides Mt (sense, 5′-ATACCCGCTCTGGTATTTGGGGTTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGCCAACCCCAAATACCAGAGCGGG-3′) and the oligonucleotides 2Mt, containing two palindromic Mt sites (sense, 5′-CTAGAGGAAATACCCGCTCTGGTATTTGGGGTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTAGAACCCCAAATACCAGAGCGGGTATTTCCT-3′) were annealed and inserted into both the plasmid pBLCAT2 (31Lucknow B.

Chem. 1991; 266: 6562-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constructs containing one, two, and four Mt motifs were obtained. Gene transfer into C2,7 myogenic cells (32Pinset C. Montarras D. Chenevert J. Minty A. Barton P. Laurent C. Gros F. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, fibroblast C3H10T1/2, and HeLa cells; harvesting of cell extracts; and CAT assays were performed as described previously (28Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6562-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of nuclear extracts from different cell lines was based on the methodology of Hazan et al. (33Hazan U. Thomas D. Alcami J. Bachelerie F. Israel N. Yssel H. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seidedos F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7861-7865Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assays were purchased from the Genset Company (Paris, France) and are presented in Fig. 6. Gel mobility shift assays were typically performed as described previously (28Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6562-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 20-μl reaction volume at room temperature. Each reaction mixture contained 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC), 0.5–1 ng of labeled DNA probe, and 4 μg of protein in crude nuclear extracts in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl, and 60 mm KCl. For the supershift assay, 2 μl of antibody against MEF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added into the mixture after the addition of probe and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Previous studies involving transfecting the deletion mutants in myotubes have demonstrated that 70 bp (−919 to −850) of the human desmin myotube-specific enhancer produces an activity similar to that of the full enhancer in myotubes (28Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6562-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence comparisons of this enhancer region with hamster (34van de Klundert F.A. Jansen H.J. Bloemendal H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 220-225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mouse enhancers (35Li H. Capetanaki Y.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that this region has been conserved during mammalian evolution, suggesting that it may therefore be important for enhancer function. Fig. 1 Ashows an alignment of this sequence. Within these 70 bp, 90% are conserved across the three species. Interestingly, a previous footprinting experiment had demonstrated that 42 bp of this region were protected by nuclear extracts from muscle cells (18Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 42-bp region includes MEF2 and MyoD binding sites. Due to its high degree of evolutionary conservation and its capacity to bind nuclear factors, we decided to analyze this region in more detail for its transcriptional activity. To investigate the cooperation between the sites present in this region and the possibility that an additional regulatory site exists between the MEF2 and MyoD sites, we introduced different mutations in this 42-bp region. These constructs were tested by transient transfection assays in C2,7 myotubes and myoblasts, and the data are presented in Fig. 1 C. When linked to the tk promotor (construct 1), this 70 bp can increase expression about 33-fold compared with the tk promoter alone in myotubes but not in myoblasts. Mutation of the MEF2 binding site resulted in a loss of 70–90% of the CAT activity in myotubes according to the mutated nucleotides (constructs 2 and 3); mutation of the MyoD site resulted in almost complete loss (95%) in myotubes (construct 10). These results show that the MEF2 and MyoD1 sites are important for the gene expression in myotubes. The mutations in constructs 6, 7, and 8 did not change gene expression in myoblasts but resulted in a 60–80% loss of CAT activity (from 33 to 10, 13, and 7, respectively) in myotubes. These three mutations were located in a GGTATTT sequence. Mutations in 6, 7, and 8 convert wild-type sequence GGTATTT into GagATcT, GGTAccT, and GGgATcc, respectively. These mutations abolished the binding activity to nuclear proteins (Fig. 5). We designate this sequence (GGTATTT) as Mt (active inmyotubes). We found this sequence present as a palindrome between the MEF2 and MyoD sites; one Mt* sequence, AAATACC (complementary to the Mt site), overlaps with the MEF2 site. The mutation in construct 3 that changes the MEF2 and Mt* site in the same time reduced CAT activity by 70% in myotubes. Double mutations in the MEF2 and Mt sites resulted in an almost complete loss of CAT activity (constructs 11 and 12) in myotubes. The mutation in construct 9 that changes the flanking sequence of the Mt site does not alter CAT activity in myotubes or myoblasts. Mutations in constructs 4 and 5 give rise to a 20% increase in CAT activity in myotubes and a slight increase of CAT activity in myoblasts. The increase of CAT activity of mutant 4 in myotubes could be explained by the fact that this mutation converted the imperfect (nonconsensus) desmin MEF2 siteCTATAAATAcCC to a perfect MEF2 siteCTATAAATAGGA, which is 100% identical to the MEF2 consensus (6Pollack R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 7Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B.

It has been reported that the flanking sequences modulate the cell specificity of the M-CAT regulatory site (37Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The increase in gene expression in myoblasts and myotubes for mutants 4 and 5 could also be related in that the flanking sequences around the MEF2 and Mt sites could have some negative effect, or mutations could create new regulatory elements. These results demonstrated that the Mt sequence is necessary for the maximal expression in myotubes, and mutation of any one of the three sites (MEF2, Mt, and MyoD) results in a dramatic loss of activity, suggesting a synergistic effect between MEF2, Mt, and MyoD sites to give maximal expression in differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The discovery of the MyoD family of proteins provided the first information about the molecular events that control myogenic commitment and muscle fiber differentiation. When expressed in many nonmyogenic cell lines, each member of the MyoD family is capable of converting the nonmyogenic cells into cells capable of myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression (1Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 38Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K.

Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The MyoD binding site alone is not sufficient to direct high transcription and should cooperate with other sites (42Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To know if Mt site mutations influence MyoD transactivation on the desmin enhancer, the constructs containing the mutations either in the Mt site or MyoD site linked to the desmin promoter or tk promoter were carried out. These constructs were cotransfected with MyoD1 or myogenin expression vectors in nonmyogenic cells C3H101/2. We have found that both factors could greatly increase CAT activity when wild-type desmin enhancer was present in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts. However, when the MyoD binding site was mutated, the transactivation effect was diminished to the level obtained by the desmin promoter without enhancer (Fig. 2). When the Mt site was mutated, the transactivation effect was diminished about 50% compared with the wild-type enhancer. Similar results were obtained when wild-type or mutated enhancer was linked to the tk promoter (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the novel Mt site is also necessary to obtain the maximal transactivation effect by the MyoD family and that there is a potential cooperation between Mt and MyoD sites. To test the capacity of the Mt sequence to direct gene expression, one, two, and four copies of the Mt site were linked to either the tk promoter or desmin promoter. Because the Mt site is present in a palindrome in the human desmin enhancer, two copies and four copies of the Mt site were linked either in tandem or in palindrome fashion as indicated in Fig. 3. These constructs were transfected transiently in HeLa cells, fibroblasts, myoblasts, and myotubes. The results show that one copy of the Mt site linked to both tk and desmin promoters cannot activate gene expression in these four cell types. Two copies of the Mt site arranged in tandem or as a palindrome can give rise to a slight increase in CAT activity (three times) only in myotubes. Four Mt copies linked in tandem can increase about 9-fold the expression in myotubes, but not in myoblasts, fibroblasts, and HeLa cells. Interestingly, four Mt copies linked in palindromic fashion function as native myotube-specific enhancers of desmin and can increase 30 times the CAT expression in myotubes. However, in contrast to the native desmin myotube-specific enhancer, these four copies of palindromic Mt sequence give rise to a slight increase in CAT activity (2–6 times) in myoblasts, fibroblasts, and HeLa cells. This suggests that sequences surrounding the Mt site in the myotube-specific enhancer of the human desmin gene could function as negative elements in undifferentiated muscle cells and nonmyogenic cells. DNA-protein binding experiments were performed to characterize trans-acting factors that interact with the Mt site. A 26-bp oligonucleotide containing the Mt site was bound in gel mobility shift assays by nuclear proteins from HeLa cells, fibroblast 3T3, C2,7 myoblasts, and myotubes (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10). The binding of nuclear proteins was sequence-specific as assessed by competition with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides bearing the wild-type Mt sequence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11) and the lack of competition by excess oligonucleotides bearing the mutated Mt sequence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). Since the Mt binding complex migrated to approximately the same gel location irrespective of whether the nuclear extracts were derived from HeLa, fibroblasts, myoblasts, or myotubes, it seems likely that the same or similar Mt-binding protein, termed MtBF (Mt binding factor), is present in these diverse cell types. To try to obtain a consensus sequence for Mt, we tested the binding capacity of a series of oligonucleotides containing different mutations in the Mt site and in the surrounding sequences. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the specific complex formed by Mt and nuclear proteins from the C2,7 myotubes was abolished by competition with unlabeled wild-type Mt sequence (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 3), A/T-rich sequence from myoglobin promoter (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and 5) (43Grayson J. Williams R.S. Yu Y.T. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), MuFL1 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 6 and 7), and MuFL2 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 8 and 9). MuFL1 and MuFL2 change only the flanking sequence around the GGTATTT sequence. The A/T-rich sequence contains a GCTATTT sequence. This complex is also abolished by the unlabeled MEF2 oligonucleotide of the human desmin enhancer (Fig. 4 C, lanes 18 and 19), which contains an overlapping Mt sequence, GGTATTT, but is not abolished by the MEF2 site of the MCK enhancer, which contains a GTTATTT (Fig. 4 C, lanes 16 and 17). To show that MtBF is not related to the MEF2 family, gel supershift analysis was performed, and the results demonstrated that the antibody against MEF-2 did not change the Mt binding activity (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), whereas this antibody can supershift the band formed by MEF-2 site from the MCK and desmin enhancer (Fig. 4 B, lanes 10 and 15). In addition, the Mt site cannot compete with the MEF2 site of MCK and vice versa (Fig. 4 B). The MEF2 site of the desmin enhancer containing the GGTATTT sequence can form both MEF-2 and Mt complexes (Fig. 4 B, lane 9). These results demonstrated MtBF is different from MEF-2. The Mt-protein complex is not abolished by a MyoD site of the human desmin enhancer (Fig. 4 C, lanes 20 and 21), but surprisingly mutation of the MyoD site GGCAGCTG toGGAATCTG abolished the complex (Fig. 4 C, lanes 22 and 23). The mutations that transformed GGTATTT to GGTAccT, GGgATcc, ccTATTT, and GagATcT (Fig. 4 C, lanes 9–12, 24, 25, 28, and 29) cannot compete with the Mt sequence. The mutation from GGTATTT to cGTATTT exhibits a slight competition with Mt (Fig. 4 C, lanes 26 and 27). To show that the Mt binding activity is different from TATA-box binding activity, an oligonucleotide containing a potential TATA-box (GGTATAAAAA) was used as competitor and shows no competition with Mt (Fig. 4 C, lanes 30 and 31). MtBF is also different from the HMG-box proteins and Oct1–2 factors, because the oligonucleotides containing an HMG-box binding site (TTCAAAG) and Oct binding site (ATGCAAAT) (44Boulikas T. Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 117-321Google Scholar) cannot compete with the Mt site (Fig. 4 B). The Mt motif (GGTATTT) differs in one nucleotide from the GT2-box (GGTAATT), which is present in the promoter of phytochrome polypeptide-encoding gene A of rice. The GT2 binding factor shares a trihelix motif (HLHLH, helix-loop-helix-loop-helix) and might be representative of a new class of DNA-binding proteins (45Dehesh K. Hung H. Tepperman J.M. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4131-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). But the competition assay showed that MtBF is not related to the GT2 factor (Fig. 4 B, lane 8). The oligonucleotides used in the gel mobility shift assays were listed in the Fig. 5. A preliminary consensus sequence (G(G/C)(T/A)AT(T/C)T) for the Mt site has been deduced. No homology with Mt has been found within the known DNA binding sequences (for a review, see Ref. 44Boulikas T. Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 117-321Google Scholar). Using the preliminary consensus, we were able to identify several potential Mt sites in other muscle-specific control regions (Fig. 6). These sites are located within regions that have been shown to be functionally important for transcription of the associated genes, most of them overlapped with a potential MEF2 site. This study has identified a novel cis-acting regulatory element Mt, between the MEF2 and MyoD sites within the myotube-specific enhancer. Mutation analysis reveals that a sequence, GGTATTT, located between the MyoD and MEF2 sites is required for full transcriptional activity of the desmin myotube-specific enhancer in myotubes; the relative loss of transcriptional activity in myotubes due to Mt mutations that abolished the Mt-protein complex formation is greater than 60% compared with the 70-bp wild-type enhancer (Fig. 1 C). The same Mt mutation neither decreases nor increases the low level of reporter gene expression in proliferating myoblasts or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Mutation analysis also showed that the MyoD site is important for enhancer activity in myotubes. Mutation of this site resulted in the loss of almost all of the enhancer activity despite the presence of MEF2 and Mt sites. Mutation of the MEF2 site resulted in a 90% loss of CAT activity, suggesting that this site is also necessary for enhancer activity in myotubes. The fact that mutation of one of these three sites resulted in dramatic loss of reporter gene activity suggests the existence of a synergy among the MyoD, MEF2, and Mt sites. It is interesting to note that the 70-bp fragment containing these three sites acts as a powerful myotube-specific enhancer. One Mt binding complex of similar mobility was observed in myotubes, myoblasts, fibroblasts, and HeLa cells in a gel shift mobility assay. Although one- and two-Mt motifs do not appear to be active on their own, four-Mt sites arranged in tandem are active only in myotubes. Interestingly, four Mt sites linked in a palindrome can function as a wild-type desmin enhancer in myotubes. It is, however, somewhat more active than the native sequence in myoblasts and nonmuscle cells, suggesting that additional negative control elements contributing to muscle specificity may be present within the complete enhancer. The reason why a four-Mt site in a palindrome is more active than that in tandem awaits determination and could be related to fact that the Mt motif in a palindrome favors the spatial interaction of the transactivators in the transcriptional machinery. It seems that this could not be related to novel factors binding to the oligonucleotides containing two or four Mt motifs in a palindrome, because they give a DNA-protein complex similar to the oligonucleotide containing one Mt site in gel shift assays (data not shown). MtBF is present in various cell extracts; why then are four copies of Mt very active only in myotubes? It is possible that MtBF's activity is regulated in these cell types through several mechanisms, for example by post-translational modification (e.g. phosphorylation) or by interaction with ubiquitous or cell type-specific coactivators. Considering the fact that Mt tetramers are very active in myotubes but not in myoblasts, mitogen-regulated phosphorylation could be involved in MtBF activity. In the case of the MyoD family, cAMP-dependent kinase can inhibit the activity of myogenic helix-loop-helix proteins (64Li L. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4478-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The alternative mechanism, protein-protein interaction, could also be involved in MtBF activity. In fact, it has been reported that MyoD and MEF2 proteins need the coactivator p300 to activate gene expression (65Sortorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition, protein-protein interaction mechanisms have been proposed for regulation of the cardiac troponin T gene. In this gene, the ubiquitous TEF-1 factor binds to an M-CAT control element (10Farrance I.K.G. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but its full transcriptional activity requires intermediary factors, termed TIFs (66Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Coactivators of MtBF are perhaps present only in myotubes. Post-translational modification and protein-protein interaction could both be involved in the regulation of the MtBF. Current efforts in our laboratory are directed at cloning this apparently unknown factor. Understanding the mechanisms involved in regulating MtBF function awaits its cloning and characterization. We have established a preliminary consensus sequence (G(G/C)(T/A)AT(T/C)T) for the Mt site from the competition analysis of gel retardation assays. Using the preliminary consensus, we were able to identify several potential Mt sites in other muscle-specific control regions (Fig. 6). All of these potential Mt sites are located within regions that have been shown to be functionally important for transcription of the associated genes; most of them overlapped with an A/T-rich sequence or a potential MEF2 site. The consensus sequence of MEF2 is (C/T)T(A/T)(A/T)AAATA(A/G) (67Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The following sequence CcTAAAATAGC bearing an imperfect MEF2 site can abolish the Mt-protein complex (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 5). Some sequences, for example the MEF2-like site in the desmin enhancer (18Li Z. Paulin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10403-10415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Li H. Capetanaki Y.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), rat sTnI (54Nakayama M. Stauffer J. Cheng J. Banerjee-Basu S. Wawrousek E. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1988; 8: 2581-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and β-enolase first intron enhancer (63Feo S. Antona V. Barbier G. Passantino R. Cali L. Giallongo A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5991-6001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing an imperfect MEF2 site (C/T)T(A/T)(A/T)AAATAcC can compete with the Mt site (Fig. 4 B, lanes 18 and 19). The sequence complementary to the Mt site is underlined. However, the sequence ((C/T)T(A/T)(A/T)AAATAAC), bearing a MEF2 site found in the MCK enhancer, cannot abolish the Mt-protein complex (Fig. 4 B, lanes 16 and 17). These results indicate that there could be some subtle differences between the different potential MEF2 sites present in the control region of muscle-specific genes. The MEF2 site of the desmin enhancer is capable of forming two complexes with the myotube nuclear extracts; one band is abolished by the unlabeled MCK MEF2 site and the other by unlabeled Mt sequence, whereas the complex formed by the MCK MEF2 site cannot be abolished by the addition of excess unlabeled Mt sequence (Fig. 4 B). The significance of this difference between the MEF2 sites in the control of muscle-specific gene expression awaits study. It is interesting to note that the common core regulatory sequences are found in skeletal slow and fast fiber-specific regulatory elements (54Nakayama M. Stauffer J. Cheng J. Banerjee-Basu S. Wawrousek E. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2408-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This common core sequence contains some conserved regulatory elements such as an E-box, CCAC-box, and MEF2-like site. Transgenic mice bearing this common core sequence of quail fast fiber-specific troponin I express preferentially the transgene in fast fibers (68Hallauer P.L. Bradshaw H.L. Hastings K.E.M. Development. 1993; 119: 691-701PubMed Google Scholar), whereas transgenic mice containing the core element of rat sTnI are preferentially in slow fibers. These transgenes contain different MEF2 sites. The MEF2 site in the quail fast fiber-specific troponin I control region is perfectly homologous to the MEF2 consensus sequence and does not contain an Mt sequence, whereas the MEF2 site in rat sTnI enhancer is an imperfect MEF2 site (one nucleotide difference) and contains an Mt sequence. In addition, three sequences sharing the homology (six bp out of seven; Fig. 6) with the Mt sequence are found in the rat sTnI control region but not in quail fast fiber-specific troponin I. The MtBF is different from that of Mhox, a mesodermally restricted homeodomain protein that binds an A + T-rich element (T(A/T)ATAAT(A/T)A) in the MCK enhancer. In experiments reported by Cserjesi et al. (69Cserjesi P. Lilly B. Bryson L. Wang Y. Sassoon D. Olson E.N. Development. 1992; 115: 1087-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), oligonucleotides containing an Mt motif (mutant 10 and 12 GCTATTT) cannot abolish the MHox-protein complex (69Cserjesi P. Lilly B. Bryson L. Wang Y. Sassoon D. Olson E.N. Development. 1992; 115: 1087-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MtBF is also different from the TATA-box binding factor, HMG-box-binding proteins, and Oct1–2 factors, because a standard TATA-box sequence (70Peterson M.G. Tanese N. Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Science. 1990; 248: 1625-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), HMG-box and Oct1–2 site was not able to abolish the Mt-protein complex (Fig. 4, B and C). A 35-kDa muscle-specific (ATF35) protein, able to bind to a myoglobin A/T-rich (TCTGGAAGCTATTTTAGGGCAGG) sequence overlapping a MEF2 site, has been described (43Grayson J. Williams R.S. Yu Y.T. Bassel-Duby R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The same oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 C, lanes 4 and 5) can abolish the Mt-protein complex, suggesting that the MtBF and ATF35 could be the same or similar protein. Nevertheless, there are some differences. ATF35 was reported to be a muscle-specific protein, whereas our experiments show that the Mt binding factor is present in nonmuscle cells like fibroblasts and HeLa cells. We thank Drs. S. Tajbakhsh, D. Daegelen, and J. Humbert for critical reading of the manuscript. We are grateful to L. Gazzolo, S. König, J. Lavie, M. Mericskay, and P. Vicart for fruitful discussion."

Type X collagen is synthesized by chondrocytes specifically when they become hypertrophic, and this specificity is primarily regulated at the level of transcription.

Furthermore, type X collagen was shown to be associated with preexisting types II/XI/IX collagen fibrils by immunoelectron microscopy studies (15Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev.

The diffusion studies also suggest that type X collagen may affect the biosynthesis of cartilage proteoglycans and alter the biochemical and physical properties of hypertrophic cartilage matrix (19Chen Q. Linsenmayer C.M. Gu H. Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The expression of type X collagen is controlled primarily at the level of transcription, as demonstrated by both in situhybridization (6Linsenmayer T.F. Chen Q. Gibney E. Gordon M.K. Marchant J.K. Mayne R. Schmid T.M. Development. 1991; 111: 191-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nuclear run-off experiments (20LuValle P. Hayashi M. Olsen B.R. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We observed previously in transfection experiments, that a proximal promoter region that extended from 562 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. upstream to 86 bp downstream of the transcription start site conferred cell specificity for the expression of the gene (21Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have explored further the proximal promoter region and its neighboring sequences for their involvement in the tissue-specific regulation of the type X collagen gene. In transient transfection experiments with constructs containing serial deletions of the proximal promoter region, we found multiple regulatory elements that appear to contribute to the expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes. A detailed analysis focused on a sequence from −135 to +5, which conferred high level expression in this cell type, revealed two noncanonical Sp1 binding sites. The binding of Sp1 proteins to these sequences appears to be essential for high level expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes . The constructs pCAT I and pCAT II were as described previously (21Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Constructs pCAT III through pCAT XII were generated as follows. The genomic inserts were obtained by PCR from the plasmid pFL2, which contained a 1.5-kilobase pair genomic fragment spanning the transcription start site of the type X collagen gene (21Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To each corresponding genomic fragment, a HindIII site was added at the 5′ end and a SalI site at the 3′ end. The resultant fragments were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and subjected to HindIII and SalI digestion. The digested products were cloned into the HindIII and SalI sites of the vector pCAT-Basic (Promega). The resultant plasmids were sequenced (Life Technologies, Inc.) to confirm their identities. To generate constructs pCAT XIII, XIV, and XV, mutations were introduced into the sequence by PCR using primers containing these mutations. The resultant DNA was then cloned into pCAT-Basic as described above. Primary cultures of hypertrophic chondrocytes and nonhypertrophic chondrocytes were prepared from tibia and sterna of 14-day chick embryos, respectively, as described previously (21Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The transient transfections were done as described previously (21Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of pSVβ-gal (Promega) was used as an internal control and cotransfected with 4 μg of constructs in 25 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected for 5–8 h, allowed to recover in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Life Technologies, Inc. supplemented with 10% calf serum from HyClone Laboratories) for 60 h, and the cells were harvested. In each experiment, transfections of each construct were done at least in triplicate. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar) and expressed as the optical density of the substrate reaction at the wavelength of 420 nm (OD420). CAT (pg) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an anti-CAT antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Normalized levels of CAT expression were calculated as CAT protein to β-galactosidase activity (i.e. CAT/β-galactosidase). The mean value of CAT/β-galactosidase ratios from multiple transfections for each construct was taken as its CAT expression level in the experiment. Results presented in the paper are from two or more separate experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared from monolayer cell cultures at different salt concentrations (0.8–1.6 m KCl) according to Abmayr and Workman (23Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 12.1.1-12.1.7Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Double-stranded probes were generated either by PCR or by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, according to Mueller et al. (24Mueller P.R. Garrity P.A. Wold B. Ausubel S.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994: 15.5.1-15.5.26Google Scholar). These were then labeled with32P by a forward reaction with T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the products purified by Nensorb 20 cartridges (NEN Life Science Products). EMSA was performed according to Chodosh (25Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 12.2.1-12.2.10Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts of 7–14 μg and approximately 1–3 × 104 cpm of probes were used in each reaction. For competition assays, cold competitors were added in 200–400 molar excess. The nucleotide sequence of the competitor for Sp1 binding (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) is as follows (shown for a single strand): 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′. The sequence of the mutant form (Sp1′) is 5′-ATTCGATCGGTTCGGGGCGAGC-3′. For supershift experiments, binding was performed as described above, and subsequently 2 μl of Sp1 antibody (1 μg/μl rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the reaction. An additional 20-min incubation at 30 °C followed prior to gel analyses. Previously, we showed that the proximal promoter region, comprising 562 bp upstream and 86 bp downstream of the transcription start site (pCAT I, see Fig. 1), directs high level expression of a reporter gene in a cell-specific manner (21Long F. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31310-31314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To delineate the cis-acting elements within this region that are responsible for the regulation, we have now generated a series of constructs with nested deletions (see Fig. 1) and tested them by transient transfections. In nonhypertrophic chondrocytes, all constructs examined directed only a low level of expression. Specifically, the expression levels by these constructs in this type X-negative cell type were less than 30% of the expression elicited by pCAT I in hypertrophic chondrocytes (Table I). Examination of these constructs in hypertrophic chondrocytes, however, revealed a number of potential cis-acting elements, both positive and negative.Table IMinimal expression of CAT constructs in nonhypertrophic chondrocytes (n = 3)pCAT (% ± S.D.)IIIIIIIVVVIVIIXXIXII14.7 ± 0.614.7 ± 0.62.02.7 ± 0.62.7 ± 0.62.7 ± 0.69.7 ± 0.64.0 ± 1.04.3 ± 0.626.3 ± 3.1 Open table in a new tab The first exon of the type X collagen gene appeared to contain a positive regulatory activity for transcription. The 86-bp transcribed sequence (nt +1 to +85, see Fig. 1) present in pCAT I represents a large portion of the first exon (26LuValle P. Ninomiya Y. Rosenblum N.D. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18378-18385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion construct pCAT III, however, contains only 5 bp of the transcribed region and thus lacks the bulk of the first exon (see Fig. 1). This construct elicited expression significantly lower than that by pCAT I (see Fig. 2), indicating the presence of a positive regulatory activity in the sequence from nt +6 to + 85. Consistent with this, another construct that lacked the sequence, pCAT X, also directed considerably lower expression than pCAT XI, which contained it. Previously, we reported that the 2.6-kilobase pair upstream sequence included in pCAT II did not affect cell specificity to any substantial degree. By comparing pCAT II and pCAT I within hypertrophic chondrocytes themselves, however, we found that expression by the former was consistently lower than that by the latter (see Fig. 2), suggesting that the 2.6-kilobase pair upstream sequence may actually repress expression. The first intron of several collagen genes has been shown to contain regulatory activities responsible for tissue-specific expression (see “Discussion”). To test whether this is true for the type X collagen gene, we examined the expression by pCAT XII, a construct that contained the entire first intron in addition to the proximal promoter region (see Fig. 1). Our results showed that the expression level by this construct is similar to that by pCAT I (see Fig. 2), indicating that the first intron does not have any detectable effect on expression. To determine whether other regulatory elements might be present in the proximal promoter region, serial deletions were made from the 5′-end inward within the pCAT III insert (i.e. sequence from nt −562 to +5). This procedure resulted in the constructs pCAT IV through pCAT X (see Fig. 1). From the experiments using this set of constructs, a number of potentially interesting features of the promoter were uncovered. A positive activity was found from nt −562 to −493, as the expression level elicited by pCAT IV was lower than that by pCAT III (see Fig. 2). Likewise, a second positive activity was located within the sequence from nt −492 to −413, as shown by the lower expression level by pCAT V compared with that by pCAT IV. Negative regulatory activities were also found in the proximal promoter region. These were present from nt −412 to −292 and from nt −291 to −140, as demonstrated by an increase of expression by progressively shorter constructs, starting from pCAT V to pCAT VI to pCAT VII (see Fig. 2). We next further dissected the sequence from −139 to −55, which appeared to contain a potent activity for high level expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Whereas pCAT X (containing the sequence from nt −54 to +5, see Fig. 1) elicited only a negligible level of expression, inclusion of the sequence from nt −139 to −55 in pCAT VII resulted in an 8–10-fold increase in CAT expression (Fig. 2). Further analyses of the region from nt −139 to −55 revealed that sequences from nt −139 to −115, and from nt −89 to −55 are important for the high level expression. This is indicated by the results that the expression level dropped about 2-fold from pCAT VII to pCAT VIII and 3-fold from pCAT IX to pCAT X. Thus, by performing transient transfection experiments in hypertrophic chondrocytes, we have identified multiple regions with regulatory activities in the type X collagen gene. These results are summarized in TableII.Table IIPotential regulatory elements of type X collagen gene in hypertrophic chondrocytesApproximate positions of elementsRegulatory activities−3163 to −563−−562 to −493+−492 to −413+−412 to −292−−291 to −140−−139 to −115+−89 to −55++6 to +85+ Open table in a new tab To begin to examine the potential involvement of nuclear proteins in the regulation of expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes, EMSA was carried out using double-stranded DNA from nt −139 to −55 as a probe. We chose to examine this region because the transfections have shown that a construct containing this relatively short sequence, pCAT VII, elicited high level expression (about 70% of that by pCAT I) in hypertrophic chondrocytes (see above). Nuclear extracts prepared at different salt concentrations (0.8–1.6 m KCl) were examined, and all gave similar results (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Two major bands specific to the probe were detected (see Fig. 3 B). To further dissect this region, a panel of oligonucleotides designed to cover the full length of the probe were used as competitors in EMSA (Fig. 3 A). These experiments showed that DNA from nt −89 to −55 (Com4) competed for binding just as efficiently as the full-length cold probe (Com1), and that DNA from nt −139 to −115 (Com2) also competed for binding but to a somewhat lesser extent. DNA from nt −114 to −90 (Com3), from nt −120 to −94 (Com5), and from nt −99 to −75 (Com6), however, did not compete (see Fig. 3 B). These results localized nucleotides important for the binding to the regions from nt −139 to −121 and from nt −75 to −55. Furthermore, both Com2 and Com4, when themselves used as probes in EMSA, exhibited two major bands (see Fig. 4, A and B) with mobilities similar to those produced by the full-length probe (Fig. 3 B), confirming that they contribute to the binding of nuclear factors. These results are consistent with the finding from the transfection studies that nucleotides from nt −139 to −115 and from nt −89 to −55 are important for the high level expression conferred by the sequence from nt −139 to −55 (described above).Figure 4EMSA and mutation analyses.

The arrows point to the two major bands detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sequence comparisons between the sequences from nt −139 to −121 and from nt −75 to −55 revealed two 10-bp nucleotide stretches of high similarity. These nucleotide stretches, located from −130 to −121 and from −74 to −65, are 5′-CCCCACCCCT-3′ and 5′-TGGGGAGGAG-3′, respectively. We term them “core sequences” 1 (CS1) and 2 (CS2), respectively (see Fig. 4, A and B). To determine whether the core sequences are important for binding of nuclear factors, oligonucleotides containing mutations within these sequences were examined for competition in EMSA. As shown for probe Com2 in Fig. 4 A, a mutation within CS1 (mutant 1) abolished its competition. Similarly for probe Com4, mutations within CS2 (mutants 2 and 3) abolished competition, whereas mutations in other regions had no effect (mutants 4 and 5) (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that CS1 and CS2 are essential for the sequence from −139 to −55 to bind nuclear proteins from hypertrophic chondrocytes. To determine whether Com2 and Com4 bind the same proteins, these sequences were used to compete with each other in EMSA. Shown in Fig. 4 A, Com4 competed with the probe Com2 and the competition was abolished by the mutation within CS2 (mutant 2). Likewise, Com2 competed with the probe Com4, and the competition was eliminated by a mutation within CS1 (mutant 1) (Fig. 4 B). Thus, CS1 and CS2 appear to be involved in binding the same proteins. A computer search identified 70% similarity between the core sequences and the consensus binding site for Sp1 and its related proteins. To determine whether it is Sp1 family proteins that are responsible for the binding to the core sequences in hypertrophic chondrocytes, we first performed additional competition assays using EMSA. In these assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either a wild-type or a mutant Sp1 binding site were used as competitors for binding. As shown in Fig. 5 A, in reactions using either Com2 or Com4 as a probe, the wild-type Sp1 oligonucleotide (lanes 4 and 10) disrupted formation of the two major complexes (arrows), whereas the mutant oligonucleotide Sp1′, with a two-nucleotide alteration (see “Materials and Methods” for sequences), did not (lanes 5 and 11). These results indicate that the Sp1 binding sequence specifically competes with both Com2 and Com4 for the binding. To determine whether the core sequences bind Sp1, we performed supershift experiments using an antibody against this protein. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lanes 6 and 12), the bottom band of the two main complexes (arrows) detected by Com2 and Com4 was supershifted by the Sp1 antibody. The upper band, however, does not appear to be shifted by the antibody. Thus, the lower band contains Sp1, whereas the upper band may contain a related family member. Overall, together with the competition data above, these results establish that both CS1 and CS2 bind Sp1. A similar observation was also made with nuclear extracts from nonhypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 5 B). Specifically, probes Com2 (lane 13) and Com4 (lane 18) both detected two major complexes that were competed out by the Sp1 sequence (lanes 15 and 20) but not by the mutant Sp1′ oligonucleotide (lanes 16 and 21). Of the two complexes, the lower but not the upper band was also supershifted by the Sp1 antibody (lanes 17 and 22). Therefore, as in hypertrophic chondrocytes, Sp1 and its related proteins are also present and bind to the core sequences in nonhypertrophic chondrocytes. However, the ratio of the two complexes appears different between hypertrophic and nonhypertrophic chondrocytes. For instance, the bottom band formed by Com4 predominates over the upper band in nonhypertrophic chondrocytes (lane 18) whereas the two appear similar in intensity in hypertrophic chondrocytes (lane 8). These differences presumably reflect differential expression of the Sp1 family members in the different cell types, which could be important for cell-specific regulation of the type X collagen gene (see “Discussion”). To determine whether Sp1 family binding is functionally important for regulating expression of the type X collagen gene, we performed transfection experiments with mutant constructs. The mutations, in either CS1 or CS2 or both (Fig. 6 A), were introduced into the construct pCAT VII and the effects of these alterations were examined for changes in the expression levels. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a mutated CS1 (pCAT XIII) reduced expression by approximately 2-fold (compared with pCAT VII), and mutations in both CS1 and CS2 (pCAT XV) completely abolished expression (i.e. reduced it to the level of pCAT X). Likewise, a mutated CS2 alone (pCAT XIV) also eliminated expression. These data, when taken together with the results that these mutations abolish binding (see above), demonstrate that the binding of these Sp1 family proteins at both CS1 and CS2 are important for high level expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Furthermore, the binding of Sp1 proteins at CS2 appears to be indispensable. In the present study, we have uncovered a number of potentialcis-acting elements involved in the transcriptional control of the chicken type X collagen gene. Most notably, an 85-bp sequence from nt −139 to −55 contained a potent positive regulatory activity and this sequence, in conjunction with a short fragment containing the TATA box (nt −54 to +5), was sufficient to direct high level expression in a cell-specific manner. Detailed analysis of this region revealed two noncanonical Sp1 binding sites, whose binding to Sp1 family proteins appeared to be critical for high level expression of the gene in hypertrophic chondrocytes. The present study suggests that the Sp1 family proteins mediate the expression of type X collagen in a cell-specific manner. Similar cell-specific regulation by these factors has also been reported for other matrix genes, including those of collagens and elastin (27Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

One is based on information showing that not all members of the family produce the same regulation. For instance, it is known that Sp3 functions as an inhibitor, whereas Sp1 is an activator (29Conn K.J. Rich C.B. Jensen D.E. Fontanilla M.R. Bashir M.M. Rosenbloom J. Foster J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28853-28860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Thus it is conceivable that, in chondrocytes at different stages of maturation, regulation is achieved by the relative level or availability of these factors. This is of particular interest in light of our gel shift data, which showed differential relative intensities for the bands of Sp1 family proteins in hypertrophic versus nonhypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 5). Furthermore, since Sp1 is a phosphoprotein (32Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 33Leggett R.W.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 28: 279-286PubMed Google Scholar), its phosphorylation status in different cell types could influence its regulatory function in a cell-specific manner. Alternatively, other protein-DNA interactions in the promoter may influence the function of Sp1 proteins in nonhypertrophic chondrocytes. In support of this possibility, our preliminary data showed that when an 85-bp fragment (−139 to −55) containing the Sp1 sites and their neighboring sequence was used as an EMSA probe, three additional bands exclusive to nonhypertrophic chondrocytes were detected, in addition to the two major Sp1 complexes (data not shown). Two of the three bands appear to represent higher order Sp1 complexes. The third band, however, seems to be a separate entity, since its formation occurs more efficiently in the absence of Sp1 binding. These observations, when coupled with the result that this 85-bp sequence conferred cell specificity in transfections, suggest a possible inhibitory mechanism in the nonhypertrophic chondrocytes. Nonetheless, Sp1 appears to be critical for the high level expression of type X collagen in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Nucleotide comparisons of the type X collagen gene across several species revealed that the Sp1 binding site CS2 identified in this study is greatly conserved throughout evolution (see Table III). For instance, the promoter for the human gene contains an element that is 90% identical with the chicken CS2, despite the fact that the overall similarity between the two species from nt −100 to −1 is only about 60%.Table IIIConservation of a Sp1 binding site (CS2) across speciesSpeciesSequencePositionReferenceHuman5′-AGGGGAGGAG-3′nt −80 to −71(36Thomas J.T.

This is suggested both by the competition analyses in which Com4 (containing CS2) competed better than Com2 (containing CS1) (Fig. 3 B), and by the mutation study where probe 2 (with a mutated CS1) bound Sp1 more efficiently than probe 1 (with a mutated CS2) (data not shown). This differential binding affinity is consistent with the greater reduction of expression in transfections by the mutation in CS2versus that in CS1 (see Fig. 6 B). The mechanism(s) by which CS1 and CS2 combinatorially regulate expression of the gene remain to be investigated. Nonetheless, CS2 appears to play a pivotal role for activation of the gene. Activation by CS1 is not only synergistic with that by CS2 but also seems to be dependent upon the presence of CS2. The present study also revealed several other potential regulatory regions in the promoter of the type X collagen gene. For instance, the sequence from nt −562 to −413 appeared to have a positive regulatory activity. Conversely, the fragment from nt −3163 to −563 and that from nt −412 to −140 seemed to repress expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes. Further studies, however, are required to elucidate the regulation in these regions. Taken together, the results from this study suggest that multiple cis-acting regulatory elements exist within the proximal promoter region of the chicken type X collagen gene and that Sp1 family proteins mediate signals promoting the cell-specific expression of the type X collagen gene."

In the mouse, ath3expression initially occurs widely in the developing nervous system and then gradually becomes restricted to the neural retina. Here, we characterized the genomic organization and promoter activity of mouseath3 (Math3). Math3 gene consists of two exons separated by an 8-kilobase intron, and the whole protein-coding region is located in the second exon. Transcription starts at two sites, which are 75 nucleotides apart from each other, and there is no typical TATA box in the upstream region of either start site. Transient transfection analysis showed that the 5′-region of Math3 can direct efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells but not in glioma or fibroblast cells. Deletion studies revealed that the proximal 193-base pair region, which contains the downstream transcription initiation site but not the upstream site, is essential for the Math3 promoter activity and can direct efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells. In contrast, retrovirus-mediated promoter analysis demonstrated that a region further upstream is additionally necessary for retinal expression. These results indicate that Math3 promoter contains two essential regulatory regions, the proximal 193-base pair region, which confers efficient neural-specific expression, and a region further upstream, required for retinal expression. ath3, a vertebrate basic helix-loop-helix gene homologous to Drosophila proneural gene atonal, can directly convert non-neural cells into neurons with the anterior features.

Transient transfection analysis showed that the 5′-region of Math3 can direct efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells but not in glioma or fibroblast cells. Deletion studies revealed that the proximal 193-base pair region, which contains the downstream transcription initiation site but not the upstream site, is essential for the Math3 promoter activity and can direct efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells. In contrast, retrovirus-mediated promoter analysis demonstrated that a region further upstream is additionally necessary for retinal expression. These results indicate that Math3 promoter contains two essential regulatory regions, the proximal 193-base pair region, which confers efficient neural-specific expression, and a region further upstream, required for retinal expression. Recent studies demonstrated that vertebrate neuronal differentiation is controlled positively and negatively by multiple basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); INL, inner nuclear layer; Math3, mouse atonal homolog 3; ONL, outer nuclear layer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s); INL, inner nuclear layer; Math3, mouse atonal homolog 3; ONL, outer nuclear layer; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside.genes in an analogous way to Drosophila regulators (1Kageyama R.

For example, in Drosophila the bHLH genes of achaete-scute complex promote neuronal differentiation, whereas other bHLH genes, hairy and Enhancer of split, functionally antagonize achaete-scute complex and inhibit neuronal differentiation (3Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1993; 75: 827-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Likewise, in mammals the bHLH gene Mash1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila achaete-scute complex, promotes neuronal differentiation (4Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), whereas the bHLH gene Hes1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila hairy and Enhancer of split, antagonizes Mash1 and inhibits neuronal differentiation (5Sasai Y.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, the structures and functions of bHLH genes have been well conserved during evolution. Balance between these positive and negative bHLH genes is critical for normal neural development (4Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J. Joyner A.L.

Some of them are shown to promote neuronal differentiation in Xenopus(9Lee J.E. Hollenberg S.M. Snider L. Turner D.L. Lipnick N. Weintraub H. Science. 1995; 268: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 10Ma Q. Kintner C. Anderson D.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Among them, ath3 is unique because it is specifically expressed in the anterior neural tissues such as the forebrain, cranial ganglions, and retina and can generate neurons with the anterior features in Xenopus embryos (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, ath3 exhibits not only the anterior-specific expression but also the anterior-specific neurogenic activity. Furthermore, ath3 can induce expression of the photoreceptor-specific gene opsin (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that ath3 may play an important role in retinal differentiation. In the mouse, ath3 expression occurs widely in the developing nervous system at early stages but then gradually becomes restricted to the anterior region like Xenopus ath3 (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After birth, ath3 expression is detected only in the neural retina (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, ath3 shows two modes of the expression patterns during neural development; the initial general expression in the nervous system and the subsequent retina-specific expression. In this study, to understand the molecular mechanism of neural-specific gene expression, we cloned mouse ath3(Math3) gene and characterized its promoter activity. We found that the 5′-region of Math3 confers neural-specific gene expression. Furthermore, deletion study revealed that the proximal 193-bp region of Math3 promoter can direct efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells, whereas a region further upstream is necessary for retinal expression. Thus, these results suggest that the two modes of Math3 expression are controlled by two separate regulatory elements in the 5′-region of Math3 gene. The mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened by hybridization with the Math3 cDNA as a probe. Nine clones were isolated from 9 × 105 plaques. The fragments hybridized positively were subcloned into pBluescript and subjected to sequence analysis. For Southern blot analysis, the tail DNA was digested by restriction enzymes, electrophoresed on 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane filter. The 32P-labeled Math3cDNA was hybridized at 65 °C in solution containing 0.2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS. For the primer extension experiment, primer 4, 5′-CTCTTTCCCGGGGTCAGCTCCCGCGAGTAG-3′ (corresponding to the region from +175 to +204), was labeled at the 5′-end, hybridized to the mouse retina poly(A) RNA, and subjected to reverse transcription, as described previously (23Takebayashi K. Akazawa C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1342-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the reverse transcription-mediated PCR, the following primers in addition to primer 4 were used; primer 1, 5′-ACACGCAGTGGCAAAGCTGG-3′ (−20 to −1); primer 2, 5′-ACCTGGTCAGAGAAGCCTTG-3′ (+1 to +20); and primer 3, 5′-TGGTCAGCAGCCAAAACCAG-3′ (+85 to +104). Sets of primers 1 and 4, primers 2 and 4, and primers 3 and 4 were used to detect 224- , 204-, and 120-bp bands, respectively. After 30 cycles of reaction (94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min), the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel. The reporter plasmids contained the firefly luciferase gene under the control of various lengths of Math3 promoter or the SV40 promoter. 1 μg of a reporter plasmid was transfected with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) into Neuro2a, NCB20 neuroblastoma brain hybrid cells, C6 glioma, or C3H10T1/2 cells, which were plated in 6-multiwell plates at the density of 2–4 × 105/well. 0.1 μg of the plasmid containing Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (pHSVtk-RL) was also transfected as an internal standard to normalize the transfection efficiency. Medium was changed after incubation with the transfection complex at 37 °C for 6 h, and cells were further incubated at 37 °C. After 42–48 h, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured. For construction of pLNSZ, which directs lacZ expression from the SV40 promoter and neo expression from the upstream long terminal repeat, the bacterial lacZ reporter gene was ligated into the HindIII site of pLNSX (24Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). For the Math3promoter constructs (pLNMZ), the SV40 promoter region was removed from pLNSZ by BamHI and HindIII digestion, and various lengths of the Math3 promoter fragments were ligated into the BamHI and HindIII sites. Retrovirus was produced by transfecting the retroviral DNA constructs into the packaging cell line ψ2mp34 (a kind gift of Dr. Kazuhiro Ikenaka). Retrovirus solution was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and concentrated, as described previously (6Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The viral titer determined by neo-resistance was usually 1 × 105colony-forming units/ml. Retinal explants were prepared from E17.5-E18.5 mouse embryos and infected with 30 μl of retrovirus on the first day of culture, as described previously (8Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The explants were placed onto a Millicell chamber filter (Millipore, diameter 30 mm, pore size 0.4 μm) with the ganglion cell layer upward. The chambers were transferred into 6-multiwell plates that contained in each well 0.8 ml of 50% minimum Eagle's medium with HEPES, 25% Hank's solution, 25% heat-inactivated horse serum, 200 μml-glutamine, and 6.75 mg/ml glucose (25Caffé A.R. Visser H. Jansen H.G. Sanyal S. Curr. Eye Res. 1989; 8: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Sparrow J.R. Hicks D. Barnstable C.J. Dev. Brain Res. 1990; 51: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The explants were maintained at 34 °C in 5% CO2. After 2 weeks the explants were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 30 min, stained with X-gal solution (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside, 35 mm potassium ferricyanide, 35 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.01% deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated in 25% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. The samples were frozen and sectioned at 10–16-μm thickness. To understand the molecular mechanism of neural-specific gene expression, we clonedMath3 gene. Nine overlapping genomic clones were isolated from 9 × 105 plaques of a mouse genomic library by using the Math3 cDNA as a probe. Sequence comparison with the full-length Math3 cDNA revealed thatMath3 gene encompassed a 12-kb region and consisted of two exons; the first exon contained only the 5′-noncoding region, whereas the second exon contained the whole protein-coding region (Fig. 1). The feature that the whole coding region is present in a single exon is also observed in Math1, Math2, and Mash1 genes (16Akazawa C. Ishibashi M. Shimizu C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8730-8738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 17Shimizu C. Akazawa C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,27Guillemot F. Joyner A.L. Mech. Dev. 1993; 42: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), suggesting that these neural bHLH genes originated from a common ancestral gene. The two exons of Math3 were separated by an intron with the size of approximately 8 kb (Fig. 1 B). Southern blot analysis using the tail DNA showed that the sizes of the hybridized DNA bands were identical to those of the cloned fragments (data not shown). Previously, we isolated two types of Math3 cDNAs that differed only in the 5′-noncoding region; a 275-nucleotide 5′-noncoding region was deleted in the major species when compared with the minor one. 2H. Tsuda, K. Takebayashi, S. Nakanishi, and R. Kageyama, unpublished data. This deleted portion corresponded to the region from the nucleotide residues 205–479 of Math3 gene (the first transcription initiation site is designated as the nucleotide residue +1; see below), indicating that the major species used the region upstream of the residue 205 as the first exon, whereas the minor species used the region extending to 479 as the first exon (Fig. 1 A). In both cases, the exon-intron boundary conformed to the GT-AG rule (Fig. 1 A). The 3′-noncoding region was 2239 residues long, and the putative polyadenylation signal AATAAA was present at the residue 3698, which was 17 nucleotides upstream of the polyadenylation site (data not shown). To determine the transcription initiation site, we first performed a primer extension experiment. The labeled antisense primer corresponding to the region from the nucleotide residue +175 to +204 was hybridized to retinal RNA and subjected to reverse transcription. This analysis demonstrated two specific bands with the sizes of 204 and 129 nucleotides (Fig. 2 A, lane 1, arrows), suggesting that transcription initiates at two sites, the nucleotide residues +1 and +76. In many promoters that lack the TATA box, transcription starts at multiple sites. Consistent with this notion, there was no typical TATA box in the upstream region of either transcription start site of Math3 gene (Fig. 1 A). Instead, upstream of the first initiation site (+1) there was an AT-rich region (tttaaacaaaaacaaa) at −35, and upstream of the second site (+76) there was a G-rich region (ggggagggg) at +49, which could be recognized by Sp1. To confirm that no transcription initiates in the further upstream region, we next carried out reverse transcription-mediated PCR with retinal RNA (Fig. 2 B). Whereas a set of the primers 1 (corresponding to the region from −20 to −1) and 4 (+175 to +204) gave rise to no specific bands (lane 9), sets of primers 2 (+1 to +20) and 4 and of primers 3 (+85 to +104) and 4 each generated a single band only after reverse transcription (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 7 and 8). These results clearly showed that the region downstream from +1 was transcribed, but the further upstream region was not. To characterize the mechanism for neural-specific gene expression, the promoter activity of Math3 gene was examined by a transient transfection method. A reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the 5′-region of Math3 gene (from −2.8 kb to +196) was transfected into neuroblastoma, glioma, and fibroblast cell lines. The control SV40 promoter showed 30- to 40-fold activation in these cells when compared with the promoter-less construct (Fig. 3). The Math3 promoter directed a higher level of expression than the SV40 promoter in neuroblastoma cells, NCB20 and Neuro2a: 2.5-fold higher in NCB20 and 1.7-fold higher in Neuro2a (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, the Math3 promoter exhibited much lower activity than the SV40 promoter in other cell types: only 20% activity in C6 glioma cells and 15% activity in C3H10T1/2 fibroblast cells as compared with the SV40 promoter (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicated that the 5′-region of Math3 gene can direct neuronal-specific expression. The intron region was also tested by a transient transfection method, but the addition of the intron did not up-regulate neuronal expression (data not shown). To determine the regulatory elements responsible forMath3 expression, a series of deletion constructs of the 5′-region were tested in Neuro2a and NCB20 cells. Deletion from −2.8 kb to −1197 led to a 50–70% decrease in the promoter activity in these cells, suggesting that there is a neural-specific positive element in this region (Fig. 4, A and C). However, further deletion from −1197 to +4, which lost the upstream transcription initiation site (+1), only showed a small decrease. Thus, the region from +4 to +196 still retained ∼20% of the promoter activity as compared with that of the −2.8-kb construct in both Neuro2a and NCB20 cells (Fig. 4, A and C), suggesting that the upstream transcription start site was dispensible in these cells. We next tested the 5′ fragments that lacked the region from +5 to +196 but contained the first transcription initiation site. However, these fragments, including the one spanning from −2.8 kb to +4, did not show the promoter activity (Fig. 4, A and C), indicating that the first transcription initiation site was not functional in the absence of the downstream region. In addition, these results suggest that the region upstream of −1197, which significantly up-regulated the promoter activity, depended upon the proximal region from +5 to +196. Thus, the region from +5 to +196 that contained the second transcription initiation site was essential for the Math3 promoter activity. To further narrow the essential regions, we made various deletions from the region between +4 and +196. However, whereas deletion from +4 to +31 retained a very weak activity, any further deletion led to almost complete loss of the promoter activity (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicated that most of the region from +4 to +196 that consisted of the 72-bp upstream region, the second transcription initiation site (+76), and the 121-bp downstream regions were required for the promoter activity. Thus, the 193-bp region constituted a minimal promoter that was essential for Math3expression in neural cells. The low activity of Math3 promoter in non-neural cells could be due to the presence of a transcriptional repressor in non-neural cells. To test this possibility, various deletion constructs of Math3 promoter were transfected into C3H10T1/2 cells. However, none of the deletion constructs showed up-regulation of the promoter activity (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that there is no non-neural cell-specific repressor region in Math3 promoter. Thus, it is likely that the low activity of Math3 promoter in non-neural cells is due to the absence of transcriptional activators in such cells. Math3expression initially occurs in various regions of the developing nervous system but later becomes restricted to the neural retina (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the adult retina, Math3 is expressed at a high level in the outer region of the inner nuclear layer (INL), where bipolar and horizontal cells are present (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To determine the promoter regions necessary for retinal cell type-specific expression, retrovirus-mediated promoter analysis was performed (28Ikenaka K. Nakahira K. Nakajima K. Fujimoto I. Kagawa T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. New Biol. 1992; 4: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). We generated recombinant retroviruses that direct lacZ expression under the control of the SV40 promoter or various lengths of Math3promoter (Fig. 5, A and D and Table I). The explants of the developing retina, known to well mimic the in vivodevelopment (8Tomita K. Ishibashi M. Nakahara K. Ang S.-L. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R.

Brain Res. 1990; 51: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), were prepared from mouse embryos at day 17.5 or 18.5 and infected with these retroviruses. Only mitotic cells are infected with retrovirus, and once infected, cells precisely transmit the virus genome to their daughter cells. After 14 days of culture, at which time neuronal differentiation was finished, the retinal explants were stained with X-gal. If the promoter was functional, virus-infected cells should become blue after X-gal staining. It has been shown that during the postnatal period, the newly differentiating cells are mostly rods (almost 80%) and bipolar cells (∼10%) (29Turner D.L. Cepko C.L.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 5, the SV40 promoter directed lacZexpression in various retinal cell types, such as rods and bipolar cells. More than 80% of the labeled cells were rods, which are located in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), and ∼10% were bipolar cells, which are present in the INL (Fig. 5, B and C and TableI). The other retinal cell types that were labeled with X-gal constituted about 2% of the total infected cells. Thus, the ratios of these labeled cell types well reflected the cells that differentiate during this period, indicating that the SV40 promoter functioned well in all retinal cell types. In contrast to the SV40 promoter, the region from −1197 to +196 of Math3 promoter directed lacZ expression specifically in the INL neurons, and no rods were labeled (Fig. 5, E and F and Table I). Furthermore, about 80% of the labeled cells were located in the outer region of the INL (TableI), where Math3 is mainly expressed (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 5′-region of Math3 gene conferred the INL cell-specific expression, well mimicking neuronal type-specific Math3expression. The region from −671 to +196 also directed the INL neuron-specific expression and, in addition, more than 80% of the labeled cells were present in the outer region of the INL (Table I). For this Math3 promoter activity in retinal neurons, the proximal 193-bp region was essential, because the 5′-region from −671 to +4 failed to induce lacZ expression (Table I). Interestingly, the region from +4 to +196, which was able to induce as efficient expression as the −671 to +196 promoter in neuroblastoma cells, did not direct expression in retinal cells (Table I). Thus, the upstream region between −671 and +4, which was not essential for expression in neuroblastoma cells, was required for retinal cell type-specific expression. These results demonstrated thatMath3 expression is controlled by at least two separate regions, the 193-bp minimal promoter required for neural expression and the upstream region essential for retinal cell type-specific expression. In this study, we isolated and characterized Math3 gene and showed that the 5′-region of Math3 gene confers the cell type-specific expression. The 5′-region can direct efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells but not in other cell types. Interestingly, the proximal 193-bp region (from nucleotide residue +4 to +196), which consists of the 72-bp upstream region, the second transcription initiation site (+76), and the 121-bp 5′-noncoding region, which lacks the first transcription initiation site (+1), is sufficient for efficient expression in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, this 193-bp region is essential forMath3 expression, since the region further upstream that contains the first transcription initiation site but lacks the proximal 193-bp region cannot direct expression in neuroblastoma cells. Even the region from −2.8 kb to +5 did not show the promoter activity. Thus, the upstream regulatory region seems to depend upon the proximal 193-bp region. Interestingly, this proximal 193-bp region cannot direct expression in retinal cells. A region further upstream, which is not essential for expression in neuroblastoma cells, is required for retinal expression, indicating that Math3 expression is controlled by at least two separate regions, the proximal 193-bp region and a region further upstream; addition of the region from −671 to +3 conferred the INL-specific expression in the retina. This retinal expression was mainly observed in the outer region of the INL, where Math3is expressed at the highest level, suggesting that this upstream region contains the retinal cell type-specific regulatory element. During development, Math3 shows two different modes of expression: the initial wide distribution in the developing nervous system and later restriction to the subsets of the INL cells in the retina (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the initial wide distribution may be controlled by the proximal region, whereas the later retinal-specific expression may be regulated by the upstream region. It is very important to identify the transcription factors that interact with the Math3 promoter elements. We previously found that neural-specific expression of the bHLH factor Hes5 is regulated by multiple repeats of GC-rich elements (23Takebayashi K. Akazawa C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1342-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A neural-specific factor interacts with these GC-rich elements and may be responsible for Hes5 expression (23Takebayashi K. Akazawa C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1342-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the proximal 193-bp region of Math3 promoter, there is a GC-rich element similar to those of Hes5 promoter in the upstream region of the second transcription start site. Thus, it is possible that this GC-rich region may be responsible for neural-specific expression of Math3. For retinal gene expression, it has been demonstrated that several transcription factors such as Pax6, Chx10, and Rx are essential; in the absence of Pax6 or Rx, eyes do not develop (31Hill R.E. Favor J. Hogan B.L.M. Ton C.C.T. Saunders G.F. Hanson I.M. Prosser J. Jordan T. Hastie N.D. van Heyningen V. Nature. 1991; 354: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar, 32Gruss P. Walther C. Cell. 1992; 69: 719-722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 33Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and in the absence of Chx10, bipolar cells do not differentiate (34Burmeister M. Novak J. Liang M.-Y. Basu S. Ploder L. Hawes N.L. Vidgen D. Hoover F. Goldman D. Kalnins V.I. Roderick T.H. Taylor B.A. Hankin M.H. McInnes R.R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Particularly, Math3 and Chx10 expressions are quite similar in the retina; expressions of both genes begin in progenitor cells at early stages of retinal development, become restricted to the INL at later stages, and continue in the INL in the adult (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Liu I.S.V. Chen J. Ploder L. Vidgen D. van der Kooy D. Kalnins V.I. McInnes R.R. Neuron. 1994; 13: 377-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, Chx10 may regulate Math3 expression in the retina. However, coexpression of Chx10 did not up-regulate the Math3 promoter activity in neuroblastoma or fibroblast cells,2 thus suggesting that Chx10 may not directly regulate Math3expression. In Math3 promoter, there is an E box sequence at −177, which is a potential Math3 target site. Thus, Math3 could up-regulate its own expression, as observed in the case of the muscle determination factor MyoD, which positively autoregulates its own expression by directly binding to the promoter (36Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, in transient transfection analysis with neuroblastoma and fibroblast cells, overexpression of Math3 failed to up-regulate the Math3 promoter activity, suggesting that Math3 does not positively autoregulate its expression or that factors required for Math3 function are missing in the cells that we used. We previously showed that continuous expression of Hes1 inhibits neuronal differentiation and that, conversely, Hes1-null mutation leads to up-regulation of Mash1 and premature neuronal differentiation in the retina (6Ishibashi M. Moriyoshi K. Sasai Y. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1799-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 7Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that Hes1 regulates the timing of differentiation by inhibiting Mash1 activity. These data raise the interesting possibility that Hes1 could also target to Math3 for inhibition of differentiation in the retina. For example, there is an N box sequence at −107 that can be recognized by Hes1. However, in transient transfection assay, Hes1 failed to repressMath3 promoter activity in neuroblastoma cells.2Thus, Hes1 does not functionally antagonize Math3 at the transcriptional level, but it is still possible that Hes1 could inhibit the activity of Math3 at the protein level, because Hes1 can inhibit the activity of other bHLH factors such as Mash1 and MyoD through protein-protein interaction (5Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). It was shown that activation of the membrane protein Notch also inhibits neuronal differentiation in the retina (37Dorsky R.I. Rapaport D.H. Harris W.A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 38Bao Z.-Z. Cepko C.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is suggested that Notch-induced suppression of differentiation requires induction of Hes1 (39Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Similar to the case of Hes1, the active form of Notch failed to repress Math3 promoter activity in transient transfection assay.2 Characterization of the Math3 function is another important issue. In Xenopus, ath3 can induce retinal neuronal differentiation, and it is likely that Math3 also regulates retinal differentiation. Interestingly, Xenopus and mouse ath3, both, contain a possible phosphorylation site in the basic region, and in Xenopus, mutation of this site into Asp, which mimics the phosphorylation of this site, retains a general neurogenic activity but severely impairs the retinal differentiation activity (12Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We speculate that in mice, ath3 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation of the basic region and that retinal differentiation may be induced by a nonphosphorylated form of Math3. We previously showed that Math3 (locus symbol:Atoh3) is located on chromosome 10 (40Isaka F. Shimizu C. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Genomics. 1996; 37: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and closely links to eye blebs (eb) mutation, which shows eye anomalies (41Chapman D.B. Hummel K.P. Mouse News Lett. 1963; 28: 32Google Scholar). However, Southern blot analysis indicated that there is no major insertion or deletion in Math3 gene of eb mutant mice.2 Furthermore, there are many more defects in eb, including the kidney and limb, which are different from the regions expressing Math3. Therefore, the two genes Math3 and eb may be different. Now that the structure of Math3 was characterized, we can proceed to in vivo functional analysis such as loss-of-function assay in mice by targeted gene disruption.

Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 is a voltage-dependent K+ channel composed of α and β proteins that are widely expressed in the brain. Expression of this channel in Xenopus oocytes resulted in a current that had fast inactivating and noninactivating components. Previously we showed that basal and protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation of the α subunit at Ser-446 decreases the fraction of the noninactivating component. In this study we investigated the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on the channel. We showed that a PKC-activating phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)) increased the noninactivating fraction via activation of a PKC subtype that was inhibited by staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide but not by calphostin C. However, it was not a PKC-induced phosphorylation but rather a dephosphorylation that mediated the effect. PMA reduced the basal phosphorylation of Ser-446 significantly in plasma membrane channels and failed to affect the inactivation of channels having an α subunit that was mutated at Ser-446. Also, the activation of coexpressed mGluR1a known to activate phospholipase C mimicked the effect of PMA on the inactivation via induction of dephosphorylation at Ser-446. Thus, this study identified a potential neuronal pathway initiated by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a coupled to a signaling cascade that possibly utilized PKC to induce dephosphorylation and thereby to decrease the extent of inactivation of a K+ channel.

It is now well accepted that modulation of activity of voltage-gated K+ channel by protein kinases and phosphatases can regulate neuronal excitability (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Jonas E.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar and 2Breitwieser G.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We could correlate the modulation of the channel activity by the unidentified kinase and by PKA with phosphorylation of Ser-446 on the cytoplasmic C terminus of the α subunit. In the case of PKC, however, mutations of the numerous putative phosphorylation sites on the α subunit did not eliminate the modulation by PKC (5Peretz T. Levin G. Moran O. Thornhill W.B. Chikvashvili D. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mammalian Shaker family homologues such as Kv1.1 may normally exist as heteromultimers of α with β subunits that supply the pore-occluding domain that confers fast inactivation upon coexpression of the two subunits in heterologous systems (6Rettig J.

Part of the interaction is probably mediated by a native post-synaptic density-95-like protein of the oocyte that recognizes the C-terminal end of the α subunit (9Jing J. Peretz T. Singer-Lahat D.

In this work we studied the effect of PKC on the extent of fast inactivation of the Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 channel. We showed that the PKC effect is opposite that of PKA, and it is mediated by dephosphorylation of Ser-446 that is phosphorylated by PKA. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. mGluRs participate in synaptic plasticity, both in long term potentiation and long term depression, as well as in neurotoxicity and neuroprotection (for reviews see Refs. 11Hollman M.

Group I of mGluRs comprises mGluR1 (the longer splice variant is mGluR1a) and mGluR5 that activate phospholipase C (probably via coupling to Gq class of G proteins) and thereby activate a large endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride current (19Masu M.

In this study we identify a potential physiological pathway initiated by activation of mGluR1a coupled to a signaling cascade that possibly utilizes PKC to modulate the extent of inactivation of Kv1.1/Kvβ1.1 channel.

Vanadate (sodium orthovanadate) and okadaic acid were from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem); bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) and calyculin A were from Calbiochem; cyclosporin A was a gift from Sandoz Pharmaceutical, Basel, Switzerland. [35S]Methionine/cysteine mix and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Corp. Kv1.1 antiserum was generated against a 23-amino acid peptide that corresponds to the N terminus of Kv1.1 (SGENADEASAAPGHPQDGSYPRQ), as described (3Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G.

Kvβ1.1 cDNA was a gift of Dr. Pongs (Hamburg, Germany). mGluR1a cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan). Frogs (Xenopus laevis) were maintained and dissected, and their oocytes were prepared as described (22Dascal N. Lotan I. Methods Mol. Biol. 1992; 13: 205-225Google Scholar). Previously (8Levin G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) we showed that coinjection of Kv1.1 (α) and Kvβ1.1 (β) mRNAs in a 1 to 30 ratio is enough to saturate α with β and to render over 90% of the channels in the form of αβ in the plasma membrane. Thus, for biochemical studies oocytes were injected (50 nl/oocyte) with 100–200 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 3–7 μg/μl Kvβ1.1 mRNAs. For electrophysiological studies a ratio of 1 to 100 was used as done previously (8Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to ensure saturation of α with β beyond any doubt; thus, 2–5 ng/μl Kv1.1 and 200–500 ng/μl Kvβ1.1 mRNAs were injected. 5 ng/μl mGluR1a mRNA were injected for both electrophysiological and biochemical studies. The concentrations of the injected S446A mRNA deviated slightly from the above concentrations as it was adjusted to give current amplitudes similar to wild type. Injected oocytes were incubated at 22 °C for 1–4 days in ND96 solution (8Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and then assayed either electrophysiologically or biochemically. Oocytes injected with mGluR1a were injected with 20 nl of 50 mm K+-EGTA (pH 7.6) 2–6 h before the electrophysiological experiment; this corresponds to ∼1 mm EGTA in the oocyte. Staurosporine (3 mm in Me2SO stock, 3 μm final), calphostin C (5 mm in Me2SO stock, 5 μm final), BIS (2.5 mm in water stock, 5 μm final), okadaic acid (2 mm in Me2SO stock, 2 μm final), calyculin A (2 mm in Me2SO stock, 0.3 μm final), and cyclosporin A (33 mm in ethanol/Tween 80 1:2 stock, 250 μmfinal) were added to the standard NDE solution in which the oocytes were incubated for at least 2 h before the experiment; all the stock solutions were kept at −20 °C except for that of cyclosporin A which was prepared daily (the solution of calphostin C was exposed to daylight for its activation). Control solutions always included the same concentration of the vehicle as in the corresponding solutions containing the drug of choice. 10 nm β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (β-PMA) and α-PMA were applied by constant bath perfusion after stability of the current had been verified for at least 5 min. 100 μm glutamate was bath perfused for 1 min and then washed away. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To avoid possible errors introduced by series resistance, only current amplitudes up to 4 μA were recorded, and in a given experiment the amplitudes of WT and mutant currents were similar. Also, the currents in mGluR1a-injected oocytes had similar amplitudes (achieved by injection of larger amounts of channel mRNAs). Currents were elicited by stepping the membrane potential from a holding potential of −80 mV to +50 mV for 160 ms. Current-voltage relationships were obtained by 160-ms depolarizing steps from −80 mV to the indicated voltages. Net current was obtained by subtraction of the scaled leak current elicited by a voltage step from −80 to −90 mV. Oocytes having a leak current of more than 3 nA/1 mV were discarded. Intervals of 20 s between each trace allowed for recovery from inactivation. The time course of the decay phase of the current was fitted with a sum of two exponential components. The slow component had a time constant of several tens of milliseconds, thus representing inactivation distinct from the fast inactivation of the fast component. The time constant of the fast component (τinact) is referred to below. This was done essentially as described (4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Following injection of mRNA(s), six to eight oocytes were incubated at 22 °C for 2–4 days in NDE containing 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys. Before homogenization oocytes were incubated with either 100 or 10 nm PMA for 25 min in a dark environment or with 100 μm glutamate for 1 min, as required by the experiment. Homogenization was done in 150–300 μl of medium consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline supplemented with protein phosphatase inhibitors as follows: 50 nm okadaic acid, 0.5 mm vanadate, and 50 mm KF. Yolk was removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. After addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 4%, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C, antiserum was added to the supernatant for 16 h. After 1 h incubation with protein A-Sepharose, immunoprecipitates were washed four times with immunowash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100); the final wash contained no Triton. Samples were boiled in SDS-gel loading buffer and electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide-SDS gel (SDS-PAGE). Plasma membranes were separated mechanically, as described (3Ivanina T. Perets T.

Defolliculated oocytes were placed for 10 min in ice-cold hypotonic solution (5 mm NaCl, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin, and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors, as specified above. Plasma membranes together with the vitelline membranes (extracellular collagen-like matrix) were removed manually with watchmaker's forceps. Ten internal fractions or 20–30 plasma membranes were processed as described for whole oocytes. This was done essentially as described (23Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Chibalin A.V. Burgener-Kairuz P. Jaisser F. Mathews P.M. Rossier B.C. Cotecchia S. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24437-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yolk-free homogenates of 10 oocytes that were injected with mRNA(s) 2–3 days before homogenization were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitors (as above) in a final volume of 100 μl at 25 °C for 40 min in the presence of 100 nm PMA, 1.5 mm CaCl2 with either 3 mm ATP or 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Phosphatase inhibitors (as above) were added, and the following steps were as described above for [35S]Met/Cys labeling. Gels were dried and placed in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) cassette for about 1 day. Using the software ImageQuant, a digitized scan was derived, and relative intensities of protein bands were estimated quantitatively by the software ImageQuant as described (4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.E.; n denotes the number of oocytes assayed. Student'st test was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences between two populations. Previously (5Peretz T. Levin G. Moran O. Thornhill W.B. Chikvashvili D. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) we showed that oocytes injected with Kv1.1 (α) RNA and assayed by the two-electrode voltage clamp technique express a delayed rectifier type of K+current (α current) that is modulated by PMA. Incubation with 10 nm PMA causes gradual reduction of the α current amplitude (Ref. 5Peretz T. Levin G. Moran O. Thornhill W.B. Chikvashvili D. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; e.g. Fig. 1 D) that is mediated by activation of the oocyte's PKC. When Kv1.1 is coexpressed with Kvβ1.1 (β) a heteromultimeric αβ channel is formed that expresses a rapidly inactivating current that has a fast inactivating component (Ii) and a noninactivating sustained current component (Is) remaining at the end of a depolarizing pulse to +50 mV (Ref. 8Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; see illustrations in Fig. 1 A). The apparent extent of inactivation (inactivating fraction) is defined as Ii/Ip(Ip = peak current), and the sustained fraction (Is fraction) is defined as Is/Ip(8Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the effect of PMA on the αβ current. Fig. 1 (A and C) shows that 10 nm PMA reduced the peak αβ current amplitude; the time course and the extent of the reduction (reaching about 50% of control after 20 min) were similar to those of α current expressed in oocytes taken from the same frogs. PMA did not affect any endogenous currents in oocytes uninjected with RNA (Fig. 1 A, inset). In addition, PMA caused a gradual decrease in the extent of inactivation (Fig. 1 B), which is depicted in Fig. 1 E as an increase in the Is fraction determined in currents where Is was larger than 400 nA (after leak subtraction, see “Experimental Procedures”) to preclude any interference from endogenous currents activated by PMA. The initial Isfraction was 0.41 ± 0.02 before the addition of PMA and increased to more than 150% of its original value after 20 min. The time constant of inactivation changed slightly from 6.8 ± 0.5 ms before PMA to 8.9 ± 0.4 ms 20 min after the start of PMA (seven oocytes assayed; p > 0.05). No change in Ip or the extent of inactivation could be detected in the absence of PMA (Fig. 1, C and E, respectively) or in the presence of 10 nm α-PMA, an isomer that does not activate PKC (not shown). As expected, separate analysis of the effect of PMA on each of the two apparent current components (Fig. 1 D) shows that the increase in Is fraction is due to the fact that within 20 min the reduction of Ii(∼40% of its initial value) was larger than the reduction of Is (∼65% of its initial value). Actually, the reduction of Is was preceded by an early increase (∼130% of its initial value) that peaked at ∼10 min when Ip was still constant and Ii had already started to decrease. Taken together, one may deduce that two overlapping effects are initiated by PMA as follows: 1) as already described for the α current (5Peretz T. Levin G. Moran O. Thornhill W.B. Chikvashvili D. Lotan I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) which is a PKC-mediated reduction of the total current amplitude consisting of Ii and Is, and 2) a novel one, which is an increase in Is that brings about smaller net reduction of Is (caused by the first effect) and thus is manifested in a decrease in the extent of inactivation (increase in Isfraction). The voltage sensitivity of the channel was not altered by PMA, as verified by the overlapping activation curves of Ipbefore and during PMA application (inset of Fig. 1 C). PMA was assessed in more than 30 frogs altogether (see also below) and was found to always reduce the current amplitude; however, in oocytes of five frogs it failed to affect the extent of inactivation. These experiments were not taken into account. The involvement of PKC in the PMA-mediated decrease of extent of inactivation was tested by using a series of protein kinase inhibitors as follows: a broad specificity protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine acting at the protein kinase catalytic site, a specific PKC inhibitor BIS acting at the PKC catalytic site, and a specific PKC inhibitor calphostin C acting at the diacylglycerol-binding site (24Hidaka H. Kobayashi R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Oocytes were preincubated for 2–4 h in medium containing 3 μmstaurosporine or 5 μm BIS; in addition, BIS was also injected into the oocytes before PMA application. PMA effects with and without the blockers were compared in oocytes from the same frogs because of variable effects by PMA among oocytes from different frogs (Fig. 1 F). Staurosporine and BIS significantly suppressed the decrease in inactivation; however, neither a 4-h incubation with 5 μm calphostin C nor injection of this blocker into the oocytes suppressed the PMA effect on the extent of inactivation. Previously (3Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we showed that the α protein is extensively phosphorylated in its basal state in the oocyte and that this phosphorylation is manifested as a shift in its migration in SDS-PAGE; the nonphosphorylated form migrates as a 54-kDa protein, whereas the phosphorylated form migrates as a 57-kDa protein. This phosphorylation was totally abolished when Ser-446 was replaced by alanine (S446A mutant). In this study we looked for PKC-induced phosphorylation of the channel proteins first in homogenates of oocytes and then under in vivo conditions. Fig. 2 shows an experiment in which the oocyte's PKC was stimulated in homogenates of oocytes expressing α or αβ channels by stimulating with added 100 nm PMA and 1.5 mm CaCl2 in the presence of added γ-ATP, as was described by Beguin et al. (23Beguin P. Beggah A.T. Chibalin A.V. Burgener-Kairuz P. Jaisser F. Mathews P.M. Rossier B.C. Cotecchia S. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24437-24445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the Na,K-ATPase. To our surprise, PKC activation brought about dephosphorylation, rather than phosphorylation, of the α protein both in α and in αβ channels. Dephosphorylation of the basally phosphorylated α protein at Ser-446 was evident from SDS-PAGE analyses of32P-labeled or [35S]Met/Cys-labeled channel proteins that were coimmunoprecipitated by a specific anti-α antibody. Thus, the 32P- labeled 57-kDa band that corresponds to the phosphorylated α protein could be precipitated from homogenates incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (the low intensity band at 57 kDa in control oocytes that do not express the channel may represent an endogenous K+ channel; Ref. 3Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) but could not be detected after the addition of CaCl2 and PMA (Fig. 2, right panel). Correspondingly, in homogenates of oocytes that were metabolically labeled with [35S]Met/Cys and incubated with cold ATP, the addition of CaCl2 and PMA induced dephosphorylation of α that was quantified as the reduction in the extent of its phosphorylation. Thus, following addition of CaCl2 and PMA, the extent of phosphorylation of α (calculated as the ratio of labeling intensities of the 57-kDa over the 54-kDa bands; see Ref. 4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was reduced to 0.33 and 0.4 of that of control (without PMA) in α (compare lanes 5 and 2) and αβ (compare lanes 4 and 1) channels, respectively (Fig. 2, left panel). The β protein was not phosphorylated (Fig. 2, right panel). The total amount of α did not change significantly by the treatment (comparelanes 1 with 4 (27% increase) and lanes 2 with 5 (4% increase)). This experiment shows that phosphorylation of the α protein by an enzyme constitutively active in the oocyte's homogenate was reduced upon stimulation of the oocyte's PKC. Interestingly, a massive dephosphorylation of oocyte's proteins probably occurred upon PKC stimulation, as judged from the extensive reduction of the 32P labeling of the other proteins nonspecifically pulled into the immune complex (right panel of Fig. 2), whereas their total amount (intensity of their [35S]Met/Cys labeling; left panel of Fig. 2) was not reduced. We then asked whether PMA induces dephosphorylation in vivoby testing the effect of a 25-min incubation of intact oocytes with PMA. Fig. 3 shows an SDS-PAGE analysis of α and β proteins immunopurified separately from plasma membranes and from internal fractions of oocytes labeled with [35S]Met/Cys (see “Experimental Procedures”). In oocytes treated with PMA (10 or 100 nm; no significant difference between the effects of the two concentrations was detected) the relative intensity of the 57-kDa band decreased, as compared with untreated oocytes, indicating that PMA induced dephosphorylation of the α protein. Dephosphorylation occurred both in the plasma membranes and in the internal fractions. In three similar experiments (including that shown in Fig. 3) the PMA-induced dephosphorylation was quantified as the reduction in the extent of phosphorylation. Thus, in the plasma membranes of oocytes treated with PMA the extent of phosphorylation (ratio of labeling intensities of 57- over 54-kDa bands) was 0.74 ± 0.05 of those of untreated oocytes, and in the internal fractions it was 0.41 ± 0.005. The larger phosphorylation in the plasma membranes versus the internal fractions probably relates to the phenomenon described by us previously that α protein phosphorylated at Ser-446 tends to accumulate into plasma membrane (4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, in five of nine additional experiments, in which channel proteins were immunopurified from whole oocytes, PMA decreased the extent of phosphorylation to 0.68 ± 0.07 of control. In one experiment we checked if the dephosphorylation could occur in less than 25 min incubation with PMA and found that already within 5 min significant dephosphorylation occurred (not shown). It is noteworthy that PMA did not alter the β-binding capacity of α, as verified in all the experiments by a quite constant ratio of intensities between the α and the β proteins coprecipitated with the α antibody (Fig. 3). Next we tested the possibility that dephosphorylation of Ser-446 underlies the decrease in the extent of inactivation by PMA. We performed two experiments in which the modulation by PMA of wild-type (αWTβ) channels was compared with that of the mutant (αS446Aβ) channels where Ser-446 in α was replaced by alanine and thereby rendered the channel totally non-phosphorylated in its basal state (4Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the peak amplitude of αS446Aβ was decreased by PMA to the same extent as that of αWTβ (Fig. 4 A), the extent of inactivation of the mutant was unaffected compared with WT where the extent of inactivation decreased (as shown in the increased Is fraction; Fig. 4 C). The inactivation of two other phosphorylation-irrelevant serine mutants S489I and S322A ("
