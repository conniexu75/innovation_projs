https://openalex.org/W1976721572,"A new compilation of fossil data on invertebrate and vertebrate families indicates that four mass extinctions in the marine realm are statistically distinct from background extinction levels. These four occurred late in the Ordovician, Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous periods. A fifth extinction event in the Devonian stands out from the background but is not statistically significant in these data. Background extinction rates appear to have declined since Cambrian time, which is consistent with the prediction that optimization of fitness should increase through evolutionary time."

This confirms the long-held idea that the surface vegetation, which produces the evapotransporation, is an important factor in the earth's climate."
https://openalex.org/W2005094822,"Prasinohaema virens, an arboreal scincid lizard, differs from its closest relatives in that it exhibits subdigital adhesive setae resembling those of anoles in shape and those of geckos in some aspects of size. The other scincid species in this genus as well as those in a presumed ancestral genus exhibit pad scales with surface folds and ruffles but no setae; at least one of these species uses an adhesive grip similar to that of anoles and geckos. Thus, there appear to be two strikingly different epidermal specializations for adhesive grip within this small radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1972050685,"Mixed inoculums of microorganisms from Chesapeake Bay sediments transformed inorganic tin (SnCl(4) . 5H(2)O) to organotin compounds. Dimethyltin and trimethyltin species were identified as products by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Methylated tin species were not observed in sterile controls or in poisoned controls. Thus, estuarine microorganisms have the potential for transforming tin to toxic organotins and for mobilizing tin in the ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2045665482,"Between 17 million and 6 million years ago, 200,000 square kilometers of the American Northwest were flooded by basaltic lava that erupted through fissures in the crust up to 150 kilometers long. Larger individual eruptions covered over a third of the Columbia Plateau in a few days. The lavas represent partial melts of the earth's mantle that were only slightly modified by near-surface, upper crustal processes. The abundant chemical and mineralogical data now available offer an opportunity to study mantle composition and the processes involved in the evolution of the earth's crust."

The movement rates of lumber were similar to those of oil slicks observed elsewhere. These observations indicate that a major oil spill could expose significant numbers of California sea otters to oil contamination."

https://openalex.org/W1975211337,"The thrift institution deposit insurance mess is rooted in defects in political and bureaucratic accountability. Under existing incentives, covering up evidence of poor regulatory performance and relaxing binding capital requirements are rational governmental responses to widespread industry insolvency. Similarly, aggressive industry risk taking is a rational response by thrift managers to regulatory forbearances. Far from acknowledging these incentive defects, the Bush plan for cleaning up the mess adopts theories that spotlight other causes: specifically, poor thrift management and the deregulation of thrift institution activities and of deposit interest rates. To end the mess, politicians and regulators must jettison these comfortable theories and surrender discretion that permits them to finesse the need to budget for governmental financial commitments."
