https://openalex.org/W2007842741,"The NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase family, Sir2 (or sirtuins), is important for many cellular processes including gene silencing, regulation of p53, fatty acid metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and life span extension. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in wines and thought to harbor major health benefits, was reported to be an activator of Sir2 enzymes in vivo and in vitro. In addition, resveratrol was shown to increase life span in three model organisms through a Sir2-dependent pathway. Here, we investigated the molecular basis for Sir2 activation by resveratrol. Among the three enzymes tested (yeast Sir2, human SIRT1, and human SIRT2), only SIRT1 exhibited significant enzyme activation (∼8-fold) using the commercially available Fluor de Lys kit (BioMol). To examine the requirements for resveratrol activation of SIRT1, we synthesized three p53 acetylpeptide substrates either lacking a fluorophore or containing a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (p53-AMC) or rhodamine 110 (p53-R110). Although SIRT1 activation was independent of the acetylpeptide sequence, resveratrol activation was completely dependent on the presence of a covalently attached fluorophore. Substrate competition studies indicated that the fluorophore decreased the binding affinity of the peptide, and, in the presence of resveratrol, fluorophore-containing substrates bound more tightly to SIRT1. Using available crystal structures, a model of SIRT1 bound to p53-AMC peptide was constructed. Without resveratrol, the coumarin of p53-AMC peptide is solvent-exposed and makes no significant contacts with SIRT1. We propose that binding of resveratrol to SIRT1 promotes a conformational change that better accommodates the attached coumarin group.

The silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) family of proteins (sirtuins) are NAD+-dependent histone/protein deacetylases that tightly couple the cleavage of NAD+ and deacetylation of protein substrates to form nicotinamide, the deacetylated product, and a novel metabolite, 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr) 1The abbreviations used are: OAADPr, 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose; AcH3, acetylated histone H3; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; Boc, butoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MALDI MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry; R110, rhodamine 110.

Substrate and product analogs as well as small molecules have been screened for Sir2 regulatory activity. Of all the NAD+-like metabolites and salvage pathway intermediates analyzed for regulatory activities on Sir2 enzymes, only nicotinamide displayed a level of inhibition which was consistent with a physiological role (37Schmidt M.T.

NADH was shown previously to be a competitive inhibitor of NAD+ in vitro (42Lin S.J. Ford E. Haigis M. Liszt G. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar); however, the high mm binding constant for NADH indicates that cellular NADH levels are unlikely to regulate Sir2 activity under most physiological conditions (37Schmidt M.T.

In addition, 15 plant phenols, including quercetin, piceatannol, and resveratrol, were shown to have SIRT1 activating properties (35Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S.

Of all the small molecules identified, resveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) (Fig. 1) was found to be the most potent activator of SIRT1 and to a lesser extent, of ySir2 (35Howitz K.T.

Resveratrol has been shown to increase SIRT1 activity by as much as 8-fold, lowering the Km value for acetylated substrate and to a much lesser extent that of NAD+, with no reported effect on the overall turnover rate of the enzyme (35Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3202) Google Scholar). Resveratrol was shown to enhance SIRT1-dependent cellular processes such as axonal protection (34Araki T. Sasaki Y. Milbrandt J. Science. 2004; 305: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), fat mobilization (33Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N. Topark-Ngarm A. Senawong T. Machado De Oliveira R. Leid M. McBurney M.W. Guarente L. Nature. 2004; 429: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar), and inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcription (31Yeung F. Hoberg J.E. Ramsey C.S. Keller M.D. Jones D.R. Frye R.A. Mayo M.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2369-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). In yeast, resveratrol was shown to mimic Sir2-dependent life span extension during calorie restriction, although the effects of calorie restriction and resveratrol were not additive (35Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3202) Google Scholar). One study on yeast aging suggested that Sir2 acts independently of pathways mediated by calorie restriction (60Kaeberlein M. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E296Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Resveratrol extended life span in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster through a Sir2-mediated process (36Wood J.G. Rogina B. Lavu S. Howitz K. Helfand S.L. Tatar M. Sinclair D. Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which resveratrol activates Sir2 enzymes was unknown. In the current study, we sought to elucidate how resveratrol activates SIRT1. Our results indicate that resveratrol is not a general activator of Sir2 enzymes and that activation requires the presence of a fluorophore covalently attached to the peptide substrate. To validate our findings, four different deacetylation assays were used, and three p53 acetylpeptide substrates either lacking a fluorophore or containing either coumarin (p53-AMC) or rhodamine (p53-R110) fluorophores were synthesized. The commonly used BioMol (Plymouth, PA) assay kit, Fluor de Lys, which employs a similar fluorescent detection method, was included in the analysis. We show that the peptide sequence is inconsequential for resveratrol activation, but the covalent attachment of the fluorophore on the peptide is necessary to produce the resveratrol-mediated activation. A model of p53-AMC peptide bound to SIRT1 was developed to visualize the interaction of the fluorophore with the enzyme. We propose that resveratrol binding to SIRT1 promotes conformational changes in the enzyme which allow tighter binding of the fluorophore. Materials—Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide, Fluor de Lys-H4 AcK16 peptide, and Fluor de Lys Developer II 5 × concentrate, were purchased from BioMol. Resveratrol was purchased from Sigma. The p53 peptide was purchased from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Peptide Synthesis Center. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma and Fisher, or as otherwise noted, and were of the highest quality available. Expression and Purification of SIRT1—Histidine-tagged SIRT1 was cloned into a pQE80 vector (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The plasmid was transformed into BL21DE3 cells, which were grown to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 prior to induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–8 h. Cells were harvested and stored at –20 °C until use. Cells were lysed using a French pressure cell in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl with 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was rocked with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then loaded onto a column and washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. SIRT1 was eluted with a gradient of 0–200 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. SIRT1 fractions were pooled and lyophilized in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol and stored at –20 °C prior to use. SIRT1 Deacetylase Assays—Four different deacetylase assays were used to assess resveratrol activation of SIRT1 in vitro: the Fluor de Lys fluorescence assay, coumarin and rhodamine-based fluorescence assays, charcoal binding assay, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assays. All the reactions were performed with 10% final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration at 37 °C. The Fluor de Lys fluorescence assay was performed as indicated in the BioMol product sheets. Briefly, assays were performed using Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 or Fluor de Lys-H4 AcK16 peptides, NAD+, and SIRT1, in the absence and presence of resveratrol in SIRT1 assay buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, as indicated in the BioMol product sheets). The buffer, dimethyl sulfoxide, resveratrol, and SIRT1 were preincubated for 10 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 × concentrations of the Fluor de Lys peptide and NAD+. Prior to quenching the reaction, 2 mm nicotinamide was added to 1× Developer II in the histone deacetylase assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, as indicated in the BioMol product sheets). At each time point, 50 μl of the reaction was removed and mixed with 50 μl of the developer solution. The quenched samples were kept at 37 °C for 45 min prior to fluorescence reading. Fluorescence readings were obtained using the CytoFluor series 4000 fluorometer (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA), with the excitation wavelength set to 360 nm and the emission set to 460 nm (according to BioMol specification). The p53-AMC and p53-R110 fluorescence assays were carried out similarly to that described above for the Fluor de Lys fluorescence assay. However, for the p53-R110 peptide, the excitation wavelength was set to 490 nm and the emission set to 520 nm. For the charcoal binding assay and the HPLC assay, conditions similar to those in the fluorescence assay were used. The enzyme was preincubated in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide, resveratrol, and the SIRT1 assay buffer prior to addition of the substrates to initiate the reaction. For the charcoal binding assay, [3H]acetylated histone H3 peptide ([3H]AcH3) was used as a substrate instead of the Fluor de Lys peptide. Generation of [3H]AcH3 was described previously (61Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the charcoal binding assay, at each time point, the reaction was quenched by the addition of charcoal slurry containing activated charcoal in 2 m glycine, pH 9.5. Samples were incubated at 95 °C for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant transferred into a new microcentrifuge tubes containing charcoal slurry. After centrifugation, the radioactivity of the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. For the HPLC assay, Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 and [14C]NAD+, in which the 14C label is located on the nicotinamide ring, are used in the reaction (synthesis of [14C]NAD+ and the HPLC assay were described previously (61Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The reactions were quenched with trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%. Time points were injected into a reversed phase, C18, small pore column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA). The substrates and products were resolved using increasing concentrations of acetonitrile. Radioactivity of the collected fractions was determined by scintillation counting. Competition Assay between the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 and p53 Peptide with [3H]AcH3—Competition assays were performed using the charcoal binding assay to determine whether resveratrol enhances the binding of the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1, p53-AMC, or p53 4-mer peptides. The charcoal binding assay was carried out with 20 μm [3H]AcH3, 100 μm NAD+, varying concentrations of the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1, p53-AMC, or p53 4-mer peptides, with and without 200 μm resveratrol. The reactions were quenched, and the amount of O-[3H]AADPr product was quantified as described previously (61Borra M.T. Denu J.M.

Synthesis of p53-AMC and p53-R110 Peptides (Figs.1and2)—Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC (28 mg, 63 μmol; Bachem, Switzerland) was deprotected with 1:1 trifluoroacetic acid:CH2Cl2. The resulting clear oil was further dried using hexane to form an azeotrope. The product was purified by reversed phase HPLC using a C18, small pore preparative column (Vydac), eluting with methanol to yield crude H-Lys(Ac)-AMC in quantitative yield that was used without further purification. Ac-R(Pmc)-H(Trt)-K(Boc)-OH (55 mg, 43 μmol; University of Wisconsin-Madison Peptide Synthesis Center) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (0.22 ml) and preactivated with O-benzotriazol-1-yl-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (21 mg, 55 μmol) and N-methyl morpholine (18 μl, 164 μmol). H-Lys(Ac)-AMC (28 mg, 63 μmol) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (0.11 ml) was added, reacted for 9 h at room temperature, and dried in vacuo. The arginine, histidine, and lysine protecting groups were cleaved with trifluoroacetic acid, and the crude product was purified by reversed phase HPLC, eluting with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in water. The product, Ac-Arg-His-Lys-Lys(Ac)-AMC, was lyophilized to yield a white flocculent power (30 mg, 37 μmol) in 59% overall yield. MALDI MS calculated for C38H56N12O8 (M+H+), 809.9; found, 809.8. Boc-Lys(Ac)2-R110 (a generous gift from L. Lavis and R. Raines, University of Wisconsin-Madison) was converted to p53-R110 in a manner similar to the p53-AMC peptide. MALDI MS calculated for C38H56 N12O8 (M+H+), 1597.8; found, 1597.8. Molecular Modeling of SIRT1 and p53-AMC—The SIRT1 crystal structure was built by homology modeling using the SWISS-MODEL function in Swiss PDB viewer version 3.7 (62Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). The p53-AMC peptide was modeled from the crystal structure of p53 bound to Sir2-Af2 (63Avalos J.L. Celic I. Muhammad S. Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Using Sybyl (version 6.8, Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO), an amide bond was built between the amino group of AMC and the main chain carboxyl group of the acetyllysine residue of p53 bound to Sir2-Af2. The built SIRT1 structure and the Sir2-Af2 structure containing the modeled p53-AMC peptide were aligned in Swiss PDB viewer version 3.7 (62Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) using sequence homology thereby docking the p53-AMC peptide into the SIRT1 structure. The resulting crystal structure of p53-AMC peptide bound to SIRT1 was used for all subsequent analysis. Resveratrol Activates SIRT1 but Not Other Sir2 Homologs—To determine whether resveratrol activated Sir2 homologs, ySir2, human SIRT2, and human SIRT1 were analyzed using the commercially available Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 as a peptide substrate, with and without 200 μm resveratrol. Samples were quenched with the Developer II solution with added 2mm nicotinamide, and the fluorescence was measured according to the manufacturer's protocol. With SIRT1, SIRT2, and ySir2, fluorescence increased over time, indicating deacetylation of the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide (Fig. 3). Comparison of the rate of fluorescence increase in the presence and absence of resveratrol showed that resveratrol activated SIRT1 by 8-fold (Fig. 3A), consistent with previous studies using this assay (35Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3202) Google Scholar). However, no significant activation was observed when SIRT2 (Fig. 3B) and ySir2 (Fig. 3C) were assayed with the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide. Moreover, a higher concentration of ySir2 was required to observe significant deacetylation of the substrate, indicating that Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide is a poor substrate for ySir2. Because resveratrol activation was specific for SIRT1, subsequent mechanistic studies were performed using this enzyme. Resveratrol Activation Requires Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 as a Substrate—To verify resveratrol activation of SIRT1, an alternative assay was employed. The charcoal binding assay (61Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was carried out under the same conditions as those for the Fluor de Lys fluorescence assay, except that the Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide was replaced by [3H]AcH3 peptide, which corresponds to the sequence of the histone H3 N-terminal tail including and surrounding the acetylated lysine 14 (sequence: KSTGG([3H]AcK)APRKQ). In the charcoal binding assay, the [3H]acetyl group from the [3H]AcH3 is transferred to the ADP-ribose portion of NAD+ to form O-[3H]AADPr, which is quantified as described previously (61Borra M.T. Denu J.M. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out with and without 200 μm resveratrol, and the concentrations of product formed were quantified and plotted versus time. As shown in Fig. 4A, the product formed increased over time; however, the rate of product formation was identical (within error) in the presence and absence of resveratrol, indicating that resveratrol had no effect on the enzymatic activity when [3H]AcH3 was employed as a substrate and when the charcoal binding assay was used. Because of the conflicting results from the Fluor de Lys fluorescence assay and the charcoal binding assay, other possible explanations for resveratrol activation were examined. To determine whether resveratrol induces an increase in product fluorescence, the deacetylated Fluor de Lys-SIRT1 peptide was incubated in the SIRT1 assay buffer with and without resveratrol. The fluorescence was measured, and no difference with and without resveratrol was observed (data not shown), indicating that resveratrol does not increase the fluorescenc"
https://openalex.org/W1970338621,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a childhood premature aging disease caused by a spontaneous point mutation in lamin A (encoded by LMNA), one of the major architectural elements of the mammalian cell nucleus. The HGPS mutation activates an aberrant cryptic splice site in LMNA pre-mRNA, leading to synthesis of a truncated lamin A protein and concomitant reduction in wild-type lamin A. Fibroblasts from individuals with HGPS have severe morphological abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. Here we show that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from individuals with HGPS. Introduction of wild-type lamin A protein does not rescue the cellular disease symptoms. The mutant LMNA mRNA and lamin A protein can be efficiently eliminated by correction of the aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the activated cryptic splice site. Upon splicing correction, HGPS fibroblasts assume normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins are rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications are corrected and proper expression of several misregulated genes is reestablished. Our results establish proof of principle for the correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with HGPS."

This calculation is based on the triple helical stabilization propensities of individual residues and their intermolecular and intramolecular interactions, as quantitated by melting temperature values of host-guest peptides. Experimental melting temperature values of a number of triple helical peptides of varying length and sequence were successfully predicted by this algorithm. However, predicted Tm values are significantly higher than experimental values when there are strings of oppositely charged residues or concentrations of like charges near the terminus. Application of the algorithm to collagen sequences highlights regions of unusually high or low stability, and these regions often correlate with biologically significant features. The prediction of stability from sequence indicates an understanding of the major forces maintaining this protein motif. The use of highly favorable KGE and KGD sequences is seen to complement the stabilizing effects of imino acids in modulating stability and may become dominant in the collagenous domains of bacterial proteins that lack hydroxyproline. The effect of single amino acid mutations in the X and Y positions can be evaluated with this algorithm. An interactive collagen stability calculator based on this algorithm is available online.

The ability to predict structure and stability from amino acid sequence is an important step in the understanding of basic protein principles and the structural consequences of pathological mutations. The vast number of amino acid sequences available from DNA data contrasts with the smaller number of high resolution protein structures and the limited experimental data on protein stability. The ability to make predictions that are in good agreement with experimental data provides insight into the stabilizing interactions within proteins. In addition, there is much interest in computing the effect of single amino acid replacements on protein stability because destabilizing effects are associated with deleterious mutations that result in clinically detectable phenotypes (1Wang Z.

In contrast to globular proteins, the relation among sequence, structure, and stability is simpler and better defined for the linear collagen triple helix.The collagen triple helix motif is found widely in structural proteins of the extracellular matrix and in an increasing set of non-collagenous proteins, many of which are involved in host-defense functions (4Myllyharju J.

The close packing of three supercoiled polyproline II-like polypeptide chains in the collagen triple helix generates a requirement for Gly as every third residue (6Rich A. Crick F.H. J. Mol.

The observation of such a repeating (Gly-X-Y)n sequence pattern over a stretch of residues signifies a triple helix conformation. However, the collagen triple helix is not uniform in structure or stability. Crystal structures of collagen peptides show that variation in amino acid content leads to small but significant variations in the super-helix twist (9Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 10Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol.

Calorimetric results suggest the presence of multiple independent folding domains along a collagen molecule (12Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), and the presence of regions of different stability was confirmed by recent studies on recombinant collagen constructs (13Steplewski A. Ito H. Rucker E. Brittingham R.J. Alabyeva T. Gandhi M. Ko F.K. Birk D.E. Jimenez S.A. Fertala A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are multiple binding domains in collagens (14Di Lullo G.A. Sweeney S.M. Korkko J. Ala-Kokko L. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4223-4231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), and regions of decreased triple helix stability have been implicated in binding in some cases (15Shah N.K.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10517-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, specific residues along the (Gly-X-Y)n sequence determine functionally important modulation of structure and stability.Experimental thermal stability data obtained from host-guest peptides is integrated here to produce an algorithm for predicting global melting temperatures of collagen triple helical peptides and short fragments and for detecting modulations in relative stability along a collagen chain. Good agreement is observed between predicted and observed stabilities of a number of collagen peptides. In cases in which the predicted Tm is significantly different from that observed, interactions involving longer range electrostatic interactions or unraveling of the ends are suggested. The variations in stability along the collagen chain appear related to known functional sites, and high stability is achieved through a combination of stabilizing imino acid and KGE/D sequences.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe Tm values of all host-guest peptides were measured under a set of standard conditions, with c = 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and with a heating rate average of 0.1 °C/min, as previously reported (20Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Small variations are seen at acid versus neutral pH, but all calculations are based on host-guest peptide data collected at pH 7.The (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n peptides for n = 6, 7, 8, and 12 were synthesized by Tufts Core Facility (Boston, MA) and purified using high pressure liquid chromatography; their identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization.To extrapolate the dependence of the Tm of the host peptides on peptide length, the experimental values for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n and (Pro-Pro-Gly)n versus n, where n is the number of tripeptide units, were fit to the exponential decay functionTm0=Tmmax−A⋅exp(−nn0)eq.1 where Tm0(n) is defined as the base thermal stability of the repeating polytripeptide standard, Tmmax is the maximum melting temperature, and the constant n0 represents the length of the repeating peptide with Tm = 0.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExperimental Stabilities of Host Guest PeptidesExperimental data on host-guest triple helical peptides, using a (Gly-Pro-Hyp)8 host, have provided information on the propensities of individual residues for the X and Y positions of Gly-X-Y triplets, the interactions within the triple helix for a given Gly-X-Y sequence, and the interactions resulting from neighboring tripeptide sequences (21Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14960-14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These data establish the basis for determining the loss of stability that will result from replacing Gly-Pro-Hyp tripeptide sequences by other Gly-X-Y sequences, essentially defining a set of rules for relating amino acid sequence and stability.Individual Residue Propensities for X and Y Positions—The propensity measurements for all 20 residues in the X position in a Gly-X-Hyp context and all 20 residues in the Y position in a Gly-Pro-Y context were determined by measuring thermal stability of host-guest peptides (21Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14960-14967Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The most stable tripeptide unit is Gly-Pro-Hyp (Tm = 47.3 °C). Replacing Pro in the X position leads to a decrease in stability ranging from 4 °C for Gly-Glu-Hyp (Tm = 42.9 °C) to 15 °C for Gly-Trp-Hyp (Tm = 31.9 °C). Replacing Hyp in the Y position leads to a decrease in stability ranging from almost 0 °C for Gly-Pro-Arg (Tm = 47.2 °C) to 21 °C for Gly-Pro-Hyp (Tm = 26.1 °C).Gly-X-Y Tripeptide Sequences—Direct intrachain interactions are not sterically possible between adjacent X and Y residues in the Gly-X-Y unit of a chain, but interchain interactions can take place between the Y residue in one chain and the X residue in an adjacent chain staggered by 1 residue (Fig. 1). Peptides with Gly-X-Y guest triplets were designed to model these interchain interactions. Only a restricted set of possible Gly-X-Y tripeptides are significantly populated in collagens (24Ramshaw J.A.M. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), reflecting in part strong preferences for basic residues to be in the Y position and for Glu and hydrophobic residues to be in the X position and very low occurrence of Cys, Trp, and Tyr. A limited set of 41 guest Gly-X-Y sequences was selected to include the most common tripeptide sequences and to model a range of typical electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Because of the strong bias in collagen compositions, the selected 41 Gly-X-Y, 19 Gly-X-Hyp, 19 Gly-Pro-Y, and Gly-Pro-Hyp tripeptides cover about 80% of human fibrillar collagen sequences (22Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although Pro residues in the Y position are post-translationally modified to Hyp in multicellular animals, collagenous domains have recently been found in bacteria and viruses where there is no hydroxylation of Pro (25Rasmussen M. Jacobsson M. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32313-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 26Xu Y. Keene D.R. Bujnicki J.M. Hook M. Lukomski S. J. Biol.

To model these sequences, Gly-Pro-Pro and Gly-Ala-Pro guest triplets were also included.A complete table of the stability for all Gly-X-Y triplets was constructed using the experimental values for all frequent sequences and the predicted values for all others (Table I; experimental values are in bold). Predicted values were calculated on the basis of additivity of residues in the X and Y position (22Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. J. Mol.

The largest deviations were observed for GKD and GRD, which were more stable than predicted by 7 °C, suggesting some interchain electrostatic stabilization. Observed Tm values of GXR sequences (GER, GAR, GKR, GQR, and GDR) were 2.5 °C smaller on average than predicted, indicating the need for a correction factor in a GXR context versus a GPR context.Interactions between Adjacent Gly-X-Y Units—Interactions between adjacent Gly-X-Y tripeptides were included in the calculations. A recent study reported stabilities of a selection of host-guest peptides including residues in two adjacent tripeptide units, Gly-X-Y-Gly-X′-Y′, covering possible direct interchain or intrachain interactions between residues that are separated by ≤3 residues in sequence (23Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1414-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Significant deviations from predicted stability were seen for six hexapeptides, which suggested favorable interchain and intrachain electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Table II). The most dramatic difference was the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding stabilization observed when Lys is in the Y position and a negatively charged residue is in the X′ position (KGD or KGE), with observed Tm values 15.4 °C to 17.5 °C more stable than expected. The large magnitude of KGD/E interactions is comparable with the Tm spread of all X (14 °C) and Y residues (21 °C) (23Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B.

The Tm value is seen to depend on n (the number of tripeptide units) for repeating (Gly-Pro-Hyp)n and (Gly-Pro-Pro)n peptides (27Sutoh K. Noda H. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 2391-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Kirkpatrick A. Brodsky B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 11500-11501Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The sharp dependence of stability on length leveling off with increasing n can be fit to a single exponential decay (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Effect of peptide length on the melting temperatures of unblocked (POG)n (□) and (PPG)n (○). The Tm values are shown for (Pro-Pro-Gly)n for n = 12, 15, and 20 (c = 3 mg/ml, 3% HAc, equilibrium conditions) (27Sutoh K. Noda H. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 2391-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); for n = 10 (20Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); and for n = 9 (K. Okuyama, unpublished data). The Tm values for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n were obtained in our laboratory using the standard melting conditions. The extrapolated curve is shown as a solid line, as described by Eq. 1. The two points (▪) show the experimental Tm values for the blocked Ac-(POG)n-NH2 peptides for n = 7 and 8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of blocking groups on peptide stability was also taken into consideration. Studies at different pH values and on peptides with and without blocked termini are consistent with a reduction of stability by about 2 °C when unblocked charged N termini are present and by about 3 °C when unblocked charged C termini are present, for a peptide length of n = 10 (29Venugopal M.G. Ramshaw J.A.M. Braswell E. Zhu D. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7948-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This destabilization is presumed to be due to repulsion when three charged termini are in close proximity, consistent with the unraveling of the termini observed in high resolution structures of collagen peptides (8Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 30Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). End effects are more pronounced for short peptides than for longer ones, as seen for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)7 and for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)8 (Fig. 2).Algorithm Relating Amino Acid Sequence to Triple Helix StabilityThe relative stability of each Gly-X-Y tripeptide compared with Gly-Pro-Hyp and the interaction between adjacent Gly-X-Y tripeptides were used to derive an algorithm for predicting triple helix stability. The Tm values, rather than Gibbs free energy values, were used for calculating peptide stability. The extremely long times needed to reach equilibrium and the lack of agreement of the equilibrium curve with a two-state model presented practical and theoretical limitations to thermodynamic characterization (20Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fortunately, the use of Tm values obtained under standardized conditions has proved to be useful as an empirical measure of triple helix stability (20Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Additivity of Tm values was observed for peptides with residues that cannot interact. Thus, Tm values are seen to be a good measure of relative stability, as long as standard conditions of buffer, pH, and rate of heating are maintained (20Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The algorithm predicts a global Tm value for collagen model peptides between 6 and 20 tripeptides in length and predicts a relative stability for collagen sequences.The global thermal stability of homotrimeric triple helical peptides with length 6 ≤ n ≤ 20 is predicted by an algorithm consisting of the following steps.1) For the total number of triplets n in a given peptide, the base TM0(n) for (Pro-Hyp-Gly)n or (Pro-Pro-Gly)n is calculated from the length dependence (Eq. 1), including any effect of blocking groups.2) The melting temperature value is decreased for every triplet in the sequence that is not Gly-Pro-Hyp, subtracting a value of ΔTmGXY (Table I). The N-terminal and C-terminal tripeptide units are excluded from the calculation due to the staggering of the chains and the reported disorder for the peptide ends (8Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 10Kramer R.Z. Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 131-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Li M.H. Fan P. Brodsky B. Baum J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7377-7387Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Kramer R.Z. Venugopal M.G. Bella J. Mayville P. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1191-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).3) The final value for the peptide melting temperature is adjusted using the ΔTmint values for interactions between neighboring tripeptides (Table II).The algorithm can be formulated as follows.Tm=Tm0−∑i=2n−1ΔTmGXY+ΣΔTminteq.3 The collagen stability algorithm is available to all users for calculation of global stability of peptides and local stability variations in collagens and collagen-like domains (rwjms.umdnj.edu/biochemistry/collagen).Prediction of Tm Values for Collagen-like PeptidesThe stability algorithm was applied to 40 synthetic collagen-like peptides whose Tm values have been experimentally determined under the same defined standard conditions (Table III). Most of the peptides are n = 10 tripeptide units in length, and some have unblocked ends, whereas others have terminal blocking groups. Excellent agreement was found between the calculated and observed Tm values for peptides with GPO tripeptide units on both ends. For instance, for the unblocked peptide T3–785, the predicted Tm value is 17.1 °C (58.8 °C - [(47.3 °C - 30.8 °C) + (47.3 °C - 38.2 °C) + (47.3 °C - 31.2 °C)]), in close agreement with the observed Tm of 18.0 °C. When KGE or KGD sequences are present, the good agreement is dependent on the inclusion of ΔTmint correction values for interactions between adjacent triplets. For instance, peptide T1–655, which has GPO caps on both ends, has an observed Tm value of 42.8 °C. If each independent triplet is considered, one would subtract 16.5 °C for GAK, 15.7 °C for GDA, and 6.4 °C for GPA, yielding 58.8 °C - 38.6 °C = 20.2 °C. However, there is a KGD sequence, which gives +17.5 °C, and an increase of 5 °C because the ends are blocked, giving a net predicted value of 42.7 °C, which is very close to the observed value of 42.8 °C. The set of peptides related to T1–892 with GPA sequences on the N-terminal ends also show excellent agreement with predictions. It is notable that the “reverse” peptide, T1–892r, which has the same tripeptide composition but in a different order, has the same Tm as T1–892, supporting the dependence of thermal stability on tripeptide unit composition when there are no interactions present (Table III) (32Buevich A.V.

https://openalex.org/W2137023074,"BACE is a transmembrane protease with β-secretase activity that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP). After BACE cleavage, APP becomes a substrate for γ-secretase, leading to release of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer disease. APP and BACE are co-internalized from the cell surface to early endosomes. APP is also known to interact at the cell surface and be internalized by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a multifunctional endocytic and signaling receptor. Using a new fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay of protein proximity, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), and co-immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that the light chain of LRP interacts with BACE on the cell surface in association with lipid rafts. Surprisingly, the BACE-LRP interaction leads to an increase in LRP C-terminal fragment, release of secreted LRP in the media and subsequent release of the LRP intracellular domain from the membrane. Taken together, these data suggest that there is a close interaction between BACE and LRP on the cell surface, and that LRP is a novel BACE substrate.

In addition to its role in endocytosis, LRP has an interesting pattern of proteolysis that parallels APP in some ways. Ectodomain shedding of LRP has been described (24Quinn K.A. Pye V.J. Dai Y.P. Chesterman C.N. Owensby D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and proteolysis of LRP by matrix metalloproteases was recently reported (25Rozanov D.V.

Miyazaki K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6514-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the postulated α-secretases of the ADAM family are also metalloproteinases. Furthermore, and as with APP, γ-secretase cleavage of LRP leads to release of the LRP intracellular domain (LRP-ICD), which can translocate to the nucleus and interact with Tip60 (27Kinoshita A. Shah T. Tangredi M.M. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41182-41188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol.

Given that BACE and APP interact and traffic with one another, and that APP interacts with and traffics with LRP, we now examined whether LRP interacts with BACE. Using both a FRET-based assay of protein proximity and co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that the LRP-ICD interacts with BACE and that this interaction seems to take place in lipid rafts on the cell surface. Surprisingly, the BACE-LRP interaction does not appear to enhance BACE endocytosis from the cell surface. Instead BACE induces LRP extracellular domain cleavage and subsequent release of the LRP intracellular domain from the membrane. Taken together, these data suggest a close interaction between BACE and LRP on the cell surface and suggest that LRP is processed by BACE in a fashion analogous to APP processing. Generation of Expression Constructs of LRP and BACE and BACE siRNA—The generation of the LRP light chain with two copies of Myc at its N terminus (amino acids 3844–4525) (Myc-LC), the minireceptor mLRP1-Myc that encodes the N-terminal cluster of ligand binding repeats fused to the light chain of LRP and tagged with Myc at its C terminus has been described previously (29Mikhailenko I. Battey F.D. Migliorini M. Ruiz J.F. Argraves K. Moayeri M. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39484-39491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These constructs were used instead of full-length LRP because of its functional similarity to and better expression than full-length LRP. To make mLRP1-GFP, mLRP1 was PCRed into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). To create the LC-LDLR chimera, a unique KpnI restriction site was introduced into the cytoplasmic portion of LC downstream of the transmembrane domain using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR-generated sequences encoding cytoplasmic domains of the human LDL receptor were then inserted in place of the LRP sequence. To make the LRP165-Myc construct, mLRP1-Myc was digested, and the band containing the vector and the N-terminal 14 amino acids and the C-terminal 165 amino acids of LRP was extracted and self-ligated as described (27Kinoshita A. Shah T. Tangredi M.M. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41182-41188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). LRP light chain (amino acid 4148–4544) was fused C-terminally to the Gal4-VP16 synthetic transcription factor, and subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). The leader peptide from LRP was fused to a hemagglutinin epitope, which was then fused to the N terminus of the fusion protein in the construct. Secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was fused by PCR to the N terminus of LC (amino acids 4018–4525) in pSecTagB (Invitrogen); the SEAP-cDNA was kindly provided by S. F. Lichtenthaler (A. Butenandt-Institut, Munich, Germany). The Fe65-Myc clone and BACE with N-terminal Myc and C-terminal V5 tags have been described previously (10Kinoshita A. Fukumoto H. Shah T. Whelan C.M.

Herz (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). Authenticity of the PCR-generated constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The constructs used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1. An siRNA corresponding to the BACE1 gene was designed as described in Kao et al. (31Kao S-C. Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Tsai L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1942-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The following sense sequence was used: 5′-gctttgtggagatggtgga-3′. Cell Culture Conditions and Transient Transfection—H4 cells derived from human neuroglioma cells, mouse neuroblastoma N2a, pac1, LRP-deficient CHO cells (13-5-1), and HEK293 cells are used in this study. Transient transfection of the cells was performed using a liposome-mediated method (FuGENE 6; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were passaged 24 h prior to transfection and harvested or stained 24 h post-transfection. Primary cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (32Berezovska O. Frosch M. McLean P. Knowles R. Koo E. Kang D. Shen J. Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Tonegawa S. Hyman B.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day 16 CD1 mice (Charles River). Staining was performed 8 days after preparation. For experiments requiring delivery of siRNA, cells were transfected by electroporation per the manufacturer's instructions (AMAXA, Gaithersburg, MD). Specific knockdown of >70% of overexpressing BACE was observed starting 24 h after transfection by Western blot and immunostaining (data not shown). Immunocytochemistry and Antibodies—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS, and blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum. For surface staining Triton-X treatment was omitted. The following antibodies were used: the Golgi organelle marker GM130 mAb and the FITC-conjugated endosomal marker EEA1 mAb (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). The tag antibodies used were rabbit anti-Myc Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-Myc mAb, anti-V5 mAb (both from Invitrogen), and rabbit anti-V5 Ab (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Antibodies raised in rabbit against the N (46Kawarabayashi T. Shoji M. Younkin L.H. Wen-Lang L. Dickson D.W. Murakami T. Matsubara E. Abe K. Ashe K.H. Younkin S.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3801-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar–56) and C termini (487–501) of BACE were obtained from Calbiochem. A hybridoma secreting an mAb to the LRP intracellular domain (11H4) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Alexa-555-labeled cholera toxin B (CTx-B, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to visualize lipid rafts. Secondary antibodies used were labeled with FITC and Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). Immunostained cells were coverslipped and mounted for confocal or two photon microscopic imaging. The immunostained cells were observed with the appropriate filters by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal 3-channel instrument. Isolation of Caveolae and Noncaveolae Membrane (CM and NCM, respectively)—Caveolae and noncaveolae membrane fractions were isolated from rat smooth muscle cells (pac1) using the method of Smart et al. (33Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Briefly, 70% confluent rat smooth muscle cells were collected and Dounce-homogenized in a hypertonic buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. First, the plasma membrane were isolated and sonicated. CM and NCM fractions were prepared using an optiprep gradient with the sonicated plasma membrane samples. 300-μl membrane fractions (PM, CM, NCM) were solubilized with 100 μlof4× lysis buffer (4% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm Tris, and 600 mm NaCl) to attain final concentration of 1× (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, and 150 mm NaCl). Following the addition of protease and phosphatase inhibitors, CM and NCM lysates were precleared and immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP monoclonal IgG (5A6)-protein G complex overnight. CM and NCM immunoprecipitates along with PM lysate were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were probed with 125I-labeled 11H4 and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak). Cholesterol Depletion—For cholesterol depletion, H4 cells were grown for 24 h in Opti-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and then for 24 h in either DMEM supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% delipidated fetal bovine serum (Cocalico Biologicals), 20 μm lovastatin (Calbiochem), and 0.5 mm mevalonate (mevalonolactone, Sigma) or DMEM with 10% complete fetal bovine serum (34Liscum L. Arnio E. Anthony M. Howley A. Sturley S.L. Agler M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1708-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Prior to experimentation, cells were incubated for 10 min in DMEM with 10 mm methyl β-cyclodextrin (Mβ-CD, Sigma) or DMEM alone. Tissue Staining—The Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center Brain Bank provided temporal cortex. Tissue staining was performed with 11H4 labeled by Alexa-488 and BACE-CT (Calbiochem) labeled by Cy3. Co-immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with BioMag beads conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The magnetic beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-V5 or anti-Myc mAb or TBS alone. Lysates from H4 cells co-transfected with BACE-V5 and mLRP1-Myc or pure lysis buffer were added to the bead-antibody complex for 2 h at 4 °C. After the supernatants were collected, the beads were washed in lysis buffer and then boiled with 2× Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) for 3 min. The supernatants were loaded onto 10–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) under denaturing and reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk. mLRP1-Myc was detected by rabbit anti-Myc Ab. BACE was detected by rabbit anti-BACE-NT Ab. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were applied and visualized by chemiluminescence. The Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center Brain Bank provided temporal cortex. Our protein solubilization procedure was adapted from previously reported studies (35Orlando L.R. Dunah A.W. Standaert D.G. Young A.B. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The tissue was homogenized at 1 ml/100 mg tissue in ice-cold TEVP-sucrose buffer (containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 320 mm sucrose). The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatants were removed. The pellets were resuspended in 800 μl of TEVP with 1% SDS, sonicated for 10 s, and then boiled for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitation after the protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Co-immunoprecipitation in human brain tissue was performed as described above with rabbit anti-BACE-CT as pull-down Ab and probed with 11H4 mAb. FRET Measurements using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)—FRET is observed when two fluorophores are in very close proximity, i.e. <0 nm. FRET measurements using FLIM relies on the observation that fluorescence lifetimes (the time of fluorophore emission after brief excitation, measured in picoseconds) are shorter in the presence of a FRET acceptor. We have utilized a new FLIM technique that can detect protein-protein proximity using multiphoton microscopy (36Berezovska O. Ramdya P. Skoch J. Wolfe M.S. Bacskai B.J. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4560-4566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Bacskai B.J. Skoch J. Hickey G.A. Allen R. Hyman B.T. J. Biomed. Opt. 2003; 8: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Spectra Physics) sends a ∼100-fs pulse every ∼12.5 ns to excite the fluorophore. Images were acquired using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 multiphoton microscope. We used a high speed Hamamatsu MCP detector (MCP5900; Hamamatsu, Ichinocho, Japan) and hardware/software from Becker and Hickl (SPC 830, Berlin, Germany) to measure fluorescence lifetimes on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Excitation at 800 nm was empirically determined to excite GFP, Alexa 488 and FITC, but not Cy3. Donor fluorophore (GFP, Alexa 488, or FITC) lifetimes were fit to two exponential decay curves to calculate the fraction of fluorophores within each pixel that interact with an acceptor. As a negative control, GFP, Alexa 488, or FITC lifetimes were measured in the absence of acceptor (Cy3), which showed lifetimes equivalent to GFP, Alexa 488-IgG, or FITC IgG alone, in solution or with co-transfection with an empty vector (pEGFP) measured in the presence of Cy3-labeled BACE-V5 or LC-Myc. No bleedthrough or mis-excitation of Cy3 was observed under these conditions. Statistical testing was performed by Student's t test. Internalization Assay—To quantitate BACE internalization we modified a previously reported protocol (38Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CHO 13-5-1 (LRP-null cells) were grown to 70% confluency in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with Myc-BACE and either empty vector or LC-GFP. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm glucose (PBS++++) and 0.4 μg/ml biotinylated Myc-mAb (Upstate Biotechnologies) in PBS++++ was applied for 30 min on ice. After that the cells were allowed to endocytose at 37 °C for the indicated times. Returning the plates to ice stopped endocytosis. Surface biotin was masked with streptavidin (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h on ice. Avidin was quenched with 0.5 mg/ml biocytin (Sigma). Cells were harvested in blocking buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and incubated on IgG-coated 96-well plates at 4 °C overnight. After three washes in PBS, the plates were incubated in streptavidin-peroxidase 1:5000 (Roche Applied Science) in blocking buffer for 1 h. After another wash cycle 3× in PBS, the plates were incubated with 200 μl of 10 mg of o-phenyldiamine HCl (Sigma), 10 μl of 30% H2O2 (Sigma) in 25 ml of 50 mm Na2HPO4, 27 mm citrate, pH 5.0. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of H2SO4 and the A490 was read. BACE internalization was then graphed as the percentage of internalized Myc-BACE of total surface Myc-BACE. LRP Ectodomain Secretion Assay—HEK cells passaged into 12-well plates were transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter, LRPβ-fused N-terminally to secreted alkaline phosphatase and either empty vector, BACE, or a catalytically inactive BACE mutant. Each condition was transfected in triplicate except for siRNA experiments, which were transfected in duplicate. Media was changed 24 h later, and then collected after another 24 h. Measurement of SEAP activity in the conditioned media was carried out in triplicate by chemiluminescent assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SEAP activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity, which was measured by hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in cells lysed with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Pharmacologic inhibition of LRP cleavage was assessed after overnight treatment with vehicle (Me2SO) or a cell-permeable, peptidomimetic inhibitor of BACE (Calbiochem) (39Abbenante G. Kovacs D.M. Leung D.L. Craik D.J. Tanzi R.E. Fairlie D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—N2a cells co-transfected with LC-Myc and either empty vector, BACE, or a catalytically inactive BACE mutant and treated with 1 μm γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (40Kornilova A.Y. Das C. Wolfe M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16470-16473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for 12 h (a generous gift from M. Wolfe, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in TBS buffer and proteinase inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science) and then loaded onto 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Novex) under denaturing and reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and LRP light chain was detected by rabbit anti-Myc Ab with Alexa 680 (Molecular Probes) goat anti-rabbit secondary and visualized on a Licor Odyssey near-infrared gel reader (Lincoln, Nebraska). Luciferase Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with LRP-Gal4-VP16 (LRP-GV) in the absence or presence of BACE and relative luciferase activity determined (28May P. Reddy Y.K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18736-18743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Activity relative to β-galactosidase is shown and averaged for triplicate transfection. In all cases transfection was confirmed by immunoblotting. Localization of BACE and LRP Constructs—We first tested the localization of BACE and LRP in co-expressing H4 cells. When expressed individually, both mLRP1 and BACE were localized mainly in punctate structures in the cells. mLRP1-positive structures largely overlapped with BACE-positive structures when they were co-expressed. To determine the subcellular distribution we immunostained co-expressing H4 cells with organelle markers or, in cell surface stained without Triton X-100 treatment, Alexa555-labeled CTx-B as a raft marker. mLRP1 and BACE co-localized in the endosomal compartments stained by EEA1 (Fig. 2A). To a lesser extent, the Golgi marker GM130 also overlapped with mLRP1 and BACE (Fig. 2B). On the cell surface Myc-LC and BACE are partly co-localized with one another in lipid rafts. The results of the immunocytochemistry suggest that LC and BACE are co-localized in distinct compartments of the cell including lipid rafts (Fig. 2C), Golgi and prominently in the endosomal compartment. To confirm that LRP localizes to lipi"

Although the osmotic movement of water into and out of the mitochondrion is central for its morphology and activity, the molecular mechanisms and the pathways for water transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), the main barrier for molecules moving into and out of the organelle, are completely unknown. Here, we show the presence of a member of the aquaporin family of water channels, AQP8, and demonstrate the strikingly high water permeability (Pf) characterizing the rat liver IMM. Immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and biophysical studies show that the largest mitochondria feature the highest AQP8 expression and IMM Pf. AQP8 was also found in the mitochondria of other organs, whereas no other known aquaporins were seen. The osmotic water transport of liver IMM was partially inhibited by the aquaporin blocker Hg2+, while the related activation energy remained low, suggesting the presence of a Hg2+-insensitive facilitated pathway in addition to AQP8. It is suggested that AQP8-mediated water transport may be particularly important for rapid expansions of mitochondrial volume such as those occurring during active oxidative phosphorylation and those following apoptotic signals.

It is suggested that AQP8-mediated water transport may be particularly important for rapid expansions of mitochondrial volume such as those occurring during active oxidative phosphorylation and those following apoptotic signals. Mitochondrial volume is of pivotal importance for the activity of the electron transport chain (1Garlid K.D. Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Thurman R.G. Westerhoff H.V. Mitochondrial Volume Control. Plenum, New York1988: 259-278Google Scholar) and a control point of apoptosis (2Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar). Changes in mitochondrial volume occur in many other physiological and patho-physiological conditions, including intracellular signal transduction, liver regeneration, ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage, and anoxia (3Ichas F.

Brain Res. 2004; 999: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are well behaved osmometers, and swelling and contraction of the mitochondrial matrix and related changes to mitochondrial morphology are the consequence of the water movement that osmotically accompanies the net transport of solutes into and out of the mitochondrion (6Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Mitochondrial volume changes are modulated by the net movement of solutes including K+ and Ca2+ ions across the IMM 1The abbreviations used are: IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; AQP, aquaporin; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. (7Garlid K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8Kristián T. Gertsch J. Bates E.T. Siesjö B.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1999-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The inner mitochondrial membrane acts as a major barrier for the solutes and water moving between the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix, the outer membrane being freely permeable to molecules of up to 1.5 kDa due to the presence of the exceedingly large pores formed by VDAC, the voltage-dependent anion channel (9Colombini M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 256–257: 107-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although a number of IMM transport systems have been cloned and characterized for their ability to transport solutes across the IMM (10Palmieri F. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), the molecular pathway for the movement of water remains obscure. Important clues for understanding the molecular bases of the mitochondrial osmotic properties were recently provided by the identification of an aquaporin water channel (11Agre P. Kozono D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), AQP8, in rat hepatocyte mitochondria (12Ferri D. Mazzone A. Liquori G.E. Cassano G. Svelto M. Calamita G. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 947-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AQP8 was also found in intracellular vesicles that are shuttled to the hepatocyte apical membrane under choleretic stimuli such as those brought about by glucagon (13Gradilone S.A. Garcia F. Huebert R.C. Tietz P.S. Larocca M.C. Kierbel A. Carreras F.I. LaRusso N.F. Marinelli R.A. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize the existence of two distinct pools of AQP8 in hepatocytes, one involved in primary bile secretion and another related to intracellular osmoregulation (14Portincasa P. Moschetta A. Mazzone A. Palasciano G. Svelto M. Calamita G. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 864-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As AQP8 is predominantly expressed within the cell interior (12Ferri D. Mazzone A. Liquori G.E. Cassano G. Svelto M. Calamita G. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 947-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Calamita G. Mazzone A. Bizzoca A. Cavalier A. Cassano G. Thomas D. Svelto M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and displays a very distinct gene organization and evolutionary pathway (16Calamita G. Spalluto C. Mazzone A. Rocchi M. Svelto M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 85: 237-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zardoya R. Villalba S. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we also suggested that AQP8 evolved separately to feature intracellular specializations lacking in other mammalian aquaporins (12Ferri D. Mazzone A. Liquori G.E. Cassano G. Svelto M. Calamita G. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 947-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate possible correlations between mitochondrial AQP8 expression, and mitochondrial morphology and water permeability, we have now defined the biochemical and ultrastructural localization of AQP8 in the submitochondrial compartments, characterized the molecular pathways and biophysics of water transport across the IMM, and suggested functions for AQP8 in mitochondria. Subcellular and Submitochondrial Membrane Fractionations—Subcellular membranes were prepared from adult male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g (Morini, S. Polo D'Enza, Italy). Rats were fed with a standard diet and water ad libitum. For all experiments, rats were decapitated after anesthesia, and livers and other organs were quickly removed and processed depending on the specific preparation. All experiments carried out were in accordance with the principles for research involving animals authorized by The University of Bari. For the isolation of subcellular membrane fractions, livers were homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (four strokes in 1 min at 500 rpm) in an isolation medium consisting of 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet consisting of nuclei and unbroken cells was discarded; the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the related pellet (1,000 × g membrane fraction) was washed twice before being resuspended in isolation medium to which a mixture of protease inhibitors had been added (1 mm PMSF, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm pepstatin A). The 1,000 × g supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet washed twice leading to the 3,000 × g membrane fraction. A similar procedure was used to prepare the 6,000 × g and 17,000 × g fractions of subcellular membranes. The preparation of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and mitoplasts was performed by using the detergent approach described by Ragan et al. (18Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Critical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar). Briefly, digitonin (Calbiochem) was added to a suspension of 1,000, 3,000, or 6,000 × g mitochondria (100 mg of protein/ml) to a final concentration of 0.6% w/v in isolation medium and incubated for 15 min on ice under gentle stirring. After dilution with 3 volumes of isolation medium, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C. The resulting pellet (mitoplasts) was saved, whereas the supernatant was centrifuged at 144,000 × g for 20 min at 5 °C leading to a pellet (outer mitochondrial membrane fraction), which was then washed twice. The protein concentration was assayed by the Lowry method. The relative purity of the outer membrane and mitoplasts was assessed from the specific activity of marker enzymes (monoamine oxidase and malate dehydrogenase for the outer membrane and mitoplasts, respectively) as described previously by Ragan et al. (18Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Critical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar). All chemicals used for the preparations except digitonin were from the Sigma. Inner Mitochondrial Membrane Vesicle Preparation—The IMM vesicles were prepared as reported previously (18Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Critical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar) from the 1,000, 3,000, or 6,000 × g subpopulation of rat liver mitochondria suspended at a protein concentration of 100 mg/ml. Briefly, mitoplasts were prepared as above and resuspended in isolation medium at a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml before being sonicated with a probe sonicator (Vibra-Cell, Sonics & Materials Inc., Berlin, Germany) for six 5-s bursts at the maximum energy setting with 30-s cooling periods. After sonication, mitoplasts were diluted with an equal volume of isolation medium and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of isolation medium and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g; this process was repeated twice. The final pellet was resuspended in isolation medium to which protease inhibitors had been added and assayed for its protein content. The purity of the vesicles was assessed by assaying the cytochrome c oxidase. The diameter of the IMM vesicles was determined both by a particle size analyzer and by electron microscopy (see below). Immunoblotting Analysis—Aliquots (60 μg of proteins) of isolated mitochondria, outer membrane, or mitoplasts prepared as above were heated to 90 °C and electrophoresed in an SDS, 13% acrylamide gel (Mighty Small II, Amersham Biosciences) using a low molecular weight protein ladder (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The resolved proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto nylon membranes that were blocked in 5% (w/v) low fat milk in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) for 1 h, and further incubated with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against an N-terminal peptide of rat AQP8 (10Palmieri F. Pflügers Arch. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), AQP9 (Alpha Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX), or prohibitin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) all at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml blocking solution. Horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG-treated membranes (anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase antibody, Sigma) were developed by luminal-chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus, Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry—After being removed, samples of liver were quickly processed to be included in a hydrophilic resin (Technovit 8100, Heraeus-Kulzer, Wehrheim, Germany). Samples were fìxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 4 h at 4 °C. After overnight incubation in PBS to which 6.8% sucrose had been added, the samples were then dehydrated with acetone and embedded in Technovit 8100 at 4 °C. Before staining, semithin sections were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 0.01% trypsin in 0.1% CaCl2, pH 7.8. AQP8 was localized by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 1% H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the AQP8 affinity-purified antibodies at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml in blocking buffer (1% normal goat serum in PBS). Successively, sections were treated for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer and then incubated with peroxidase-antiperoxidase (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the immunolabeling was revealed by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine/H2O2 medium for 10 min at room temperature. Controls were performed by omitting the primary antibodies. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Four animals were used for the study. Samples of liver or testis or mitochondrial pellets were fixed in a mixture of 3% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter PBS at pH 7.4 for 4 h at 4 °C. Some specimens were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Fixed specimens were dehydrated in ethanol and then embedded in Epon (TAAB, Reading, England). Ultrathin sections were mounted on gold mesh grids. Sections of osmicated samples were oxidized with sodium metaperiodate to restore specifìc labeling. Both osmicated and non-osmicated sections were treated with 0.05 mol/liter glycine in PBS buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Grids were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin and then placed on a drop of a solution of the AQP8 N terminus antibody (10 μg/ml PBS containing 0.2% gelatin) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The grids were then incubated in 1:10 10-nm gold-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.2% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature and lightly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Finally, the grids were observed using a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Immunolabeling controls were performed by omitting the AQP8 antibody or using an antibody directed against AQP9. Ten to fifteen images were obtained from each animal or pellet (1,000 × g fraction) of freshly isolated mitochondria, while morphometric analyses were performed by counting the number of immunogold particles over an overall micrograph surface of about 2,000 μm2. Stopped-flow Light Scattering—The size of the IMM vesicles (1,000 × g fraction) to be used for the stopped-flow measurements was determined both with a N5 submicron particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and by morphometric analysis of electron micrographs. The time course of vesicular volume change was followed from changes in intensity of scattered light at the wavelength of 450 nm using a Jasco FP-6200 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) stopped-flow reaction analyzer that has a 1.6-ms dead time and 99% mixing efficiency in <1 ms. The sample temperature was controlled by a circulating water bath. To perform the experiments, 35 μl of a concentrated vesicle suspension was diluted into 2.5 ml of a hypotonic (220 mosM) isolation medium (124 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). One of the syringes of the stopped-flow apparatus was filled with the vesicle suspension, whereas the other was filled with the same buffer added of mannitol to reach a final osmolarity of 500 mosm to establish a hypertonic gradient (140 mosm) upon mixing. The final protein concentration after mixing was 100 μg/ml. Immediately, after applying a hypertonic gradient, water outflow occurs, and the vesicles shrink, causing an increase in scattered light intensity. The data were fitted to a single exponential function. The osmotic water permeability coefficient (Pf), an index reflecting the osmotic water permeability of the vesicular membrane, was calculated as described (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), using the equation: Pf = Kexp·V0/Av·Vw·ΔC, where Kexp is the fitted exponential rate constant, V0 is the initial mean of vesicle volume, Av is the mean vesicle surface, Vw is the molar volume of water, and ΔC is the osmotic gradient. The medium osmolarity was verified by freezing point depression, using a Halbmikro-Osmometer (Knauer, Berlin, Germany). In some experiments, IMM vesicles were incubated for 5 min in isolation medium deprived of EGTA and EDTA and containing 300 μm HgCl2, a sulfhydryl compound known to block mammalian aquaporins including AQP8 (20Ishibashi K. Kuwahara M. Kageyama Y. Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In other experiments, to verify the blocking action of the Hg2+ ion, the HgCl2 treatment of the vesicles was followed by a 15 min exposure to 10 mm of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol. The temperature dependence of osmotic water permeability in the IMM vesicles in the presence or absence of Hg2+ inhibition was assessed by determining the activation energy of Arrhenius (Ea) calculated measuring the Pf of the vesicles at 10, 20, and 30 °C. As a first step, we defined the precise subcellular localization of AQP8 in rat liver. This was done by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting using an affinity-purified immunoglobulin G specific for the rat AQP8 polypeptide. Strong immunohistochemical AQP8 reactivity was seen within the hepatocyte cell interior (Fig. 1A). Overall, AQP8 labeling was found to be greater in the periportal and midlobular than pericentral regions of the hepatic lobule, although hepatocytes with heavy immunostaining were sometimes found in the pericentral region (Fig. 1A, red block arrows). For the immunoblotting experiments, the AQP8 antibody was incubated with fractions of rat liver membranes prepared at different gravitational forces as reported previously (21Lanni A. Moreno M. Lombardi A. Goglia F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A band of expected size, 28 kDa, was strongly detected in the 1,000 and 3,000 × g fractions and, to a lesser extent, in the 6,000 × g pellet (Fig. 1B). An additional band of higher molecular mass was seen in the mitochondrial fraction, likely representing a multimeric form of AQP8 (Fig. 1B). Consistent with a previous report (21Lanni A. Moreno M. Lombardi A. Goglia F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), microscopic analysis revealed that the 1,000, 3,000, and 6,000 × g pellets of liver used throughout the experiments were basically composed of mitochondria (98, 96, and 84% of the pellet volume, respectively). This was also confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against prohibitin, a mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1C). Supporting a predominant expression of AQP8 in intracellular organelles, the 28-kDa band was very weak in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction (17,000 × g) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, after normalizing for the different percentage of mitochondria composing the gravitational pellets, densitometric analysis of the above immunoblots showed that the heavier the mitochondrial fraction the stronger the intensity of the 28-kDa band (Fig. 1D). By electron microscopy analysis, the average mitochondria size in the 1,000 × g liver fraction was almost twice and three times larger than the 3,000 and 6,000 × g fractions, respectively (1.18 ± 0.4, 0.68 ± 0.4, and 0.45 ± 0.3 μm, respectively). Suggesting a wide expression in mitochondria, AQP8 immunoreactivity was detected in the mitochondrial fractions of kidney (Fig. 1E) and many other rat organs known to express such AQP including testis, heart, duodenum, jejunum, and colon (data not shown). AQP8 was apparently absent in epididymal spermatozoa (data not shown). Control immunoblotting using antibodies against AQP9, an aquaporin reported to be expressed only in the hepatocyte sinusoidal membrane (22Elkjaer M. Vajda Z. Nejsum L.N. Kwon T. Jensen U.B. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Frokiaer J. Nielsen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), showed the absence of immunoreactivity in the mitochondrial fractions, while a band of expected molecular mass, 29 kDa, was detected in the fractions containing plasma membrane (Fig. 1F). Localization of AQP8 in the inner mitochondrial membrane was indicated by immunoblotting experiments showing higher AQP8 immunoreactivity in mitoplasts than whole mitochondria and negligible staining in the OMM (Fig. 1G). This finding was fully consistent with studies of immunogold electron microscopy with both in situ and freshly isolated mitochondria, in both cases showing AQP8 immunoreactivity in the IMM and, occasionally, the matrix compartment (Fig. 2, A, B, and D). No distinctive labeling was observed in the OMM when this membrane was clearly visible (Fig. 2D). Morphometric analysis of freshly isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2F) showed variable AQP8 reactivity among mitochondria, some of which appeared poorly labeled or even unreactive. This pattern of distribution is consistent with the heterogeneous distribution of AQP8 in liver (Fig. 1A) and suggests the existence of subpopulations of mitochondria where AQP8 is not expressed. This possibility is corroborated by the apparent absence of immunogold AQP8 particles in the mitochondria of rat epididymal spermatozoa (data not shown). Interestingly, such mitochondria have the distinctive metabolic feature of not performing the β-oxidation of fatty acids and to use fructose as the only carbon source. Future studies will be addressed to identify the metabolic features of the subpopulations of mitochondria expressing AQP8. Consistent with a possible involvement of AQP8 in rapid increases in mitochondrial volume, swollen mitochondria showed AQP8 immunostaining in their IMM (Fig. 2C). Confirming the wide presence of AQP8 in mitochondria, immunogold particles were seen in in situ mitochondria of rat testis (Fig. 2D). No mitochondrial labeling was seen in control experiments where mitochondria were incubated with antibodies directed against the other hepatocyte aquaporin, AQP9 (data not shown).Fig. 2Submitochondrial localization of AQP8 by immunogold electron microscopy.A, in situ labeling.

To investigate the reciprocal contribution of the channel-mediated (facilitated diffusion) and lipid bilayer (simple diffusion) pathways to the movement of water through the IMM, we directly assessed osmotic water permeability (Pf) and related activation energy (Ea) of basically pure and homogeneous IMM vesicles by measuring scattered light intensity using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Mitochondria and mitoplasts could not be used for the IMM Pf calculation as they are of heterogeneous size (Fig. 2, A–D) and irregular shape (Fig. 3A), respectively. IMM vesicles from the 1,000, 3,000, or 6,000 × g subpopulations of intact mitochondria were obtained by sonication from liver mitoplasts and had a mean vesicle diameter of 234 ± 31 (n = 626), 248 ± 36 (n = 611), and 243 ± 28 (n = 676) nm, respectively (Fig. 3B). Vesicles were subjected rapidly to a hypertonic osmotic gradient (140 mosm), and the time course of the vesicle shrinkage was followed from the change in scattered light. The osmotic water permeability of all three subpopulations of IMM vesicles was strikingly high (Fig. 3, C and D) in line with the rapid changes in volume which mitochondria undergo during metabolic homeostasis (23Bereiter-Hahn J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 122: 1-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The highest values of Pf were obtained with the IMM vesicles prepared from the heaviest mitochondria, since the Pf values were of 524.5 ± 6.7, 496.6 ± 9.0, and 341.4 ± 4.5 μm/s for the 1,000, 3,000, and 6,000 × g fraction, respectively (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, the Pf values paralleled the expression rates of AQP8 in the same mitochondrial populations from which the IMM vesicles were prepared (Fig. 1, A and B). Proving the absence of mixing artifact, no change in scattered light was observed when vesicles were mixed with isosmotic buffer (Fig. 3C). Indicating direct correlation between mitochondrial size and importance of the channel-mediated pathway for the water movement across the IMM, the heavier the mitochondrial population the higher the inhibition of the IMM Pf after exposure of the vesicles to 300 μm HgCl2, a known aquaporin blocker acting on the sulfhydryl group of a cysteine in the vicinity of the aqueous pore (Cys210 in AQP8). The extent of the Pf inhibition of the 1,000, 3,000, and 6,000g vesicles was –56.4 ± 5.2%, –47.6 ± 3.4%, and –39.6 ± 4.2%, respectively (Fig. 3E). Such inhibitions did not significantly increase when vesicles were exposed both internally and externally to HgCl2 (data not shown). Consistent with the existence of a Hg2+-inhibitable aqueous pathway for osmotic water permeability across the IMM, the above inhibition was reversed after exposure to the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3E). However, the fact that in liver mitochondria we could not detect any reactivity (data not shown) to other known mammalian aquaporins being insensitive to sulfhydryl blockers (AQP4 and AQP7) suggests the possible presence of unknown aqueous pores that are insensitive to Hg2+ and which provide a non-negligible contribution to the high Pf of the IMM. To examine further the molecular mechanism and pathway(s) of water transport across IMM, we decided to determine the Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) of the osmotic water permeability of the IMM vesicles from temperature dependence data. Some increase in the rate of osmotic water transport was observed when the vesicles were subjected to the same osmotic gradient (140 mosm) at increasing temperatures. Arrhenius plotting of the calculated Pf values at 10, 20, and 30 °C resulted in an Ea of 3.93, 4.51, and 4.93 kcal/mol for the 1,000, 3,000, and 6,000 × g IMM vesicles, respectively. These Ea values, all biophysically consistent with water permeation through aqueous channels (19van Heeswijk M.P. van Os C.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 92: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), showed only slight increases when the IMM vesicles were exposed to HgCl2 before the stopped-flow light scattering measurements (4.71, 4.86, and 5.11 kcal/mol for the 1,000, 3,000, and 6,000 × g IMM vesicles, respectively). Although the Hg2+-inhibitable route accounts for most water permeability of the IMM this result suggests the existence of an additional pathway, a Hg2+-insensitive one, facilitating the movement of water across the IMM. The molecular identity of the Hg2+-insensitive pathway will be a matter for future investigation. Mitochondrial AQP8 might act independently or be part of the postulated “permeability transition pore complex” that mediates the rapid entry of solutes and water into the matrix (24Zoratti M. Szabo I. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), causing swelling of the organelle, rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and release of cytochrome c and other key pro-apoptotic elements into the cytoplasm leading to apoptosis. This possibility is corroborated both by the recent observation that treatment with aquaporin blockers prevents the mitoplast swelling induced by the Cd2+ ion, a known apoptotic agent (26Lee W-K. Bork U. Gholamrezaei F. Thévenod F. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F27-F39Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and our preliminary studies showing absence of AQP8 in the mitochondrial compartment of immortalized hepatocytes (data not shown). Aquaporins have already been reported to affect the rate of apoptosis by controlling the rate of downstream apoptotic events (27Jablonski E.M. Webb A.N. McConnell N.A. Riley M.C. Hughes F.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C975-C985Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). AQP8 may also be relevant in facilitating the increase in volume which the mitochondrion undergoes when its ATP synthesis efficiency increases because, as seen above, the mitochondria with the highest AQP8 content are also the ones with the greatest diameter (Fig. 1, B and D), oxidative capacity, and respiratory rate (21Lanni A. Moreno M. Lombardi A. Goglia F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Weibel E.R. Staubli W.S. Gnagi H.R. Hess F.A. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). By contrast, AQP8-mediated water movement would not be necessary in small mitochondria performing low oxidative phosphorylation, as sufficient amounts of water can cross the IMM by facilitated diffusion through the unidentified aqueous pore suggested by the above biophysical experiments and by simple diffusion (non-channel mediated pathway). Pathways of simple diffusion through the IMM are 1) the lipid bilayer, which is comparatively large in small mitochondria due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, and 2) the extensive hydrophilic domains created by the extraordinary amount (76%) of proteins composing the IMM. Overall, as well as biophysically characterizing the osmotic conduit of water across the mitochondrion, we provide biochemical and ultrastructural evidence for the presence of an aquaporin water channel, AQP8, in the inner membrane. Moreover, the existence of a pathway other than aquaporins that facilitates the osmotic movement of water across the IMM is postulated and deserves investigation. AQP8-mediated water movement may be particularly important in the homeostatic control of mitochondrial volume such as in the swelling that the mitochondrion undergoes under apoptotic stimuli and during oxidative phosphorylation. Recognition of AQP8 in mitochondria therefore has profound new implications for an understanding of how mitochondria adapt their morphology. We are grateful to Dr. Peter Agre for his encouragement and valuable suggestions regarding the biophysical studies, W. B. Guggino, Adrian E. Hill, and Raoúl A. Marinelli for critical reading of this paper, to Fernando Goglia for his valuable suggestions about mitochondria isolation, and to Anthony Green for proofreading the final text and suggesting stylistic improvements."

https://openalex.org/W1980365766,"We have previously shown that the p75 isoform of the transcriptional co-activator lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF) interacts tightly with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 integrase (IN) and is essential for nuclear targeting of this protein in human cells (Cherepanov, P., Maertens, G., Proost, P., Devreese, B., Van Beeumen, J., Engelborghs, Y., De Clercq, E., and Debyser, Z. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 372–381; Maertens, G., Cherepanov, P., Pluymers, W., Busschots, K., De Clercq, E., Debyser, Z., and Engelborghs, Y. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33528–33539). Here the interaction between recombinant LEDGF/p75 and HIV-1 IN was examined in a pull-down binding test. LEDGF/p75 was shown to increase the solubility of HIV-1 IN. Next, fluorescent correlation spectroscopy was used to measure the interaction of LEDGF/p75 or the complex of HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 with a specific double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. Whereas LEDGF/p75 displayed only a moderate affinity for DNA, it strongly promoted the binding of HIV-1 IN to DNA. This effect was specific for the p75 isoform of LEDGF and was not seen with p52. In the pull-down assay LEDGF/p75 interacted with HIV-1, HIV-2, and feline immunodeficiency virus IN, but not with the IN of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2, Moloney murine leukemia virus, or Rous sarcoma virus. These results strongly suggest that the interaction of LEDGF/p75 with IN is specific to lentiviridae. LEDGF/p75 stimulated the binding of HIV-1 and HIV-2 IN, but not Moloney murine leukemia virus or Rous sarcoma virus IN, to an aspecific DNA. These results provide supporting evidence for our hypothesis that LEDGF/p75 plays a role in the tethering of lentiviral IN to the chromosomal DNA.

Reverse transcription takes place in the cytoplasm of the infected cell and results in the formation of a compact and stable pre-integration complex (PIC) containing the viral reverse-transcribed genome and a number of virion-derived and cellular proteins. The family of the retroviridae can be broadly divided into simple and complex retroviridae, depending on their genomic composition and replication cycle. The retroviridae are then further subdivided into seven groups defined by evolutionary relatedness. Five of these groups represent retroviruses with oncogenic potential, and the other two groups are the lentiviruses and the spumaviruses (for a review, see Ref. 1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 1-25Google Scholar). Lentiviridae (e.g. HIV-1, HIV-2, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), or simian immunodeficiency virus) are able to productively infect non-dividing cells, a feature that distinguishes them from oncoretroviridae (e.g. Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-2), which require cell division for productive infection (2Lewis P.F.

The viral integrase (IN) catalyzes the integration of the viral cDNA into the host genomic DNA, a process that is essential for replication and results in a provirus that will remain present as long as the cell survives (for reviews, see Refs. 4Brown P.O.

The functional holoprotein required for concerted integration of two long terminal repeat ends is believed to exist as a homodimer of two tetramers (13Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B.

Identification and characterization of these cellular cofactors will increase our understanding of the viral replication cycle and aid in the development of new antiviral drugs. Various cofactors of the lentiviral integration process have been proposed. Integrase interactor 1, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (17Wang W. Cote J. Xue Y. Zhou S. Khavari P.A. Biggar S.R. Muchardt C. Kalpana G.V. Goff S.P. Yaniv M. Workman J.L. Crabtree G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 18Pruss D. Reeves R.

Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Other cellular host factors might participate in HIV integration. The high mobility group protein HMG-1a, a non-histone chromosomal protein involved in transcriptional control and nuclear architecture, was identified as a cellular host factor essential for PIC activity in vitro (22Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Human EED, a cellular protein interacting with HIV-1 matrix protein and acting as a transcriptional repressor and gene silencer, was found to interact with HIV-1 IN and to stimulate the integration reaction in vitro (23Violot S. Hong S.S. Rakotobe D. Petit C. Gay B. Moreau K. Billaud G. Priet S. Sire J. Schwartz O. Mouscadet J.F. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 12507-12522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other cellular factors, such as the barrier to autointegration factor and Ku, have been shown to co-purify with PICs. Barrier to autointegration factor is thought to prevent intramolecular integration (24Lee M.S. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The exact function of all these factors during in vivo integration remains to be determined. Recently, we have identified the p75 isoform of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) as a tight binding partner of HIV-1 IN in human cells (13Cherepanov P. Maertens G. Proost P. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Engelborghs Y. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 372-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). LEDGF/p75 was shown to enhance the enzymatic activity of recombinant HIV-1 IN. Expression of LEDGF/p75 is required for the association of IN with mitotic chromosomes, suggesting a role in tethering IN to DNA (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Although the exact cellular function of LEDGF/p75 is still unknown, it has been suggested to play a role in transcriptional regulation because it is isolated from HeLa cell extracts as an interactor of the transcriptional co-activator PC4 (25Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). LEDGF/p75 is a member of the hepatoma-derived growth factor family and has been proposed to play a protective role during stress-induced apoptosis (26Ganapathy V. Daniels T. Casiano C.A. Singh D.P.

Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48899-48907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DNA binding of LEDGF/p75, with specificity for stress response DNA elements, has been reported (29Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A second protein product, p52, is generated from the LEDGF/p75 gene as a result of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA (25Ge H. Si Y. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6723-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Singh D.P. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Ohguro N. Kikuchi T. Sueno T. Reddy V.N. Yuge K. Fatma N. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although p52 was found to be a more general and stronger transcriptional co-activator in vitro than LEDGF/p75 (31Ge H. Si Y. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 751-759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it does not interact with HIV-1 IN in vitro or in living cells (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In this report, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to study the effect of LEDGF/p75 on the binding of IN to different DNA substrates. LEDGF/p75, but not p52, clearly stimulated the binding of HIV-1 IN to DNA. Moreover, in both pull-down and FCS assays, the interaction of LEDGF/p75 with IN proved to be specific for lentiviridae. Plasmids for Bacterial Expression—The constructs pCPnat75 and pKBnat52 were used for the bacterial expression of non-tagged LEDGF/p75 and p52 proteins as described previously (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The plasmid pKB-IN6H was used for the bacterial expression of the C-terminal His6tagged form of HIV-1 IN (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal-tagged form of HIV-1 IN was expressed from pRP1012 (32Lutzke R.A. Plasterk R.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4841-4848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragments containing the IN open reading frame of HIV-2 (33van den Ent F.M. Vos A. Plasterk R.H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FIV (34Vink C. van der Linden K.H. Plasterk R.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1468-1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RSV (35Chiu R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6482-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were cloned into pET-20b(+) vector (Novagen, VWR, Leuven, Belgium) as fusions to a C-terminal His6 tag, using the NdeI and SalI sites. The fragments were PCR-amplified using the following primers and templates: 5′-CGCGTCGACTGCCATTTCTCCATCCT, 5′-CGCCATATGTTCCTGGAAAAAATAGAGC, and pRP1013 to obtain pKBHIV2IN; 5′-CGCGTCGACCTCATCCCCTTCAGGAAGAGC, 5′-CGCCATATGTGGGTTGACAGAATTGAGGAAG, and pRP825 to obtain pKBFIVIN; and T7 promoter primer and 5′-CGCGTCGACTGCAAAAAGAGGGCTCGCCTC to obtain pKBRSVIN. HTLV-2 IN with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed from the plasmid pHTLV2 (36Wang T. Piefer A.J. Jonsson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14710-14717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and for bacterial expression of Mo-MuLV IN, the plasmid pETINH1 was used (37Jonsson C.B. Donzella G.A. Roth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1462-1469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs used in this work were verified via sequence analysis. Production and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Non-tagged LEDGF/p75 and p52 proteins were produced from the plasmids pCPnat75 and pKBnat52, respectively, in Escherichia coli B BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The purification of HIV-2 IN, FIV IN, and RSV IN was done as described for HIV-1 IN (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). HTLV-2 IN was first enriched by batch purification on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and then manually loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap™ Heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 1 m NaCl, 7.5 mm CHAPS, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the peak fractions were supplemented with 5 mm dithiothreitol plus 10% glycerol and frozen at –80 °C. The purification of Mo-MuLV IN was performed as described previously (38Villanueva R.A. Jonsson C.B. Jones J. Georgiadis M.M. Roth M.J. Virology. 2003; 316: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon10 (Millipore) or Vivaspin 15R (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). All IN protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad); the proteins were separated by 11% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue R-250. His6 Tag Integrase Pull-down Assay—Binding of IN to LEDGF/p75 was assayed in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 20 mm imidazole containing 150 or 400 mm NaCl, in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 (binding buffer). 1 μg of recombinant His6-tagged IN was incubated with 1–3 μg of LEDGF/p75 in 200 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the mixtures were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove aggregated protein. The supernatant was supplemented with 40 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose and stirred for an additional 30 min. The agarose beads were recovered by centrifugation for 2 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C and washed with 500 μl of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in 40 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 200 mm imidazole and 1% SDS and analyzed by 11% SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). For the solubility assay, the same amounts of IN and bovine serum albumin were added to 200 μl of binding buffer with a NaCl concentration ranging between 100 and 500 mm in the absence or presence of LEDGF/p75. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the mixtures were centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove aggregated proteins. The supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid by adding 1 volume of 50% trichloroacetic acid to the protein sample. Following a 30-min incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with cold acetone and centrifuged again to remove the supernatant. The pellet was dried and redissolved in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for analysis on SDS-PAGE. FCS Instrumentation—A commercial FCS set up (the ConfoCor I of Zeiss) was used as described previously (39Van Craenenbroeck E. Engelborghs Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5082-5088Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40Van Craenenbroeck E. Engelborghs Y. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this configuration, an objective lens of type C-Apochromat 40x/1.2W was used, the pinhole diameter was 45 μm in all experiments, and a typical size of the excitation volume was 1.4 fl. The 543 nm line of the HeNe ion laser and the 488 nm line of an Argon ion laser were applied in all experiments, attenuated with a 0.3 optical density neutral density filter for the DNA binding experiments. The laser beam was focused at about 180 μm above the bottom of the Nunc cuvettes (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) in a typical volume of 10 μl. The data electronics and software (Borland Delphi) were used as described previously (41Van Craenenbroeck E. Vercammen J. Matthys G. Beirlant J. Marot C. Hoebeke J. Strobbe R. Engelborghs Y. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Assay—The DNA binding assay was based on fluorescence fluctuations analysis (11Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This was carried out on the one hand with synthetic oligonucleotides that resemble the U5 long terminal repeat ends of the genome of each specific retrovirus analyzed and on the other hand with one aspecific DNA substrate. For each DNA substrate, one oligonucleotide was fluorescence-labeled with a tetramethylrhodamine derivative (TAMRA; Molecular Probes), at the 5′ end. For HIV-1, we used INT1-TMR5 (5′-TGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT) and INT2 (5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACA); for RSV, we used RSVINT1-TMR5 (5′-ATTGCATAAGACTACATT) and RSVINT2 (5′-AATGTAGTCTTATGCAAT); for Mo-MuLV, we used Mo-MuLVINT1-TMR5 (5′-GTCAGCGGGGGTCTTTCATT) and Mo-MuLVINT2 (5′-AATGAAAGACCCCCGCTGAC); and for HIV-2, we used HIV2INT1-TMR5 (5′-GCAGGAAAATCCCTAGCAGG) and HIV2INT2 (5′-CCTGCTAGGGATTTTCCTGC). For the aspecific DNA substrate 5′-CCTGCTAGGGATTTTCCTGC, TCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTGTGCACTCTTCTTCTTCT and GCGCACGCGTGTGCACACTCGAGTACGTACATGCATGC were ordered and labeled at the 5′ end with BODIPY. All oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by Proligo (Paris, France). We purified the oligonucleotides further by gel electrophoresis in a denaturing urea gel (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.23-11.30Google Scholar). For substrate preparation, equimolar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. The samples were incubated at 80 °C for 1 min and cooled to 20 °C over the course of ∼90 min. The final DNA concentration of the fluorescent double-stranded DNA was determined using ConfoCor I. The effect of LEDGF/p75 on the DNA binding properties of IN was tested in the reaction buffer normally used for enzymatic assays. This buffer contained the following final concentrations: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 5% polyethylene glycol 8000 and will be referred to henceforth as the reaction buffer. The DNA substrate concentration was kept constant at 30 nm, whereas the IN concentration varied. After an incubation of the samples for 10 min at room temperature, the measurements were performed during a 60-s period. Each sample was measured 10 times. The data were subsequently analyzed as described previously, using the quantile plot analysis method (12Vercammen J. Maertens G. Gerard M. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38045-38052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interaction of HIV-1 Integrase with LEDGF/p75 as Analyzed by a Pull-down Binding Assay—To study the interaction between IN and LEDGF/p75 in vitro we optimized a specific binding assay, based on the ability of Ni-NTA-agarose to bind His6-tagged proteins (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that LEDGF/p75 but not p52 specifically interacts with HIV-1 IN in this test (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). After pre-incubation of His6-tagged HIV-1 IN with recombinant LEDGF/p75, HIV-1 IN is bound to Ni-NTA-agarose, washed, and eluted with imidazole. Recombinant LEDGF/p75 is readily recovered in a stable complex with IN. Finally, the proteins in the complex are identified in a SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. First we examined the effect of a N-versus C-terminal His6 tag on the interaction between LEDGF/p75 and HIV-1 IN as well as the effect of the NaCl concentration in the buffer. Heretofore we cloned the His6 tag at the C terminus or the N terminus of HIV-1 IN. In comparison with the protein with the His6 tag at the C terminus, N-terminal-tagged HIV-1 IN pulled down less LEDGF/p75 (Fig. 1). This result is in agreement with our previous findings that the N-terminal domain of IN enhances the affinity of IN for LEDGF/p75 (16Maertens G. Cherepanov P. Pluymers W. Busschots K. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33528-33539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Therefore, all further experiments were carried out with IN tagged at the C terminus. The binding assays were performed in both 150 and 400 mm NaCl. Although the interaction of IN with LEDGF/p75 is strongest in 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 1, compare the band for LEDGF/p75 in lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 6 and 7 and in lanes 10 and 11 with lanes 13 and 14), the precipitation of IN is also more pronounced in the presence of 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 2). This effect was minimal in the experiment shown in Fig. 1, but it was more pronounced with the other retroviral INs used in the present study. Therefore, the following binding experiments were always performed in both 150 and 400 mm NaCl. LEDGF/p75 Enhances the Solubility of HIV-1 IN—To study the effect of LEDGF/p75 on the solubility of HIV-1 IN, we performed a precipitation experiment to determine the NaCl concentration required to keep IN in solution. We used the buffer of the pull-down assay, with NaCl concentrations ranging between 100 and 500 mm (Fig. 2). After 30 min of incubation, the samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were separated from the supernatant, which was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. All samples were redissolved and run in a SDS-PAGE gel. In the absence of LEDGF/p75, IN precipitated in salt conditions of ≤350 mm. In the presence of LEDGF/p75, however, IN remained soluble at a NaCl concentration above 200 mm. Addition of bovine serum albumin did not increase the solubility of IN, indicating that the increase in solubility of IN by LEDGF/p75 is a specific effect. LEDGF/p75 Enhances the Binding of HIV-1 IN to DNA—We have previously established an FCS-based assay to analyze the binding of HIV-1 IN to a fluorescence-labeled 20-mer double-stranded DNA resembling the HIV-1 U5 long terminal repeat sequence (12Vercammen J. Maertens G. Gerard M. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. Engelborghs Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38045-38052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study at a final NaCl concentration of 50 mm, the dissociation constant (Kd) for the IN·DNA complex was 208 ± 26 nm. We then investigated the effect of the addition of recombinant LEDGF/p75 on the formation of the IN·DNA complex. The Kd for this LEDGF-DNA complex was estimated at 1110 ± 86 nm. Next, increasing concentrations of LEDGF/p75 were added to the DNA at various concentrations of HIV-1 IN. By plotting the calculated amounts of free proteins and complexes bound to the DNA, we could demonstrate a clear stimulation by LEDGF/p75 of the binding of HIV-1 IN to DNA (Fig. 3). From the slope of the binding plot at low IN concentrations, the dissociation constant for the IN·LEDGF/p75·DNA complex was calculated at 6.17 ± 0.88 nm, corresponding to a >33-fold increase in binding. We also investigated the binding of the p52 isoform to DNA. This protein bound to DNA with a higher affinity than LEDGF/p75. The calculated apparent Kd was 763 ± 303 nm. Upon addition of p52, no stimulation of the binding of IN to DNA was seen (Fig. 3). Overall binding merely represented the additive effect of the binding of each protein to the DNA (data point at IN = 0 concentration). The Interaction between LEDGF/p75 and IN Is Lentivirus-specific—The specificity of binding of various retroviral INs to human LEDGF/p75 was tested in the pull-down binding assay. The INs of the following lentiviridae were included in the experiment: HIV-1, HIV-2, and FIV, as well as the INs of the retroviridae HTLV-2, Mo-MuLV, and RSV. All C-terminal His6-tagged INs were expressed in bacteria and purified by Ni-NTA and Heparin chromatography. The purification scheme is described under “Experimental Procedures” and was identical for all INs, except for Mo-MuLV and HTLV-2 IN. Of note, HTLV-2 IN displayed a very low solubility and precipitated even in 1 m NaCl, but LEDGF/p75 did not enhance its solubility (data not shown). The purity of the different IN preparations was verified with SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were used at equimolar concentrations in the pull-down binding assay. The results of these interaction studies are shown in Fig. 4. The IN of HIV-1, HIV-2, and FIV showed a strong and specific interaction with human LEDGF/p75 (Fig. 4A). No interaction was detected with the IN of human HTLV-2, murine Mo-MuLV, or avian RSV (lanes 4 and 6 on all gels in Fig. 4B) because no LEDGF/p75 was pulled-down for these INs. This lack of interaction with retroviral IN was confirmed by a more sensitive detection of LEDGF/p75 by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-LEDGF p75/p52 antibody (data not shown). The results demonstrate that the binding of LEDGF/p75 to IN is lentivirus-specific. In a parallel yeast two-hybrid experiment, interaction was shown between LEDGF/p75 and the integrases of HIV-1 a"

Small molecule inhibitors of MKP-1 have not been reported, in part because of the lack of structural guidance for inhibitor design and definitive assays for MKP-1 inhibition in intact cells. Herein we have exploited a high content chemical complementation assay to analyze a diverse collection of pure natural products for cellular MKP-1 inhibition. Using two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, we identified sanguinarine, a plant alkaloid with known antibiotic and antitumor activity but no primary cellular target, as a potent and selective inhibitor of MKP-1. Sanguinarine inhibited cellular MKP-1 with an IC50 of 10 μm and showed selectivity for MKP-1 over MKP-3. Sanguinarine also inhibited MKP-1 and the MKP-1 like phosphatase, MKP-L, in vitro with IC50 values of 17.3 and 12.5 μm, respectively, and showed 5–10-fold selectivity for MKP-3 and MKP-1 over VH-1-related phosphatase, Cdc25B2, or protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B. In a human tumor cell line with high MKP-1 levels, sanguinarine caused enhanced ERK and JNK/SAPK phosphorylation. A close congener of sanguinarine, chelerythrine, also inhibited MKP-1 in vitro and in whole cells, and activated ERK and JNK/SAPK. In contrast, sanguinarine analogs lacking the benzophenanthridine scaffold did not inhibit MKP-1 in vitro or in cells nor did they cause ERK or JNK/SAPK phosphorylation. These data illustrate the utility of a chemical complementation assay linked with multiparameter high content cellular screening.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1478-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Over the past five years, reports have become more numerous describing high levels of MKP-1 in human tumors. For example, high levels of MKP-1 have been found in prostate (4Magi-Galluzzi C. Mishra R. Fiorentino M. Montironi R. Yao H. Capodieci P. Wishnow K. Kaplan I. Stork P.J. Loda M. Lab. Investig. 1997; 76: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar), gastric (5Bang Y.J. Kwon J.H. Kang S.H. Kim J.W. Yang Y.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), breast (6Wang H. Cheng Z. Malbon C.C. Cancer Lett. 2003; 191: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and pancreatic cancer (7Liao Q. Guo J. Kleeff J. Zimmermann A. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Friess H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1830-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In ovarian cancer samples, MKP-1 expression was correlated with decreased progression-free survival (8Denkert C. Schmitt W.D. Berger S. Reles A. Pest S. Siegert A. Lichtenegger W. Dietel M. Hauptmann S. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 102: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). High levels of MKP-1 expression were also found in the early phases of prostate, colon, and bladder carcinogenesis (9Loda M. Capodieci P. Mishra R. Yao H. Corless C. Grigioni W. Wang Y. Magi-Galluzzi C. Stork P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 1553-1564PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that MKP-1 may actually support the transformed phenotype comes from a recent study by Liao et al. (7Liao Q. Guo J. Kleeff J. Zimmermann A. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Friess H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1830-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) who showed that PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells stably transfected with a full-length MKP-1 antisense construct had longer doubling times, decreased ability to form colonies in soft agar, and were unable to form tumors in nude mice. The precise mechanism by which loss of MKP-1 expression affects tumorigenicity, however, remains elusive. Several reports have implicated JNK/SAPK and p38 as the primary mediators of MKP-1 mediated cytoprotection (1Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Franklin C.C. Srikanth S. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3014-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the data presented by Liao et al. (7Liao Q. Guo J. Kleeff J. Zimmermann A. Buchler M.W. Korc M. Friess H. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1830-1845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) argue that the primary mechanism by which MKP-1 supports the transformed phenotype is mediated by ERK, but not JNK, as suppression of MKP-1 expression by antisense did not affect basal levels of phospho-JNK or phospho-p38, but instead increased basal ERK phosphorylation and prolonged ERK phosphorylation after epidermal growth factor stimulation in PANC-1 cells. The availability of a cell-active selective MKP-1 inhibitor would be a valuable tool for dissecting the complex regulatory processes involved in the attenuation of ERK, JNK, and p38 activation and for defining the contributions of MKP-1 and its cellular targets to the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. In light of recent findings, inhibitors of MKP-1 might also find applications as novel target-based antineoplastic therapies, either alone or in combination with clinically used antineoplastic agents (1Sanchez-Perez I. Martinez-Gomariz M. Williams D. Keyse S.M. Perona R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5142-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Franklin C.C. Srikanth S. Kraft A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1478-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The search for MKP-1 inhibitors has been challenging for several reasons. In contrast to MKP-3, whose crystal structure has been reported and found to possess high structural similarity to the related VHR in its catalytic domain (10Stewart A.E. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. McDonald N.Q. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), no structural information is available for MKP-1. This may in part be due to difficulties in producing large amounts of recombinant enzyme and the need of MKPs to interact with their physiological substrates to become fully active (11Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The conformational changes associated with phosphatase-substrate interactions may render assays based on dephosphorylation of small molecule substrates or short peptides inaccurate predictors of effective phosphatase inhibitors in a physiological context. Cellular assays provide a potentially powerful alternative to in vitro screening for phosphatase inhibitors. The advent and maturation of cellular assay technologies such as high content screening (HCS) (12Giuliano K.A. DeBiasio R.L. Dunlay T. Gough A. Volosky J.M. Zock J. Pavlakis G.N. Taylor D.L. J. Biomol. Screen. 1997; 2: 249-259Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar) permit the construction of rapid and quantitative discovery assays with definitive phenotypic endpoints. In this report, we have combined a definitive cellular assay for MKP-1 activity with HCS methodology and an unbiased statistical analysis of the HCS data set, and executed a small molecule screen for inhibitors of MKP-1 in intact mammalian cells. By analyzing a relatively small number of diverse natural products, we identified a plant alkaloid, sanguinarine, as a cell-active inhibitor of MKP-1. Compound credentialing was greatly facilitated by the employment of a cellular assay, which selected compounds with a defined biological activity. These results not only reveal sanguinarine as the first reported selective inhibitor of MKP-1 but also expose a primary cellular target for some of the biological activities of sanguinarine. Compounds—The MicroSource Natural Products Library (Discovery Systems, Inc., Gaylordsville, CT) is a 720-compound collection of pure natural products and their derivatives. The collection includes simple and complex oxygen heterocycles, alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, pentacyclic triterpenes, sterols, and many other diverse representatives. Compounds were supplied as 10 mm stocks of Me2SO, stored at –20 °C and thawed immediately before analysis. Aliquots were dissolved to a final concentration of 50 μm in complete growth medium prior to cell treatment. Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. All other chemicals, including the sanguinarine analogs, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies and Plasmids—Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK (E10), rabbit polyclonal phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, and pan-JNK/SAPK antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal ERK antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-c-myc (9E10) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse, AlexaFluor 546-, 555-, and 647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG and goat-anti mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). cDNA encoding myc-tagged human MKP-3 (PYST-1) in a pSG5 mammalian expression vector (37Groom L.A.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3389-3399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CL100 in a pET15b bacterial expression vector were gifts from Dr. Stephen Keyse (CRUK, Dundee, UK). A plasmid encoding myc-tagged mouse MKP-1 in a pCEP4 mammalian expression vector was a gift from Dr. Nicholas Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories). To improve transfection efficiency, a BamH1 fragment containing the c-myc-MKP-1 sequence was excised from the pCEP4 vector and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Clontech). Bacterial expression vectors for human His6-MKP-3 and His6-MKP-1 were gifts from Dr. Zhong-Yin Zhang (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) and Dr. Jack Dixon, (University of California, San Diego, CA), respectively. The pEGFP-C1 expression vector was from Clontech. The identities of all cDNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture—PANC-1 and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. High Content Screening for MKP-1 Inhibitors—HeLa cells (5,000) were plated in the wells of collagen-coated 384-well plates (Falcon Biocoat) and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were transfected with c-myc-MKP-1 or EGFP cDNAs (100 ng/well) and Lipofectamine 2000 (2.5 μl/μg DNA) in Opti-MEM-reduced serum medium as per manufacturer's instructions. Three hours after transfection, complexes were removed and fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Eighteen hours later, cells were treated in duplicate wells for 15 min with TPA or mixtures of TPA and library compounds, fixed and immunostained with a mixture of anti-phospho-ERK (1:200 dilution) and anti-c-myc (1:100 dilution) antibodies as described (14Vogt A. Cooley K.A. Brisson M. Tarpley M.G. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 733-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Positive phospho-ERK and c-myc-MKP-1 signals were visualized with Alexa-Fluor 647 (phospho-ERK) and AlexaFluor 488-(c-myc)-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively. All staining steps were carried out on a Biomek 2000 laboratory automation work station (Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). For confirmatory and selectivity studies, cells were transfected with MKP-1, MKP-3, or GFP, using 4–12 wells for each treatment condition. In some cases, phospho-ERK was visualized using AlexaFluor 546 or AlexaFluor 555 secondary antibodies. Plates were analyzed by three-channel multiparametric analysis for phospho-ERK and c-myc-MKP intensities in an area defined by nuclear staining using the Compartmental Analysis Bioapplication on the ArrayScan II (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA). Images were acquired in three independent fluorescence channels using an Omega XF93 filter set at excitation/emission wavelengths of 350/461 nm (Hoechst), 494/519 nm (AlexaFluor 488), 556/573 nm (AlexaFluor 546/555), or 650/665 nm (AlexaFluor 647), respectively. At least 1,000 individual cells were analyzed for phospho-ERK, c-myc-MKP-3, c-myc-MKP-1, or GFP intensities. For each condition, the percentage of MKP (GFP)-expressing cells was determined from FITC (AlexaFluor 488) intensity distribution histograms, setting appropriate gates for MKP (GFP)-positive and MKP (GFP)-negative cells. Analysis of HCS Data: Generalization of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test to Two-dimensional Data Distributions—The one-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was adapted to two dimensions by Ref. 20Peacock J.A. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 1983; 202: 615-627Crossref Google Scholar and further refined by Ref. 21Fasano G. Francescini A. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 1987; 225: 155-170Crossref Google Scholar. The approach used here was a modification of the Fortran 77 implementation of the above work (39Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Flannery B.P. Numerical Recipes in Fortran 77. The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1992: 640-644Google Scholar). Briefly, the two-dimensional data distributions representing two physiological parameters from a multiparameter HCS assay obtained after drug treatment were compared with the two-dimensional data distributions obtained from multiple wells of untreated cells. First, each data distribution was divided into quadrants defined by the median x and y axis values calculated from the untreated cell data distributions. The two-dimensional KS statistic was then found by ranging through all four quadrants to find the maximal difference between the fraction of cells in each treated quadrant and the fraction of cells in each corresponding untreated quadrant. Calculations were performed with the S-Plus statistical software package (Insightful, Inc., Seattle, WA). Analysis of HCS Data: Percent Responder Analysis—MKP-expressing and non-expressing cell populations were gated as above. A threshold for phospho-ERK-positive cells was defined as the average Cy5 intensity + 2 standard deviations from a randomly chosen, MKP-1-transfected well, and the percentage of cells in the MKP-1 (GFP)-expressing cell subpopulations whose pERK staining intensities exceeded the pERK threshold was calculated. Using this method, the percentage of phospho-ERK-positive cells was low (<5%) in MKP-1-expressing cells, and high (up to 90%) in GFP-expressing cells (see Fig. 4). In Vitro Phosphatase Assays—Full-length MKP-3, and Cdc25B2 as well as the catalytic domain of Cdc25B2 were expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins from pET21a vectors. Full-length VHR and proteintyrosine phosphatase 1B were expressed as GST fusion proteins from a pGEX2T vector as described (40Rice R.L. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GST and His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli using standard methodology. His-tagged human MKP-1 (CL100) was expressed from a pET15b vector and purified on Talon resin. Phosphatase activity assays were performed using a fluorescence-based 96-well microtiter plate assay with O-methyl fluorescein phosphate (OMFP) as previously described (40Rice R.L. Rusnak J.M. Yokokawa F. Yokokawa S. Messner D.J. Boynton A.L. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15965-15974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 41Lazo J.S. Aslan D.C. Southwick E.C. Cooley K.A. Ducruet A.P. Joo B. Vogt A. Wipf P. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4042-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies were conducted at optimal pH using OMFP at its Km value for each phosphatase. Simultaneous Measurement of Phospho-ERK and Phospho-JNK Levels by Quantitative Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PANC-1 cells (10,000/well) were plated in the wells of a 384-well microplate, allowed to attach overnight, and treated for 30 min with vehicle (Me2SO), TPA (500 ng/ml), anisomycin (25 μg/ml), phenylarsine oxide (PAO) (5 μm), or unknown compounds. Cells were fixed and immunostained with a mixture of anti-phospho-ERK (E10 mouse monoclonal) and anti-phospho-JNK (rabbit polyclonal) antibodies (1:200 dilution), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and AlexaFluor 647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 and average nuclear AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 647 fluorescence intensities were measured on the Array-Scan II in an area defined by the nucleus, as described above. To control for potential compound autofluorescence, background fluorescence values were measured for each condition in the absence of primary antibodies and subtracted from the average fluorescence intensities obtained in the presence of primary antibodies. Western Blotting—PANC-1 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, exposed to compounds for 30 min, harvested by trypsinization, and lysed. Cell lysates were resolved on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with anti-phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, anti-ERK, and anti-JNK antibodies. Positive antibody reactions were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. For quantitation of protein expression levels, luminescence band intensities were measured on a Kodak i1000 imaging station using a 14-bit CCD camera under non-saturating conditions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). High Content Screening of a Natural Products Library Using a Definitive Assay for MKP-1 Activity in Intact Cells—We implemented a definitive assay for MKP-1 inhibition in intact mammalian cells as a high content cellular screen. The fundamental approach, which we have termed “chemical complementation” (13Vogt A. Takahito A. Ducruet A.P. Chesebrough J. Nemoto K. Carr B.I. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20544-20550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and recently implemented for high content screening (14Vogt A. Cooley K.A. Brisson M. Tarpley M.G. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 733-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is based on the measurement of ERK phosphorylation in MKP-1 expressing and non-expressing cell subpopulations after transient transfection with mammalian expression plasmids, similar to that previously used to credential inhibitors of MKP-3 (14Vogt A. Cooley K.A. Brisson M. Tarpley M.G. Wipf P. Lazo J.S. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 733-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). HeLa cells were plated in 384-well plates and transiently transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding c-myc-tagged MKP-1. Twenty one hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with TPA to generate a strong and uniform phospho-ERK signal, and immunostained with a mixture of anti-c-myc and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies. c-myc-MKP-1 and pERK-positive cells were visualized with AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 647 secondary antibodies, respectively. Using this methodology, immunofluorescence images showed that MKP-1-expressing cells had low levels of phospho-ERK compared with surrounding non-expressing cells (see Fig. 3 for a representative example).Fig. 3Visual confirmation of the positive compound identified in the natural products library. Archived immunofluorescence images from the MKP-1 high content screen were manually evaluated for c-myc-MKP-1 and phospho-ERK (pERK) expression. MKP-1-transfected and TPA-stimulated HeLa cells were simultaneously immunostained for c-myc-MKP-1 (lower panel) and phospho-ERK (upper panel). Images shown are representative fields from wells treated with vehicle (Me2SO), PAO, or sanguinarine sulfate from the microsource library (well E08). MKP-1-expressing cells (lower panel) were visually identified and traced, and traces were transferred to Cy5 channel images (upper panel). MKP-1 reduces phospho-ERK levels in MKP-1-expressing cells. Both PAO and sanguinarine restored phospho-ERK in MKP-1-expressing cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then screened 720 members of a commercially available natural products library for compounds that restored phospho-ERK levels in the MKP-1 expressing cells to that seen in non-expressing cells. Each microplate contained four wells with untransfected cells, four wells each with cells transfected with empty vector or GFP, 16 wells with cells transfected with MKP-1 and treated with vehicle, and 160 wells with cells transfected with MKP-1 and treated with library compounds. All wells were stimulated for 15 min with TPA alone or TPA in combination with library compounds in duplicate at a single concentration of 50 μm. The broad protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, PAO, was included as a positive control. A minimum of 1,000 individual cells in each well were then analyzed on an ArrayScan II for c-myc and phospho-ERK intensities, and gated into c-myc-MKP-1 expressing and non-expressing cell subpopulations by setting a threshold for c-myc immunoreactivity based on the AlexaFluor 488 intensity of mock-transfected wells. This procedure yielded an HCS data set containing individual channel intensities for each individual cell that was used to determine transfection efficiencies and phospho-ERK levels. Consistent with our previous report, we found transfection efficiencies of up to 30% for MKP-1 and up to 55% for GFP, which was included as positive control. Identification of Positives—To identify positive compounds, we used a two-dimensional KS analysis with the HS data set. KS statistics have been described as a method to quantitatively compare the distributions of individual cell populations (15Young I.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 16Lampariello F. Cytometry. 2000; 39: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Watson J.V. Cytometry. 2001; 43: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Cox C. Reeder J.E. Robinson R.D. Suppes S.B. Wheeless L.L. Cytometry. 1988; 9: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and shown to be a valuable tool for the quantification of HCS data (19Giuliano K.A. Chen Y.T. Taylor D.L. J. Biomol. Screen. 2004; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional KS method ranges over data in a (x, y) plane in search of a maximum cumulative difference between two two-dimensional data distributions (20Peacock J.A. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. 1983; 202: 615-627Crossref Google Scholar, 21Fasano G. Francescini A. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 1987; 225: 155-170Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting KS values can assume a value between 0 (identical distributions) and 1 (completely different distributions). To fully exploit the information contained in our multiparameter high content data, we developed an algorithm that combined the KS statistics with ratio analysis of means (17Watson J.V. Cytometry. 2001; 43: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of both AlexaFluor 488 (MKP-1) and AlexaFluor 647 (phospho-ERK) in a minimum of 1,000 individual cells in 192 wells on a 384-well microplate. Two color fluorescence data from 16 controls (MKP-1 transfected but not drug-treated wells) were pooled for each fluorescence channel and used to generate a two-dimensional reference data distribution. The two-dimensional data distribution of each individual well was then compared with the reference data distribution, and a KS value was calculated for each well. A heatmap based on two-dimensional KS values was then generated to aid the visualization of screening hits (Fig. 2). Using this methodology, we found that the average two-dimensional KS value for all untreated controls was 0.074. This indicated that the biological assay variation between controls was comparable with what would be predicted based on the algorithm described by Young (15Young I.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1977; 25: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), namely, a KS value of 0.077 denoting significant dissimilarity between populations, assuming significance on the p = 0.05 level and 1,000 objects analyzed in each sample population. By comparison, the average two-dimensional KS value for cells treated with the positive control, PAO, was 0.300. By selecting agents that showed a greater than 3-fold increase in two-dimensional KS values over the average of all data points, we identified six compounds (0.69% of total) as positives. Positive compounds from the screen were visually examined for restoration of phospho-ERK levels in MKP-1-expressing cells. Fig. 3 shows representative immunofluorescence images acquired in which MKP-1 expressing cells were identified on the basis of FITC fluorescence (lower panels) and mapped onto images acquired in the Cy5 channel (top panels). In the absence of small molecule compounds, MKP-1-expressing cells did not respond to TPA with increased ERK phosphorylation. Both the broad spectrum tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, PAO, and the active compound in well E08 (sanguinarine) restored ERK phosphorylation in the MKP-1 expressing cells, confirming the results from the two-dimensional KS analysis. Treatment of MKP-1 transfected cells with sanguinarine resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of pERK-positive cells in the MKP-1-expressing cell subpopulations. When the data were normalized to the percentage of pERK-positive cells in GFP expressors, the concentration of sanguinarine required for a 50% effect (ED50) was 10 μm (Fig. 4). Sanguinarine Inhibits MKP-1 but Not MKP-3 in Intact Cells—To examine whether sanguinarine was selective for MKP-1 over the closely related MKP-3, HeLa cells were transfected with c-myc-tagged MKP-1 or MKP-3 and analyzed using"

A large collection of E3s use Cullins (CULs) as scaffolds to form multisubunit E3 complexes in which the CUL binds a target recognition subcomplex and the RBX1 docking protein, which delivers the activated ubiquitin moiety. Arabidopsis and rice contain a large collection of CUL isoforms, indicating that multiple CUL-based E3s exist in plants. Here we show that Arabidopsis CUL3a and CUL3b associate with RBX1 and members of the broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac (BTB) protein family to form BTB E3s. Eighty genes encoding BTB domain-containing proteins were identified in the Arabidopsis genome, indicating that a diverse array of BTB E3s is possible. In addition to the BTB domain, the encoded proteins also contain various other interaction motifs that likely serve as target recognition elements. DNA microarray analyses show that BTB genes are expressed widely in the plant and that tissue-specific and isoform-specific patterns exist.

Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 2Smalle J. Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 555-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). This ubiquitination is directed by an ATP-dependent conjugation cascade involving the sequential action of Ub-activating (E1), Ub-conjugating (E2), and Ub-protein ligase (E3) enzyme families. As the last components in the cascade, E3s control the specificity of ubiquitination by identifying appropriate targets for Ub transfer. The Ub moiety is connected via an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal Gly of Ub and one or more accessible lysyl ϵ-amino groups in the target. In many cases, chains of poly-Ub are assembled by reiterative conjugation cycles using Lys residues within previously attached Ubs as the binding sites. The complexity of ubiquitination is illustrated by the fact that almost 1,300 distinct genes encoding E3 components have been identified thus far in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome whose protein products potentially modify an equally large number of targets (2Smalle J. Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 555-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Studies with yeast and animals have identified four broad families of E3s based on subunit composition and mechanism of action. These include the real interesting new gene (RING) E3s and their structural relatives the U-box E3s, the homologous to E6-AP C terminus (HECT) E3s, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), and the Cullin (CUL)-based E3s (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 2Smalle J. Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2004; 55: 555-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The CUL-based E3s are multisubunit ligases that use one of several CUL isoforms to form a scaffold upon which several other factors assemble (see Fig. 1A). The resulting complexes interact with both the target and an E2-Ub intermediate and presumably align the two for optimal Ub transfer. The best characterized CUL-based E3 is the multisubunit SCF complex, named after its founding member from yeast, which contains SKP1, the CUL CDC53 (or CUL1), and the F-box protein CDC4 (3Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). A fourth subunit, RBX1 (or ROC1 and HRT1) was subsequently identified as integral to the complex. Biochemical and structural analyses indicate that the RBX1 subunit recruits the Ub-E2 intermediate and the SKP1/F-box protein pair serves as a target recognition module. The F-box protein binds the target directly with SKP1 linking the F-box protein to CUL1 (3Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 4Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Other CUL-based E3s include the von-Hippel Lindau/Elongin B/Elongin C (VBC) E3s that use CUL2 and -5 to assemble RBX1 with a target recognition module composed of a family of SOCS box recognition factors and the Elongin B and C adaptor proteins (5Kile B.T.

The >10-subunit APC complex also contains a CUL-like protein (APC2) that presumably performs a similar scaffolding function (7Capron A. Serralbo O. Fulop K. Frugier F. Parmentier Y. Dong A.

The only apparent exception is the VHL E3 complex where potential orthologs of the Elongin B and C and SOCS box proteins are not evident. Remarkably Arabidopsis encodes almost 700 F-box proteins, 21 SKPs (designated ASKs in Arabidopsis), and two CUL1 orthologs (CUL1 and -2a), indicating that a large array of SCF E3s is assembled in plants (11Gagne J.M.

Sequence and/or functional orthologs of yeast CUL4 and APC2 that should associate with the DDB1/DET1/COP1 and the APC E3 complexes, respectively, are evident in various plant genomes, indicating that these E3 types are present as well (9Capron A.

However, analysis of the Arabidopsis genome has uncovered at least seven more CUL-type proteins (12Shen W.H. Parmentier Y. Hellmann H. Lechner E. Dong A. Masson J. Granier F. Lepiniec L. Estelle M.

Recently a new type of CUL-based multisubunit E3 was discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and humans (15Furukawa M. He Y.J. Borchers C. Xiong Y. Nat.

Biol. 2004; 24: 7130-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). It includes the CUL3 isoform, RBX1, and members of the broad complex/tramtrack/bric-abrac (BTB) (or poxvirus and zinc finger (POZ)) protein family (20Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21Zollman S. Godt D. Prive G.G. Couderc J.L. Laski F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10717-10721Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These proteins share a degenerate BTB(POZ) domain of ∼120 amino acids that appears to assume a three-dimensional structure similar to the CUL1/2 interaction domains in the SKP1 and Elongin C adaptor proteins (4Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P.

Either N- or C-terminal to the BTB domain is one of several interaction motifs, suggesting that the full-length proteins function as SKP1/F-box protein hybrids that deliver targets to CUL3. The best studied example is the C. elegans E3 complex containing the BTB-protein MEL-26. MEL-26 in association with CUL3 and RBX1 promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent turnover of MEI-1, a subunit of the katanin-like microtubule-severing heterodimer MEI-1/MEI-2 (15Furukawa M. He Y.J. Borchers C. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 17Xu L. Wei Y. Reboul J. Vaglio P. Shin T.H. Vidal M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W.

Nature. 2003; 425: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). BTB proteins have been identified in a number of eukaryotes. As examples, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and human genomes are predicted to encode 3, 3, 105, 141, and 208 BTB domain-containing proteins, respectively (15Furukawa M. He Y.J. Borchers C. Xiong Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 24Pintard L. Willems A. Peter M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In searches of various plant protein sequence databases, we and others detected likely CUL3 orthologs, suggesting that similar BTB E3 complexes also exist in plants (12Shen W.H. Parmentier Y.

(49Wang K.L. Yoshida H. Lurin C. Ecker J.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) provided further support with the discovery that the Arabidopsis ethylene overproducer (ETO)-1 protein contains a BTB domain that binds CUL3a. Furthermore eto1 mutants contain abnormally high levels of the aminocyclopropane synthase 5, implying that aminocyclopropane synthase 5 is the ubiquitination target of the BTBETO1 complex. Here we provide a description of the CUL3/BTB E3s in Arabidopsis. Through reiterative BLAST searches of the near complete genomic sequence, 80 proteins were identified that contain the BTB consensus sequence that could be divided into 10 subfamilies. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction studies confirmed that members of the BTB family assemble with CUL3a and CUL3b to form E3 complexes. Many, but not all, of the BTB subfamilies are expressed in most Arabidopsis tissues, implying a pervasive action in plant growth and development. The importance of the BTB E3s to plant biology was supported by analysis of a cul3a cul3b double mutant. Loss of both CUL3s generated an embryo-lethal phenotype in which embryogenesis arrested at variable stages. Several members of the Arabidopsis BTB protein family have been previously described as proteins of unknown function that participate in specific cellular events. In addition to ethylene biosynthesis, the list includes disease resistance (nonexpressor of PR genes (NPR) 1), phototropism (non-phototropic hypocotyl (NPH) 3 and root phototropism (RPT) 2), hormone perception (armadillo repeat protein interacting with ABF2 (ARIA)), and leaf morphogenesis (blade-on-petiole1 (BOP1)) (25Dong X.

Their possible roles in selective ubiquitination by BTB E3s may now help explain their seemingly disparate cellular actions. Identification of Arabidopsis Genes Encoding BTB Domain Proteins—The SMART database (smart.embl-heidelberg.de) was used to locate the BTB(POZ) domain in 37 BTB proteins from a variety of organisms (C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, S. pombe, Mus musculus, and humans). These sequences were used as queries in NCBI BLASTP searches (final search concluded on 11/12/2003) of the near complete A. thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col)-0 genome sequence available in The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org/Blast/). These queries recovered 48 non-redundant sequences based on an E-value cutoff of 0.02. This cutoff value was sufficient to eliminate random sequences and was equally or more stringent than similar domain-based searches in Arabidopsis, including those for F-box proteins (see Refs. 11Gagne J.M. Downes B.P. Shiu S.H. Durski A.M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11519-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar and 30Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). BLASTP searches were repeated using the SMART- and PFAM-predicted BTB domains from all 48 proteins as queries; this search recovered 29 additional loci with sequence scores beneath the 0.02 cutoff. This process was repeated a third time with these additional sequences and recovered two more loci. Finally eight representative Arabidopsis BTB domains were used as queries against the six-frame translated Arabidopsis genome. These searches recovered one additional locus (At3g22104), which was subsequently predicted by hand analysis to encode a BTB domain. Additional BLAST searches against the Arabidopsis protein database with all 80 predicted BTB domains recovered no additional sequences beneath the cutoff score. The annotation of At3g19850 was revised to include an additional exon and intron at the 5′-end based on sequence alignments with its close sequence relative At1g50280. For At5g19000, alignment of the genomic sequence with that of a corresponding cDNA recovered by a Y2H screen necessitated changes in The Arabidopsis Information Resource-predicted sequence that combined into one intron: 23 bp upstream of the second intron, the second intron, the third exon, and the third intron. For At2g40440, the annotation was revised based on sequence alignment with its closest relative At2g40450, resulting in extension of the second predicted exon to a stop codon and removal of the predicted third and fourth exons. At3g03510 was revised based on sequence similarity to At5g17850, which altered annotation of the first predicted intron. See Supplemental Data Set 6 for the revised sequences. The SMART/PFAM data bases predicted BTB domains in 79 of the 80 proteins. The outer limits of the domain were refined by hand analysis based on sequence alignments. These adjusted domains were used in the final alignments. For At2g13690, the BTB domain was predicted by sequence alignment and hand analysis. For the three genes (At1g04390, At2g040740, and At2g30600) that encoded proteins with two separate BTB domains, the BTB domain with the lowest SMART or PFAM E-value was used. Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis—Using previously identified animal and Arabidopsis CUL sequences as queries, CUL and CUL-like proteins were identified by BLASTP of rice (Oryza sativa) using the Gramene comparative genome database (www.gramene.org/db/searches/blast). This search recovered 13 non-redundant rice sequences with E-values ≤ 0.00058. Full-length sequences, BTB domains, and putative SKP1/BTB/DDB-binding regions were aligned using ClustalX PC version 1.81 (31Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G.

Amino acid sequence alignments were calculated and displayed using MacBoxshade version 2.15 (Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright, UK). Additional domains were identified from the SMART and PFAM databases, BLAST searches, sequence alignments, and the PROF (33Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R.

RT-PCR and DNA Gel Blot Analyses—For RT-PCR, total RNA isolated from 10-day-old seedlings by the TRIzol reagent was used as the template.

A 650-bp CUL3b probe was generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA with the primers ATGAGTAATCAGAAGAAGAGAAATTTCC and ACAATCACAAGACTCAATAAAC and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primed labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Y2H Analyses—The full-length coding regions for CUL3a and CUL3b were amplified by RT-PCR from Arabidopsis RNA and the primer pairs ATGAGTAATCAGAAGAAGAGG and TTAGGCTAGATAGCGGTAAAG (CUL3a) and primer E and TTACGCTAGATAGCGGTAAAG (CUL3b) and inserted into the pGBKT7 plasmid (Clontech) as a translational fusion to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The CUL3a-DB fusion was used as bait in a Y2H screen of two Arabidopsis cDNA libraries at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Molecular Interaction Facility, Madison, WI (www.sbiotech.wisc.edu/MIF/) that were cloned as GAL4 activation domain fusions into pGADT7-rec (Clontech). One library was prepared using RNA isolated from 3-day-old etiolated seedlings, and the second was a composite prepared from RNA isolated from 3-week-old seedlings stressed by various hormone, osmotic, and environmental extremes. Putative interactors were identified by growth on histidine dropout medium plus 1 mm 3-amino-1′,2′,4′-triazole and by β-galactosidase activity assays. Positive pGADT7-rec clones were isolated from yeast and sequenced. The cDNAs for At4g08445 and At5g19000 were isolated from the stress library, and the cDNA for At1g21780 was isolated from the etiolated seedling library. For directed Y2H assays, the full coding regions for CUL1, CUL3a, CUL3b, RBX1, ASK1, unusual floral organs (UFO), and the various BTB genes were PCR-amplified from A. thaliana ecotype Col-0. Templates included 7-day-old seedling RNA converted to cDNA by RT-PCR, genomic DNA, and full-length expressed sequence tags (ESTs) provided by the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH) and the Riken Bioresource Center (Yokahama City, Kanagawa, Japan). The coding regions were reamplified with primers designed to add 33–36 additional nucleotides complementary to the pGADT7-rec and pGBKT7 vectors, which would promote in-frame insertion of the products by homologous recombination in yeast. pGBKT7 was linearized with EcoRI and NdeI, and pGADT7-rec was linearized with SmaI. The inserts and vectors were transformed into the appropriate yeast strains at a 3:1 ratio using the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit according to the manufacturer (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The CUL and BTB coding regions, cloned into the respective pGBKT7 and pGADT7-rec vectors, were transformed into the haploid yeast strains YPB2a and LB414α (34Gray W.M. del Pozo J.C. Walker L.

Yeast were mated on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium plus adenine for 24 h at 30 °C and then grown on complete supplemental medium (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, CA) minus leucine and tryptophan. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by overlay assay (35Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and growth was tested on complete supplemental medium containing 5 mm 3-amino-1′,2′,4′-triazole but without leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. For each mating, 5 μl of cells with an A600 of 3 × 10–2 were spotted and grown for 5 days at 23 °C. Identification and Analysis of the cul3a-1 and cul3b-1, eto1, eol1, and eol2 Mutations—The insertion mutants cul3a-1 (SALK_046638), eto1-11 (SALK_019825), eto1-12 (SALK_061581), eto1-13 (SALK_ 113656), eol1-1 (SALK_144028), eol2-1 (SALK_015094), eol2-2 (SALK_114207), and eol2-3 (SALK_138238) were identified in the SIGNAL T-DNA collection (signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress) generated from the Col-0 ecotype and obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The cul3b-1 insertion mutant was identified in the University of Wisconsin T-DNA collection generated in the Wassilewskija ecotype. The SALK mutations were tracked by PCR using the gene-specific primers A and B (cul3a-1), TGAAGACAAGCTGCCACCAGA and ACGCTGTCGTTTCTCCCGAGT (eto1-11), TGAGCCTGTCAGTATACAACCAGCA and GACGGGAAAGACTGGCGTCTC (eto1-12), TGAGCCATCTTCTCAACCAAATCA and AAAAAGATACCACAAACAAACACA (eto1-13), CAAGCCAAAACCAAAGTGGACA and CTCGAGAAGGCAACCGAATTG (eol1-1), ATCCATCAGCACTGCCACACA and TGCTTCAGAATGATCCCAGCA (eol2-1), TGTTGAGTGCCAACATTGCCT and TCTCTTGCTCTCTCCGTCTCCC (eol2-2), and ACATCAATGGCGTGCCTCCTA and CCCAAATTTTCACAAATTAAAAGCC (eol2-3) in combination with either a left border (Lba1; TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG) or a right border (CGCTTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCA) T-DNA-specific primer. The cul3b-1 mutation was followed by PCR using the gene-specific primers GACGTCCCAACAAGTAGCTTT and GTCCAAGCTCATGAACATGAG in combination with the border primer JL202 (CATTTTATAATAACGCTGCGGACATCTAC).

https://openalex.org/W1969344217,"To obtain further information on time course and mechanisms of cell death after poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) hyperactivation, we used HeLa cells exposed for 1 h to the DNA alkylating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. This treatment activated PARP-1 and caused a rapid drop of cellular NAD(H) and ATP contents, culminating 8–12 h later in cell death. PARP-1 antagonists fully prevented nucleotide depletion and death. Interestingly, in the early 60 min after challenge with N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitochondrial membrane potential and superoxide production significantly increased, whereas cellular ADP contents decreased. Again, these events were prevented by PARP-1 inhibitors, suggesting that PARP-1 hyperactivity leads to mitochondrial state 4 respiration. Mitochondrial membrane potential collapsed at later time points (3 h), when mitochondria released apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c. Using immunocytochemistry and targeted luciferase transfection, we found that, despite an exclusive localization of PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribose) in the nucleus, ATP levels first decreased in mitochondria and then in the cytoplasm of cells undergoing PARP-1 activation. PARP-1 inhibitors rescued ATP (but not NAD(H) levels) in cells undergoing hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Glycolysis played a central role in the energy recovery, whereas mitochondria consumed ATP in the early recovery phase and produced ATP in the late phase after PARP-1 inhibition, further indicating that nuclear poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation rapidly modulates mitochondrial functioning.

Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, once hyperactivated by genotoxic stress, PARP-1 causes NAD and ATP depletion, eventually leading to irreversible cellular energy failure and necrotic death (2Berger N.A. Radiat. Res. 1985; 101: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 3Gaal J.C. Smith K.R. Pearson C.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 129-130Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Ha H.C.

The pathophysiological significance of PARP-1 hyperactivation is well exemplified by the remarkable therapeutic efficacy of PARP-1 inhibitors in experimental models of disorders characterized by DNA damage, such as ischemia, diabetes, shock, inflammation, and cancer (7Virag L. Szabo C. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 375-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies have broadened the role of poly(ADP-ribosyl)-ation in cell killing, showing that PARP-1 activation also occurs during apoptosis, and inhibition of PAR formation impairs activation of the apoptotic machinery (for reviews see Refs. 8Scovassi I.A. Poirier G.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 199: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and 9Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been reported that PARP-1 prompts a cascade of events leading to PAR-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and rapid release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (10Yu S.W. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar, 11Alano C.C. Ying W. Swanson R.A. J.

Res. 2004; 63: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Despite their pathogenetic relevance, however, molecular mechanisms underlying energetic derangement during PARP-1 hyperactivation still wait to be clarified. For instance, whether nuclear or mitochondrial PARP-1 hyperactivity triggers mitochondrial dysfunction and release of apoptogenic factors is unresolved (13Chiarugi A. Moskowitz M.A. Science. 2002; 297: 200-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Hong S.J. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Trends Pharmacol.

Similarly, the early events occurring in mitochondria during hyper-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are elusive. In light of the powerful cytoprotective efficacy of PARP-1 inhibitors, another major question waiting to be answered is whether, and with which spatiotemporal kinetics, energy rescue occurs in cells when PARP-1 is inhibited after hyperactivation. To address these issues, we used HeLa cells exposed to the PARP-1-activating agent N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (1D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 4Ha H.C. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999; 69: 13978-13982Crossref Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 10Yu S.W. Poitras M.F. Coombs C.

Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar) or to PARP-1 inhibitors after MNNG exposure.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Culture Conditions—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics. Cultures were brought to 50–70% confluence and exposed to MNNG and other drugs. Cell viability was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release in the incubating medium or reduction of methylthiazolyl tetrazolium. Data obtained by means of methylthiazolyl tetrazolium reduction were always confirmed by microscopic evaluation of cell morphology. Annexin V staining was performed using a kit from Molecular Probes.Western Blotting and Immunocytochemistry—Cell fractionation, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry were performed as described previously (16Rapizzi E. Pinton P. Szabadkai G. Wieckowski M.R. Vandecasteele G. Baird G. Tuft R.A. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The anti-PARP and anti-PAR antibodies (C2–10 and 10H, respectively) were from Alexis (Vinci, Italy), the anti-caspase-3 antibody was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), the anti-AIF was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the anti-cytochrome c (Cyt-c) was from BD Biosciences (Lexington, KY). Imaging was performed using a Nikon fluorescence microscope and a charge-coupled device camera.Nucleotide and Superoxide Measurement—NAD contents were quantified by means of an enzymatic cycling procedure according to Shah et al. (17Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine G. Desnoyers S. Brochu G. Lageaux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J-C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). NADH was quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography and UV light detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model LC 90). Briefly, cells seeded in a 24-well plate were killed with 50 μl of KOH at a concentration of 50 mm and the lysate transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 75 μl of Buffer A (see below) and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. 100 μl of the supernatant were injected into a C18 Pinnacle-II column. The mobile phases were 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 6 (Buffer A), and 100 mm KH2PO4 + 10% methanol, pH 6 (Buffer B). The gradient used was: 100% Buffer A in 14 min, 25% Buffer B in 6 min, 60% Buffer B in 5 min, 100% Buffer B in 5 min, and a final step of 7.5 min at 100% Buffer B. Absorbance was measured at 340 nm. ATP was measured by means of a kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ADP was quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography and UV light detection according to Kawamoto et al. (18Kawamoto Y. Shinozuka K. Kunitomo M. Haginaka J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 262: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Superoxide production was measured by means of the nitro blue tetrazolium colorimetric assay as described by Vrablic et al. (19Vrablic A.S. Albright C.D. Craciunescu C.N. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Evaluation of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Cell Autofluorescence—Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was evaluated by means of digital imaging microscopy or flow cytometry. Cells seeded onto 24-mm coverslips were incubated with Krebs-Ringer-modified buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C) containing TMRE at a concentration of 25 nm for 10 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were then mounted into a Leyden chamber containing Krebs-Ringer-modified buffer plus 2.5 nm TMRE at 37 °C, and the cells allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before imaging with a Nikon microscope equipped with piezoelectric motorization and a charge-coupled device camera. Drugs were added directly to the incubating solution. Stacks of images were acquired through the depth of the cell and deconvolved using the EPR software as described by Carrington et al. (20Carrington W.A. Lynch R.M. Moore E.D. Isenberg G. Fogarty K.E. Fay F.S. Science. 1995; 268: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). For each experiment, an intensity threshold was chosen, and the thresholded stack was projected to form a two-dimensional mask. This mask was used to identify mitochondrial pixels in the subsequent time series, thereby avoiding computation of noise by cytosolic TMRE fluorescence. Analysis of the resulting TMRE images and quantification of intensity optical density were performed using custom designed software. For each time point, values correspond to the mean of at least six different microscopic fields containing the same number of cells. For analysis of ΔΨm by flow cytometry, cells seeded in 48-well plates were incubated with 2.5 nm TMRE in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, exposed or not to MNNG at a concentration of 100 μm and analyzed. Briefly, the cells were detached with trypsin and then diluted in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After gentle pipetting, 200 μl of the cell suspension were further diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by the flow cytometer Coulter EPICS XL (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) equipped with the EXPO32 Flow Cytometry ADC software (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). TMRE at a concentration of 2.5 nm was present in all the solutions used for cell preparation and measurement. Cell autofluorescence was measured with the microscopic apparatus described above equipped with an UV light filter. A stack of 6–8 images/microscopic field was acquired and processed for deblurring and tri-dimensional reconstruction.Mitochondrial and Cytosolic ATP Measurement—ATP was indirectly quantified by means of cytosol- or mitochondria-targeted luciferase (21Kennedy H.J. Rafiq I. Pouli A.E. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Transfection with cytLuc or mtLuc cDNA (4 μg/ml) was performed by the standard calcium-phosphate procedure. Cell luminescence was evaluated 36 h after transfection by means of a luminometer as described previously (22Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Cells were perfused with Krebs-Ringer-modified buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 μm luciferin, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 at 37 °C). Under these conditions, the light output was in the range of 1,000–10,000 count/s/coverslip of cytLuc-transfected cells and 1,000–3,000 count/s/coverslip of mtLuc-transfected cells versus a background <30 count/s. As previously reported, recordings did not exceed 15 min, because longer measurements may be biased by factors other than intracellular ATP, such as coenzyme A or luciferin availability, pH, as well as oxyluciferin and oxygen radicals formation (21Kennedy H.J. Rafiq I. Pouli A.E. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jouaville L.S. Pinton P. Bastianutto C. Rutter G.A. Rizzuto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Evaluation of significant differences among groups was performed using the Student's t test or analysis of variance followed by Tukey's w test. Differences among flow cytometry histograms were assessed through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z test.RESULTSEffects of PARP-1 Hyperactivation on Cell Death—Cells were exposed to the PARP-1 activator MNNG at a concentration of 100 μm for 1 h, washed, and incubated in culture medium for different times. Only 23 ± 2% of cells survived 12 h after MNNG exposure. The presence of PARP-1 inhibitors of different chemical classes, such as benzamide (BZD, 1 mm), 6(5H)-phenanthridinone (PHE, 30 μm), and 5-iodo-6-amino-1,2-benzopyrone (INH2BP, 100 μm), in the incubating medium during and after MNNG exposure increased survival to 89 ± 8, 98 ± 4, and 82 ± 9%, respectively. Considering that these concentrations are consistent with the IC50 on PARP-1 activity of the drugs (23Banasik M. Komura H. Shimoyama M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1569-1575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Chiarugi A. Meli E. Calvani M. Picca R. Baronti R. Camaioni E. Costantino G. Marinozzi M. Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E.

Chem. 2003; 10: 321-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that the hyperactivity of PARP-1 was mainly responsible for MNNG-induced cell death. This assumption is corroborated by evidence that PARP-1–/– fibroblasts, astrocytes, and neurons do not die after MNNG exposure (10Yu S.W. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G.

Decker P. Muller S. Hoger T. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17860-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and BZD and PHE might inhibit its enzymatic activity, to date there is no evidence that PARP-2 hyperactivation causes cell death. This is consistent with the fact that almost 80% of cellular poly(ADP-ribose) is synthesized by PARP-1 (27Shieh V.M. Ame J.C. Wilson M.V. Wang Z.Q. Kho D.W. Jacobson M.K. Jacobson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cell death was evident 8 h after MNNG exposure (not shown) and became almost complete at 12 h, when cells became round-shaped and nuclei showed typical apoptotic hallmarks, such as chromatin condensation, nuclear pyknosis, and fragmentation, as well as phosphatidylserine exposure outside the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). As further evidence of apoptosis, cells released only ∼4% of total lactate dehydrogenase 8 h after MNNG (not shown). MNNG-treated cells, however, did not undergo caspase-3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage (Fig. 1B) and were not protected by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (not shown). In control cells and 1 h after MNNG exposure, intracellular distribution of AIF was punctate, indicating mitochondrial localization (28Cande C. Cohen I. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Larochette N. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). AIF immunoreactivity appeared cytoplasmic 3 h after MNNG exposure in ∼30% of cells, whereas massive cytoplasmic and nuclear AIF redistribution occurred after 4 h. Protein relocation was prevented by PHE (Fig. 1C) or BZD (not shown) added to the incubating media during and after MNNG challenge. Similar time courses of AIF and Cyt-c release in cytosol were obtained by Western blotting (Fig. 1D).PAR and Nucleotide Contents during PARP-1 Hyperactivation—PAR accumulated in the nucleus of HeLa cells 5 min after MNNG exposure and returned to control levels after 15 min and for the following 8 h (Fig. 2A and not shown). Findings are in keeping with prompt PAR hydrolysis by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase and prevention of PARP-1 inhibition by auto-(ADP-ribosyl)ation (1D'Amours D. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 249-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Under resting conditions, contents of NAD, NADH, and ATP in HeLa cells were 8.2 ± 0.9, 3.9 ± 0.8, and 16 ± 2.3 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Upon MNNG exposure, NAD contents decreased to 11.7 ± 2% of control after 15 min, whereas those of ATP reached 9.9 ± 1.5% of control after 30 min. Despite MNNG washout, nucleotide contents remained at these levels for the following 6 h and became hardly detectable at 8 h (Fig. 2B). Notably, PHE and BZD efficiently prevented MNNG-induced NAD and ATP depletion in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown), indicating that PARP-1 and not MNNG caused energy derangement. In keeping with prior findings in cardiac myocytes (29Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Canton M. Barile M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (30Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), we found that NAD contents were higher in mitochondria than in the cytosol of HeLa cells (54 ± 7 and 2.8 ± 0.4 nmol/mg protein in mitochondria and cytosol, respectively). These results, along with evidence that mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening triggers NAD depletion in mitochondria isolated from cardiac myocytes (29Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. Canton M. Barile M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2571-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) or in intact astrocytes exposed to MNNG (11Alano C.C. Ying W. Swanson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18895-18902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), prompted us to evaluate the effect of the permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin-A on reduction of NAD contents in HeLa cells undergoing PARP-1 hyperactivation. Of note, cyclosporin-A (0.3–30 μm) had no effects on MNNG-triggered, PARP-1-mediated NAD shortage (not shown), suggesting that the alkylating agent and/or PARP-1/PAR did not cause transition pore opening in HeLa cells under our experimental conditions. Contents of NADH also decreased upon exposure to MNNG in a PHE-sensitive manner (Fig. 2C, a), indicating that PARP-1 hyperactivation triggers cellular NADH depletion. In principle, two hypotheses can be advanced to explain this result. One is that PARP-1 indirectly decreases NADH content by simply consuming NAD and therefore shifting the NAD↔NADH equilibrium to the left. The other is that PARP-1 directly triggers NADH decrease through unknown mechanisms. The finding that rotenone (an inhibitor of NADH conversion into NAD by respiratory Complex I), increased NADH content in cells undergoing PARP-1 activation (Fig. 2C, a) suggests that the first hypothesis is probably correct. Accordingly, cell autofluorescence, a classic index of intracellular NADH (31Chance B. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 385: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was mainly distributed in structures resembling mitochondria and drastically reduced upon MNNG exposure (Fig. 2C, b).Fig. 2Irreversible NAD, NADH, and ATP depletion in HeLa cells exposed to MNNG is PARP-1-dependent.A, PAR immunoreactivity, barely detectable in the cytoplasm of the control cell (C), selectively increases in the nucleus 5 min after MNNG exposure. Polymer levels are significantly reduced at 10 min and return to control values 15 min after MNNG challenge. B, exposure to 100 μm MNNG decreases NAD and ATP contents to ∼10% of control after 15 and 30 min, respectively. MNNG washout after 1 h does not affect nucleotide depletion. Both cellular NAD and ATP are almost undetectable at 8 h from MNNG exposure. C, a, exposure to MNNG for 1 h drastically reduces cellular NADH contents. The presence of PHE (30 μm) during MNNG exposure abolishes NADH depletion. The latter is also partially prevented by the presence of the mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor rotenone (10 μm). C, b, tri-dimensional visualization of HeLa autofluorescence. Autofluorescence, taken as an index of NADH content, is mainly localized in subcellular structures resembling mitochondria and strongly reduced by 100 μm MNNG for 1 h.

Physiol. 2004; 286: C1139-C1151Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To our surprise, we found that TMRE fluorescence increased 30 (136 ± 24%) and 60 min (142 ± 18%, p < 0.05 versus control) after MNNG exposure (Fig. 3, A and B). Evidence that the presence of PHE in the medium prevented increase of TMRE fluorescence (Fig. 3A, d) indicated that PARP-1 was responsible for early increase of ΔΨm. Mean mitochondrial membrane potential returned to control values 1 h after MNNG washout (Fig. 3A, a), and the same occurred in cells not washed from MNNG (not shown). Significant drop of mean ΔΨm took place only 4 h after MNNG exposure (Fig. 3A, a), and such a collapse was inhibited (50.9 ± 6.7% inhibition) by PHE (30 μm) added to the incubating medium 1 h before MNNG exposure (not shown). Cytofluorimetric analysis revealed that the majority of MNNG-treated cells had ΔΨm higher than controls up to 3 h after PARP-1 activation. However, a fraction of cells with decreased ΔΨm appeared after 2 and 3 h (6.5 ± 3.5 and 27.5 ± 7.4%, respectively), whereas most of the cells (70.2 ± 12%) lost ΔΨm only 4 h after PARP-1 activation (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Effects of PARP-1 activation on ΔΨm.A, evaluation of ΔΨm by means of TMRE and digital imaging microscopy. a, ΔΨm increases 1 h after MNNG exposure and then decreases to values slightly lower than control ones. Such values are maintained up to 3 h after MNNG exposure.

B, flow cytometric analysis confirms increase of ΔΨm 1 h after MNNG exposure. After 2–3 h, mitochondria are still hyperpolarized even if ΔΨm starts collapsing in a small fraction of cells. Almost complete ΔΨm loss occurs 4 h after MNNG exposure. C, rotenone (ROT, 10 μm) decreases ΔΨm of cells at 1 and 2 h after MNNG (1 h at 100 μm), whereas 3-nitropropionic acid (NP, 1 mm) reduces ΔΨm only 2 h after MNNG treatment. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus control (A) or MNNG (C) at the respective time points.

Rotenone decreased ΔΨm in cells exposed 1 and 2 h to MNNG, whereas ΔΨm became sensitive to 3-nitropropionic acid only 2 h after exposure to the alkylating agent (Fig. 3C). Importantly, at all the time points investigated, addition of the protonophore FCCP (1 μm) to the incubating solution never led to increase of TMRE fluorescence but always to rapid (seconds) and complete loss of mitochondrial TMRE accumulation (Fig. 3A, c, and not shown), indicating that the dye was indeed working in a non-quenching mode.Increase of ΔΨm, despite lack of ATP production, occurs during ADP shortage-dependent mitochondrial state 4 respiration (34Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). Accordingly, ADP contents decreased in HeLa cells exposed to MNNG, and PHE prevented ADP depletion (Fig. 4A), indicating that PARP-1 was causative in the adenine nucleotide fall. Furthermore, in line with increased production of O2− during transition from state 3 to state 4 respiration (34Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar), we found a PHE-sensitive burst of O2− production in cells exposed to MNNG (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effects of PARP-1 hyperactivation on cellular ADP contents and O2− production.A, ADP contents decrease time dependently in cells exposed to MNNG at 100 μm. The presence of 30 μm PHE in the incubating medium prevents such a decrease. B, 30 μm PHE abrogates increased O2− production in cells exposed to 100 μm MNNG.

We have previously shown that the 3020insC mutant of CARD15/NOD2 has impaired function as a defensive factor against intracellular bacteria in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) (19Hisamatsu T.

We demonstrate here that GRIM-19 is an interactor necessary for NF-κB and anti-bacterial effects of NOD2. Cell Culture and Transfection—SW480, HT29, Caco-2, T84, Colo205, HCT116, HEK293, COS7, THP-1, and Jurkat cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HEK293 and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals Inc., Norcross, GA). THP-1 and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc.) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. All the other IEC lines were cultured as described previously (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a cationic lipid (Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For immunostaining experiments, cells were transfected using the TransIT transfection reagents kit (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed by MATHCMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, pGBKT7-NOD2 was generated by PCR methods from pCMVFLAG-NOD2 vector (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). pGBKT7-NOD2 was transfected into the AH109 yeast strain. Expression of Myc-tagged NOD2 protein in yeast extract was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Covance, Richmond, CA) and affinity-purified anti-NOD2 anti-sera (19Hisamatsu T.

Screening was performed using a bone marrow pretransformed library (BD Biosciences Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Co-transformants were selected in S.D. medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Yeast α-galactosidase activity, expressed from the MEL1 gene in response to GAL4 activation, was determined in plates containing X-α-gal (BD Biosciences Clontech). Construction of Expression Plasmids—Xpress-tagged GRIM-19 mammalian expression vector (pCDNA4/HisMAX-GRIM-19) was generated by PCR from cDNA from T84 cells. FLAG-tagged NOD2 mammalian expression vector (pCMVFLAG-NOD2) was previously constructed (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and GFP-tagged NOD2 mammalian expression vector (pEGFPC1-NOD2) was generated by restriction methods from pCMVFLAG-NOD2. pCI CARD4/NOD1-HA expression vector was kindly provided by Dr. John Bertin (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Two oligonucleotides, 19 residues in length (gtgtgggatactgcgagta and atcgaggacttcgaggctc) specific to the human grim-19 cDNA were selected for synthesis of siRNA (20Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). pSUPER vector for siRNA was purchased from Oligoengine (Seattle, WA). The depletion of endogenous GRIM-19 expression by siRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Experiments—Cells were grown on 6-well plates. Medium was removed, and 300 μl of 1% Triton lysis buffer (1.25% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2.5% glycerol, 62.5 mmol/liter Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science) was added. Supernatant of cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained for FLAG-NOD2 using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), for Xpress-GRIM-19 using anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), and for NOD1-HA using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science). Two milligrams of cell lysate were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG, anti-Xpress, or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies and 100 μl of Hiptrap protein A/G-Sepharose beads. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4–12% or on 4–20% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and stained using specific antibodies. For endogenous binding, 500 μg of total protein from HT29 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation/blotting as described above using rabbit anti-NOD2 anti-serum HM2559 (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified rabbit antiserum against human GRIM-19 produced by Affinity Bioreagents (Project A203001, immunizing peptide IMKDVPDWKVGESVF). Confocal Microscopy—Caco-2 cells were grown on sterile permanox coverslips for 24 h and then transfected with pCDNA4/HisMAX-GRIM-19 and pCMVFLAG-NOD2. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed for 20 min with cold methanol at –20 °C, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were saturated for 30 min with PBS containing 5% donkey serum. Cells were then incubated for 2 h with primary antibody (mouse monoclonal anti-Xpress antibody and/or rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Immunostaining was performed, respectively, with Texas-Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) secondary antibodies. Salmonella typhimurium was detected with rabbit antibody to Salmonella fluorescein conjugate (Biodesign International, Saco, ME). The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Bacterial Invasion Assays—Invasion assays were performed with Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium or Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen). Monolayers were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plate with 105 cells/well and incubated for 20 h. Monolayers were then infected in 1 ml of cell culture medium without antibiotic and with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 bacteria/epithelial cell. After a 2-h incubation period at 37 °C, monolayers were washed two times with PBS. Fresh cell culture medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma) was added for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The epithelial cells were then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in deionized water. Samples were diluted and plated onto Luria-Bertani agar plates to determine the number of colony-forming units corresponding to the number of intracellular bacteria. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA of IEC lines were extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. For reverse transcription, 2 μg of total RNA were transcribed by the SuperScript First-strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector using the SYBR Green JumpStart™ detection system. Briefly, 50 ng of the reversed transcribed cDNA were used for each PCR reaction with 200 nm of forward and reverse primers. Primers for PCR were forward 5-accggaagtgtgggatactg-3, reverse 5-gctcacggttccacttcatt-3 (GRIM-19, 194 bp); forward 5-tcatctctgccccctctgct-3, reverse 5-cgacgcctgcttcaccacct-3 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 440 bp). The PCR program used was 50 °C for 2 min, then 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 15 s, and 72 °C 15 s. The threshold cycle (CT) values were obtained for the reactions reflecting quantity of the template in the sample. GRIM-19 Delta CT (ΔCT) was calculated by subtracting the GAPDH CT value from the GRIM-19 CT value and thus represented the relative quantity of the target molecule after normalizing with the internal standard GAPDH. The GRIM-19 ΔCT values of Caco-2 cells infected with Salmonella or transfected with pCDNA4/HisMAX-GRIM19 were expressed as percentage of GRIM-19 ΔCT values of control Caco-2 cells. PCR products were sequenced using an ABI 3700 PRISM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) automated sequencer. Sequences were analyzed using NCBI BLAST software. Cytotoxicity Assays—To evaluate the effect of overexpression of GRIM-19 and NOD2 in Caco-2 cells, we measured the release of adenylate kinase from damage cells using the ToxiLight non-destructive cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME). As a positive control, we infected Caco-2 cells with S. typhimurium at an MOI of 50 during 2 h. NF-κB Activation Assays—HEK293 cells were transfected overnight with 1 ng of NOD2, 10 ng of grim-19 siRNA plus 1 ng of pIV luciferase reporter plasmid and Renilla plasmid. At the same time, 1 μg of MDP-LD (Sigma) was added. After 24 h, luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized relative to Renilla activity. Statistical Analysis—For analysis of the significance of differences in invasion, NF-κB, or mRNA levels, Student's t test was used for comparison of two groups of data. All experiments were repeated at least three times. A p value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. GRIM-19 Is a New Binding Partner of NOD2—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify cellular proteins that interact with NOD2. The N-terminal deletion construct, NOD2 without the CARD15 domain, was used as bait (Fig. 1A). We screened a human bone marrow cDNA library expressing proteins fused to the AD transcriptional activation domain. One positive clone was identified to encode the human GRIM-19 protein, a novel cell death-related gene (21Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Co-expression of NOD2 and GRIM-19 in yeast survival assays in S.D./–Ade/–His/–Leu/–Trp/X-gal-selective medium confirmed a strong interaction between these two proteins (data not shown). Association of NOD2 and GRIM-19 —To confirm the interaction of NOD2 and GRIM-19 in mammalian cells, we transfected COS7 or HEK293 cells with FLAG-tagged NOD2 and Xpress-tagged GRIM-19. As shown in Fig. 1B, GRIM-19 was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from NOD2 co-transfectants, but not from cells co-transfected with the control plasmid (Fig. 1B). A reciprocal immunoprecipitation/blotting experiment using anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody also showed NOD2 co-precipitating with GRIM-19 (Fig. 1B). To study the possible physiological significance of NOD2/GRIM-19 interaction, we investigated endogenous interaction between NOD2 and GRIM-19. For this, we used the HM2559 rabbit antiserum against NOD2 previously generated (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and a newly produced rabbit antiserum against GRIM-19. Anti-GRIM-19 antibody specifically recognized Xpress-tagged GRIM-19 overexpressed in COS7 or HT29 cells (data not shown). The rabbit antiserum against NOD2 HM2559 showed a good endogenous NOD2 expression in HT29 cells, whereas COS7 and HEK293 cells expressed low amounts of endogenous NOD2 (data not shown). We expressed GRIM-19 in HT29 cells and showed after immunoprecipitation using anti-GRIM-19 antiserum an association with endogenous NOD2 (Fig. 1C). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of HT29 lysate overexpressing NOD2 using anti-GRIM-19 antiserum showed increased NOD2 binding compared with lysate from non-transfected HT29 cells (data not shown). The interaction between GRIM-19 and CARD4/NOD1 was also examined. In contrast to NOD2, no association was observed between NOD1 and GRIM-19 by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1D). These data suggest a specific functional link between GRIM-19 and NOD2. GRIM-19 and NOD2 Colocalize in Caco-2 and COS7 Cells— To determine in which cellular compartment NOD2 and GRIM-19 interact, we examined their subcellular localization by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. COS7 and Caco-2 cells were transfected with Xpress-GRIM-19 and GFP-NOD2 expression plasmids (Fig. 2). The NOD2 protein was observed throughout the cytoplasm and also near the plasma membrane. In COS7 and Caco-2 cells co-expressing GFP-NOD2 and Xpress-GRIM-19, GRIM-19 partially colocalized with NOD2 in intracellular vesicles but not near the membrane (Fig. 2). GRIM-19 Is Expressed in IBD Tissues and Intestinal Epithelial Cell Lines—Expression of GRIM-19 was also determined in colonic biopsies from Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis patients taken from both involved and non-involved areas and compared with expression in mucosal biopsies obtained from controls without IBD. In the non-involved mucosa from IBD patients, grim-19 mRNA expression was comparable with that in control patients. In contrast, grim-19 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in involved areas from mucosa of both ulcerative colitis and CD patients (Fig. 3A). Expression of grim-19 mRNA was also assessed by RT-PCR in several human intestinal epithelial cell lines, the THP-1 macrophage cell line, and Jurkat cells. GRIM-19 was expressed in THP-1, Jurkat cell lines, and in all the IEC lines used in this study (Fig. 3B). The effect of bacterial invasion on GRIM-19 expression was evaluated. Caco-2 cells were infected with invasive S. typhimurium and non-pathogenic and non-invasive E. coli for 2 h at an MOI 100. Invasive ability of S. typhimurium was verified using gentamicin protection assay (data not shown). S. typhimurium infection up-regulated grim-19 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells (2.26-fold), whereas infection with a non-pathogenic and non-invasive E. coli had no effect on grim-19 mRNA expression (Fig. 4). Functional Role of GRIM-19 in Caco-2 Cells—To determine the effect of GRIM-19 on cell death, we assessed a non-destructive bioluminescence cytotoxicity assay on Caco-2 cells. Cells were transfected with Xpress-tagged GRIM-19 or FLAG-tagged NOD2 or infected with S. typhimurium. Overexpression of GRIM-19 or NOD2 did not induce cell death under the conditions of this study, whereas infection by S. typhimurium induced cell death (Fig. 5A). To determine whether GRIM-19 protein results in an alteration of the functional outcome of bacterial survival, untransfected and transiently transfected Caco-2 cells were infected with S. typhimurium. After a 2-h incubation period with the monolayer, the percentage of intracellular bacteria in comparison with the inoculum was significantly decreased (72.0 ± 5.4%) in Caco-2 cells expressing GRIM-19 in comparison with non-transfected cells or cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 5B). Consistent with these findings, S. typhimurium invasion increased (162.0 ± 43.8%) in Caco-2 cells harboring a plasmid encoding the grim-19 siRNA-1 (Fig. 5B), which significantly decreased grim-19 mRNA levels (data not shown), whereas the control grim-19 siRNA (sequence 2), which has no effect on grim-19 mRNA, did not modify S. typhimurium invasive ability. To confirm these results, immunostaining was performed with Caco-2 cells transfected with Xpress-tagged GRIM-19 and infected with S. typhimurium. As shown in Fig. 5C, few bacteria were found in Caco-2 cells expressing GRIM-19, whereas numerous bacteria were observed in adjacent cells that did not express GRIM-19 (Fig. 5C). Consistent with these results, the mean number of intracellular bacteria found in Caco-2 cells expressing GRIM-19 after immunostaining examination by confocal microscopy is significantly lower (7.5 bacteria/cell) (p < 0.001) than that of untransfected cells (14.8 bacteria/cells) (Fig. 5D). Thus, GRIM-19 protected host cells by reducing the intracellular survival of S. typhimurium. Retinoic Acid and IFN-β Exert Anti-bacterial Activity by Inducing GRIM-19 Expression—To investigate whether endogenous GRIM-19 directly exerts anti-microbial activity, we induced endogenous GRIM-19 expression by stimulating Caco-2 cells with a combination of retinoic acid (RA) and interferon-β (INF-β). After stimulation with RA and IFN-β, real-time RT-PCR showed that grim-19 mRNA expression was significantly increased (Fig. 6), whereas Caco-2 cells stimulated with either RA or IFN-β alone did not induce GRIM-19 expression. Subsequently the ability of S. typhimurium to invade Caco-2 cells that were unstimulated or stimulated with RA or INF-β, or both, was evaluated. After a 2-h incubation period with the epithelial monolayer, the percentage of intracellular bacteria was significantly decreased in Caco-2 cells stimulated with both RA and INF-β (Fig. 6), whereas the invasive ability of S. typhimurium remained the same in Caco-2 cells stimulated only with either RA or INF-β. Increased grim-19 expression therefore correlated with a decrease in the number of recovered viable S. typhimurium in bacterial invasion assays. Finally, grim-19 siRNA-1 restored invasive ability of S. typhimurium in stimulated Caco-2 cells in comparison with non-stimulated Caco-2 cells (Fig. 6), indicating that retinoic acid and INF-β exert anti-bacterial activity by inducing endogenous GRIM-19 expression. GRIM-19 Is Required for NOD2-mediated NF-κB Activation following MDP-LD Stimulation—HEK293 cells transfected with 1 ng of NOD2 were stimulated with 1 μg of MDP-LD and transfected with siRNA specific for grim-19. Transfection with grim-19 siRNA-1 significantly decreased grim-19 mRNA level and inhibited the MDP-LD-driven response to NOD2. NF-κB activation in HEK293 transfected with NOD2 and grim-19 siRNA-1 after MDP-LD stimulation was only 50% of that observed in HEK293 transfected only with NOD2 or with pSUPER control vector (Fig. 7A). Control grim-19 siRNA, which did not knock down grim-19 mRNA, had no significant effect on NF-κB activation via NOD2 after MDP-LD stimulation. The anti-bacterial activity of NOD2 was also dependent on the presence of GRIM-19. The invasive ability of S. typhimurium decreased in HEK293 cells overexpressing NOD2 compared with non-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 7B). This effect was reversed in the presence of grim-19 siRNA-1 (Fig. 7B), suggesting that anti-bacterial activity conferred by NOD2 correlates with NF-κB activation. We have previously shown that NOD2, but not the NOD2 mutant 3020insC associated with CD, protects intestinal epithelial cells against Salmonella infection (19Hisamatsu T. Suzuki M. Reinecker H.C. Nadeau W.J. McCormick B.A. Podolsky D.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 993-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and identified GRIM-19 as an interacting protein with NOD2 in mammalian cells. GRIM-19, gene associated with retinoid-IFN-induced mortality 19, is located on chromosome 19 and induces cell death in a number of tumor cell lines. GRIM-19 protein expression is induced by the combination of IFN-β and all-transretinoic acid RA (21Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The subcellular location of GRIM-19 action remains to be established. Originally GRIM-19 was observed in the nucleus (21Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and more recently in both nucleus and cytoplasm (23Hu J. Angell J.E. Zhang J. Ma X. Seo T. Raha A. Hayashi J. Choe J. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Its nuclear, but also cytoplasmic, distribution and punctate staining patterns observed in cells prompted speculation that GRIM-19 might interact with various protein or protein complexes to regulate cellular responses (21Angell J.E.

GRIM-19 is also a subunit of the mitochondrial NADPH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I) (24Fearnley I.M. Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38345-38348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and colocalized with mitochondria in MCF-7 and COS1 cells (25Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recently, GRIM-19 was detected in the native form in mitochondrial complex I. Homologous deletion of GRIM-19 in mice causes embryonic lethality at embryonic day 9.5 (26Huang G. Lu H. Hao A. Ng D.C. Ponniah S. Guo K. Lufei C. Zeng Q. Cao X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8447-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed a cytoplasmic colocalization of GRIM-19 and NOD2. Furthermore, interaction between GRIM-19 and NOD2 is NOD2-specific; no binding was observed with NOD1, another NOD protein family member. Present and previous studies indicate that GRIM-19 binds additional proteins that play a crucial role in IBD, including NOD2, Stat3, and GW112. GRIM-19 binds Stat3 in various cell types but did not bind other Stat proteins, such as Stat1 or Stat5a (25Lufei C. Ma J. Huang G. Zhang T. Novotny-Diermayr V. Ong C.T. Cao X. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and the interaction between GRIM-19 and Stat3 suppresses Stat3 activity. Stat3 has a critical role in the development and regulation of innate immunity, and deletion of Stat3 during hematopoiesis causes Crohn disease-like pathogenesis and lethality in mice (27Welte T. Zhang S.S. Wang T. Zhang Z. Hesslein D.G. Yin Z. Kano A. Iwamoto Y. Li E. Craft J.E. Bothwell A.L. Fikrig E. Koni P.A. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1879-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). GRIM-19 has also been reported to bind GW112, a protein expressed in various human normal and malignant tissues with higher expression in organs/tumors of the digestive system. GW112 plays an anti-apoptotic role that promotes tumor growth, and GW112 could be involved in the regulation of cellular apoptosis under inflammatory conditions in the digestive system (28Zhang X. Huang Q. Yang Z. Li Y. Li C.Y. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2474-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We provide evidence here that Salmonella infection increases grim-19 mRNA in infected Caco-2 cells, whereas expression remains unchanged in Caco-2 cells infected with non-invasive E. coli. Epithelial cells of the human intestinal mucosa are the initial site of host invasion by bacterial enteric pathogens. Human colonic epithelial cells were shown to undergo apoptosis following infection with different invasive bacteria, such as enteroinvasive E. coli or Salmonella. Apoptosis in response to bacterial infection may function to delete infected and damaged epithelial cells and restore epithelial cell growth regulation and epithelial integrity (29Kim J.M. Eckmann L. Savidge T.C. Lowe D.C. Witthoft T. Kagnoff M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that after invasion of intestinal macrophages, virulence proteins secreted by Salmonella specifically induce apoptotic cell death by activating the cysteine protease caspase-1 (30Jarvelainen H.A. Galmiche A. Zychlinsky A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 204-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GRIM-19 has been shown to interact with multiple proteins such as mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase and to have several biological activities, including cell growth, transcription, and cell death (21Angell J.E. Lindner D.J. Shapiro P.S. Hofmann E.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33416-33426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here, we show that under the conditions of this study, GRIM-19 did not induce cell death. Expression of GRIM-19 in Caco-2 cells decreased the invasive ability of Salmonella, revealing its protective role in IEC. Given that the overall transfection efficiency in the Caco-2 cells was ∼30–35%, the 28% reduction in colony-forming units suggests that GRIM-19 is highly effective in controlling intracellular survival in those cells expressing the transfected protein. Down-regulation of GRIM-19 expression using siRNA increased the invasive ability of S. typhimurium. Consistent with these findings, the invasive ability of S. typhimurium also decreased in Caco-2 cells expressing increased endogenous GRIM-19 induced by the combination of IFNβ/RA. In addition, siRNA against GRIM-19 restored invasive activity of S. typhimurium in Caco-2 cells stimulated with IFNβ/RA, confirming that endogenous GRIM-19 protects cells against bacteria. We also show that expression of GRIM-19 is decreased in IBD tissues from both ulcerative colitis and CD patients in affected areas, compared with uninvolved tissue. This decrease could be due to the loss of epithelium in the involved area or to the down-regulation of GRIM-19 expression in inflamed areas in IBD patients. Given the fact that we demonstrate a protective role for GRIM-19, decreased GRIM-19 expression in involved colonic areas in IBD patients could induce a higher susceptibility of commensal and/or pathogenic bacteria to invade and/or survive in involved areas of the epithelium. The question remains how does GRIM-19 function in the innate immune mucosal response? It appears from our data that GRIM-19 acts as a key component of the innate immune mucosal response by modulating NF-κB activation via NOD2. Decreased expression of GRIM-19 using specific siRNA in HEK293 overexpressing NOD2 decreased NF-κB activation in response to MDP-LD. Importantly, NF-κB activation correlates with a decrease in the number of viable intracellular S. typhimurium, indicating that NOD2 anti-bacterial activity is dependent on NF-κB activation. In addition to its effects on NOD2-mediated NF-κB activation, it is possible that GRIM-19 has other functions that contribute to its effects on epithelial response to invasive bacteria. GRIM-19 is a subunit of the mitochondrial NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (24Fearnley I.M. Carroll J. Shannon R.J. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Hirst J. J. Biol.

The NADPH enzyme complex catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular superoxide anion. Reactive oxygen species operate on a variety of physiological processes, including host defense against pathogens (31Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The best knownO2⋅¯-producing enzyme is the phagocyte-associated respiratory enzyme NADPH oxidase burst that plays a crucial role in the process of killing microorganisms (31Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide stimulated Toll-like-receptor 4 signaling and activated the NADPH oxidase 1 (32Teshima S.

Immun. 2001; 69: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, a yeast two-hybrid screen led to the observation of a direct interaction of TLR4 with NADPH oxidase 4 that mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced reactive oxygen species generation and NF-κB activation (34Park H.S. Jung H.Y. Park E.Y. Kim J. Lee W.J. Bae Y.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). It is possible that GRIM-19 increases the production of reactive oxygen species in intestinal epithelial cells after bacterial invasion, protecting the intestinal mucosa against pathogens. GRIM-19 could support mucosal defense by mediating NOD2 function in the recognition of bacterial pathogens and their elimination in intestinal epithelial cells.

Therefore, the development of therapies aimed at the inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis is a major issue. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor has been shown to convey survival signals to the hepatocyte. To learn about the endogenous response of epidermal growth factor receptor ligands during Fas-mediated liver injury we investigated the expression of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, betacellulin, epiregulin, and amphiregulin in the liver of mice challenged with Fas-agonist antibody. Amphiregulin expression, barely detectable in healthy liver, was significantly up-regulated. Amphiregulin administration abrogated Fas-mediated liver injury in mice and showed direct anti-apoptotic effects in primary hepatocytes. Amphiregulin activated the Akt and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 survival pathways, and up-regulated Bcl-xL expression. Amphiregulin knock-out mice showed signs of chronic liver damage in the absence of any noxious treatment, and died faster than wild type mice in response to lethal doses of Fas-agonist antibody. In contrast, these mice were more resistant against sublethal liver damage, supporting the hypothesis that chronic liver injury can precondition hepatocytes inducing resistance to subsequent cell death. These results show that amphiregulin is a protective factor induced in response to liver damage and that it may be therapeutic in liver diseases.

Hepatocyte apoptosis is a common mechanism to many forms of liver disease. It has been recognized to contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, cholestatic liver disease, and ischemia/reperfusion injury (1Rust C. Gores G.J. Am. J.

More recently hepatocyte apoptosis has been reported to occur in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, correlating with the severity of the disease (4Feldstein A.E. Canbay A.

The consequences of hepatocellular apoptosis may extend beyond the mere loss of functional liver mass, because moderate and persistent apoptosis may contribute to the development of liver inflammation and fibrosis (5Faouzi S.

Apoptosis can be triggered by the activation of two molecular pathways: an intrinsic mitochondrially mediated cascade and a death receptor pathway. In the liver, the death receptor pathway appears to be predominant and involves the activation of cytokine receptors such as Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors-1 and -2 (1Rust C. Gores G.J. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 567-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 2Jaeschke H. Gores G.J. Cederbaum A.I. Hinson J.A. Pessayre D. Lemasters J.J. Toxicol.

Upon activation by their respective ligands these receptors initiate intracellular signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of death-inducing proteolytic enzymes (1Rust C. Gores G.J.

Fas is abundantly expressed in the liver, and Fas-mediated apoptosis has been shown to significantly contribute to toxic or viral damage and acute liver failure (7Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R.

Interestingly, hepatocyte apoptosis observed in cholestasis is initiated by the ligand-independent activation of Fas by hydrophobic bile salts (1Rust C. Gores G.J. Am. J.

In addition, lack of Fas expression or RNA interference targeting of Fas results in significant protection from fulminant hepatitis (7Ogasawara J. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A.

This receptor can be bound and activated by a broad family of ligands that, besides EGF, include transforming growth factor α (TGFα), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin (BTC), epiregulin (EPR), and amphiregulin (AR) (27Prenzel N.

Treatment of isolated murine hepatocytes with EGF, or transgenic overexpression of TGFα in mice, have demonstrated to induce hepatocyte resistance toward Fas-mediated apoptosis (18Musallam L.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 519: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is known that the expression of TGFα and HB-EGF in liver tissue is markedly increased on liver injury induced by CCl4 (29Webber E.M. Fitzgerald M.J. Brown P.I. Bartlett M.H. Fausto N.

Additionally, we have recently reported that the expression of AR is induced in chronic liver damage and is necessary for efficient hepatocyte DNA synthesis after partial hepatectomy (31Berasain C.

However, to our knowledge, the expression of these ligands in the liver during Fas-mediated apoptosis has not been examined. Information on this issue can shed light on the endogenous protective mechanisms triggered in this clinically relevant model and help to design therapeutic interventions. This was the original aim of this study that led us to uncover the hepatoprotective potential of AR. Animal Experiments—Experiments were performed in conformity with our Institution's guidelines for the use of laboratory animals. Acute liver damage was induced in male C57/BL6 mice (20 g) (Harlan, Barcelona, Spain) and male AR+/+ and AR–/– littermate mice (20 g) (32Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (n = 3–5 per condition and time point), with a single intraperitoneal injection of the agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody Jo2 (4 μg/mouse in saline) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) (15Kosai K. Matsumoto K. Nagata S. Tsujimoto Y. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Controls received the equivalent volume of saline. For survival experiments male AR+/+ and AR–/– littermate mice (20 g, n = 11 mice per genotype) received a single intraperitoneal injection of Jo2 antibody (0.3 mg/kg of body weight). The mice were monitored for up to 24 h, and the time of death was recorded. Where indicated mice were injected intraperitoneally with human recombinant AR (9.5 μg/mouse, Sigma) 6 and 0.5 h prior and 3 h after anti-Fas antibody. At the indicated time points mice were bled, and serum was analyzed for alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST). Mice (C57/BL6) were also treated with Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (15 mg/kg of body weight in saline) or CCl4 (1 μl/g of body weight in olive oil) (Sigma), intraperitoneally administered. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points by cervical dislocation, and livers were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded for hematoxylin and eosin staining. RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Analyses—Total RNA was extracted using the TRI reagent (Sigma). We treated 2 μg of RNA with DNase I (Invitrogen) prior to reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of RNaseOUT (Invitrogen) and used 1/10 of cDNA preparation for each PCR. PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantitated using the Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Data were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. Only samples with a comparable amplification of β-actin mRNA were included in the study. We designed all primers to distinguish between genomic and cDNA amplification and sequenced all PCR products to confirm the specificity. Real-time PCR was performed using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) and the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). To monitor the specificity final PCR products were analyzed by melting curves and electrophoresis. The amount of each transcript was expressed as the n-fold difference relative to the control gene β-actin (2ΔCt, where ΔCt represents the difference in threshold cycle between the control and target genes), as previously described (33Berasain C. Hevia H. Fernández-Irigoyen J. Larrea E. Caballería J. Mato J.M. Prieto J. Corrales F.J. García-Trevijano E.R. Avila M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1690: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TUNEL Assay—Frozen liver tissue sections were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). The TUNEL assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Isolation, Culture, and Treatment of Mouse Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were isolated from male C57/BL6 mice (20 g) by collagenase (Invitrogen) perfusion as described previously (34Martínez-Chantar M.L. Corrales F.J. Martínez-Cruz L.A. García-Trevijano E.R. Huang Z.Z. Chen L. Kanel G. Avila M.A. Mato J.M. Lu S.C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1292-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto collagen-coated 6-well dishes (type I collagen, Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford, MA) 5 × 105 cells per well. Cultures were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (all from Invitrogen). After 2-h incubation medium was removed, and cells were refed the same medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum. Apoptosis was induced in cultured mouse hepatocytes by treatment with 0.5 μg/ml anti-Fas antibody and 0.05 μg/ml actinomycin D as described before (15Kosai K. Matsumoto K. Nagata S. Tsujimoto Y. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Where indicated hepatocytes were treated with AR 3 h prior to addition of anti-Fas antibody and actinomycin D. Apoptosis was estimated by the determination of soluble histone-DNA complexes using the Cell Death Detection Assay (Roche Applied Science). Cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm (enrichment factor) was calculated as the ratio between the absorbance values of the samples obtained from treated and control cells. The effect of AR on Fas-mediated apoptosis was also tested in the presence of the extracellular-regulated kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) inhibitor PD98059, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY-294002, and the EGF-R inhibitor PD153035, all from Calbiochem. The protective effect of AR (20 nm) on Jo2- and actinomycin D-induced apoptosis in isolated mouse hepatocytes was also assessed by TUNEL staining. Treatments were performed as described above; subsequently, cells were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 30 min. The TUNEL assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Measurement of Caspase-3 Activity—Caspase-3 activity was measured in mouse hepatocytes and liver tissue lysates using the Caspase-3/CPP32 Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA). Cells (5 × 105) were scraped in culture medium, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer. Liver tissue was Dounce-homogenized in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell lysates and supernatants from liver homogenates (200 μg in 50 μl) were used to measure caspase-3 activity following the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Homogenates from liver samples and isolated hepatocytes were subjected to Western blot analysis as described (31Berasain C. García-Trevijano E.R. Castillo P. Erroba E. Lee D.C. Prieto J. Avila M.A. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 424-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were: affinity-purified biotinylated anti-mouse AR polyclonal antibody (BAF989) (RD Systems), active caspase-3 p17 subunit (9664S), phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) (9271S), and phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr705) (9131S) and phospho-JNK (9251) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); ERK1/2 (06–182) and STAT3 (06–596) (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). All other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): BclxL (sc8392), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Tyr204) (sc7383), Akt (sc5298), and Fas (sc1023). Statistical Analysis—Data are the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was estimated with the Mann-Whitney test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Expression of EGF-R Ligands in Mouse Liver after the Administration of the Fas-agonistic Antibody Jo2—The expression of the EGF-R ligands EGF, TGFα, HB-EGF, BTC, EPR, and AR was studied by real-time PCR in the liver of control mice and in mice that received a dose of Jo2 antibody previously shown to cause significant liver damage and apoptosis (15Kosai K. Matsumoto K. Nagata S. Tsujimoto Y. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Liver samples were taken for analysis 2, 5, and 10 h after Jo2 administration. As depicted in Fig. 1A, serum levels of transaminases alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were still normal 2 h after Jo2 injection, increased remarkably between 5 and 10 h of treatment, and decreased thereafter. As shown in Fig. 1B we observed different patterns of response to Jo2 treatment among EGF-R ligands. HB-EGF gene expression showed a slight reduction early after Jo2 injection, but remained close to control values for the rest of the study. TGFα gene expression showed a peak 2 h after Jo2 administration and was rapidly down-regulated, reaching values below control levels by 10 h of treatment. EGF gene expression did not change significantly early after Jo2 injection, but dropped below control values after 5 h of treatment. Similarly, BTC gene expression was significantly down-regulated between 2 and 5 h after Jo2 injection and remained so at the last time point tested. The two other EGF-R ligands examined, namely AR and EPR, showed a clear up-regulation in Jo2-treated mice. EPR gene expression was progressively induced, being maximal 10 h post-Jo2 administration, the latest time point tested. Interestingly, in agreement with other reports and our previous observations we noticed that AR gene expression was barely detectable in normal liver (35Plowman G.D. Green J.M. McDonald V.L.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); however, it was potently induced between 2 and 5 h after Jo2 injection, preceding that of EPR. In concordance with the up-regulation of AR mRNA levels, Western blot analyses performed with a biotinylated affinity-purified anti-mouse AR antibody on liver samples obtained 10 after Jo2 antibody administration allowed us to detect a set of proteins that were present in the liver of treated mice (Fig. 2). Four bands of ∼50, 43, 28, and 19 kDa are consistent with the different forms of AR described in epithelial cells (36Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The 50- and 28-kDa bands likely represent membrane-anchored forms of AR, whereas the 43- and 19-kDa bands may be proteolytically processed soluble forms of AR (36Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The fact that AR gene expression becomes induced during the early time period following Jo2 treatment suggested that AR may be protective against Fas-mediated apoptosis. This observation led us to evaluate the in vivo hepatoprotective effects of this EGF-R ligand.Fig. 2A, AR gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR in the liver of control mice and in the liver of mice treated with Jo2 antibody for 5 h. B, Western blot analysis of liver extracts from control and Jo2-treated mice performed with a biotinylated affinity purified anti-AR antibody. Samples were obtained after 10 h of treatment with Jo2 antibody. Arrowheads indicate the different AR forms. Three representative samples are shown per group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AR Administration Attenuates Fas-mediated Acute Liver Injury in Mice—To test if AR can limit the extent of liver injury we examined the effect of AR administration in mice challenged with Jo2 antibody. Serum levels of ALT and AST were greatly elevated 10 h after Jo2 injection (Fig. 3A). AR treatment potently suppressed liver damage, as indicated by the reduced levels of serum transaminases and histopathological analysis of liver tissue sections from AR-treated mice, showing how this growth factor prevented the destruction of the parenchymal architecture induced by Fas ligation (Fig. 3A). As mentioned above, apoptotic cell death is a major determinant in Fas-mediated liver damage. To confirm that the hepatoprotective effects of AR against Fas-mediated liver injury derived from an anti-apoptotic action, we performed TUNEL staining and measured caspase-3 cleavage and activity in mouse liver extracts. TUNEL staining showed profuse apoptotic injury in Jo2-treated mice (Fig. 3B), which was confirmed by cleavage and activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3, C and D). All these apoptosis-related events were significantly prevented by AR treatment (Fig. 3, B–D). Prevention of caspase-3 cleavage by AR suggests the specific blockade of Fas-induced apoptotic pathway by this growth factor (Fig. 3D). Bcl-2 family proteins inhibit apoptosis induced by variety of stimuli, including Fas-mediated apoptosis (37Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kosaka H. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 38Stoll S.W. Benedict M. Mitra R. Mitra R. Hiniker A. Elder J.T. Nuñez G.

Kahn A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). We assessed the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL by Western blotting 10 h after the injection of anti-Fas antibody. Bcl-xL proteins levels were decreased in the liver of mice treated with Jo2; however, AR administration helped to maintain the Bcl-xL protein levels found in control mouse liver (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, AR mRNA levels are also rapidly induced (between 2 and 3 h) in other models of hepatic injury such as acute CCl4 or bacterial lipopolysaccharide administration (data not shown). CCl4 causes necrosis and apoptosis in liver cells through the promotion of membrane lipid peroxidation and the production of high levels of tumor necrosis factor α (40Shi J. Aisaki K. Ikawa Y. Wake K. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 41Czaja M.J. Xu J. Alt E. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 1849-1854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The administration of AR 0.5 h prior and 12 h after CCl4, significantly prevented the development of tissue injury and the rise in serum transaminases: from 9193 ± 908 IU/ml ALT in CCl4-treated mice to 4688 ± 735 IU/ml ALT in CCl4 plus AR-treated mice, p < 0.05. In the same animals AST levels were reduced from 8579 ± 684 to 4475 ± 773 IU/ml in AR-treated mice, p < 0.05. Direct Antiapoptotic Effect of AR on Primary Cultured Hepatocytes—To determine whether the in vivo antiapoptotic effects of AR could be mediated by a direct action of AR on the liver parenchymal cells, we used mouse hepatocytes in primary culture. It has been described that hepatocytes exposed to anti-Fas antibodies (Jo2) efficiently undergo apoptosis in the presence of actinomycin D (15Kosai K. Matsumoto K. Nagata S. Tsujimoto Y. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Musallam L. Ethier C. Haddad P.S. Bilodeau M. Am. J.

Cell Res. 1994; 215: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were pretreated with different concentrations of AR for 3 h prior to actinomycin D and Jo2 antibody addition. Apoptosis, and apoptosis-related molecular events, were measured 18 h later. As shown in Fig. 4A, AR dose-dependently protected hepatocytes from apoptosis indicating a direct cytoprotective effect of AR in the prevention of Fas-mediated liver apoptosis. The antiapoptotic effect of AR was further demonstrated by TUNEL staining of isolated hepatocytes treated with Jo2 plus actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 4B the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in AR-treated cultures. Interestingly, the cytoprotective activity of AR was also observed in apoptosis induced by other agents such as okadaic acid, TGFβ, and tumor necrosis factor α plus galactosamine (data not shown). In concordance with the antiapoptotic effect of AR, we observed that caspase-3 cleavage and activation induced by anti-Fas antibody were significantly inhibited by AR (Fig. 4C). In agreement with our previous observations performed in vivo, we found that, although the levels of the ant"

MTAN is therefore involved in quorum sensing, recycling MTA from the polyamine pathway via adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and recycling MTR to methionine. Hydrolysis of MTA by E. coli MTAN involves a highly dissociative transition state with ribooxacarbenium ion character. Iminoribitol mimics of MTA at the transition state of MTAN were synthesized and tested as inhibitors. 5′-Methylthio-Immucillin-A (MT-ImmA) is a slow-onset tight-binding inhibitor giving a dissociation constant (Ki*) of 77 pm. Substitution of the methylthio group with a p-Cl-phenylthio group gives a more powerful inhibitor with a dissociation constant of 2 pm. DADMe-Immucillins are better inhibitors of E. coli MTAN, since they are more closely related to the highly dissociative nature of the transition state. MT-DADMe-Immucillin-A binds with a Ki* value of 2 pm. Replacing the 5′-methyl group with other hydrophobic groups gave 17 transition state analogue inhibitors with dissociation constants from 10-12 to 10-14 m. The most powerful inhibitor was 5′-p-Cl-phenylthio-DADMe-Immucillin-A (pClPhT-DADMe-ImmA) with a Ki* value of 47 fm (47 × 10-15 m). These are among the most powerful non-covalent inhibitors reported for any enzyme, binding 9-91 million times tighter than the MTA and SAH substrates, respectively. The inhibitory potential of these transition state analogue inhibitors supports a transition state structure closely resembling a fully dissociated ribooxacarbenium ion. Powerful inhibitors of MTAN are candidates to disrupt key bacterial pathways including methylation, polyamine synthesis, methionine salvage, and quorum sensing. The accompanying article reports crystal structures of MTAN with these analogues.

It catalyzes the physiologically irreversible hydrolysis of 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to adenine and 5-methylthio-d-ribose (MTR). The product adenine is subsequently recycled into the adenine nucleotide pool by the widely distributed adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (5Williams-Ashman H.G. Seidenfeld J. Galletti P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1982; 31: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the 5-methylthio-d-ribose is subsequently phosphorylated to 5-methylthio-α-d-ribose 1-phosphate and converted into methionine (6Myers R.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10547-10551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTA is a by-product of the reactions involving sequential transfers of the aminopropyl group from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine to form spermidine and spermine (although spermine is absent in Escherichia coli). Polyamine synthesis is sensitive to product inhibition by MTA, with inhibition constants reported to be 0.3 μm for bovine spermine synthase (7Pajula R.L. Raina A. FEBS Lett. 1979; 99: 153-156Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and 50 μm for rat spermidine synthase (8Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 94: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MTAN is therefore expected to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis and the salvage pathways for adenine and methionine. Another function of MTAN in bacteria is generation of S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH) from SAH. SRH is a precursor for synthesis of tetrahydrofurans, quorum-sensing molecules involved in expression of the enzymes for biofilm formation, exotoxin synthesis, and antibiotic resistance factors (9Winzer K.

Previously characterized nucleoside and nucleotide N-ribosyl hydrolases proceed through transition state structures in which the N-ribosidic bond is partially cleaved at the transition state without significant bond order to the attacking water nucleophile (15Schramm V.L.

The Immucillin transition state analogues designed for these enzymes were modified to incorporate chemical features of MTA and were the starting point for our inhibitor design program. Kinetic isotope effect analysis for MTAN has established the transition state structure to be more closely related to a highly dissociated ribooxacarbenium ion. 2V. Singh, S. Nunez, J. E. Lee, P. L. Howell, and V. L. Schramm, unpublished results. 2V. Singh, S. Nunez, J. E. Lee, P. L. Howell, and V. L. Schramm, unpublished results. Highly dissociated transition states for N-ribosyltransferases are closely related to the human and malarial purine nucleoside phosphorylases and to ricin, which have all been shown to form highly dissociated SN1-like transition states (18Chen X.Y. Berti P.J. Schramm V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 1609-1617Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Schramm V.L. Acc. Chem.

The second-generation DADMe-Immucillins are closer mimics of highly dissociated N-ribosyltransferase transition states (20Lewandowicz A. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Schramm V.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and we modified the DADMe-Immucillins to incorporate features of MTA for the second-generation MTAN inhibitors (Fig. 2). Transition state structures derived from kinetic isotope effect analysis have proven to provide robust atomic blueprints for the design of transition state analogues (15Schramm V.L. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 301-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 21Schramm V.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Wolfenden R. Nature. 1969; 223: 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 23Wolfenden R. Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In contrast, protein structural similarity has not been a strong predictor of transition state structure. For example, the catalytic sites of human and bovine purine nucleoside phosphorylases are identical within the error of x-ray diffraction experiments, yet the transition states differ considerably (20Lewandowicz A. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thymidine phosphorylase, another ribosyltransferase, was predicted from structural and computational analysis to have a dissociative transition state, but kinetic isotope effect analysis established a nearclassical SN2 transition state (24Mendieta J. Martin-Santamaria S. Priego E.M. Balzarini J. Camarasa M.J. Perez-Perez M.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 25Birck M.R. Schramm V.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2447-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent analyses have implicated dynamic motion as an important component of transition state formation. The only dependable way to understand enzymatic transition states is with methods such as kinetic isotope effect analysis that are independent of dynamics (21Schramm V.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Fig. 2MTAN-catalyzed hydrolysis of MTA and the dissociative transition state of the reaction (A). Features of the transition state that distinguish it from substrate are shown in blue. 5′-Thio substituted Immucillin-A molecules mimic an early transition state where the bond between the ribosyl and adenine groups retain partial bond order. Features important for transition state recognition are shown in blue (B). 5′-Thio-substituted DADMe-Immucillin-A molecules mimic a late transition state where the ribosyl cation is fully dissociated from the adenine leaving group, a distance of ∼3 Å (B). In fully dissociated ribosyl transition states, the site of carbocation formation is at C1′, and the N1′ mimics this geometry. The methylene bridge positions the leaving group at an appropriate distance from the ribooxacarbenium ion site; 9-deazaadenine provides a carbon-carbon bridge for chemical stability and to increase the pKa at N7. Features important for transition state recognition are shown in blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transition state analogue inhibitors are designed from the hypothesis that chemically stable analogues that mimic geometric and molecular electrostatic features of the transition state will be bound to the enzyme tighter than the substrate by the factor equal to the catalytic rate of acceleration imposed by the enzyme (22Wolfenden R. Nature. 1969; 223: 704-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 23Wolfenden R. Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Transition state analogues with nearly irreversible binding can hypothetically be designed for enzymes with typical catalytic rate enhancements (1010 to 1015). Nucleoside hydrolases enhance reaction rates by ∼1012. With Km values of 0.43 and 4.3 μm for MTA and SAH, respectively (26Ragione D.F. Porcelli M. Carteni-Farina M. Zappia V. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 27Zappia V. Della Ragione F. Pontoni G. Gragnaniello V. Carteni-Farina M. Adv. Exp. Med.

Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), perfectly designed transition state analogues for MTAN should have dissociation constants of ∼10-19 to 10-18 m. However, it is impossible to design perfect transition state analogues, since the actual enzymatic transition state has non-equilibrium bond lengths and charges that cannot be accurately copied in chemically stable molecules. We synthesized putative transition state analogues for MTAN that mimic properties of both partially and fully dissociated SN1 transition state structures. Efficient transition state analogue inhibitors include ribooxacarbenium ion (carbocation) mimics and a 9-deazaadenine group to mimic the elevated pKa for N7 of MTA at the transition state (Fig. 2). The same approach and some of the same transition state analogues have also been shown to be powerful inhibitors of human MTA phosphorylase (29Singh V. Shi W. Evans G.B. Tyler P.C. Furneaux R.H. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Singh V. Tyler P.C. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transition state mimics of the Immucillin family include an iminoribitol moiety as a mimic of the ribooxacarbenium ion. A stable C-C ribosidic bond replaces the N-ribosidic bond of substrates and an elevated pKa at the N7 position is accomplished by the use of 9-deazaadenine. Iminoribitol mimics resemble early transition states where significant N-ribosidic bond order remains at the transition state. To mimic a fully dissociated ribooxacarbenium transition state, the DADMe-Immucillin family was synthesized. These analogues include the pyrrolidine moiety as the ribooxacarbenium ion mimic and a methylene bridge between the ribooxacarbenium ion mimic and the 9-deazaadenine to provide a geometric approximation of the N-ribosidic bond distance for a fully dissociated transition state. Chemical stability of the pyrrolidine nitrogen is achieved by three neighboring methylene groups, generating analogues resembling 2′-deoxyribosyl nucleosides (Fig. 2). Dissociation constants of the Immucillin analogues extend to the picomolar range whereas the DADMe-Immucillin inhibitors extend to the femtomolar range. Competitive inhibitors with femtomolar dissociation constants are rare in enzymology, making these compounds among the most powerful noncovalent enzyme inhibitors yet reported. Enzyme Preparation—The fragment containing full-length E. coli MTAN was obtained by EcoRI/NotI digestion of p5Xmtan (28Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and cloned into a pPROEX Hta expression vector. The vector was transformed into E. coli strain TOP10F′. The transformed cells were cultured in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and MTAN was expressed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside. This construct expressed a protein with six histidines at the N terminus and was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography (28Cornell K.A. Swarts W.E. Barry R.D. Riscoe M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 724-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Lee J.E. Cornell K.A. Riscoe M.K. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The histidine tag was removed by chymotrypsin digestion following purification. The digested protein has a linker region of ten amino acid residues at its N terminus. The purified protein was analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue and was stored at 15 mg/ml at -70 °C following flash freezing in dry ice-acetone.

Conversion of these amine hydrochlorides to (3R,4R)-1-[(9-deaza-adenin-9-yl)methyl]-3-hydroxy-4-(methoxymethyl)pyrrolidine and (3R,4R)-4-(benzyloxymethyl)-1-[(9-deaza-adenin-9-yl)methyl]-3-hydroxypyrrolidine, respectively, was achieved by a Mannich-type reaction with formaldehyde and 9-deazaadenine, via a previously reported general method (35Evans G.B.

This compound was deacetylated with sodium methoxide in the presence of either cyclohexylmethyl methanesulfonate or cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl, or cyclobutyl bromide; and the corresponding (3R,4S)-3-hydroxy-4-(alkylthiomethyl)pyrrolidine hydrochlorides were isolated after removal of the Boc group with methanolic HCl. Conversion of these amine hydrochlorides to the DADMe-Immucillin-A derivatives was achieved via a Mannich reaction with formaldehyde and 9-deazaadenine as described previously (35Evans G.B.

MT-DADMe-3-deaza-ImmA [49] was synthesized via a Mannich reaction with formaldehyde, 3-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrrolidine and N-Ac-3,9-dideazaadenine, followed by deprotection of the acyl group. The N-Ac-3,9-dideazaadenine moiety was prepared from 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-3-nitropyridine.

https://openalex.org/W1992603021,"Some transmembrane proteins must associate with lipid rafts to function. However, even if acylated, transmembrane proteins should not pack well with ordered raft lipids, and raft targeting is puzzling. Acylation is necessary for raft targeting of linker for activation of T cells (LAT). To determine whether an acylated transmembrane domain is sufficient, we examined raft association of palmitoylated and nonpalmitoylated LAT transmembrane peptides in lipid vesicles by a fluorescence quenching assay, by microscopic examination, and by association with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). All three assays detected very low raft association of the nonacylated LAT peptide. DRM association was the same as a control random transmembrane peptide. Acylation did not measurably enhance raft association by the first two assays but slightly enhanced DRM association. The palmitoylated LAT peptide and a FLAG-tagged LAT transmembrane domain construct expressed in cells showed similar DRM association when both were reconstituted into mixed vesicles (containing cell-derived proteins and lipids and excess artificial raft-forming lipids) before detergent extraction. We conclude that the acylated LAT transmembrane domain has low inherent raft affinity. Full-length LAT in mixed vesicles associated better with DRMs than the peptide. However, cells appeared to contain two pools of LAT, with very different raft affinities. Since some LAT (but not the transmembrane domain construct) was isolated in a protein complex, and the Myc- and FLAG-tagged forms of LAT could be mutually co-immunoprecipitated, oligomerization or interactions with other proteins may enhance raft affinity of one pool of LAT. We conclude that both acylation and other factors, possibly protein-protein interactions, target LAT to rafts."
https://openalex.org/W2137620514,"Protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt reportedly plays a role in the survival and/or proliferation of cells. We identified a novel protein, which binds to PKB, using a yeast two-hybrid screening system. This association was demonstrated not only in vivo by overexpressing both proteins or by coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins, but also in vitro using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Importantly, this protein specifically associates with the C terminus of PKB but not with other AGC kinases and enhances PKB phosphorylation and kinase activation without growth factor stimulation. Thus, we termed this Akt-specific binding protein APE (Akt-phosphorylation enhancer). Since APE-induced phosphorylation of PKB did not occur in cells treated with wortmannin or LY294002, APE itself is not a kinase but seems to enhance or prolong the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PKB. In cells in which APE was suppressed by small interfering RNA, DNA synthesis was significantly reduced with suppression of PKB phosphorylation, suggesting a synergistic role of APE in PKB-induced proliferation. On the other hand, in cells overexpressing both PKB and APE, despite markedly increased basal phosphorylation of PKB, both DNA rereplication and subsequent Chk2 phosphorylation and apoptosis were seen, suggesting the involvement of APE in the regulation of cell cycling replication licensing. Taking these observations together, APE appears to be a novel regulator of PKB phosphorylation. Furthermore, the interaction between APE and PKB, possibly dependent on the expression levels of both proteins, may be a novel molecular mechanism leading to proliferation and/or apoptosis.

The serine/threonine protein kinase PKB 1The abbreviations used are: PKB, protein kinase B; PI, phosphoinositide; PH, pleckstrin homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MTT, 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; PKC, protein kinase C. (also called Akt) is thought to be a key mediator of signal transduction. Upon growth factor stimulation, a family of lipid kinases known as class 1 phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) is recruited to the plasma membrane. PI 3-kinases phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate at the D-3 position of the inositol ring, converting it to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Following the activation of PI 3-kinase, PKBs are recruited to the plasma membrane through direct contact of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and are phosphorylated at Thr308 by PDK1 and at Ser473 by PDK2, a kinase of which the molecular structure has not yet been identified (1Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). AGC kinases other than PKB are also known to be regulated by PI 3-kinase, and PKB acts downstream from PI 3-kinase to regulate numerous biological processes, such as proliferation, antiapoptosis, cell growth, and glucose metabolism (1Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar). PKB has a wide range of substrates, including GSK-3, FKHR (FoxO1), FKHR-L1 (FoxO3), AFX (FoxO4), and eNOS, all of which have the consensus motif RXRXX(S/T) (3Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Protein kinases do not generally form stable complexes with their substrates, although PKB has been shown to exist in a stable complex with several of its substrates including MDM2, p21Cip1/WAF1, and TSC2 (5Zhou B.P.

It was recently shown that several proteins interact with PKB as function modulators rather than as substrates. In a specific subset of T and B cells, TCL1 interacts with the PH domain of PKB and increases its kinase activity (9Pekarsky Y. Koval A. Hallas C. Bichi R. Tresini M. Malstrom S. Russo G. Tsichlis P. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3028-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was shown to form complexes with Cdc37 and PKB, and PKB was stabilized and protected from dephosphorylation and degradation, resulting in increased kinase activity (10Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Chiosis G. Giri B. Tsichlis P. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39858-39866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein binds to the carboxyl terminus of PKBα. Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein binding reportedly inhibits the phosphorylation and kinase activity of PKB, and stable expression of carboxyl-terminal modulator protein leads to phenotypic regression of a v-Akt transformed lung epithelial cell line to wild type (11Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). TRB3 was also identified as a negative modulator of the PKB type (12Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), although a contradictory report was very recently published (13Iynedjian P.B. Biochem. J. 2004; 386: 113-118Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results indicate that understanding PKB modulation is important for elucidating the mechanism of PKB activation and its regulation of cellular functions. In this study, we identified a novel protein that interacts with PKB (in vivo and in vitro). Without growth factor stimulation, overexpression of this protein markedly enhances phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 in PKB, leading to its kinase activation and phosphorylation of its downstream substrates such as GSK-3 and FKHR. In addition, suppression of APE using RNA interference significantly reduces PKB phosphorylation and PKB kinase activity. Therefore, we termed this protein APE (Akt-phosphorylation enhancer) and herein demonstrate the possible role of APE in DNA synthesis and apoptosis in cooperation with PKB. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The DupLEX-A two-hybrid system (Ori-Gene) was used for screening. We screened a mouse embryonic cDNA library with the pJG4-5 vector with a bait protein corresponding to the full length of mouse PKBα using a pEG202 vector and yeast strain EGY48. The positive clones were selected and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmid DNAs were isolated from positive clones and co-transformed with bait cDNA or negative control cDNA back into yeast to reconfirm the interaction. A yeast β-galactosidase assay kit (Pierce) was used to measure the protein-protein in vivo interaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern Blotting—Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was used for Northern blotting. APE cDNA corresponding to the 600 bp of the coding region of the C-terminal and 400 bp of the untranslated region was used as a probe. Antibody against APE—Fragments of the cDNA clone were subcloned into a glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression vector (Amersham Biosciences), expressed in BL21 and purified using glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads. Purified GST fusion proteins were injected into rabbits, and antisera were affinity-purified using the respective antigens. APE-C was generated to a fragment of APE encompassing amino acids 1646-1845. APE-N1 corresponded to amino acids 172-372, and APE-N3 to corresponded to 501-601. Polyclonal antibodies to each antigen were affinity-purified, using each GST fusion protein, after removal of GST-specific antibody. Gene Constructions and Expression System in Yeast and Mammalian Cells—Full-length APE cDNAs were cloned into the pShuttle vector to express these proteins with an adenovirus expression system (Clontech). The expression cassette was excited and subcloned into pAdeno-X vector (Clontech). Adenovirus was cloned, and large scale virus purification from 293T cell lysates was achieved by performing CsCl density gradient centrifugation twice, followed by overnight dialysis as previously described. An adenovirus expression vector for PKBα with a Myc tag at its C terminus had previously been generated (14Yamada T. Katagiri H. Asano T. Inukai K. Tsuru M. Kodama T. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5339-5345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). PKBβ, the PKBα PH domain (residues 1-106), the PKBα kinase domain (residues 138-418), PKBα kinase and its hydrophobic domain (residues 148-480), and the PKBα hydrophobic domain (residues 418-480) were generated by PCR using PKBα or PKCβ cDNA as described previously (14Yamada T.

SGK1 (residues 98-431), SGK2 (residues 35-333), PKCβ2 (residues 342-673), and PKCϵ (residues 408-737) were generated by PCR using a mouse testis cDNA template. APE fragments were generated by PCR using full-length cDNAs as templates. The PCR products were cloned into pEG202 or pJG4-5 vectors. Cell Cultures—HepG2, COS-7, and HeLa cells were from the RIKEN Cell Bank. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Immunoblot Analysis—The antibodies used in this study were anti-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Thr308-Akt, anti-phospho-Ser473-Akt, anti-phospho-Thr68-Chk2, anti-phospho-Ser256-FKHR, anti-phospho-Ser20/9-GSK-3α/β, anti-caspase 3, anti-cleaved caspase 3, anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), anti-cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology) anti-FLAG and anti-α tubulin (Sigma). For total cell lysates, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and collected with Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol before separation by SDS-10% to 6% or 10% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed with ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vivo Association of APE and PKB—HeLa cells were resuspended (4 × 107 cells/ml) in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride). Mouse testis was homogenized with 50 strokes, using a Teflon/glass homogenizer, in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer A. Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. The supernatant was clarified by high speed centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove nuclei, cell debris, and insoluble aggregates. Endogenous PKB and APE in the HeLa cell lysate or mouse testis lysates were immunoprecipitated with 100 μg of immobilized anti-PKB and anti-APE-C antibodies, respectively. One hundred micrograms of immobilized Rabbit IgG were used as a control. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in buffer A with 0.1% Triton X-100, eluted with elution buffer, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These filters were subjected to inmmunoblotting using the antibodies against APE and PKB. In Vitro Association of APE and PKB—cDNAs encoding amino acids 418-480 of mouse PKBα with the Myc tag and amino acids 1646-1845 of mouse APE with the FLAG tag at their C termini were amplified by PCR. These cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-5X-1 and pET-28a vectors, and fusion protein expressions were induced in E. coli strain BL21 by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The expressed proteins were purified using GST or His tag, according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST alone, GST-APE fragment fusion protein, and GST-PKB fragment fusion protein were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 4°C followed by extensive washing in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). An aliquot containing 20 μg of GST alone and GST-APE fragment fusion protein bound to beads were then incubated with the His tag PKB fragment. Similarly, an aliquot containing 20 μg of GST alone and the GST-PKB fragment fusion protein bound to beads were then incubated with the His tag APE fragment. After a 4-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed five times with NETN buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in SDS loading buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol, electrophoresed, and then immunoblotted using anti-Myc and anti-FLAG antibodies for detection of the His tag PKB fragment and His tag APE fragment, respectively. Immunoprecipitation and PKB Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin). For co-immunoprecipitation, we incubated protein lysates with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. An Akt kinase assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) was used to measure PKB kinase activity. PKB was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and Protein G-Sepharose. PKB kinase activity was detected using GSK-3β recombinant protein as a substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene Transduction and in Vivo Phosphorylation of PKB—Mammalian cell lines were infected with adenovirus the day after plating. Purified virus was added directly to the culture medium. Titers of adenovirus for protein overexpression were adjusted so that the expression levels of the Myc-tagged PKBα were similar, irrespective of APE co-expression. Likewise, APE expression levels were adjusted so as to be similar, irrespective of Myc-tagged PKBα co-expression. Experiments were performed 36 h later for in vivo phosphorylation. Cells were starved for 12 h with KRB-Hepes buffer (118.5 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 24.9 mm NaHCO3, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were stimulated by the indicated stimulant in each experiment and, whenever indicated, 1 μm wortmannin or 10 μm LY294002 1 h prior to stimulation. Gene Silencing by siRNA—Gene silencing was performed by an adenovirus-mediated siRNA method. For silencing of endogenous APE gene expression in HepG2 cells, a sense fragment (GGATCCGCATTAACACCCACCCGCTCTTCAAGAGAGAGCGGGTGGGTGTTAATGTTTTTTCTAGAGAATTC) and an antisense fragment (GAATTCTCTAGAAAAAACATTAACACCCACCCGCTCTCTCTTGAAGAGCGGGTGGGTGTTAATGCGGATCC) were used for human APE. These two oligonucleotides were annealed in vitro, and the resultant double-stranded DNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of a pSIREN-Shuttle vector. A negative control vector was supplied by Clontech. The expression cassette containing siRNA of APE or the negative control was excited and subcloned into pAdeno-X vector. DNA Synthesis—HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 36 h and then transfected with an adenovirus encoding siRNA of APE or the negative control. Seventy-two hours after transfection, culture media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were then incubated with BrdUrd labeling solution for 4 h. Incorporated BrdUrd was detected by cell proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd (colorimetric) (Roche Applied Science). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay—Cellular proliferation was measured by reduction of MTT, which corresponds to the living cell number and metabolic activity (15Kamikubo Y. Takaori-Kondo A. Uchiyama T. Hori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17609-17614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected with adenovirus. After incubation for the indicated time, MTT solution was added to each well. After 1 h of incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol with 0.04 n HCl. The absorbance of each well was measured at 492 and 630 nm using a microplate reader. Cell Viability Analysis—HepG2 cells and HeLa cells were infected with control GFP, PKB, APE, or both PKB and APE adenoviruses and incubated for the indicated times. Floating cells were recovered from culture medium by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 1 min, and adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization. Both the floating and adherent cells were observed for morphologic changes with a light microscope at ×200 magnification. We combined the adherent and floating cells and measured their viability by using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle synchronization, cells were arrested at the G1-S phase transition separated by two subsequent thymidine blocks (2 mm thymidine) for 14 h, separated by a period of 10 h without thymidine. Both adherent and nonadherent cells were harvested by trypsinization, and an aliquot of 2 × 106 cells was fixed in ice-cold ethanol for at least 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in propidium iodine (10 μg/ml) solution containing RNase for analysis of DNA content. Data were then collected on a BD Biosciences FACScan, 20,000 events/sample, using Cellquest software. DNA content analysis was performed with Verity ModFit software for the Macintosh computer. Cloning of cDNAs Encoding the Protein Binding with PKB—Using full-length mouse PKB as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of an embryonic mouse complementary DNA library, we isolated 31 clones displaying β-galactosidase activity. Sequencing analysis revealed 10 of the clones with the strongest β-galactosidase activity to be identical. In all cases, 606 bp of the coding region were followed by a 3′-untranslated region. Isolation of the full-length cDNA by phage screening of the mouse embryonic cDNA library and a series of 5′ rapid amplifications of cDNA ends by PCR showed the largest open reading frame to be 5538 bp, which encode a 1845-amino acid protein with a predicted relative molecular mass (Mr) of 212,478 (Fig. 1A, accession number AB087827). By searching several data bases, we found that some mouse clones (BC037020, BC079895, AK129310) and this cDNA to be identical to a mouse homologue of the Kazusa DNA Research Institute clone KIAA1212. This clone is located on mouse chromosome 11 and on human chromosome 2. Although some cDNAs in the data base are presented as “full-length,” it seems that they are not, judging from the size of the protein shown in this study. Our mouse cDNA is very likely to be full-length, and this protein was subsequently shown to enhance the phosphorylation of PKB, such that we designated the clone APE (Akt-phosphorylation enhancer). Protein analysis of APE revealed it to be a hydrophilic protein, and that its N terminus has a significant similarity with the putative coiled coil domain of the myosin heavy chain (Fig. 1B). Tissue Distribution of APE—Northern blot analysis detected a 7.9-kb band of APE messenger RNA in the testis (Fig. 2A). Longer exposure revealed moderate expression in the brain, and low expressions in the spleen and lungs (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Anti-APE antibodies were generated against the three different portions of APE (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting with antibodies against APE, irrespective of the differences in the epitopes of these antibodies (Fig. 1B), identified three bands of 220, 213, and 203 kDa in mouse tissues, whereas the control antibody against GST did not recognize any of these bands (Fig. 2B). The largest band of 220 kDa was observed in the lungs, testis, and fat. The 213-kDa band was detected in the brain, testis, heart, and fat. Finally, the smallest (203-kDa) band was detected in the lungs and spleen. These results were similarly obtained by immunoblotting of either immunoprecipitates of tissue lysates (Fig. 2B, upper panel) or nonimmunoprecipitated lysate (Fig. 2B, lower panel). These results suggest the existence of alternatively spliced protein products from the APE gene because a search of human expressed sequence tag databases indicated the existence of alternatively spliced forms of APE (data not shown). In Vivo Association of PKB and APE—Next, to demonstrate in vivo association between APE and PKB, full-length APE and c-Myc-tagged PKBα were overexpressed in COS-7 cells. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3A, APE was detected in the immunoprecipitate by the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A, upper panel). Similarly, PKB was detected in the anti-APE immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3A, lower panel). This interaction between APE and PKB was demonstrated when both were overexpressed in Sf-9 insect cells or HepG2 cells (data not shown). We also demonstrated an endogenous interaction between PKB and APE by coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins using specific antibodies in HeLa cells, and mouse testis. As shown in Fig. 3B, APE was coimmunoprecipitated by anti-PKB antibody in HeLa cells. PKB was also coimmunoprecipitated by anti-APE-C antibody as shown in the lower panel. The PKB and APE interaction was reconfirmed by the same procedure using mouse testis homogenates (Fig. 3C), indicating that the PKB-APE interaction occurs under physiological conditions. APE Binds to Nonphosphorylated PKB More Efficiently than Phosphorylated PKB—The effect of PKB phosphorylation on the interaction between APE and PKB was assessed by measuring the amount of APE co-immunoprecipitated with PKB in the presence and absence of insulin stimulation (Fig. 3D). Insulin stimulation induced the phosphorylation of PKB on Thr308 and Ser473. The amount of APE co-immunoprecipitated with PKB was revealed to be significantly lower in the insulin-stimulated condition, compared with the unstimulated condition (Fig. 3D, bottom panel). This result suggests that APE has a higher affinity for nonphosphorylated than for phosphorylated PKB. APE Binds to the C-terminal Portion of PKB but Not to Other AGC Kinases—To determine the region of PKB responsible for binding with APE, we generated four deletion mutants consisting of a PH domain, kinase domain, kinase and hydrophobic domain, or the hydrophobic domain in the carboxyl terminus of PKB (16Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). These mutants were subjected to baits in a yeast two hybrid screening with APE. It was revealed that the kinase domain with the hydrophobic motif or the hydrophobic motif alone binds with APE, whereas neither PH nor the kinase domain can bind with APE (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, several deletion mutants of APE were produced to determine the portion responsible for the association with PKB. The C-terminal portion was shown to consist of 200 amino acids of APE, sufficient for the association with PKB. Since the deletion mutant amino acids 101-200 or 1-150 retain the ability to bind PKB, it is likely that the minimal portion necessary for the association with PKB is located within amino acid sequence 101-150 (Fig. 4C). PKB belongs to a family of protein kinases, originally including protein kinase A, cGMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, termed the AGC family. Proteins in this family contain regions of high homology in their kinase domains (1Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since AGC kinases contain regions of high homology with the hydrophobic motif in PKB, we further examined whether APE interacted with AGC kinases other than PKB, using a yeast two-hybrid system. SGK1, SGK2, PKCβ2, PKCϵ, and PKBβ/Akt2 have a kinase domain and a hydrophobic motif highly homologous to those of PKBα. As a result, PKBβ and PKBα bind efficiently to APE in yeast (Fig. 4D). Conversely, very little interaction with APE was observed for SGK1, SGK2, PKCβ2, or PKCϵ. These results indicate that APE is not a common AGC kinase-binding protein but, rather, a PKB-specific binding protein. In Vitro Association between Amino Acids 418-480 of PKB and Amino Acids 1646-1845 of APE—To examine whether the association of APE and PKB occurs in vitro, amino acids 418-480 of PKB and 1646-1845 of APE were expressed using E. coli and then purified. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4E, GST-amino acids 418-480 of mouse PKBα fusion protein bound to His-tagged amino acids 1646-1845 of mouse APE protein, whereas GST alone did not. Similarly, GST-amino acids 1646-1845 of mouse APE fusion protein, but not GST alone, bound to His-tagged amino acids 418-480 of mouse PKBα (Fig. 4E, right panel). These results indicate that the interaction between APE and PKB is direct. APE Markedly Enhances Basal Phosphorylation of PKB—PKBα is activated via phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop of the kinase domain and of Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif of the carboxyl terminus (17Cross D.A.

To test the effect of APE binding on phosphorylation of PKB, basal phosphorylation of endogenous PKBα in COS-7 cells transfected with GFP adenovirus or APE adenovirus was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5A, there was no significant phosphorylation on Thr308 or Ser473 of PKBα after 12-h serum starvation (left lane of Fig. 5A), but Thr308 and Ser473 of endogenous PKB were apparently phosphorylated in cells overexpressing APE. A similar result was obtained for HepG2 cells (data not shown). Pretreatment with pervanadate increased PKB phosphorylation, time-dependently, as reported previously (11Maira S.M. Galetic I. Brazil D.P. Kaech S. Ingley E. Thelen M. Hemmings B.A. Science. 2001; 294: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To explore the effect of APE on enhanced PKBα phosphorylation, we treated COS-7 cells with adenoviruses expressing PKBα and various amounts of APE. APE overexpression increased PKB phosphorylation, in a titer-dependent manner, and the maximal phosphorylation of PKB obtained by APE overexpression was comparable with that achieved by long term pervanadate stimulation (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that APE overexpression can induce essentially maximal phosphorylation of PKB on Thr308 and Ser473, which indicates that APE is an enhancer of PKB in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2017127553,"Newly synthesized MHC II α- and β-chains associated with the invariant chain chaperone (Ii) enter the endocytic pathway for Ii degradation and loading with peptides before transport to the cell surface. It is unclear how αβIi complexes are sorted from the Golgi apparatus and directed to endosomes. However, indirect evidence tends to support direct transport involving the AP1 clathrin adaptor complex. Surprisingly, we show here that knocking down the production of AP1 by RNA interference did not affect the trafficking of αβIi complexes. In contrast, AP2 depletion led to a large increase in surface levels of αβIi complexes, inhibited their rapid internalization, and strongly delayed the appearance of mature MHC II in intracellular compartments. Thus, in the cell systems studied here, rapid internalization of αβIi complexes via an AP2-dependent pathway represents a key step for MHC II delivery to endosomes and lysosomes."

In the present study, expression analysis using cDNA arrays revealed several similarities of virus-induced mouse gliomas with human brain tumors. Brain tumors with short latency contained on average 8.0 retroviral insertions and resembled human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) whereas long-latency gliomas were of lower grade, similar to human oligodendroglioma (OD) and had 2.3 insertions per tumor. Several known and novel genes of tumor progression or cell markers were differentially expressed between OD- and GBM-like tumors. Array and quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated elevated expression similar to Pdgfralpha of retrovirally tagged genes Abhd2, Ddr1, Fos, Ng2, Ppfibp1, Rad51b and Sulf2 in both glioma types compared to neonatal and adult normal brain. The retrovirally tagged genes Plekhb1, Prex1, Prkg2, Sox10 and 1200004M23Rik were upregulated in the tumors but had a different expression profile than Pdgfralpha whereas Rap1gap, Gli1, Neurl and Camk2b were downregulated in the tumors. The present study accentuates the proposed role of the retrovirally tagged genes in PDGF-driven gliomagenesis and indicates that insertional mutagenesis can promote glioma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2120085751,"Type IV pili are cell surface organelles found on many Gram-negative bacteria. They mediate a variety of functions, including adhesion, twitching motility, and competence for DNA uptake. The type IV pilus is a helical polymer of pilin protein subunits and is capable of rapid polymerization or depolymerization, generating large motor forces in the process. Here we show that a specific interaction between the outer membrane secretin PilQ and the type IV pilus fiber can be detected by far-Western analysis and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy of preparations of purified pili, to which the purified PilQ oligomer had been added, showed that PilQ was uniquely located at one end of the pilus fiber, effectively forming a “mallet-type” structure. Determination of the three-dimensional structure of the PilQ-type IV pilus complex at 26-Å resolution showed that the cavity within the protein complex was filled. Comparison with a previously determined structure of PilQ at 12-Å resolution indicated that binding of the pilus fiber induced a dissociation of the “cap” feature and lateral movement of the “arms” of the PilQ oligomer. The results demonstrate that the PilQ structure exhibits a dynamic response to the binding of its transported substrate and suggest that the secretin could play an active role in type IV pilus assembly as well as secretion.

To establish either a commensal or pathogenic relationship with its human host, Neisseria meningitidis develops specific cell-cell contacts and, to this end, exploits a diverse arsenal of adhesive proteins located on the cell surface (1Heckels J.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: S66-S73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Potts W.J. Saunders J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). During tissue colonization many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria display long adhesive fibers, termed type IV pili, from the cell surface that mediate cellular attachment to epithelial tissue receptors (3Giron J.A.

Pili are also involved in several other bacterial processes, including bacterial auto-agglutination (6Swanson J. Kraus S.J. Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 134: 886-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), variation of target tissue specificity (7Jönsson A.B. Ilver D. Falk P. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 403-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and natural competence for DNA uptake (8Zhang Q.Y. Deryckere D. Lauer P. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5366-5370Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 9Frøholm L.O. Jyssum K. Bøvre M. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1973; 81: 525-537Google Scholar). Recent data have demonstrated that type IV pili are retractile and that this retraction process is responsible for twitching motility of neisserial cells on solid and mucosal surfaces (10McBride M.J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 49-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 11Merz A.J. So M. Sheetz M.P. Nature. 2000; 407: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Type IV pili are long (>1–5 μm), thin (60–70 Å), mechanically strong polymeric fibers containing 500–2000 subunits of the major pilin protein, PilE (12Parge H.E. Forest K.T. Hickey M.J. Christensen D.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The assembly of pilin into pili, as well as pilus disassembly, is controlled by a complex interacting apparatus of up to 30 proteins (13Tønjum T. Koomey M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Alm R.A. Mattick J.S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 15Stone K.D. Zhang H.Z. Carlson L.K. Donnenberg M.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which is similar to the apparatus for secretion of proteins of the general (type II) secretory pathway (16Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nunn D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 402-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Prior to pilus assembly PilE is processed through the cytoplasmic membrane by the pre-pilin peptidase PilD, removing a hydrophobic leader peptide and methylating the N-terminal amino acid en route (13Tønjum T. Koomey M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At this stage PilE is located in the periplasm but is thought to remain tethered to the inner membrane by a single transmembrane α-helix located at its N terminus (18Forest K.T. Tainer J.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that this phenomenon creates a “pool” of accessible pilin subunits associated with the inner membrane. Several other neisserial proteins, termed pseudopilins or minor pilins, share homology within their N-terminal regions with the PilE subunit and are also required for correct pilus expression, although they are expressed at low levels compared with PilE (19Aas F.E. Lovold C. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1441-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A number of these minor pilins are thought to be integrated into the growing pilus (20Winther-Larsen H.C. Hegge F.T. Wolfgang M. Hayes S.F. van Putten J.P.M. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15276-15281Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An adhesin protein (PilC) has been shown to bind to the host epithelial receptors CD 46 (21Rudel T. van Putten J.P.M. Gibbs C.P. Haas R. Meyer T.F. Nature. 1995; 373: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and C4B (22Blom A.M. Rytkonen A. Vasquez P. Lindahl G. Dahlback B. Jonsson A.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6764-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PilC also plays a role in the assembly process and a minor pilin, PilV, has been implicated in its functional presentation (20Winther-Larsen H.C. Hegge F.T. Wolfgang M. Hayes S.F. van Putten J.P.M. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15276-15281Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, type IV pilus retraction in Neisseria appears to be regulated by PilC (23Morand P. Bille E. Morelle S. Eugene E. Beretti J. Wolfgang M. Meyer T.F. Koomey M. Nassif X. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2009-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Other essential components for the biogenesis and expression of type IV pili include a cytoplasmic protein, PilF, and a polytopic inner membrane protein, PilG, of unknown functions (24Tønjum T. Freitag N.E. Namork E. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Darzins A. Russell M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PilF, PilT, and PilU contain a consensus ATP binding motif, are homologues of GspE (a member of the AAA chaperone/mechanico-enzyme family) and presumably drive pilus assembly/disassembly by ATP hydrolysis (26Herdendorf T.J. McCasli D.R. Forest K.T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6465-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Maier B. Potter L. So M. Seifert H.S. Sheetz M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16012-16017Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic protein PilT is dispensable for pilus assembly but essential for retraction (28Wolfgang M.H.-S.P. Hayes S.F. van Putten J. P.M. Koomey M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14973-14978Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Despite individual characterization of some of these components, their function and coordinate regulation in pilus assembly, extrusion, and retraction are poorly understood.The branch point between the assembly and retraction of pili through the outer membrane occurs at the PilQ oligomer. PilQ is an antigenically conserved, abundant outer membrane protein that is essential for meningococcal pilus expression (29Tønjum T. Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is a member of the general secretory pathway secretin superfamily, members of which translocate a variety of macromolecules across the outer membrane (16Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tønjum T. Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Bitter W. Koster M. Latjinhouwers M. de Cock H. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Double knock-out mutants of pilT and pilQ form long, membrane-covered pilus-like structures that fill the periplasm (31Wolfgang M. van Putten J.P.M. Hayes S.F. Dorward D. Koomey M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PilQ subunits form a heat- and SDS-stable complex, which requires the PilP lipoprotein for functional oligomer assembly (32Drake S. Sandstedt S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of neisserial PilQ contains two to seven copies of unique octapeptides, termed small basic repeats (29Tønjum T. Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The outer membrane protein Omp85 has also been shown to affect the assembly of the PilQ oligomer into the outer membrane (33Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Images of isolated bacterial secretins have been recorded by transmission electron microscopy, and “donut-like” ring projections surrounding a central cavity have been observed (34Bitter W.

Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tonjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, more recently, at the higher resolution of 12 Å using cryo-negative stain (37Collins R.F. Frye S.A. Kitmitto A. Ford R.C. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39750-39756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The structure is dominated by a large central cavity, which is closed at both ends by “plug” and “cap” features, and four “arm-like” features, which form the sides. The PilQ oligomer exhibits 4-fold rotational symmetry with 12-fold quasi-symmetry (37Collins R.F. Frye S.A. Kitmitto A. Ford R.C. Tønjum T. Derrick J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39750-39756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is hard to rationalize this unusual structure as a passive pore within the outer membrane, acting as a conduit for a pilus fiber already assembled in the periplasm. We demonstrate here that type IV pili, purified from meningococci, spontaneously interact with the meningococcal PilQ oligomer in a highly specific fashion. Substantial conformational changes occur in the cap and arm portions of the PilQ oligomer upon association with type IV pili. These findings suggest that PilQ does not function solely as a passive pore for passage of pili through the outer membrane but is capable of a dynamic response upon interaction with the secreted substrate.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Constructs—Meningococcal strain M1080 was grown overnight on 5% blood agar in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 before harvesting. The fragments encoding the full-length, N-terminal and central portions of the PilQ gene were cloned into the vector pQE-30 (Qiagen, Germany), and the C-terminal portion of the pilQ gene was cloned into vector pET28-b(+) (Novagen). Both vectors encode a polyhistidine tag. All proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 (New England Biolabs) (see Table I). The recombinant PilQ proteins were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and were subsequently solubilized using 8 m urea in phosphate-buffered saline. The recombinant proteins were affinity-purified using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Germany) under denaturing conditions in 8 m urea. After immediate buffer exchange on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) into 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), the proteins were purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) before dialysis against 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5). The recombinant OpaD and HmbR proteins from N. meningitidis strain MC58 were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, solubilized with 6 m guanidine HCl, refolded by rapid dilution, and purified by ion exchange and size exclusion chromatography. Recombinant OpcA was obtained as described previously (38Prince S.M. Feron C. Janssens D. Lobet Y. Achtman M. Kusecek B. Bullough P.A. Derrick J.P.

For the generation of PilQ histidine-tagged in the N-terminal small basic repeat region, splicing by overlapping extension PCR and non-selective transformation of the PCR product into N. meningitidis strain M1080 were employed. The native histidine tag PilQ oligomer was isolated from meningococcal outer membranes as previously described (36Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Kitmitto A. Olsen R. Tonjum T. Derrick J.P. J.

Meningococcal cells derived from four heavily streaked Petri dishes were vortexed for 1 min in 10 ml of 0.15 m ethanolamine buffer (pH 10.5), and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Pilus fibers were precipitated at room temperature for 30 min by addition of onetenth volume of ammonium sulfate-saturated 0.15 m ethanolamine buffer and collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Pili were subsequently washed twice with 50 mm Tris-buffered saline.SDS-PAGE and Far-Western Assay—1–2 μg of the purified recombinant PilQ proteins, purified native type IV pilus fibers, neisserial outer membrane proteins (OpaD, OpcA, and HmbR), and BSA were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Amersham Biosciences) in blotting buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.9). For the far-Western analysis, the membrane was briefly washed twice with cold renaturing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% BSA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5), and the proteins were renatured by overnight incubation at 4 °C in the same buffer. For the detection of type IV pilus fiber binding to PilQ fragments, the membrane was incubated for 3 h with purified pilus fibers in renaturing buffer and washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) (41Fouassier L.

The pilus fiber-overlaid membrane was then exposed to anti-PilE polyclonal rabbit antiserum at a dilution of 1:1000. For immunoblotting of purified protein, anti-PilQ and type IV pilus-specific rabbit polyclonal antisera were used at dilutions of 1:2000 and 1:1000, respectively. Procedures for SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and antisera production have been described previously (24Tønjum T. Freitag N.E. Namork E. Koomey M. Mol.

For the detection of PilQ fragments binding to PilE from type IV pilus fibers, the membrane was incubated for 3 h with purified PilQ fragments and exposed to anti-PilQ polyclonal rabbit antiserum at a dilution of 1:1000.Density Gradient Centrifugation—Sucrose density gradients were performed as described by Pugsley and Possot (42Pugsley A.P. Possot O. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gradients with a final volume of 12 ml were prepared with a Hoefer SG 50 gradient maker by using sucrose concentrations of 60 and 28% (w/v), respectively, in Tris/EDTA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). 20 μg of the PilQ oligomer, purified as described above, with or without type IV pilus fibers or control proteins (purified OpaD or BSA), was mixed in Tris/EDTA buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min in 200-μl final volume. The samples were applied to the top of the gradients and centrifuged for 18 h at 4 °C and 245,000 × g. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradients and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit anti-PilQ and anti-type IV pilus antisera. Parts of these fractions were also subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection using anti-PilQ and anti-PilE antisera. Anti-rabbit IgG, coupled with alkaline phosphatase, was employed as the secondary antibody and detected using para-nitrophenylphosphate as a substrate. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity was measured from absorption at 405 nm in a Wallac Victor2 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sucrose concentration was determined from the refractive index (Rf) of corresponding gradient fractions measured with a refractometer from Precision Instruments (Bellingham and Stanley, London, UK).Formation of PilQ-Type IV Pilus Fiber Complex and Sample Preparation for TEM—5-μl samples of PilQ oligomer (100 μg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) Zwittergent 3–10) were incubated with 5-μl samples of pilus fibers (100 μg/ml) for 30–60 min at room temperature. 10-μl aliquots of the PilQ oligomerpilus fiber incubation were adsorbed to freshly glow discharged carboncoated copper grids (No. 400) prior to negative staining.2-D Image Analysis of Type IV Pili—Non-overlapping lengths of type IV pili were selected into 200-Å2 boxes (43Mu X.Q. Egelman E.H. Bullitt E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the resulting single particles were translationally and rotationally aligned using referencefree algorithms as implemented in SPIDER (44Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). Aligned particles (n = 2906) were grouped using correspondence analysis and hierarchical descendant clustering, and a 2-D projection map was generated from the major class average (n = 450). The helical pitch of fibers was determined by boxing out areas of long and straight pili from high contrast CTF-corrected micrographs recorded at 3- to 4-μm defocus. These data were then used to generate fast Fourier transforms in the 2-D crystallographic package CRISP (45Hovmoller S. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 41: 121-135Crossref Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The resulting fast Fourier transforms were noisy because of the inherent low contrast of pilus fibers, but a characteristic helical cross-diffraction pattern and first order layer lines could be indexed (46Hahn E. Wild P. Schraner E.M. Bertschinger H.U. Haner M. Muller S.A. Aebi U. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) allowing the range of helical pitch of the pili to be determined.Negative Staining—Samples were adsorbed to freshly glow discharged carbon-coated grids (No. 300–400) as previously described (64Holzenburg A. Shepherd F.H. Ford R.C. Micron. 1994; 25: 447-451Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Grids were placed carbon film downward on 10-μl droplets of complexed sample or PilQ (∼100 μg/ml) for 2–3 min. Grids were then immediately placed on a 10-μl droplet of 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate or a 10-μl droplet of 6% (w/v) ammonium molybdate (pH 6.8)/1% (w/v) trehalose for 30 s and then briefly blotted onto double-layered Whatman 50 filter paper.Ni-NTA-Gold Labeling—PilQ-type IV pilus complexes were prepared as described above. 20 μl of the PilQ-type IV pilus complex was incubated with 3.3 μl (1 nm) of Ni-NTA-nanogold (Nanoprobes) for 18 h at room temperature. Samples were then negatively stained with 6% (w/v) ammonium molybdate (pH 6.8)/1% (w/v) trehalose.Image Analysis and Volume Calculations of the PilQ-Type IV Pilus Complex Using Negative Stain and the Random Conical Tilt Method—Table II summarizes all additional information pertinent to TEM low dose data collection, micrograph scanning, and volume back projection used in this study. The PilQ oligomer was found to interact with pili of different fiber lengths, and, as with free pili, we observed that there was an intrinsic tendency for fibers to bend along their length. To calculate an accurate 3-D structure of the PilQ-type IV pilus complex, allowance was made for the bending observed along the pilus fiber length by treating the complex as a single particle, selected into a box 342 × 342 Å, with a determined center at the PilQ-pilus interface. The CTF of each micrograph was examined, and appropriate CTF phase corrections were applied to the entire particle data-set. Aligned particles were grouped using correspondence analysis and hierarchical ascendant classification, and a 2-D projection map was generated from the major class average. 3-D volumes of interacting PilQ-pilus complexes were subsequently calculated using the random conical reconstruction method (47Frank J.

Caugant D.A. Dunham S.A. Koomey M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but has not been shown to form a direct interaction with its secreted substrate. We employed far-Western analysis to assess the association between purified type IV pili and recombinant fragments of PilQ, which covered the N-terminal, central, and C-terminal portions of the protein (Fig. 1A and Table I). The binding of three other neisserial outer membrane proteins to type IV pili were also examined as controls, specifically the adhesins OpcA and OpaD, and the heme receptor HmbR. For the far-Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, gel a), the membrane was probed with pilus protein before detection with polyclonal anti-PilE antibody. A clear interaction of PilE with full-length PilQ was apparent (lane 2), and interactions with the N- and C-terminal fragments were also evident (lanes 3 and 5) (Fig. 1B, gel a). However, no PilE binding was found to the central portion of PilQ (lane 4) or to the control proteins OpcA, OpaD, HmbR, and bovine serum albumin (lanes 6–9). For the far-Western analysis, denatured PilQ fragments in the SDS-PAGE gel were blotted onto the supporting membrane and a “renaturation” step was introduced, which involved incubating the membrane overnight. When the experiment was repeated without this renaturation step the PilQ-pilus interaction was much weaker, suggesting that the conformation adopted by the PilQ protei"

Such modifications may directly affect major histocompatibility complex-restricted T cell recognition of processed peptides or may perturb the processing events that generate such peptides. Using the tetanus toxin C fragment protein as a test case, we show that spontaneous deamidation of asparagine residues interferes with processing by the enzyme asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) and contributes to diminished antigen presentation. Deamidation inhibits AEP action either directly, when asparagine residues targeted by AEP are modified, or indirectly, when adjacent Asn residues are deamidated. Thus, deamidation of long-lived self-proteins may qualitatively or quantitatively affect the spectrum of self-peptides displayed to T cells and may thereby contribute to the onset or exacerbation of autoimmune disease.

Asparagine deamidation is the most common spontaneous post-translational protein modification and is increasingly recognized as having an important impact on protein function. For example, a recent study demonstrated that the DNA-damaging antineoplastic drug cisplatin induced the deamidation of two asparagine residues in a flexible loop of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, preventing its interaction with other proapoptotic Bcl family members and thereby inducing apoptosis (1Deverman B.E.

Immune recognition of proteins and peptides can also be affected by deamidation/isomerization of asparagine and glutamine residues. For example, T cells have been described that specifically recognize peptides containing asparagine residues that have either cyclized (5Chen W. Ede N.J. Jackson D.C. McCluskey J. Purcell A.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1000-1005PubMed Google Scholar) or become deamidated to aspartic acid (6Cirrito T.P. Pu Z. Deck M.B. Unanue E.R. J. Exp.

Med. 2001; 193: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As has been pointed out (8Doyle H.A. Mamula M.J. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the appearance of such modifications in “self”-proteins may disturb the delicate balance that the immune system establishes between tolerance to self-proteins on the one hand but an ability to respond to foreign entities on the other. For example, mice showed no response to unmodified forms of a self-cytochrome c peptide (90-104) or to a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein D peptide (65-79) but developed strong T and B cell responses to forms of these peptides in which a single Asp residue had been modified to iso-Asp (9Mamula M.J.

Importantly, the B cell response to the iso-Asp containing peptide cross-reacted with the native protein, suggesting a plausible chain of events initiated by post-translational protein modification that may lead to autoreactivity. In the case of α-gliadin, a single glutamine residue, likely deamidated as a result of tissue transglutaminase action, is found in two overlapping T cell epitopes recognized by T cells from human leukocyte antigen-DQ2-positive celiac disease patients (10Molberg O.

Proteolytic processing reactions are required before T cell epitopes are captured and displayed on major histocompatibility complex molecules. In the class II major histocompatibility complex pathway, a number of endosomal/lysosomal processing enzymes participate in these reactions (12Watts C. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), including a cysteine protease known as asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) or legumain that is highly specific for cleavage at Asn residues (13Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The identification of this enzyme raised the possibility that asparagine deamidation may additionally affect T cell recognition of proteins indirectly, by influencing the processing reactions that generate T cell epitopes. Using the tetanus toxin C fragment (TTCF) antigen as a test case, we explore this possibility here and demonstrate that spontaneous Asn deamidation readily occurs and that this can influence antigen processing and presentation. TTCF and TTCF Mutants—The TTCF, incorporating a hexa-histidine tag, was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified using nickel-agarose as described (15Hewitt E.W. Treumann A. Morrice N. Tatnell P.J. Kay J. Watts C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4693-4699PubMed Google Scholar). Single point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions. Asn-1183 was mutated to Asp using the following mutagenic PCR primers: forward, 5′-CAA ACG CTA CAC TCC GGA CAA CGA AAT CGA TTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAA TCG ATT TCG TTG TCC GGA GTG TAG CGT TTG-3′. Peptides—TTCF peptides comprising residues 1178-1191 of the tetanus toxin sequence (KRYTPNNEIDSFVK, KRYTPDNEIDSFVK, KRYTPiso-DNEIDSFVK) were synthesized by N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) biochemistry by Dr. Graham Bloomberg at the University of Bristol. Residue 1183 is highlighted in bold. Deamidation of TTCF—To permit spontaneous deamidation of TTCF, the protein was filter-sterilized and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for 4-6 weeks at 37 °C (TTCF37). A control sample was incubated in parallel at 4 °C (TTCF4). Proteolytic Cleavage of TTCF by AEP—TTCF (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C with 10 mU/ml recombinant human AEP (prepared as described (17Li D.N. Matthews S.P. Antoniou A.N. Mazzeo D. Watts C. J.

At timed intervals, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm iodoacetamide. For pepsin digestions, TTCF (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 5 mU/ml pepsin (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0, 4 m urea. Proteolytic peptides were visualized on 12% Tris-Tricine SDS gels. Measurement of Iso-Aspartic Acid in TTCF—Iso-aspartyl residues were detected using the ISOQUANT™ protein deamidation detection kit (Promega Corp. Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, TTCF was incubated for 30 min with protein isoaspartyl methyl transferase and S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The formation of the methylation byproduct, S-adenosyl homocysteine, was detected by reversed phase HPLC. An S-adenosyl homocysteine standard curve was generated by calculating the area of the S-adenosyl homocysteine peak and used to estimate levels of iso-aspartic acid in unknown samples. Cell Lines and Media—T cell hybridomas specific for TTCF were generated as described (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C.

The hybridoma specificities have been defined as follows: 1H3 recognizes amino acids 1145-1161, 1H3 and 4E4 recognize amino acids 950-966, and 5B12 recognizes amino acids 900-915 (18West M.A. Wallin R.P.A.

The murine B cell line LB27.4 was maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml kanamycin, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. T Cell Assays—In antigen titration assays, TTCF was added at the indicated concentrations to wells containing 1 × 105 antigen-presenting cells, together with 1 × 105 hybridomas. Assays were done in duplicate or triplicate in 96-well U-bottomed plates. After 24 h, the supernatants were removed, and the amount of IL-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a mouse IL-2 OptEIA set (Pharmingen). In kinetic assays, antigen-presenting cells were incubated at 0.5-1 × 107/ml with 50 μg/ml TTCF. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points, fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 45 s, and quenched with 0.1 m glycine. Fixed cells (1 × 105/well) were added to an equivalent number of hybridomas, and the released IL-2 was measured after 24 h. Chromatography—Preparative and analytical chromatography was done on a SMART HPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Cation exchange analysis of TTCF4 and TTCF37 was done using a Mini S 3.2/3 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, over a0-1 m NaCl gradient. Reversed phase chromatography was done on a C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) over a gradient ranging from 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Mass Spectrometry—TTCF was digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w). Tryptic peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge. HPLC fractions were analyzed individually on a Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer. 1 μl of each crude peptide fraction was mixed with 1 μl of matrix (5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 48% water, 2% ammonium di-citrate) on a stainless steel MALDI plate and allowed to crystallize at room temperature. Fractions were analyzed individually on a Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer. Positive ion MS spectra were acquired in reflectron mode. The extraction delay time was 180 ns, and the acceleration voltage set at 20 kV. Spectra were calibrated using an external standard. Whole tryptic TTCF digests derived from native and deamidated samples were analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS analysis. The Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer was used to determine the sites of deamidation. 1 μl from each digest was spotted onto a stainless steel MALDI target plate and allowed to dry. 1 μl of matrix was added to each digest sample and allowed to co-crystallize. Positive ion MS spectra were acquired in reflectron mode for each digest. Peptides 1214-1223 (DGNAFNNLDR) and 1179-1191 (YTPNNEIDSFVK) were sequenced by tandem MS analysis to determine the site of deamidation. “Aged” Tetanus Toxin C Fragment Resists AEP Digestion—We have shown previously that processing of TTCF is initiated by the asparagine-specific endopeptidase AEP and that glycosylation of target Asn residues or mutagenesis to Gln drastically inhibits AEP action (14Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Asparagine deamidation, which leads to the generation of aspartic or iso-aspartic acid (19Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), might also be expected to reduce the efficiency of AEP action. Using TTCF as a model antigen, we first tested whether spontaneous asparagine deamidation occurred in this protein and whether processing by AEP was affected. Aliquots of recombinant TTCF, dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, were stored either at 4 °C or at 37° for 4-6 weeks. No precipitation or autodigestion occurred, and the concentration of protein was the same at the end of the incubation period. The protein was then subjected to digestion with purified AEP, and the products were analyzed on 12% SDS gels. As shown previously (14Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), a discrete set of digestion products is observed following cleavage at Asn residues 873, 1184, and 1219. Intact TTCF37 still persisted after 5 h of digestion, whereas TTCF4 was completely digested after 2-3 h of processing (Fig. 1A). At higher levels of AEP, additional Asn residues in TTCF are targeted. 2C. X. Moss, unpublished data. Peptides generated from cleavage by AEP at these minor sites were more prevalent in a digest of TTCF37, providing further evidence that aging TTCF perturbed the normal pattern of proteolytic degradation. Since asparagine deamidation leads to a net increase in negative charge and a gain of 1 mass unit, protein and peptide deamidation can be readily detected. Deamidation of Asn generates a mixture of Asp and iso-Asp, with l-iso-Asp comprising 60-80% (19Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an additional diagnostic for deamidation is quantitation of iso-aspartic acid using the enzyme protein-l-iso-aspartate O-methyltransferase, which methylates the unusual α-carboxylic acid group on iso-aspartic acid. As shown in Fig. 1B, TTCF37 eluted from a cation exchange column before TTCF4, consistent with the former having gained net negative charge as a result of deamidation. In addition, direct analysis of iso-aspartic acid content showed that TTCF4 contained 1.08 mol of iso-Asp/mol of TTCF, whereas TTCF37 contained 3.56 mol/mol, a 3.3-fold increase. Thus, TTCF stored at 37 °C undergoes spontaneous deamidation and becomes more resistant to digestion by AEP. To address the possibility that other post-translational modifications were introduced into TTCF during the aging process, we examined the degradation of TTCF by other proteolytic or chemical agents. As pepsin prefers to cleave between pairs of hydrophobic residues, we predicted that deamidation of Asn would have no effect on substrate cleavage. As shown in Fig. 1C, pepsin degraded both TTCF37 and TTCF4. There was no significant difference in either the kinetics of degradation or in the pattern of fragments generated. In addition, both TTCF37 and TTCF4 were equally good substrates for CNBr digestion (data not shown), suggesting that methionine oxidation had not occurred to a significant extent. Taken together, these data indicate that the in vitro aging process did not grossly affect the susceptibility of TTCF to proteolytic or chemical processing. Asparagine Residues at and Adjacent to AEP Cleavage Sites Are Deamidated in TTCF37—To establish whether AEP processing sites had become deamidated in TTCF37, we subjected TTCF4 and TTCF37 samples to tryptic digestion and resolved the peptide products by reversed phase-HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). Individual fractions were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. We identified two tryptic peptides with an isotopic distribution consistent with a proportion of the peptide having gained 1 mass unit. Interestingly, these were peptides containing AEP cleavage sites 1184 and 1219. As shown in Fig. 2A, the most abundant isotope for peptide 1214-1223 (DGNAFNNLDR) was the monoisotopic mass 1135.51 Da for TTCF4, but for TTCF37, the second isotopic mass of 1136.51 Da was the most abundant. Similarly, the isotopic distribution for peptide 1179-1191 (YTPPNNEIDSFVK) shifted upwards by one unit to 1427.68 Da. Although each peptide contains two adjacent Asn residues, AEP only cleaves at one site in each peptide (14Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), illustrating that Asn sequence context plays an important, but as yet poorly understood, role in determining AEP target sites (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Dando P.M. Fortunato M. Smith L. Knight C.G. McKendrick J.E. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine which Asn residue(s) had become deamidated, we sequenced each peptide using a MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS instrument. Inspection of the mass profile for each fragment ion generated from TTCF37 allowed us to identify the Asn residue that had become deamidated. As shown in Fig. 2B, the analysis for the 1214-1223 peptide demonstrated that residue 1219, which is the first of the paired Asn residues, had become converted to Asp/iso-Asp. When the analysis was performed for the 1179-1191 peptide, it was once again the first Asn residue of the pair (Asn-1183) that had become deamidated. No evidence was found for deamidation of Asn-1184, which is the AEP target in this region of TTCF (14Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, we find evidence for deamidation in two regions of the TTCF molecule targeted by AEP. In one, the Asn cleaved by AEP is deamidated. In the other, an Asn residue immediately adjacent to an AEP cleavage site is similarly modified. Altered Presentation of Deamidated TTCF—Processing by AEP, particularly at Asn-1219, is required for optimal presentation of most T cell epitopes in TTCF (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We therefore tested TTCF4 and TTCF37 in antigen presentation assays. For this, we used a panel of murine T cell hybridomas that recognize different epitopes in the TTCF antigen. We found no evidence for deamidation of Asn residues lying within these T cell epitopes; therefore, any effects are likely to be due to antigen uptake and/or processing rather than to the presentation of altered peptide ligands. We found that TTCF37 was much less efficient than TTCF4 in generating a T cell response in all hybridomas tested (Fig. 3), consistent with diminished processing of TTCF37. However, we were surprised by the magnitude of the inhibitory effect, which was greater than that obtained by mutagenesis of key AEP cleavage sites (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that deamidation and/or some other event occurring during aging was affecting not only processing of TTCF but some other parameter, for example, the efficiency of its uptake into antigen-presenting cells. TTCF37 Is Taken Up Less Efficiently by Antigen-presenting Cells—To investigate the possibility that TTCF37 was taken up less efficiently by antigen-presenting cells, we labeled TTCF and directly monitored the level of cell association. TTCF4 and TTCF37 were biotinylated, and the amount of biotin incorporated was shown to be equivalent in each case (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). When both forms of antigen were incubated with splenocytes (Fig. 4A), less Bi-TTCF37 was found associated with splenocytes at all time points when compared with Bi-TTCF4. This difference was evident even on cells incubated with Bi-TTCF4 or Bi-TTCF37 at 4 °C, indicating differential binding of the two TTCF forms to the cell surface. Although this differential association does not necessarily reflect the relative levels of TTCF4 and TTCF37 that are actually taken up and processed, it clearly indicates that diminished presentation of TTCF37 to T cells is likely to be due in part to weaker association with splenocytes when compared with TTCF4. Diminished AEP Processing Also Inhibits Presentation—We next asked whether the deficit in TTCF37 presentation was due to reduced processing by AEP in addition to diminished uptake. To address this, we needed to ensure that equal amounts of TTCF4 and TTC37 were taken up by cells, and we achieved this by using FcR-mediated uptake. Cells were provided with low concentrations of antigen, together with the TTCF-specific monoclonal antibodies 9B4 or 10G5. These antibodies bind equally well to both TTCF4 and TTCF37 as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cell association of the two TTCF forms was now virtually equivalent (data not shown). As expected, inclusion of either antibody boosted presentation, indicating that the endocytic route was FcR-mediated (Fig. 4B). However, even under these conditions of comparable antigen association with cells, presentation of TTCF37 was markedly worse than TTCF4 (Fig. 4B). Thus, both reduced uptake and altered processing seem to contribute to the deficiency in presentation of peptides from TTCF37. Asp but Not Iso-Asp Is Tolerated Adjacent to the Asn-1184 AEP Cleavage Site—Although our earlier studies demonstrated that Asn-1219 was the most important AEP cleavage site for maximal presentation efficiency, mutagenesis of Asn-1184 also had a measurable deleterious effect on presentation to different T cell clones and hybridomas (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) 2C. X. Moss, unpublished data.. We therefore asked whether deamidation of the adjacent residue 1183 might indirectly affect AEP processing at Asn-1184 and therefore contribute to the overall deficit in presentation of TTCF37. Mutation of Asn-1183 to Asp had little effect on in vitro digestion by AEP (Fig. 5A) nor on presentation of TTCF (Fig. 5B). However, natural Asn deamidation generates more iso-Asp relative to Asp. Because this induces a change in the conformation of the polypeptide chain, we reasoned that this might have a more profound effect on AEP cleavage at the adjacent (1184) Asn residue. To test this, we performed AEP digestions on synthetic peptides encompassing residues 1178-1191 of TTCF, which includes the 1184 cleavage site. We included Asn, Asp, or iso-Asp at position 1183. As shown in Fig. 5C, the time course of digestion of the Asn-1183 and Asp-1183 peptides was comparable, consistent with the modest effect when this mutation was expressed in TTCF protein. However, the presence of iso-Asp at 1183 markedly reduced the efficiency of digestion of the peptide. After 4 h of digestion, almost 60% of this peptide remained when compared with 10% of the wild type or 1183Asp peptides (Fig. 5B). Thus, it seems likely that at least three factors contribute to diminished presentation of TTCF37: reduced uptake, direct modification of the AEP cleavage site at Asn-1219, and indirect modification of the site at 1184 as a result of iso-Asp generation at 1183 (Fig. 6).Fig. 6TTCF structure and the location of deamidated AEP processing sites. The locations of AEP sites Asn-1184 and Asn-1219 are shown as ball-and-stick features on a ribbon model of TTCF. Deamidation occurs at Asn residues 1219 and 1183 (asterisked). Sequences surrounding the AEP cleavage sites and deamidated Asn residues are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Here we demonstrate a distinct and novel effect of deamidation on T cell recognition of a protein antigen due, at least in part, to altered antigen processing. Our experiments were prompted by our recent studies on the asparagine-specific endopeptidase AEP (or legumain) found in human and murine APCs (21Watts C. Moss C.X. Mazzeo D. West M.A. Matthews S.P. Li D.N. Manoury B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 987: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mammalian AEP or legumain is found in diverse cells and tissues including human and murine antigen-presenting cells (13Chen J.M. Dando P.M. Rawlings N.D. Brown M.A. Young N.E. Stevens R.A. Hewitt E. Watts C. Barrett A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8090-8098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It contributes to productive processing of antigens such as tetanus toxin and is one of the proteases that initiates removal of the invariant chain chaperone, which guides early class II major histocompatibility complex biosynthetic events (14Manoury B. Hewitt E.W. Morrice N. Dando P.M. Barrett A.J. Watts C. Nature. 1998; 396: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 22Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Li D.N. Billson J. Loak K. Benaroch P. Watts C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We found evidence for deamidation of a key AEP processing site (Asn-1219) and evidence that a second site (Asn-1184) was indirectly affected by deamidation and β-isomerization of a neighboring Asn residue (Fig. 6). Deamidation altered the pattern of TTCF processing by AEP and suppressed presentation of different T cell epitopes in TTCF, consistent with our earlier studies on mutagenesis of key AEP processing sites (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, reduced uptake of TTCF37 also contributed to its poor presentation when compared with TTCF4. The reasons for this are not yet fully understood. The overall net increase in negative charge that accompanies conversion of Asn to Asp/iso-Asp (Fig. 1) may diminish binding given that the cell surface is also negatively charged. However, a mutant form of TTCF in which Asn-1183 and-1219 were changed to Asp was taken up equally well by cells (data not shown). However, it is also possible that deamidation of additional Asn residues in TTCF inhibits more specific interactions than TTCF makes with cells. For example, TTCF is known to bind gangliosides as well as other receptor structures on neuronal and possibly other cells (23Fotinou C. Emsley P. Black I. Ando H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Sinha K.A. Fairweather N.F. Isaacs N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32274-32281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Herreros J. Lalli G. Schiavo G. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although we were not able to identify modifications other than Asn deamidation, it remains a possibility that other modifications could have been introduced during in vitro aging and may contribute to the altered cell association of TTCF37. By complexing TTCF4 and TTCF37 with anti-TTCF antibodies that then drive uptake via Fc receptors, we could largely eliminate differential uptake of TTCF4 and TTCF37 (see also Ref. 16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Even under these conditions, presentation of TTCF37 was significantly worse than TTCF4 due, we suggest, to deamidated AEP processing sites. In the case of the TTCF antigen, we did not observe instances of enhanced T cell epitope presentation as a result of Asn deamidation because of diminished uptake and presumably because AEP action on TTCF is required to initiate processing and is the first step for optimal presentation of most T cell epitopes (16Antoniou A.N. Blackwood S.L. Mazzeo D. Watts C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that loss of processing sites (for AEP or other enzymes) as a result of post-translational protein modifications might enhance the presentation of T cell epitopes in other antigens/autoantigens. This idea is supported by recent evidence that proteolytic processing reactions, for both class I and class II major histocompatibility complex epitopes, can be destructive as well as productive (25Beck H. Schwarz G. Schroter C.J. Deeg M. Baier D. Stevanovic S. Weber E. Driessen C. Kalbacher H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3726-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Fugger L. Viner N. Ponsford M. Streeter H. Mazza G. Wraith D.C. Watts C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Saric T. Beninga J. Graef C.I. Akopian T.N. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36474-36481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An example of this, which also illustrates how direct and indirect effects of Asn deamidation on immune recognition can be linked, is seen in the case of another AEP substrate, myelin basic protein (MBP). A T cell epitope lying between residues 85-99 in MBP is destroyed by AEP cleavage at Asn-94 (25Beck H. Schwarz G. Schroter C.J. Deeg M. Baier D. Stevanovic S. Weber E. Driessen C. Kalbacher H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3726-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Fugger L. Viner N. Ponsford M. Streeter H. Mazza G. Wraith D.C. Watts C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We have shown that presentation of this peptide to MBP-specific T cells is inversely proportional to AEP activity and have suggested that T cells specific for this region of MBP escape tolerization in the thymus because of this destructive processing reaction (26Manoury B. Mazzeo D. Fugger L. Viner N. Ponsford M. Streeter H. Mazza G. Wraith D.C. Watts C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Deamidation of Asn-94 would eliminate a dominant AEP processing site in MBP, allowing survival of the 85-99 peptide with a change to Asp or iso-Asp in position 94, which might appear foreign to the immune system. T cell reactivity to MBP85-99 is thought to be important in the inflammatory reactions that occur in multiple sclerosis, and some (although not all) T cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients that are specific for MBP 85-99 are able to recognize Asp in position 94 (28Wucherpfennig K.W. Strominger J.L. Cell. 1995; 80: 695-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). However, at this point, this scenario is speculative, and our initial attempts to demonstrate deamidation of Asn-94 in the MBP 85-99 peptide over the short time scales used in our TTCF studies have not been successful. Rates of deamidation of asparagine residues are dependent on a number of variables, among them the amino acid residue C-terminal to the Asn and the conformational flexibility of the polypeptide chain in that region. Although the slow turnover of MBP would in principle allow deamidated Asn residues to accumulate over time, the residue that follows Asn-94 in MBP, Ile-95, is not optimal for deamidation of Asn-94 (29Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Robinson N.E. Robinson Z.W. Robinson B.R. Robinson A.L. Robinson J.A. Robinson M.L. Robinson A.B. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it remains an intriguing possibility that deamidation of Asn-94 occurs in MBP over longer time scales and that this contributes to the autoreactivity to this protein seen in multiple sclerosis. In TTCF, we found that two different surface loops, each containing a pair of Asn residues, were deamidated on the first Asn of the pair (Fig. 6). The most comprehensive studies on rates of Asn deamidation did not include a second Asn as the C-terminal residue (presumably because of its own potential instability), but Asp, although not optimal, was permissible (29Robinson N.E. Robinson A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 30Robinson N.E. Robinson Z.W. Robinson B.R. Robinson A.L. Robinson J.A. Robinson M.L. Robinson A.B. J. Pept. Res. 2004; 63: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The structure of the TTCF antigen shows that the loop containing Asn-1183/-1844 is exceptionally exposed and might be expected to be flexible in solution (31Umland T.C. Wingert L.M. Swaminathan S. Furey W.F. Schmidt J.J. Sax M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 788-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 32Emsley P. Fotinou C. Black I. Fairweather N.F. Charles I.G. Watts C. Hewitt E. Isaacs N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8889-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). It is interesting to speculate that loss of AEP sites as a result of deamidation might concomitantly generate new sites for proteases specific for Asp in the P1 position. The caspases are Asp-specific proteases, although the distinct compartmental localizations of AEP (endosomes/lysosomes) and caspases (cytosol) might rule out their involvement. Another Asp-specific protease is granzyme B found in the cytolytic granules of T and NK cells. Interestingly, Casciola-Rosen et al. (33Casciola-Rosen L. Andrade F. Ulanet D. Wong W.B. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that granzyme B generates unique fragments from many known and putative human autoantigens. They propose that by so doing granzyme B action, for example, on apoptotic cell debris, might trigger an autoreactive response. They propose that sensitivity to granzyme B (but not to caspase 8, which has similar specificity) is a hallmark of candidate autoantigens. If this hypothesis is correct, it is interesting to speculate that Asn deamidation might produce new granzyme B substrates and that this might be a further connection between Asn deamidation and autoreactivity. In summary, extrapolating from the example of tetanus toxin, we speculate that long-lived self-proteins, the Asn residues of which become spontaneously deamidated, may be differently processed by AEP when compared with their younger, and in particular their thymically expressed, counterparts. Post-translational modifications to proteins constitute a potential hazard to immune tolerance because there is no certainty that a particular modification will be represented in the protein substrate “mix” available for thymic antigen presentation. Differential processing of self-proteins, between the thymus, where central tolerance is established, and peripheral tissues, is thought to be one of the factors that create permissive conditions for induction and/or maintenance of autoimmune disease (8Doyle H.A.

Immunol. 1993; 11: 729-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Finally, our results, and earlier results reporting that storage of peptides led to distinct immune recognition patterns as a result of deamidation (5Chen W. Ede N.J. Jackson D.C. McCluskey J. Purcell A.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1000-1005PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cirrito T.P. Pu Z. Deck M.B. Unanue E.R. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1165-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7McAdam S.N.

We tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-then-reoxygenation represent a stress for hematopoietic progenitor cells.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage is well known to cause loss of cell replication and multiple molecular changes involved in premature senescence, such as up-regulation of senescence-associated proteins p53, p21WAF1, and p16INK4A and permanent growth arrest (6Chen Q.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Little is known about the effects of reoxygenation-generated oxidative stress on the survival and maintenance hematopoietic progenitor and stem (HSC) cells. Studies on pathophysiological mechanisms of oxidative stress responses in stem cell diseases such as aplastic anemia has been very instructive and provides insights into the function of normal hematopoietic stem cells and their self-renewal capacity (7Maciejewski J.P. Risitano A. Arch. Med. Res. 2003; 34: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One of the well studied AA disease models is Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and a predisposition to cancer (8Bagby Jr., G.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 9D'Andrea A.D. Grompe M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that hypoxia-reoxygenation represents a physiological stress for HSC and progenitor cells, particularly those from FA patients, and sought to determine the molecular response of hematopoietic progenitor cells to reoxygenation-generated oxidative stress. Our study demonstrates that oxidative stress generated by reoxygenation can induce premature senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), of Fancc-/- hematopoietic progenitor cells through the ATM/p53/p21 pathway and suggests that stress-induced senescence may be a novel mechanism underlying hematopoietic cell depletion in bone marrow (BM) failure diseases including FA. Mice, Isolation of BM Lin- Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) Cells, and Treatments—WT and Fancc-/- mice were generated by interbreeding the heterozygous Fancc+/- mice (a gift from Dr. Manuel Buchwald, University of Toronto; Ref. 10Chen M. Tomkins D. Auerbach W. McKerlie C. Youssoufian H. Liu L. Gan O. Carreau M. Auerbach A. Groves T. Guidos C. Freedman M. Cross J. Percy D. Dick J. Joyner A. Buchwald M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Lineage-negative (Lin-) cells were isolated using a lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.) in accordance with manufacturer's instruction. BM Lin- cells were then stained with Sca-1-PE and c-kit-APC antibodies followed by cell sorting using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The resulting LSK cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing stem cell factor (100 ng/ml), interleukin-6 (20 ng/ml), and Flt-3L (50 ng/ml) (R&D Systems). Three sets of cells were incubated in parallel: 1) the control cultures were incubated at 37 °C in normoxia (humidified air with 21% O2, 5% CO2); 2) the reoxygenated cultures were subjected to hypoxia (1% O2) for 4 h then shifted to 21% O2; 3) the reoxygenated-NAC cultures were the same as those in set 2 except that the medium contained the anti-oxidant NAC at a concentration of 1 mm. Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Calbiochem) was added to cell cultures immediately after reoxygenation at 100 μm. For 2-aminopurine (2-AP) treatment, cells were incubated with 10 mm 2-AP (Sigma) during hypoxia-reoxygenation treatments. Apoptosis Assay—Aliquots of 1 × 105 BM Lin- cells were stained with Sca-1-PE and c-kit-APC antibodies followed by annexin V staining. These experiments also included PE and APC isotype controls, and FITC positive and negative controls. Apoptosis was therefore analyzed in different populations of Lin- cells by flow cytometry. Clonogenic Progenitor Cell Assays and BM Transplantation—BM LSK cells were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation with or without 2-AP and cultured in a 35-mm tissue culture dish in 4 ml of semisolid medium containing 3 ml of MethoCult M 3134 (Stem Cell Technologies) and the following growth factors: 100 ng/ml stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 100 ng/ml granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, and 4 units/ml erythropoietin. Colonies (colony-forming cells (CFCs)) were counted on day 7. To evaluate the effect of reoxygenation on the repopulation ability of the BM progenitor cells, we used a NOD/SCID repopulation assay. NOD/SCID mice (Jackson Laboratories) were handled under sterile conditions and maintained under microisolaters. WT or Fancc-/- BM (2 × 106) cells were transplanted by tail vein injection into sublethal irradiated (3.5 Gy) 8-week-old mice along with 5 × 105 competitor cells. BM cells from the transplanted mice were stained with H2kb-PE (for donor-derived cells) and H2kd-FITC (for recipient-derived cells) antibodies (Pharmingen) and analyzed by flow cytometry to detect donor-derived hematopoietic progenitors. SiRNA and Assays for DNA Damage and Senescence—The siRNA oligonucleotides targeting nucleotides 8111-8131 of mouse ATM mRNA (GeneBank™ sequence accession number NM007499; GGTGACTATAAAATCATTTAA) were cloned in the pSM2c retroviral vector (Open Biosystems). Infected cells were selected for puromycin resistance. The generation of DNA strand breaks in control and reoxygenated BM LSK cells was assessed by the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay (11Tice R.R. Agurell E. Anderson D. Burlinson B. Hartmann A. Kobayashi H. Miyamae Y. Rojas E. Ryu J.C. Sasaki Y.F. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar), using a Fpg-FLARE (fragment length analysis using repair enzymes) comet assay kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen). SA-β-gal activity was determined using a SA-β-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Immunocytochemistry—BM LSK cells were stained with primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-ATMSer-1981, Rockland Immunochemistry Research; monoclonal anti-p53Ser-15 and polyclonal anti-p21WAF1, Cell Signaling; monoclonal anti-p16, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and then with Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Statistics—Data were analyzed statistically using a Student's t test. The level of statistical significance stated in the text was based on the p values. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Reoxygenation-generated Oxidative Stress Induces DNA Damage and Inhibits Colony Formation in BM Progenitor Cells—Because reoxygenation represents oxidative stress to the cell and oxidative stress induces DNA damage (2Ames B.N.

Sci. 2000; 908: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we first sought to determine whether hypoxia-then-reoxygenation caused DNA damage in BM progenitor cells. Analysis of DNA strand breaks by comet assay revealed that there was increased accumulation of DNA damage in reoxygenated Lin- Sca-1+c-kit+ (KSL) BM cells compared with untreated counterparts (Fig. 1A). The Fancc-deficient mice have a profound defect in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment, and FA HSCs and progenitors have been shown to be hypersensitive to a variety of stresses including oxidative stress (8Bagby Jr., G.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 12Tischkowitz M. Dokal I. Br. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16805-16812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, reoxygenated Fancc-/- KSL cells induced significant (3.8-fold) more DNA strand breakage than reoxygenated WT KSL cells (Fig. 1A). Treatment of reoxygenated WT or Fancc-/- KSL cells with the anti-oxidant NAC completely abrogated the effect (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the DNA damage was generated by oxidative stress. The number of CFCs derived from both reoxygenated WT and Fancc-/- BM progenitors was significantly decreased compared with their untreated counterparts, and NAC completely restored the progenitor activity of these reoxygenated KSL cells (Fig. 1B). Reoxygenated BM Progenitor Cells Undergo Growth Arrest and Have Reduced BM Repopulating Ability—While reoxygenation induced more apoptosis in Fancc-/- BM KSL cells than in WT KSL cells shortly after exposure to high oxygen, apoptotic cells decreased thereafter (Fig. 1C). In addition, the extent of the increase was not as significant as reoxygenation-generated DNA damage at 24 h post-reoxygenation (compare Fig. 1A). Actually, apoptosis decreased to basal level 48 h post-reoxygenation (Fig. 1C). Thus, apoptosis is not the major consequence of the DNA damage. We therefore evaluated the cell cycle profile of these BM cells. Reoxygenated BM cells clearly exhibited a prolonged G0 + G1 accumulation (Fig. 1D), suggesting that there might exist an overactivated G0/G1 checkpoint in these BM progenitor cells. The marrow repopulating ability of reoxygenated progenitors was assessed by transplanting equal numbers of either untreated (control) or reoxygenated progenitors into sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID recipients. Engraftment was evaluated 4 weeks after transplantation by flow cytometric determination of donor-derived cells (H2kb+) in BM cell suspensions of the bone marrow harvested from recipient animals. The bone marrow of animals that received transplants of reoxygenated WT or Fancc-/- cells showed 2- or 3-fold lower engraftment than the untreated counterparts, respectively (Fig. 1E). Consistent with the observations of others (10Chen M. Tomkins D. Auerbach W. McKerlie C. Youssoufian H. Liu L. Gan O. Carreau M. Auerbach A. Groves T. Guidos C. Freedman M. Cross J. Percy D. Dick J. Joyner A. Buchwald M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), Fancc deficiency impairs the repopulating ability of Fancc-/- BM progenitors. Cell Fate Choice between Senescence, Tested as Staining for SA-β-gal, and Apoptosis in Reoxygenated BM Progenitor Cells—Because reoxygenated BM progenitor cells underwent G0/G1 arrest, we reasoned that stress-induced senescence might be one fate of these cells. To examine this possibility, we stained WT and Fancc-/- BM KSL cells for SA-β-galactosidase, a biomarker for senescence (14Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5558) Google Scholar). Nearly 20% of the reoxygenated WT KSL cells and more than 40% of the reoxygenated Fancc-/- KSL cells stained positive for SA-β-galactosidase activity after 48 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 2A). Because we observed reoxygenation-induced apoptosis, especially in Fancc-/- BM progenitor cells, we asked whether blockage of apoptosis would increase senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, in these reoxygenated BM cells. Indeed, when these reoxygenated BM KSL cells were incubated in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, more than 60% of the Fancc-/- cells entered senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, compared with ∼ 40% without the apoptotic inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Therefore, reoxygenated Fancc-/- BM progenitor cells blocked for apoptosis may be prone to developing senescence. Reoxygenation-induced Senescence, Tested as Staining for SA-β-gal, in BM Progenitor Cells Involves the ATM/p53/p21WAF1 Pathway—Because reoxygenation induces DNA damage and subsequent p53 activation, which is dependent on the ATM kinase (4Hammond E.M. Dorie M.J. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12207-12213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Hammond E.M. Giaccia A.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we asked whether reoxygenation-induced senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, in BM progenitor cells involves the ATM/p53/p21WAF1 pathway. We examined the reoxygenation-induced phosphorylation of ATM (Ser-1981) and p53 (Ser-15) and expression of p21 in BM KSL cells. ATM autophosphorylation at Ser-1981 activates the kinase and is largely responsible for phosphorylating p53 at Ser-15 in response to DNA damage (15Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar, 16Kurz E.U. Lees-Miller S.P. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We found ∼20% each of ATMSer-1981- and p53Ser-15-positive (Fig. 3, A and B) in reoxygenated WT BM KSL cells. In reoxygenated Fancc-/- BM KSL cells, the intensity and percentages of cells stained positive for ATMSer-1981 and p53Ser-15 increased significantly (Fig. 3, A and B). We also found that higher levels of p21-positive (22%) stained cells were present in reoxygenated WT BM KSL cells compared with untreated WT cells. The percentage of p21-positive cells increased to 66% in those FA BM KSL cells (Fig. 3, A and B). To provide evidence that there is a link between activation of the ATM/p53/p21 pathway and senescence, we wanted to know whether blockage of ATM signaling inhibited reoxygenation-induced senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, in BM progenitor cells. It is known that inhibition of ATM can relieve senescent cell cycle arrest (17d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N.P. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 426: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). We used both siRNA and the kinase inhibitor 2-AP, which has been shown to suppress ATM activation (18Huang S. Qu L.K. Cuddihy A.R. Ragheb R. Taya Y. Koromilas A.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3721-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Herbig U. Jobling W.A. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 501-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). BM KSL cells expressing the ATM siRNA or treated with 2-AP effectively reduced ATMSer-1981 and p53Ser-15 in reoxygenated WT and Fancc-/- BM KSL cells (Fig. 3, C and D). We then determined progenitor activity of these reoxygenated BM KSL cells in a clonogenic assay (Fig. 3E). Our prediction was that if inhibition of ATM reversed senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, then the senescence-reversed cells would be able to proliferate as reflected by the enhanced progenitor activity. Interestingly, reoxygenated WT BM KSL cells expressing ATM siRNA or treated with 2-AP exhibited increased clonogenic ability (nearly restored colony formation to the level of untreated WT BM KSL cells; Fig. 3E). However, both siATM and 2-AP treatments had little affect on progenitor activity of the reoxygenated Fancc-/- BM KSL cells (Fig. 3E). Recent reports show that the ability of the cell to relieve senescent cell cycle arrest or reverse senescence depends on the levels of p16INK4A expression (19Herbig U. Jobling W.A. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 501-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 20Beausejour C.M. Krtolica A. Galimi F. Narita M. Lowe S.W. Yaswen P. Campisi J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Our observations that inhibition of ATM signaling increased clonogenic ability (Fig. 3E) of WT but not Fancc-/- progenitor cells led us to examine the relationship between p16INK4A expression and senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal. Reoxygenation hardly induced p16INK4A expression in WT BM KSL cells but did so strongly in Fancc-/- BM KSL cells (Fig. 3F). Expression of siATM or 2-AP treatment reduced p16 expression in reoxygenated WT cells but did not have detectable effect on Fancc-/- BM KSL cells (Fig. 3F), indicating that reoxygenation-induced p16INK4A expression in Fancc-/- BM KSL cells was independent of ATM activity. However, when we correlated ATM inhibition and p16INK4A expression with SA-β-gal activity, we found that reoxygenated WT BM KSL cells treated with 2-AP and siATM were almost devoid of SA-β-gal-positive cells (decreased from 14.6% to 2.5 and 3.3%, respectively; Fig. 3D). In contrast, inhibition of ATM activity did not significantly reduced SA-β-gal staining in reoxygenated Fancc-/- BM KSL cells, which expressed high levels of p16INK4A (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, inhibition of ATM activity increased apoptosis in reoxygenated WT and Fancc-/- BM KSL cells (Fig. 3F). These results indicate that inhibition of ATM can reverse senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, of BM progenitor cells that do not or express low level of p16 and suggest that the ATM/p53/p21 pathway influences cell fate decision between apoptosis and senescence in reoxygenated hematopoietic progenitor cells. In summary, we have shown that 1) reoxygenation-generated oxidative stress induced DNA damage and G0/G1 arrest in BM progenitor cells without significant apoptosis; 2) reoxygenation induced senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, in reoxygenated BM progenitor cells; 3) induction of senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, in reoxygenated BM progenitor cells closely correlated with the extent of DNA damage and phosphorylation of ATM at Ser-1981 and p53 at Ser-15; and 4) inhibition of ATM signaling reversed reoxygenation-induced senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, but increased apoptosis in BM progenitor cells. Thus, these results suggest that reoxygenation induces senescence in hematopoietic progenitor cells through the ATM/p53/p21 pathway. These findings are especially relevant to the survival and maintenance of hematopoietic progenitor cells that are often exposed to transient hypoxia in vivo, and since hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell depletion is the major cause of BM failure occurred in aplastic anemia including FA, to the molecular etiology of BM diseases. We demonstrated that the ATM kinase played a major role in transducing the reoxygenation-induced DNA damage signal in BM progenitor cells. Reoxygenation can generate oxidative stress, which can damage DNA. It is known that ATM transmits the signal of DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. For instance, oncogenic insults promote the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in DNA damage and apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway (21Hermeking H. Eick D. Science. 1994; 265: 2091-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 22Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). More recently, ATM has been shown to play an essential role in transmitting DNA damage signals generated by reoxygenation, through phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 (4Hammond E.M. Dorie M.J. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12207-12213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 5Hammond E.M. Giaccia A.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1117-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We used siRNA targeting ATM and the protein kinase inhibitor 2-AP to investigate the involvement of ATM in DNA damage response of reoxygenated BM progenitor cells. Inhibition of ATM signaling resulted in reduction of ATMSer-1981, p53Ser-15, and p21 expression and reversal of senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, in reoxygenated BM progenitor cells but sensitized these BM cells to apoptosis (Fig. 3). Our results thus indicate for the first time that senescence, tested as staining for SA-β-gal, induction in reoxygenated BM progenitor cells is regulated by the ATM/p53/p21 pathway. We propose the existence of distinct mechanisms for WT and Fancc-/- BM cells with regard to cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage induced by reoxygenation-generated oxidative stress. Upon experiencing DNA damage, WT BM cells initially arrest cell cycle progression by ATM-dependent activation of the G1 checkpoint to gain time for DNA repair. The major pathway responsible for triggering the G1 checkpoint involves the activation of p53 by ATM, the p53-mediated induction of p21, and a reduction in the level of RB phosphorylation. If the DNA damage cannot be repaired in a timely manner, the cells undergo reversal senescence to prevent accumulation of genetic mutations until the damage has been repair. In Fancc-/- BM progenitor cells, however, excessive DNA damage causes overactivation of the ATM kinase, resulting in a hyperactive G1 checkpoint. The arrested Fancc-/- BM cells enter senescence, while the DNA damage remains unrepaired. Inhibition of ATM in these FA cells thus likely results in bypass of G1 checkpoint and undergoing apoptosis.

Importantly, SR-BI/ApoE double null mice have lower plasma cholesterol levels than ApoE null mice, suggesting involvement of a non-lipids mechanism. In the present study, we revealed a novel ligand-independent apoptotic pathway induced by SR-BI, and regulated by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and high density lipoprotein (HDL). SR-BI significantly induces apoptosis in three independent cell systems. In contrast to known ligand-dependent apoptotic pathways, SR-BI-induced apoptosis is ligand-independent. We further showed that SR-BI-induced apoptosis is suppressed by eNOS and HDL. By using a single site mutation, we demonstrated that SR-BI induces apoptosis through a highly conserved CXXS redox motif. We finally demonstrated that SR-BI-induced apoptosis is via the caspase-8 pathway. We hypothesize that in healthy cells, the SR-BI apoptotic pathway is turned off by eNOS and HDL which prevents inappropriate apoptotic damage to the vascular wall. When HDL levels are low, oxidative stress causes the relocation of eNOS away from caveolae, which turns on SR-BI-induced apoptosis and rapidly clears damaged cells to prevent further inflammatory damage to neighboring cells. The current studies offer a new paradigm in which to study the non-cholesterol effects of SR-BI, HDL, and eNOS on the development of atherosclerosis and potentially other cardiovascular diseases.

Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 2Krieger M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). SR-BI is expressed in a variety of tissues including the liver, endothelial cells, and ovaries (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). In the liver, SR-BI facilitates the selective uptake of cholesterol from circulating HDL, in which it is then processed and secreted as bile; however, the function of SR-BI in other tissues is unclear. Recently Braun et al. (3Braun A. Trigatti B.L. Post M.J. Sato K. Simons M. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Schrenzel M. Krieger M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Tall A.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) reported a surprising effect of SR-BI on the cardiovascular system. They showed that SR-BI/ApoE double null mice fed a standard chow diet developed severe occlusive coronary disease and atherosclerosis within 4 weeks. Other animal models such as ApoE null mice and ApoE/LDLR null mice fed a high fat diet develop occlusive coronary disease and atherosclerosis to a lesser extent than SR-BI/ApoE double null mice, and it takes considerable longer (3Braun A. Trigatti B.L. Post M.J. Sato K. Simons M. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Schrenzel M. Krieger M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Tall A.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Importantly, the total plasma cholesterol levels in the ApoE or ApoE/LDLR mouse models are normally greater than 1500 mg/dL, whereas in SR-BI/ApoE null mice it is ∼700–800 mg/dL (3Braun A. Trigatti B.L. Post M.J. Sato K. Simons M. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. Schrenzel M. Krieger M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 4Tall A.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SR-BI has cholesterol-independent effects on the cardiovascular system. Interestingly, mice over-expressing SR-BI also develop atherosclerosis (5Ueda Y. Gong E. Royer L. Cooper P.N. Francone O.L. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20368-20373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting again that SR-BI has multiple functions and that, depending on as yet unidentified factors, can function in promoting or preventing the development of pathophysiological states such as atherosclerosis.Endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) is expressed in a variety of tissues and catalyzes the oxidation of arginine to produce nitric oxide, a small signaling molecule that plays a major role in the physiological function of the cardiovascular system (6Andrew P.J. Mayer B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). A decrease in the bioavailability of nitric oxide is thought to be involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions and the development of hypertension (7Shaul P.W. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As was predicted, eNOS null mice develop atherosclerosis (8Knowles J.W. Reddick R.L. Jennette J.C. Shesely E.G. Smithies O. Maeda N. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); however, more surprising was the finding that over-expression of eNOS also promotes the development of atherosclerosis (9Ozaki M. Kawashima S. Yamashita T. Hirase T. Namiki M. Inoue N. Hirata K. Yasui H. Sakurai H. Yoshida Y. Masada M. Yokoyama M. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) whereby eNOS promotes atherosclerosis is not understood, but these findings, like those for SR-BI, suggest that the roles of eNOS are more complex than originally proposed.Apoptosis has at least two functions. One is to eliminate unneeded cells during development and another is to remove damaged cells to prevent further inflammatory damage (10Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). The process of apoptosis is especially important for vascular endothelial cells because vascular endothelial cells are constantly insulted by inflammatory factors such as oxidized LDL and superoxide (11Ross R.

Damaged endothelial cells trigger inflammatory reactions that can subsequently damage surrounding cells. Fast clearance of the damaged endothelial cells by an apoptotic mechanism is helpful in maintaining normal vascular function. However, uncontrolled apoptosis is harmful, resulting in inappropriate damage to the tissue. Thus, a tightly regulated apoptotic process is required to maintain the normal function of cells and tissues.In the current study we have described a novel ligand-independent apoptotic pathway that is induced by SR-BI and regulated by eNOS and HDL. The physiological and clinical implications of this novel finding are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The cytotoxicity detection kit (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity), the in situ cell death detection kit (TUNEL), and the apoptotic DNA ladder kit were from Roche Applied Science. The caspase-8 assay kit, caspase-9 assay kit, the anti-caspase-12 IgG, the cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor (DEVD), caspase-8 inhibitor (IETD), and caspase-9 inhibitor (LEHD) were from Calbiochem and Oncogene (San Diego, CA). The caspase-3 activity assay kit was from Sigma. The pLNCX2 vector was from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). The anti-human eNOS IgG was from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-mouse eNOS IgG and anti-VCAM-1 IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-SR-BI serum against the C-terminal region of SR-BI was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). The anti-SR-BI serum against the extracellular region of SR-BI was from Calbiochem.Generation of Mutant Construct and CHO Cell Lines—Human SR-BI cDNA was provided by Dr. Deneys van der Westhuyzen (University of Kentucky). A SR-BI point mutant (SRBI-C323G, cysteine to glycine mutant) was generated by PCR using wild type SR-BI as the template and subcloned into pLNCX2. The construct was transfected into CHO cells, and cell lines stably expressing the mutant were obtained by G418 selection as we described previously (16Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N.

CHO cell lines stably expressing vector (pLNCX2), wild type SR-BI, wild type eNOS, or both of SR-BI and eNOS were established as described previously (16Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N.

The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.3 mg/ml G418.Knock-out Mice and Genotyping—SR-BI+/- and eNOS-/- mice were from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were backcrossed 10× onto a C57BL/6 background. SR-BI null mice were generated by breeding SR-BI+/- mice. Mouse tail DNA was used for genotyping by PCR following the methods provided by the Jackson Laboratories.Primary Mouse Embryo Fibroblast Cell (MEF) and Primary Mouse Aortic Endothelial Cell Culture—MEFs were prepared as described previously (17Tymms M.J. Kola I. Gene Knockout Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 205-215Google Scholar). Briefly, SR-BI+/- females mated with SR-BI+/- males were euthanized at day 13.5 of gestation. Embryos were decapitated, digested in trypsin, and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were genotyped by PCR and used at passage three. Mouse aortic endothelial cells were isolated from wild type, eNOS null and SR-BI null mice and cultured as described previously (18Shi W. Wang X. Shih D.M. Laubach V.E. Navab M. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 2002; 105: 2078-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The purity of endothelial cells was monitored with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using VCAM-1 antibody (data not shown).Apoptosis Assay—Four different methods were employed to quantify cell death and to identify apoptosis. 1) Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cell culture supernatant, which quantitatively monitors the degree of cell damage, was measured using the cytotoxicity detection kit following the instructions. Data were expressed as percentage of the total LDH activity. 2) TUNEL assay, which quantitatively measures cell death, was performed using the in situ cell death detection kit following the manufacturer's instructions. 3) Caspase activation is a biochemical marker of apoptosis (10Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar). The caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-12 were measured as described below. 4) A DNA ladder assay, which is a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis (10Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6211) Google Scholar), was used to identify and confirm apoptosis. The ladder DNA was isolated using the apoptotic DNA ladder kit from Roche Applied Science. Both adherent and detached cells were harvested. The isolated DNA was treated with RNase for 15 min at room temperature and applied to a 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis.Caspase Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay kit from Sigma. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were measured using fluorometric assay kits from Oncogene. Activation of caspase-12 was detected by Western blot using an antibody against caspase-12. Briefly, 106 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, and the cells were cultured to 70–80% confluency in complete medium and then changed to serum-free medium. At the indicated times, the supernatants were collected for the LDH activity assay, and then the cells were scraped and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysate buffer (provided in the assay kit). The lysate was used for the caspase assays.Electrophoresis and Immunoblots—Cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min in lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 5 min), the supernatants were mixed with ¼ volume of reduced sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were then separated by electrophoresis and detected by Western blot as described previously (16Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J.

Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining were used to assay the purity of each lipoprotein fraction.Statistical Analysis—A paired Student t test was used to evaluate the data. Means were considered significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSSR-BI Induces Apoptosis, and eNOS Suppresses SR-BI-induced Apoptosis—To ensure that any measured effects of SR-BI were not cell line-specific, we used three independent cell systems. 1) We established CHO cell lines stably expressing vector cDNA, SR-BI, eNOS, or both SR-BI and eNOS (Fig. 1a). 2) Primary MEFs express SR-BI but not eNOS; therefore it is a convenient model to examine the effects of SR-BI on apoptosis in the absence of eNOS using wild type and SR-BI-/- MEFs (Fig. 1b). 3) In vivo, endothelial cells express both SR-BI and eNOS; thus primary aortic endothelial cells isolated from wild type, SR-BI-/-, and eNOS-/- mice were used (Fig. 1c).All of the CHO cell lines grew well in complete medium (5% serum) and displayed a healthy spindle-like morphology (Fig. 2a, Attached). However, a significant number of rounded cells were observed in the culture supernatant of cells expressing SR-BI (Fig. 2a, Floating). In contrast, few cells containing the vector appeared in the culture supernatant (Fig. 2a, Floating). The floating cells were collected and quantified by counting with a hemocytometer. Approximately 75,000 cells/10-cm culture dish were floating in the culture supernatant of CHO-SRBI cells compared with 9,000 cells for CHO-vector cells (Fig. 2b). To determine whether the floating cells were dead or dying a DNA ladder assay was conducted. Fig. 2c demonstrates that the floating cells harvested from the CHO-SRBI plates had fragmented DNA, whereas floating cells taken from the same number of plated cells for CHO-vector cells did not contain DNA ladders. To further confirm that SR-BI can induce cell damage we quantitatively measured LDH activity in the culture supernatant. CHO-SRBI cells had significantly more LDH leakage than CHO-vector cells (Fig. 2d).Fig. 2SR-BI induces apoptosis in the presence of serum. The CHO cell lines were grown in normal medium containing 5% serum to ∼70% confluency. a, the floating cells were collected, and the floating cells and attached cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (×10). Representative data are from four independent experiments. b, the number of floating cells was quantified for each cell type. **, p < 0.01 with respect to vector. n = 4. c, DNA was isolated from floating cells (from 10 10-cm dishes of cells) and the extent of DNA fragmentation determined with a commercial apoptotic DNA ladder kit. Apoptotic DNA was not detected in DNA isolated from the attached cells (data not shown). Representative data are from three independent experiments. d, the extent of cytotoxicity was determined by measuring LDH activity in the culture medium. **, p < 0.01 with respect to vector. n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unlike ligand-dependent apoptosis, such as Fas-induced apoptosis, which needs a FasL ligand to stimulate apoptosis, SR-BI-induced apoptosis did not require a ligand (ligand-independent). Therefore, to prevent inappropriate apoptotic damage to the endothelial cells, a mechanism(s) must exist to prevent SR-BI-induced apoptosis in physiological condition. Several laboratories including ours recently demonstrated that eNOS and SR-BI are functionally coupled in caveolae (16Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M.

Therefore, we tested whether eNOS can inhibit SR-BI-induced apoptosis using CHO-SRBI-eNOS cells expressing both SR-BI and eNOS. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression of eNOS completely inhibited SR-BI-induced apoptosis as revealed by morphological assay (Fig. 2a), floating cell counting (Fig. 2b), DNA ladder assay (Fig. 2c), and LDH assay (Fig. 2d).Apoptosis is a physiological process to eliminate unneeded or damaged cells, but it must be tightly regulated because uncontrolled apoptosis will cause inappropriate damage to tissue. Although we demonstrated that eNOS effectively suppressed SR-BI-induced apoptosis, eNOS is not always co-expressed with SR-BI in all tissues. Therefore, we used serum starvation to further investigate whether there is an inhibitor(s) in the serum that suppresses SR-BI-induced apoptosis. Serum starvation is a classic method to enhance apoptosis (23Kwon Y.G. Min J.K. Kim K.M. Lee D.J. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10627-10633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We also used this approach to further clarify whether SR-BI/eNOS are involved in apoptosis. After 24 h of serum starvation, CHO-SRBI cells underwent a major morphological change consistent with cells undergoing cell death (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the CHO-vector, CHO-eNOS, or CHO-SRBI-eNOS cells maintained a morphological appearance similar to those cells kept in the presence of serum. Cell death was quantified by LDH cytotoxicity assay. After 24 h of serum starvation, CHO-SRBI cells released 30% of total cellular LDH into the culture medium, whereas the other cells released 8% of total cellular LDH into the culture medium (Fig. 3b). After 48 h of serum starvation, CHO-SRBI cells released more than 60% of total cellular LDH, whereas CHO-vector, CHO-eNOS, and CHO-SRBI-eNOS cells released only 15.4, 12.9, and 14.1% of their total cellular LDH (Fig. 3b), respectively. To confirm that the LDH activity was due to apoptosis, we performed a TUNEL assay. After 24 h of serum starvation 12% of CHO-SRBI cells were TUNEL positive, whereas less than 0.5% of the other three cell lines were TUNEL positive (Fig. 3c). It is important to emphasize that the TUNEL assay detects dying cells attached to the culture dish and that cells that have already died will have detached from the dish and been washed away during the staining process. Thus, it is likely that the TUNEL assay values underestimated the actual number of dead/dying cells. Finally, we used the DNA ladder assay to determine whether the cells were dying by apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3d, a clear DNA ladder was obtained for CHO-SRBI cells after 48 h of serum starvation, demonstrating that the SR-BI-induced cell death is by apoptosis. In contrast, only intact DNA was detected for the other cell lines. It is important to note that the cells expressing both SR-BI and eNOS did not undergo apoptosis, which is demonstrated by the morphological assay (Fig. 3a), LDL assay (Fig. 3b), TUNEL assay (Fig. 3c), and DNA ladder assay (Fig. 3d), indicating that eNOS effectively suppressed SR-BI induced apoptosis. The serum starvation greatly enhanced SR-BI-induced apoptosis, which suggested that a survival factor exists in serum. The identification of this factor will be discussed in the next section.Fig. 3SR-BI induces apoptosis in the absence of serum. The CHO cell lines were grown in normal medium containing 5% serum to ∼50–70% confluency. a, the cells were maintained in medium containing serum or in medium not containing serum (Starve) for 24 h. The morphology of the attached cells were visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (×10). Representative data are from four independent experiments. b, the cells were serum-starved for various times and the extent of cytotoxicity determined by measuring LDH activity in the culture medium. p < 0.05 (*) and p < 0.01 (**) with respect to vector. n = 4. c, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and a commercial kit was used to determine the number of TUNEL positive cells.

Representative data are from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To ensure that the ability of SR-BI to induce apoptosis was not limited to CHO cells, we isolated wild type and SR-BI null mouse embryonic fibroblasts from the embryos obtained from breeding SR-BI+/- mice. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then placed in medium lacking serum for 24 h. The extent of apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay. Fig. 4a demonstrates that wild type cells (containing SR-BI) underwent significantly more apoptosis than SR-BI null cells (lacking SR-BI). We next wanted to confirm that eNOS prevents SR-BI-induced apoptosis in cells that normally express eNOS. To this end we isolated mouse aortic endothelial cells from wild type mice, SR-BI null mice, and eNOS null mice. The isolated cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and the extent of apoptosis was quantified by TUNEL assay (Fig. 4b). Endothelial cells isolated from eNOS null mice (contain SR-BI) underwent significantly more cell death than cells from wild type or SR-BI null mice. These data are consistent with our findings in CHO and MEF cells that the apoptosis is SR-BI-dependent and the presence of eNOS prevents SR-BI-induced cell death.Fig. 4SR-BI induces apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and aortic endothelial cells. a, wild type or SR-BI null MEFs were isolated from embryos produced by crossing SR-BI+/- mice and grown for three passages. b, aortic endothelial cells were isolated from wild type mice, SR-BI null mice, and eNOS null mice and grown for three passages.

Because HDL is a physiological ligand of SR-BI, we tested whether the presence, absence, or amount of HDL influenced the ability of SR-BI to induce cell death. Therefore, various amounts of isolated HDL or lipoprotein-deficient serum were incubated with CHO-vector or CHO-SRBI cells for 48 h, the morphology of the cells was examined, and the amount of LDH activity was quantified (Fig. 5). Fig. 5a demonstrates that CHO-SRBI cells incubated in lipoprotein-deficient serum underwent a morphological change consistent with the onset of cell death and that the expression of eNOS along with SR-BI prevented the morphological change. However, CHO-SRBI cells incubated in 100 μg/ml HDL were healthy and looked similar to control cells. Lipoprotein-deficient serum was unable to prevent SR-BI-mediated cytotoxicity, as measured by LDH release, at any of the concentrations tested. In contrast, HDL provided significant protection against LDH release at 100 μg/ml and nearly completed protection at 150 μg/ml (Fig. 5b). Control experiments with LDL and very low density lipoprotein demonstrated that these lipoproteins were not able to prevent a change in cell morphology or LDH release (data not shown).Fig. 5HDL prevents SR-BI-induced apoptosis. The CHO cell lines were grown in normal medium containing 5% serum to ∼50–70% confluency. a, cells were then incubated in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum or in medium containing HDL for 48 h. The morphology of the attached cells was visualized by phase-contrast microscopy (×10).

CXXS proteins belong to the CXXC redox family and play important roles in preventing apoptosis caused by oxidative stress (24Fomenko D.E. Gladyshev V.N.

We used this experimental model to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of tamoxifen on the development of mammary preneoplasia and adenocarcinoma. No protective effects of tamoxifen administration on mammary cancer development were found. Instead, tamoxifen treatment significantly increased rates of mammary epithelial cell proliferation and the prevalence of mammary hyperplasia at 6 months of age. Tamoxifen-exposed mice developed adenocarcinomas at younger ages than control mice and a higher percentage of mice developed adenocarcinomas by 12 months of age. Both whole mouse and tissue culture cell models were used to test if loss of full-length Brca1 was associated with a relative increase in the agonist activity of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen induced increased ductal growth in MMTV-Cre Brca1 conditional mice compared to wild type. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression was downregulated in the tamoxifen-induced hyperplasias. Reducing BRCA1 levels in MCF-7 cells using siRNA resulted in a relative increase in the agonist activity of tamoxifen. Results suggest a model of mammary cancer progression in which loss of full-length Brca1 altered the agonist/antagonist activity of tamoxifen, resulting in tamoxifen-induced mammary epithelial cell proliferation with subsequent loss of ERalpha expression and development of ERalpha-negative hyperplasias and adenocarcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1989777508,"Angiogenesis is becoming a major target for antitumor therapies, and identifying new angiogenic factors and their specific inhibitors may provide new avenues for tumor management. Here we identify gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) as a new angiogenic molecule that is secreted by tumors and acts directly upon GRP receptors in the endothelial cells. Addition of GRP increases endothelial cell migration and cord formation in vitro, and induces angiogenesis in an in vivo assay. We have recently identified a small molecule GRP blocker, compound 77427. This inhibitor significantly reduced endothelial cell cord formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Conversely, when applied to VEGF-induced angiogenesis, the small molecule did not have any effect, demonstrating its specificity. Furthermore, this GRP blocker was able to reduce lung tumor cell growth in vitro as demonstrated by MTT and clonogenic assays. When applied to a xenograft model with lung cancer cells, compound 77427 reduced tumor volume to undetectable sizes, although when the treatment was suspended, tumors began to grow again at normal rates. Our collective observations indicate that GRP is a new angiogenic peptide and that its inhibition offers an attractive tool to reduce tumor burden."
https://openalex.org/W2054435325,"The genetic instability driving tumorigenesis is fueled by DNA damage and by errors made by the DNA replication. Upon DNA damage the cell organizes an integrated response not only by the classical DNA repair mechanisms but also involving mechanisms of replication, transcription, chromatin structure dynamics, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated the role of p19INK4d in the response driven by neuroblastoma cells against DNA injury caused by UV irradiation. We show that p19INK4d is the only INK4 protein whose expression is induced by UV light in neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, p19INK4d translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus is observed after UV irradiation. Ectopic expression of p19INK4d clearly reduces the UV-induced apoptosis as well as enhances the cellular ability to repair the damaged DNA. It is clearly shown that DNA repair is the main target of p19INK4d effect and that diminished apoptosis is a downstream event. Importantly, experiments performed with CDK4 mutants suggest that these p19INK4d effects would be independent of its role as a cell cycle checkpoint gene. The results presented herein uncover a new role of p19INK4d as regulator of DNA-damage-induced apoptosis and suggest that it protects cells from undergoing apoptosis by allowing a more efficient DNA repair. We propose that, in addition to its role as cell cycle inhibitor, p19INK4d is involved in maintenance of DNA integrity and, therefore, would contribute to cancer prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2037795068,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) stimulation results in the assembly of Smad-containing protein complexes that mediate activation or repression of TGF-β responsive genes. To determine if disruption of specific Smad protein–protein interactions would selectively inhibit responses to TGF-β or generally interfere with Smad-dependent signaling, we developed three Smad-binding peptide aptamers by introducing Smad interaction motifs from Smad-binding proteins CBP, FoxH1 and Lef1 into the scaffold protein E. coli thioredoxin A (Trx). All three classes of aptamers bound to Smads by GST pulldown assays and co-immunoprecipitation from mammalian cells. Expression of the aptamers in HepG2 cells did not generally inhibit Smad-dependent signaling as evaluated using seven TGF-β responsive luciferase reporter genes. The Trx-xFoxH1b aptamer inhibited TGF-β-induced expression from a reporter dependent on the Smad–FoxH1 interaction, A3-lux, by 50%. Trx-xFoxH1b also partially inhibited two reporters not dependent on a Smad–FoxH1 interaction, 3TP-lux and Twntop, and endogenous PAI-1 expression. Trx-Lef1 aptamer only inhibited expression of the Smad–Lef1 responsive reporter gene TwnTop. The Trx-CBP aptamer had no significant effect on reporter gene expression. The results suggest that Smad-binding peptide aptamers can be developed to selectively inhibit TGF-β-induced gene expression."

The biochemical process, called ubiquitination, is a sequential three-step reaction whereby Ub is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme. The Ub C terminus then forms a thiolester intermediate with the catalytic Cys residue of a Ub-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2) active site. The final step involves a substrate-specific ubiquitin ligase (E3) and leads to the attachment of the Ub C terminus to an ∈-amino group of a Lys residue of the target (reviewed in Ref. 1Pickart C.M.

Most often, the process is repeated, and subsequent Ub molecules are attached to one another so that poly-Ub chains are generated. Mono-Ub or poly-Ub chains are used as signals for numerous cellular processes such as cell cycle progression (2Wei W. Ayad N.G. Wan Y. Zhang G.J. Kirschner M.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2004; 428: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), apoptosis (3Zhang H.G. Wang J. Yang X. Hsu H.C. Mountz J.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2009-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), mitochondrial inheritance (4Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and transcriptional regulation (5Kao C.F. Hillyer C. Tsukuda T. Henry K. Berger S. Osley M.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The versatility of ubiquitination and its ability to function in a wide variety of cellular roles are generally attributed to three main factors. First, whereas E1s are encoded by one or very few genes in the cell, E2s are a more plentiful family, with 13 such enzymes in budding yeast and many more in higher eukaryotes. Second, the most plentiful and diverse group of ubiquitination enzymes is the E3s, which function alone or as part of multi-subunit complexes. E3s are responsible for determining substrate specificity and act in either active or passive roles in ubiquitination by covalently binding Ub or acting as E2 substrate adapter proteins, respectively. A third important factor in providing versatility for ubiquitination involves the nature of the poly-Ub chains themselves. Conventional poly-Ub chains are built via Lys48 and provide a characteristic signal for substrate-specific degradation by the 26S proteasome (6Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Because protein turnover by the Ub proteasome system is a fundamental process, it is not surprising that Lys48 poly-Ub chains play such a pivotal role in the cell. However, because Ub has six other surface Lys residues, an even greater level of versatility is possible. Indeed, several studies have reported non-standard poly-Ub chains via the Lys6 (7Wu-Baer F. Lagrazon K. Yuan W. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34743-34746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), Lys29 (8Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), Lys11 (9Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) residues of Ub. Furthermore, such atypical conjugates have been shown to function in roles other than proteasome degradation. Some of the best-documented examples of such poly-Ub chains involve those through Lys63, which have been demonstrated in a stress response (8Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), mitochondrial inheritance (4Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), plasma membrane protein endocytosis (11Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), ribosome function (10Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and DNA postreplication repair (12Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Because all Ubcs, regardless of the poly-Ub chain synthesized, have a well-conserved core domain that houses the active site (13Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), part of the allure in studying atypical Ub chains lies in how they are assembled. The only example to date came as a breakthrough in the field when it was discovered that conjugation via Lys63 occurred through a novel mechanism requiring a heterodimeric complex between Ubc13 and a Ubc enzyme variant (Uev), Mms2 (12Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Uev proteins are similar in secondary and tertiary structure to E2s, but they lack the catalytic active site that forms thiolesters with Ub. Thus, it was originally proposed that the UEVs might act as dominant-negative regulators of ubiquitination (14Koonin E.V. Abagyan R.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 330-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, subsequent studies revealed otherwise. UBC13, MMS2, and Lys63 poly-Ub chains were shown to be indispensable for promoting postreplication repair (12Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Spurred by the uniqueness of E2-Uev-mediated catalysis of Lys63 Ub chains, the crystal structures for the human (15Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and yeast (16VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) Ubc13-Mms2 complexes were solved; both structures were highly superimposable, and each study proposed a similar means for chain catalysis. The three-dimensional studies were followed by extensive NMR analyses that revealed the unique mechanistic basis behind Lys63 poly-Ub chain catalysis. Briefly, a T-shaped heterodimer is formed that allows Mms2 to orient an acceptor Ub through non-covalent contacts such that its Lys63 residue is presented to the donor Ub at the Ubc13 active site. An isopeptide bond can then form between the two molecules, and Lys63 di-Ub is free to exit through a channel leading from the Ubc13 active site toward a E3 binding site (17McKenna S.

The revelation of Ubc13-Mms2-mediated catalysis suggested the necessity of heterodimer formation between the E2 and Uev; however, studies to date have not addressed in detail the significance of the Ubc13-Uev interface. Therefore, we carried out studies using structural information and a site-directed mutagenesis approach to provide a dedicated structure-function study of the human Ubc13-Mms2 interface. In our rational approach, the goals were as follows: 1) to identify key residues in Ubc13 and Mms2 that are important for complex formation; 2) to demonstrate a correlation between Ubc13-Mms2 interaction and function; and 3) to determine why Mms2 forms a specific complex with Ubc13, and not other Ubcs. Strains and Cell Culture—Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid strains used in this study include PJ69-4A (MATa trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ PGAL2-ADE2 LYS2::PGAL1-HIS3 met2::PGAL7-lacZ, a gift from Dr. P. James (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). A wild-type haploid S. cerevisiae strain HK580-10D (MATa ade-1 can1–100 his3–11,15 leu2–3, 112 trp1–1 ura3–1) was received from Dr. H. Klein (New York University) and used as the recipient to delete the entire MMS2 open reading frame by a one-step gene replacement method (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) using an mms2Δ::HIS3 cassette generated through PCR amplification as previously described (22Xiao W. Chow B.L. Fontanie T. Ma L. Bacchetti S. Hryciw T. Broomfield S. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A ubc13Δ HK580-10D strain was created with the same approach, using a ubc13Δ::HIS3 cassette (23Brusky J. Zhu Y. Xiao W. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C either in a complete yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium or in a synthetic dextrose (SD) medium supplemented with necessary nutrients as recommended (24Adames A.G. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYD. E.1997Google Scholar). To make plates, 2% agar was added to either YPD or SD medium prior to autoclaving. Yeast cells were transformed using a dimethyl sulfoxide-enhanced LiAc method as described previously (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial strains used in this study include BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene), an Epicurian coli strain that contains extra copies of the argU, ileY, and leuW tRNA genes to facilitate recombinant protein expression. Escherichia coli DH10B was used for DNA plasmid propagation and isolation. Bacterial cells containing plasmids were cultured at 37 °C in LB supplemented with ampicillin to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Plasmids—The human UBC13 open reading frame was PCR-amplified as an EcoRI-SalI fragment and cloned into pGBT9 (purchased from Clontech) to form pGBT-hUBC13, an N-terminal fusion to Gal4BD. The same UBC13 fragment was similarly cloned into pGEX6 (purchased from Amersham Biosciences) to form an N-terminal gene fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and named pGEX-hUBC13. Human MMS2 cDNAs were isolated as previously reported (26Xiao W. Lin S.L. Broomfield S. Chow B.L. Wei Y.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3908-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The open reading frame was PCR-amplified as a BamHI-SalI fragment and cloned into pGAD424 (Clontech) to form an N-terminal fusion to GAL4AD, named pGAD-hMMS2. The same MMS2 fragment was cloned into pGEX6 to form an N-terminal fusion to GST, named pGEX-hMMS2. Yeast two-hybrid or GST fusion plasmids containing sitespecific mutations within hUBC13 or hMMS2 were constructed by the mega-primer approach (27Ke S.H. Madison E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3371-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—BL21(DE3)-RIL cells transformed with pGEX6-hMMS2 or pGEX-hUBC13 were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB supplemented with ampicillin and then subcultured 1:10 the following day. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). Crude extracts were generated after cell lysis by French Press at 10,000 p.s.i., and the soluble fraction was retained after centrifugation at 30,000 rpm. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Soluble extracts were passed through a prepacked 5-ml GSTrap column (Amersham Biosciences), which was then washed with 5 column volumes of 1× PBS. GST fusion proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione elution buffer (10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and dialyzed extensively against cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0). When needed, cleavage was achieved after the addition of 2 units of Prescission™ Protease per mg of fusion protein with a 16-h incubation and gentle rocking. Cleaved proteins were then applied to a GSTrap column in order to remove the GST component from hMms2 or hUbc13. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA™ Protein Assay Kit (Pierce) as per the instruction manual. GST Pull-downs—GST pull-downs were performed using MicroSpin GST Purification Modules (Amersham Biosciences). 0.03 mg of purified GST fusion protein in 1× PBS was loaded and incubated in the purification module for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The module was then washed three times with 500 μl of PBS. Subsequently, 0.03 mg of purified, non-fused hUbc13 or hMms2 in 1× PBS was added to the module, and the incubation was continued for another hour at 4 °C. The module was washed again three times with 500 μl of PBS, and then 80 μl of reduced glutathione elution buffer was added to elute the affinitypurified proteins. Eluted samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—The yeast two-hybrid strain PJ69-4A (28James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transformed with different combinations of Gal4BD and Gal4AD constructs. The co-transformed colonies were initially selected on SD-Trp-Leu. For each transformation, at least four independent colonies were grown in SD-Trp-Leu media, and then plated as replicates onto SD-Trp-Leu-His + 3-aminotriazole to test the activation of the PGAL1-HIS3 gene. Functional Complementation of Yeast Mutations by Human Genes— The gradient plate assay was performed as a semiquantitative measurement of relative MMS sensitivity. The HK580-10D mms2Δ or ubc13Δ strains were transformed with pGAD-hMMS2 or pGBT-UBC13 two-hybrid plasmid, respectively. At least three individual transformants were each inoculated into 1 ml of SD minimal media to select for overnight cultures containing the plasmids. To prepare the plates, molten YPD agar (30 ml) was mixed with the appropriate concentration of MMS to form a bottom layer. The gradient was created by pouring this layer into tilted square Petri dishes. After solidification for 1 h, the Petri dishes were returned flat, and 30 ml of the same molten agar without MMS was poured to form the top layer. Cells (0.1 ml) were taken from an overnight culture, mixed with 0.4 ml of sterile water and 0.5 ml of 2% molten YPD agar, and then immediately imprinted onto freshly made gradient plates via a microscope slide. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR was performed using a Biacore X instrument. To create a chip for protein interaction analysis, a research-grade CM5 sensor chip was used to immobilize anti-GST antibody by amine coupling, according to instructions in the Amine Coupling and GST Capture Kits (Biacore). Approximately 15,000 response units (RU) of anti-GST antibody was immobilized to each of the two flow cells (Fc1 and Fc2). For all SPR experiments, GST fusion or native proteins were purified to >95% homogeneity and dialyzed against HBS buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20, pH 7.5). A flow rate of 20 μl/min and a 2-min injection of 5 μg/ml protein was used to capture ∼1000 RU of the GST fusion protein (ligand) in Fc2. For a control, purified recombinant GST (GST Capture Kit; Biacore) was similarly injected into the other flow cell to capture ∼1000 RU in Fc1. All data generated were corrected for background in real time (Fc2–Fc1). 10 μl of the soluble protein (analyte) at various concentrations was then applied to the flow cells at 5 μl/min for 2 min to yield binding curves. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was accomplished with a 20 μl/min injection of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, for 2 min. For binding constant determination, Biacore BiaEvaluations software was used to fit curves (1:1 molecular binding with mass transport) generated from free analyte concentrations ranging from 1 × 10–8 to 5 × 10–8 m for Mms2 and from 2.5 × 10–8 to 5 × 10–7m for Ubc13. The χ2 values were 5.2 and 2.3 for GST-Mms2 binding Ubc13 and GST-Ubc13 binding Mms2, respectively. The data are deemed reliable if χ2 is <10. To confirm the reliability of the data, we generated plots of the response (RU) versus free analyte (nm) and calculated the Kd, where Kd = RUmax × slope in the double reciprocal plot (1/response versus 1/free analyte). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—A 0.5-ml conjugation reaction containing Uba1 (20 nm), 35S-labeled Ub (2.5 μm), and Ubc13 or Mms2 (250 nm) in an ATP mixture (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5mm ATP, and 0.6 unit/ml inorganic phosphatase) was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The concentration of each component is noted in the figure legends. Reactions were terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% and processed for SDS-PAGE and subsequent analysis by autoradiography. The Ubc13-Mms2 Structure—The overall structure of the human Ubc13-Mms2 heterodimer is shown in Fig. 1A. Each molecule adopts the characteristic α/β Ubc fold (for example, see Refs. 13Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and 29Worthylake D.K. Prakash S. Prakash L. Hill C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6271-6276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and exhibits a very similar three-dimensional structure, with the main exception that Mms2 lacks two C-terminal α-helices. The N terminus, α1 helix, and the Loop 1 portions of Mms2 pack against Ubc13 to form a unique end-on structure that creates a long channel which buries ∼1500 Å of solvent-accessible surface area (15Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B is oriented similarly to Fig. 1A and reveals the residues in close proximity to the interface. Several factors were important in determining which residues to mutate. First, our early studies on heterodimer formation (17McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicate that the Ubc13-Mms2 complex is stable in salt concentrations of >1 m and therefore suggest a large portion of hydrophobic contacts. Visible inspection reveals that a significant contribution of these hydrophobic contacts likely surround a region that corresponds to a two-residue insertion (Asn12 and Phe13) near the amino end of the α1 helix that is unique to Uev sequences. Second, we previously identified a remarkable change in the orientation of the human Mms2 N terminus upon heterodimer formation with Ubc13 (15Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), implicating an importance for the Ubc13 residues in proximity to the Mms2 N terminus. Last, each of the residues that we mutated is either completely conserved or very similar when comparing protein sequence alignments across various model organisms (Fig. 1C). The panel of residues that were eventually mutated in these studies is indicated in Fig. 1, B and C. Design of Ubc13 Mutants and Their Interaction in the Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Because all evidence to date suggests a specific complex between Mms2 and a single Ubc (namely, Ubc13), we decided to initiate our mutagenesis studies with focus on Ubc13 residues. It was anticipated that this approach would narrow down the search for key residues because Ubcs involved in very different cellular roles still have very conserved core domain sequences. As a precursor to selecting mutants to test in vivo, we were first able to screen two Ala substitutions, Ubc13-Y34A and Ubc13-L83A, in vitro by using the GST pull-down approach as discussed later. These residues had been suggested previously (15Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) to contribute hydrophobic contacts to two separate regions of the interface (see Fig. 1B). However, neither mutation had a significant effect on binding to Mms2 as determined by GST pull-down and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, 2L. Pastushok, T. F. Moraes, and J. Hu, unpublished data. suggesting that residues presumed to contribute hydrophobic contacts have to be changed more drastically. With this in mind, we targeted another residue of the putative hydrophobic core, Ubc13-Phe57, and designed a non-conservative substitution to Glu to introduce a charged polar group into the region. In another attempt to address this same hydrophobic region, we focused the role of the Ubc13-Glu55 residue. Structure analysis implicates a dual role whereby the β- and γ-carbons of Glu55 can provide hydrophobic contacts for Mms2-Phe13, whereas its carboxyl group is used to H-bond with Mms2-Asn12 (15Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The only Ubc13 mutant studied to date was of the corresponding Glu55 in the yeast Ubc13 (16VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), for which Ala was substituted, resulting only in a small titration-dependent effect on binding and function (30Ulrich H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7051-7058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we created a conservative E55Q mutant that was expected to disrupt the H-bonding with Mms2-Asn12 while still retaining hydrophobic contacts and approximate size. The last of our initial Ubc13 mutagenesis focused on Ubc13-Glu60, which is situated near the N terminus of Mms2. Although it is not resolved in the human structure, the yeast Ubc13-Mms2 heterodimer shows an H-bond formed between Ubc13-Glu60 and Mms2-Ser2. It was predicted that a conservative Ubc13-E60Q mutation would disrupt the bond and address the importance of the N terminus of Mms2 in binding Ubc13. In order to determine the effect of the interface mutations on complex formation in the cell, we first employed the yeast two-hybrid assay as a qualitative measure of interaction strength. Fig. 2 shows the effects of these Ubc13 mutations. The mutation at Glu60 (E60Q) does not affect the Ubc13 interaction with Mms2, whereas both E55Q and F57E mutations resulted in the complete disruption of heterodimer formation as visualized in the assay. The severe consequences of the Ubc13-Glu55 and Ubc13-Phe57 mutants prompted us to investigate another residue in this area, Ubc13-Arg70. The Arg70 residue is absolutely conserved among Ubc13s (Fig. 1C). Although it has been suggested that Arg70 can provide hydrophobic contacts in the yeast heterodimer structure (16VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), we note another predominant contribution to the interface as an H-bond with the carbonyl carbon of Mms2-Met41 (Fig. 1B). To address this bond, we created a Ubc13-R70A mutant and tested its binding to Mms2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. As seen in Fig. 2, Ubc13-R70A impaired Ubc13-Mms2 interaction. Design of Mms2 Mutants and Their Interaction in the Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The finding that all of the Ubc13 residue substitutions that affect binding lie in close proximity allowed us to narrow our search for key interface residues in Mms2. Notably, the Mms2 residues that most closely correspond to these Ubc13 mutants are Mms2-Asn12 and Mms2-Phe13, two amino acids unique to Uevs when aligned against Ubcs (16VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Visualization of the Ubc13-Mms2 heterodimer shows an insertion of the Mms2-Phe13 residue into a hydrophobic region, created mainly by the Ubc13 residues mutated above. As with Ubc13-F57E, we decided to exploit this area with an aggressive Mms2-F13E substitution to introduce a polar, charged group to abrogate non-polar contacts. Unlike Phe13, Mms2-Asn12 does not contribute to the hydrophobic core but instead forms H-bonds with the Ubc13 residues Glu55 and Tyr34. However, because only the Ubc13-E55Q mutation showed an effect on binding, we sought to demonstrate a pairwise interaction between it and Mms2-Asn12. We thus created two Asn12 mutations, one as a conservative N12D substitution and a second mutation, N12A, in order to abolish any H-bonding possibilities. When testing these Mms2 mutants in the two-hybrid assay, we found that neither Mms2-N12A nor Mms2-N12D had a detectable effect on inhibiting complex formation as compared with wild-type (Fig. 2). In contrast, the Mms2-F13E mutation seemed to completely disrupt the Ubc13-Mms2 interaction. Because our mutagenesis of Ubc13 yielded mutants that resulted in severe (Ubc13-E55Q and Ubc13-F57E) and slight (Ubc13-R70A) disruption of the Ubc13-Mms2 interaction, we desired to have a complement of Mms2 mutants with similar effects. Therefore, we hypothesized that because the aggressive introduction of a charged group at Mms2-Phe13 (F13E) cause"
https://openalex.org/W1981954000,"Galectin-8, a mammalian β-galactoside binding lectin, functions as an extracellular matrix protein that forms high affinity interactions with integrins. Here we demonstrated that soluble galectin-8 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces growth arrest. These effects cannot be attributed to interference with cell adhesion but can be attributed to a 4–5-fold increase in the cellular content of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which was already evident following a 4-h incubation of H1299 cells with galectin-8. The increase in p21 levels was preceded by a 3–5-fold increase in JNK and protein kinase B (PKB) activities. Accordingly, SP600125, the inhibitor of JNK, and wortmannin, the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is the upstream activator of PKB, inhibited the increase in the cellular content of p21. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant inhibitory form of SEK1, the upstream kinase regulator of JNK, inhibited both JNK activation and p21 accumulation. When p21 expression was inhibited by cycloheximide, galectin-8 directed the cells toward apoptosis, which involves induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Indeed, galectin-8-induced apoptosis was 2-fold higher in HTC (p21-null) cells when compared with parental HTC cells. Because overexpression of galectin-8 attenuates the rate of DNA synthesis, stable colonies that overexpress and secrete galectin-8 can be generated only in cells overexpressing a growth factor receptor, such as the insulin receptor. These results implicate galectin-8 as a modulator of cellular growth through up-regulation of p21. This process involves activation of JNK, which enhances the synthesis of p21, combined with the activation of PKB, which inhibits p21 degradation. These effects of the lectin depended upon protein-sugar interactions and were induced when galectin-8 was present as a soluble ligand or when it was overexpressed in cells. Galectin-8, a mammalian β-galactoside binding lectin, functions as an extracellular matrix protein that forms high affinity interactions with integrins. Here we demonstrated that soluble galectin-8 inhibits cell cycle progression and induces growth arrest. These effects cannot be attributed to interference with cell adhesion but can be attributed to a 4–5-fold increase in the cellular content of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which was already evident following a 4-h incubation of H1299 cells with galectin-8. The increase in p21 levels was preceded by a 3–5-fold increase in JNK and protein kinase B (PKB) activities. Accordingly, SP600125, the inhibitor of JNK, and wortmannin, the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is the upstream activator of PKB, inhibited the increase in the cellular content of p21. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant inhibitory form of SEK1, the upstream kinase regulator of JNK, inhibited both JNK activation and p21 accumulation. When p21 expression was inhibited by cycloheximide, galectin-8 directed the cells toward apoptosis, which involves induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Indeed, galectin-8-induced apoptosis was 2-fold higher in HTC (p21-null) cells when compared with parental HTC cells. Because overexpression of galectin-8 attenuates the rate of DNA synthesis, stable colonies that overexpress and secrete galectin-8 can be generated only in cells overexpressing a growth factor receptor, such as the insulin receptor. These results implicate galectin-8 as a modulator of cellular growth through up-regulation of p21. This process involves activation of JNK, which enhances the synthesis of p21, combined with the activation of PKB, which inhibits p21 degradation. These effects of the lectin depended upon protein-sugar interactions and were induced when galectin-8 was present as a soluble ligand or when it was overexpressed in cells. The proliferation of animal cells is a highly conserved process tightly controlled by the interplay between growth-promoting and growth-limiting signals, the operation of which results in a timed progression through the cell cycle (1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar, 2Coffman J.A. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 321-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Signals that limit cell cycle advance are critically important for the control of cell number and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis both through restraints on cell proliferation and through the induction of programmed cell death (1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2711) Google Scholar, 3Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar). The molecular machinery that controls cell cycle progression is based on the sequential activity of a family of protein kinases known as cyclin-dependent kinases (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). Considering the importance of cyclin-dependent kinases in cellular proliferation, it is not surprising that their activity is exquisitely regulated. One of the key players in this process is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (also known as Waf1 or Cip1) (5Ball K.L. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This protein and its related counterparts, p27 and p57, block progression through the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by forming ternary complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases, thus inhibiting their enzymatic activity (6Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are induced in response to DNA damage through the action of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (7Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Growth factors up-regulate p21 in some cells, but this occurs in a p53-independent manner (8Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Other receptor-ligands can also act as negative regulators of cell cycle progression. These include several cytokines such as Fas ligands (9Muschen M. Warskulat U. Beckmann M.W. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 312-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), interferons (10Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Grander D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D479-D487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β (11Amati B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 3: E112-E113Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and mammalian lectins termed galectins (12Wells V. Mallucci L. Cell. 1991; 64: 91-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Yang R.Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.T. J. Biol.

Galectins are defined by two properties, namely shared amino acid motifs and an affinity for β-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates (15Rabinovich G.A. Rubinstein N. Fainboim L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 741-752PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yang R.Y. Liu F.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Poirier F. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2002; : 95-103PubMed Google Scholar). Although lacking a signal peptide and found mainly in the cytosol, galectins are externalized by an atypical secretory mechanism to mediate cell growth, cell transformation, embryogenesis, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 18Hughes R.C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 19Liu F.T. Patterson R.J. Wang J.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Rabinovich G.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In the present study we set out to determine the molecular elements involved in the growth regulation modulated by galctin-8, a family member of the galectins. Galectin-8 is a widely expressed and secreted protein made up of two homologous carbohydrate recognition domains joined by a short linking peptide (22Hadari Y.R. Paz K. Dekel R. Mestrovic T. Accili D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3447-3453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 23Hadari Y.R. Eisenstein M. Zakut R. Zick Y. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 103-112Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It functions as an extracellular matrix protein, whose binding to cell surface integrins modulates cell adhesion and spreading upon the formation of high affinity interactions with integrins (24Hadari Y.R. Goren R. Levy Y. Amsterdam A. Alon R. Zakut R. Zick Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Levy Y. Arbel-Goren R. Hadari Y.R. Ronen D. Bar-Peled O. Elhanany E. Geiger B. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31285-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These interactions trigger a unique repertoire of signaling cascades that include sustained activation of downstream effectors of the MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated kinase; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; p-JNK, phospho-JNK; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; TDG, thiodigalactoside. and PI3K pathways. These effectors mediate the distinctive cytoskeletal organization that is induced when cells adhere, spread, and migrate on immobilized galectin-8 (26Levy Y. Ronen D. Bershadsky A.D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14533-14542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Zick Y. Eisenstein M. Goren R.A. Hadari Y.R. Levy Y. Ronen D. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 19: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In contrast, transfection of galectin-8 cDNA into human lung carcinoma cells markedly inhibits colony formation, suggesting that the overexpressed galectin-8 may act as an inhibitor of cell growth (24Hadari Y.R. Goren R. Levy Y. Amsterdam A. Alon R. Zakut R. Zick Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Support for this idea is provided by the fact that other galectins were implicated as negative regulators of cell cycle progression (13Yang R.Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Kim H.R. Lin H.M. Biliran H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 414-4154PubMed Google Scholar, 28Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the growth inhibitory effects of galectins in general and galectin-8 in particular remains largely obscure. The results presented here provide evidence that soluble galectin-8 inhibits cellular growth by activating both Jun kinase (JNK) and protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt), which promote the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Furthermore, when the expression of p21 is inhibited, galectin-8 drives the cells into an apoptotic process. These results implicate soluble galectin-8 as a potential modulator of cell growth through the up-regulation of genes encoding for inhibitors of cell cycle progression. Materials—Bacterially expressed recombinant galectin-8 and glutathione S-transferase-galectin-8 were generated as described previously (22Hadari Y.R. Paz K. Dekel R. Mestrovic T. Accili D. Zick Y. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3447-3453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and ligated into the pCDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen). The pCDNA3 construct was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and the insert was gel-purified and ligated in-frame into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to generate the GFP-galectin-8 fusion protein. Generation of CHO Cells Overexpressing Galectin-8 —Galectin-8 cDNA in the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (1–5 μg) was introduced into CHO-T cells (5 × 105 cells per 60-mm plate) by transfection using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Overexpression of GFP-galectin-8 was confirmed 24–48 h post-transfection by Western immunoblot with galectin-8 antibodies or by visualizing the green fluorescence of the GFP. To establish stable clones overexpressing galectin-8, CHO-T cells (5 × 105 cells on 150-mm plates) were co-transfected with pEGFP-galectin-8 (1 μg) or with pEGFP-C1 vector and the helper plasmid pBabe-Puro (0.1 μg), which encodes for a puromycin resistance gene. Puromycin (10 μg/ml) was used to select for resistant clones. Stable clones overexpressing GFP-galectin-8 (CHOGFP-gal-8 cells) or clones overexpressing GFP alone (CHOGFP cells) were selected 21 days following transfection and were propagated further. Expression of GFP or GFP-galectin-8 was detected by Western immunoblotting or by fluorescence microscopy as described above. Generation of H1299 Cells Overexpressing a Dominant Negative Mutant (K129R) of SEK1 (H1299SEK-KR Cells)—A plasmid (10 μg) encoding for a kinase-inactive (K129R) mutant of HA-SEK1 (35Avraham A. Jung S. Samuels Y. Seger R. Ben-Neriah Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2320-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in the pCGN expression vector (HA-SEKKR, kindly provided by R. Seger of the Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel) and a pEGFP-C1 expression plasmid (1 μg) encoding for GFP and a neomycin resistance gene were cotransfected into H1299 cells (5 × 105 cells per 60-mm plate) using JetPEI according to the manufacturer's instructions. Overexpression of HA-SEKKR was confirmed 24–48 h post-transfection by a Western immunoblot with HA antibodies or by visualizing the green fluorescence of GFP under a fluorescence microscope. A G418 sulfate (0.25 mg/ml) was then used to select for G418-resistant clones. Stable clones overexpressing HA-SEKKR were selected 21 days following transfection and propagated further. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cell extracts were prepared in buffer A (25 mm Tris/HCl, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (1:1000), pH 7.5). For extraction of PARP, cell extracts were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing. Insoluble material was removed by 15 min of centrifugation (12,000 × g) at 4 °C. The supernatants were mixed with 5× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) under reducing conditions. The protein bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) and Western-immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Binding of GFP-galectin-8 to Lactosyl-Agarose Beads—CHOGFP-gal-8 or CHOGFP cells were extracted in buffer A. The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Aliquots containing 1 mg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of packed lactosyl-agarose beads. The complexes were washed twice with buffer A and once with PBS. Bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), resolved by means of SDS-PAGE (10% gels), and Western-blotted with antibodies against galectin-8. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cultured cells were incubated for 18 h in serum-free RPMI medium followed by incubation in a medium containing 20% serum for 12 h. The medium was replaced with RPMI medium containing 0.1% serum with or without galectin-8 (5 μm). Following 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/well) was added to the cells for an additional 6 h. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of ice-cold 7.5% trichloroacetic acid. The denatured proteins were washed twice with 98% ice-cold ethanol and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity was counted in a β counter using a scintillation mixture (Ultima Gold; Packard). Surface Expression of Galectin-8 —To assay for the level of expression of cell surface GFP-galectin-8, cells grown to 70% confluence were suspended in 5 mm PBS-EDTA buffer, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (1 μg/1 × 106 cells) in PBS containing 0.01% sodium azide. Cells were washed and further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the indicated secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.01% sodium azide. The emitted fluorescence was detected by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry using FL1 (green fluorescence) and FL2 (red fluorescence) filters (FACScan; BD Biosciences). Assay of BrdUrd Incorporation—Cultured cells were plated on glass coverslips in tissue culture medium. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with 10 μm BrdUrd, washed with PBS, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Following several washes with PBS, 2 n HCl containing 0.3% Triton X-100 was added to the fixed cells for 20 min. Following several washes with PBS, the slides were incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with monoclonal BrdUrd antibodies (1:10). Cells were washed and further incubated for 1 h at 22 °C with secondary Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies. Following several washes with PBS, the slides were mounted onto cover glasses and analyzed for red fluorescence (Cy3) at 570 nm and for green fluorescence (GFP) at 525 nm using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop). Apoptosis—Apoptosis was assessed by assaying the extent of PARP cleavage. Cell extracts were prepared in buffer A, and the proteins were resolved by means of SDS-PAGE (10% gels), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and subjected to Western immunoblotting with anti-PARP antibodies. Real Time PCR—Adherent H1299 cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 6 h. The cells were further incubated with or without galectin-8 for the indicated times. At the end of incubation cells were washed once with PBS, and total RNA was isolated by homogenizing the cells that were grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates in TRI-Reagent. The homogenates were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Chloroform (1 ml) was then added, and the mixture was mixed vigorously and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the aqueous phase was transferred into a fresh tube and 0.8 ml of isopropanol was added, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed once with 75% ethanol and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA samples were translated to cDNA using a mixture of 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTP, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, and 250 ng of random hexamers. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 50 min, and 72 °C for 10 min. Quantitative PCR analysis in PRISM 7000 was performed using SYBR Green PCR master mix from Applied Biosystems International according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction contained 50 ng of cDNA and 500 nm specific primers for human p21(5′-TGAGCCGCGACTGTGATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTCGGTGACAAAGTCGAAGTTC-3′ (reverse)). Results were normalized for the expression of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using 5′-ACCCACTCCTCCACCTTTGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGT-3′ (reverse) primers. Northern Blot Analysis—10-μg samples of total RNA were separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-XL membrane, and hybridized with a [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled p21 probe corresponding to the coding sequence of the human p21 gene (630 bp) (GenBank™ accession number BC013967). Membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 5 h at –20 °C. The blot was stripped and re-hybridized with β-actin probe under the same conditions for sample loading controls. Generation of Cells Overexpressing Galectin-8 —We have shown previously that transfection of H1299 cells (human non-small cell lung carcinoma) with galectin-8 cDNA significantly reduces (∼75%) the number of G-418 resistant colonies when compared with cells transfected with an empty vector (24Hadari Y.R. Goren R. Levy Y. Amsterdam A. Alon R. Zakut R. Zick Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, no stable colonies could be detected when naïve CHO (CHO-P) cells were transfected with the gene encoding GFP-galectin-8 (not shown). To override the cytostatic effects induced by the overexpressed galectin-8, its cDNA was introduced into CHO cells that overexpress the insulin receptor (CHO-T cells). These cells were chosen under the assumption that the growth-promoting signals provided by the overexpressed insulin receptors would overcome the growth-inhibitory effects of galectin-8. Overexpression of GFP-galectin-8 could be detected 24 h post-transfection by Western immunoblotting with galectin-8 antibodies (Fig. 1A, left). Cells overexpressing galectin-8 continued to accumulate up to 72 h post-transfection, but their number started to decline thereafter (Fig. 1B). The ability to overexpress galectin-8 by transient transfection prompted us to generate stable cell clones that overexpress this protein. The overexpressed GFP-galectin-8 maintained its biological activity as a lectin. This was evident by its ability to bind to a column of lactosyl-agarose (Fig. 1A, right). Furthermore, similar to its endogenous counterpart (24Hadari Y.R. Goren R. Levy Y. Amsterdam A. Alon R. Zakut R. Zick Y. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2385-2397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the overexpressed galectin-8 was secreted and remained bound to the cell surface. Flow cytometry analysis for the presence of secreted cell surface GFP-galectin-8 revealed that binding of galectin-8-antibodies to the surface of intact CHOGFP-gal-8 cells was ∼3-fold higher than that of antibodies binding to CHOGFP cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in CHO cells that transiently overexpress Myc-tagged galectin-8 (CHOMyc-gal-8, Fig. 1D). The secreted protein maintained, at least partially, its binding to cell surface receptors through protein-sugar interactions. This was evident by the fact that secreted galectin-8, introduced into CHO cells by transient transfection, could be partially dissociated from the cell surface upon incubation with lactose (Fig. 1E). Overexpression of GFP-galectin-8 Inhibits Cellular Proliferation—To better characterize the effects of galectin-8 on cell growth, the fate of cells overexpressing galectin-8 was studied. CHO-T cells, which transiently overexpress GFP-galectin-8, exhibited reduced DNA synthesis as evident by their reduced ability to incorporate BrdUrd when compared with control (GFP-transfected) cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in CHO-T cells that stably overexpress GFP-galectin-8. BrdUrd incorporation was significantly reduced (∼50%) in these cells, when compared with BrdUrd incorporation into control GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). The effects of the overexpressed galectin-8 could be mimicked by incubation of H1299 cells with soluble galectin-8. As shown in Fig. 2C, such treatment reduced by 50% the rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the cells. These findings suggest that overexpression of galectin-8 or the addition of soluble galectin-8 attenuates the rate of DNA synthesis, leading to the inhibition of cell growth. Galectin-8 Induces Elevation in the Cellular Content of the Cyclin-dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21—The attenuated cell growth induced by galectin-8 could involve an increase in the cellular content of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21 (waf-1) (6Jacks T. Weinberg R.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, elevated levels of p21 were already evident 4 h following the incubation of H1299 cells with galectin-8, and a maximal increase was observed by 24 h (Fig. 3A). The effects of galectin-8 were specific, because it did not increase the level of expression of other proteins like Bcl-2, Fas (not shown), PKB, or ERK1/2 (Fig. 5). The effects of galectin-8 were induced upon galectin-8 binding to cell surface glycoconjugates, because soluble galectin-8 failed to increase the cellular content of p21 when the cells were incubated in the presence of TDG, which inhibits protein-sugar interactions (Fig. 3B).Fig. 5Effects of galectin-8 on JNK and PKB activities. H1299 cells (5 × 105 cells per 35-mm dish) were incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 18 h and then incubated further for 9 h with the indicated concentrations of galectin-8 (A). Alternatively, serum-starved cells were incubated for the indicated times with galectin-8 (5 μm), TDG (10 mm), or"
https://openalex.org/W2158139146,"Vaults have been suggested to play a direct role in multidrug resistance (MDR) to anticancer drugs. The human major vault protein (MVP) also known as lung resistance-related protein (LRP) represents the predominant component of vaults that may be involved in the defense against xenobiotics. Here, we demonstrate that besides MDR-related cytostatics, also the non-MDR-related drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was able to induce MVP mRNA and protein expression. Treatment with 5-FU amplified the binding activity and interaction of the transcription factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) with the Y-box of the human MVP gene promoter in a time-dependent manner. 5-FU also induced reporter expressions driven by a panel of newly generated MVP promoter deletion mutants. Interestingly, stably YB-1 overexpressing cell clones showed enhanced binding of YB-1 to the Y-box motif, associated with enhanced basal as well as 5-FU-inducible MVP promoter-driven reporter expressions. Moreover, transduction of YB-1 cDNA led to increased expression of endogenous MVP protein. Under physiological conditions, we observed a strong coexpression of MVP and YB-1 in human colon carcinoma specimen. In summary, our data demonstrate a direct involvement of YB-1 in controlling basal and 5-FU-induced MVP promoter activity. Therefore, YB-1 is directly linked to MVP-mediated drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2143594252,"The expression of arginine metabolism in Lactococcus lactis is controlled by the two homologous transcriptional regulators ArgR and AhrC. Genome sequence analyses have shown that the occurrence of multiple homologues of the ArgR family of transcriptional regulators is a common feature of many low-G + C Gram-positive bacteria. Detailed studies of ArgR type regulators have previously only been carried out in bacteria containing single regulators. Here, we present a first characterization of the two L. lactis arginine regulators by means of gel retardation and DNase I footprinting. ArgR of L. lactis was shown to bind to the promoter regions of both the arginine biosynthetic argCJDBF operon and the arginine catabolic arcABD1C1C2TD2yvaD operon, but in an arginine-independent manner. Surprisingly, AhrC alone was unable to bind to DNA. Arginine-dependent DNA binding was obtained by mixing the two regulators in gel retardation assays. With both regulators present, the addition of arginine led to increased binding of ArgR-AhrC to the biosynthetic argC promoter but also to diminished binding to the catabolic arcA promoter. Footprinting showed ArgR-AhrC protection of regions containing ARG box operator sequences preceding argC. In the absence of AhrC, ArgR protected sites in the arcA promoter region with similarity to ARG box half-sites, here called ARC boxes. We propose a model for repression of arginine biosynthesis and activation of catabolism by anti-repression, involving arginine-dependent interaction between the two L. lactis regulator proteins, ArgR and AhrC.

Regulation is exerted by binding of single transcriptional regulators of the ArgR family to so-called ARG operator sites preceding the relevant target genes, generally leading to repression of arginine biosynthetic genes and activation of catabolic genes, in the presence of arginine. Crystal structures of the ArgR type transcriptional regulators of Escherichia coli (ArgREc (13Sunnerhagen M. Nilges M. Otting G. Carey J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Van Duyne G.D. Ghosh G. Maas W.K. Sigler P.B. J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 6: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), and Bacillus subtilis (AhrCBsu (16Dennis C.C. Glykos N.M. Parsons M.R. Phillips S.E. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)) have revealed these to be structurally similar proteins, making up a complex of six identical subunits. The subunits are arranged in hexameric structures, which are organized as dimers of trimers. In E. coli and B. subtilis, the hexameric structure is maintained both in the absence and presence of arginine (4Czaplewski L.G. North A.K. Smith M.C. Baumberg S. Stockley P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Lim D.B. Oppenheim J.D. Eckhardt T. Maas W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6697-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas the regulator of B. stearothermophilus mainly exists as a trimer that assembles into hexamers dependent of the concentrations of arginine, protein, and DNA (5Dion M. Charlier D. Wang H. Gigot D. Savchenko A. Hallet J.N. Glansdorff N. Sakanyan V. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Ni J. Sakanyan V. Charlier D. Glansdorff N. Van Duyne G.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Six arginine molecules are bound at the trimer-trimer interface, strengthening the interaction between the trimers and at the same time introducing a conformational change in the regulator, thus increasing its affinity for operator binding (4Czaplewski L.G. North A.K. Smith M.C. Baumberg S. Stockley P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An ArgR monomer consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central hinge region, and a C-terminal multimerization and arginine-sensing domain. In hexameric form, the DNA-binding domains surround the core of C-terminal domains (14Van Duyne G.D. Ghosh G. Maas W.K. Sigler P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 377-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Ni J. Sakanyan V. Charlier D. Glansdorff N. Van Duyne G.D. Nat. Struct.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies of mainly ArgREc have allowed identification of specific amino acid residues making up the N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding region (18Tian G. Maas W.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Additionally, a range of residues in the C-terminal domain has been shown to be important for either subunit multimerization or arginine binding (18Tian G. Maas W.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Burke M. Merican A.F. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Chen S.H. Merican A.F. Sherratt D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ARG operator sites consist of pairs of 18-bp palindromic sequences (called ARG boxes), of which the 5′-TnTGnATwwwwATnCAnA-3′ (where conserved residues are capitalized, n represents any nucleotide, and w represents A or T) consensus sequence in E. coli (21Maas W.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 631-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is conserved with only small variations in various other organisms studied (22Makarova K.S. Mironov A.A. Gelfand M.S. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (research. 8): 0013.1-000013Google Scholar). The distance between the ARG boxes varies between 2 bp (e.g. for the B. stearothermophilus argC operator) and 3 bp (for the E. coli biosynthetic argCO1 operator). This spacing means that the boxes are aligned on the same side of the DNA helix. Also, single ARG boxes can confer regulator binding and regulation. This is exemplified by the arginine catabolic rocABC and rocDEF operons of B. subtilis (23Klingel U. Miller C.M. North A.K. Stockley P.G. Baumberg S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Gardan R. Rapoport G. Debarbouille M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 843-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 25Miller C.M. Baumberg S. Stockley P.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the biosynthetic argGHCJBD operon of Thermotoga maritima (9Morin A. Huysveld N. Braun F. Dimova D. Sakanyan V. Charlier D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 537-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ARG box sequence variation, spacing, and location are factors that determine the strength of regulator-DNA interaction. Whereas single ArgR-type regulators have been studied in detail, the continuously increasing number of bacterial genome sequences becoming available make it clear that several low-G + C Gram-positive organisms harbor multiple homologues of ArgR type regulators (see overview by Belitsky (26Belitsky B.R. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and its closest relatives: From genes to cells. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.2002: 203-231Google Scholar)). A few recent investigations have proven that these ArgR homologues are not merely orthologous but fulfill distinct functions in these organisms. A study in Enterococcus faecalis revealed the presence, upstream of the arginine catabolic arcABCRD operon, of two genes named argR1 and argR2 (10Barcelona-Andres B. Marina A. Rubio V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6289-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although the function of the E. faecalis ArgR-type regulators was not investigated, it was proven that the divergently transcribed argR1 and argR2 genes were differentially expressed in response to arginine and glucose, possibly via putative ARG boxes preceding the genes (10Barcelona-Andres B. Marina A. Rubio V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6289-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In our laboratory, a random knock-out screening led to the identification of the argR and ahrC genes in L. lactis, the gene products of which were responsible for repression of the arginine biosynthetic gltSargE operon (12Larsen R. Buist G. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Further characterization showed that both ArgR and AhrC of L. lactis are necessary for repression of the arginine biosynthetic argCJDBF, gltSargE, and argGH operons; they do not complement each other. Interestingly, arginine-dependent regulation of the arginine catabolic arcABD1C1C2TD2yvaD operon also required both ArgR and AhrC, but in a manner different from that of arginine biosynthesis. Whereas deletion of argR resulted in constitutively increased expression of the arc genes, deletion of ahrC gave constitutively decreased expression. However, arc expression was increased in an L. lactis argR ahrC double mutant, indicating that AhrC is not a classical activator of arc expression and, additionally, that ArgR might act as a repressor of arc expression (12Larsen R. Buist G. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A thorough recent study of arginine regulation in Lactobacillus plantarum showed that repression of arginine biosynthesis was abolished when point mutations were introduced in either one of two separate genes encoding putative ArgR-type regulators or in promoter regions containing ARG box-like sequences (11Nicoloff H. Arsene-Ploetze F. Malandain C. Kleerebezem M. Bringel F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6059-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this work, we have sought to clarify the molecular basis for the complex dual mechanism of ArgR-AhrC-mediated regulation in L. lactis. To this end, purified ArgR and AhrC were investigated for their function in DNA binding and arginine sensing, with respect to both repression of arginine biosynthesis and activation of catabolism. The experimental evidence allowed us to propose a comprehensive model of ArgR-AhrC-mediated gene regulation in L. lactis. Bacterial Strains and Growth Media—Strains of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (listed in Table I) were routinely cultivated at 30 °C in M17 (27Terzaghi B.E. Sandine W.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) medium containing 0.5% (w/v) glucose (GM17). For primer extensions and citrulline determinations, cells were grown in a chemically defined medium (CDM15) as described previously (28Kunji E.R. Mierau I. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with 0.5% (w/v) glucose as carbon source and free amino acids as nitrogen source. Arginine was added to the CDM15 as described throughout. When required, 4 μg/ml erythromycin (Em), 4 μg/ml chloramphenicol (Cm), or 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) was added to the growth medium. Chemicals and antibiotics were purchased from Merck and Sigma. For induction of genes cloned behind the nisA promoter, Nisaplin (Aplin & Barnett Ltd., Beaminster, Dorset, UK) was suspended 1:1 (w/v) in 50% ethanol, thoroughly vortexed, and centrifuged (5 min at 12,000 rpm), after which the supernatant was added 1:1 × 10-6 (v/v) to the culture, unless stated otherwise.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsNameCharacteristicsSource or referenceL. lactisMG1363L. lactis ssp. cremoris, plasmid-free derivative of NCDO 712Ref. 41Gasson M.J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5633-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) as helper plasmid, as described before (12Larsen R. Buist G. Kuipers O.P. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), yielding L. lactis NZΔahrC and L. lactis NZΔargRahrC (Table I). Chromosomal deletions were confirmed by PCR and by Southern blotting. Probe-labeling, hybridization, and detection was done with the ECL direct nucleic acid labeling system (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Overexpression and Isolation of His-tagged ArgR and AhrC Proteins—The argR and ahrC genes were amplified from MG1363 chromosomal DNA with the primer pairs argR-Nhis1/argR-MAL2 and ahrC-Nhis1/ahrC-His2, respectively, thereby introducing N-terminal hexahistidine tags (His tags). The PCR products were cloned as NcoI/HindIII and NcoI/XbaI fragments, respectively, in the multiple cloning site of the PnisA expression vector pNG8048E, resulting in the plasmids pNG-HisArgR and pNG-HisAhrC. The expression constructs were made and maintained in NZ9000ΔargRahrC and overexpression of the His-tagged regulators, His6-ArgR and His6-AhrC, was induced by the addition of Nisaplin (as described above) to the cultures during the midexponential phase of growth in GM17. After induction for 2 h, 900 ml of cell culture were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 16 ml of column buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cells were disrupted by shaking twice for 1 min at room temperature with glass beads (75-105 μm) in a Biospec Mini-BeadBeater-8 (Biospec). Samples were kept on ice between steps. Glass beads and cell debris were removed by two centrifugation steps (5 min at 14,000, 4 °C). Proteins were purified by affinity fast protein liquid chromatography; crude cell extracts were applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and washed with column buffer until complete removal of bulk proteins, followed by ∼10 volumes of wash buffer (column buffer plus 18.75 mm imidazole). Elution was done with elution buffer (column buffer plus 250 mm imidazole). Elution fractions and pooled fractions after removal of imidazole were analyzed for yield and purity by SDS-PAGE. Imidazole was removed from the eluate by dialysis, using dialysis membranes from Medicell International Ltd. (London, UK). Since dialysis of His6-ArgR resulted in significant protein precipitation, imidazole was removed from His6-ArgR samples using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). In-gel samples of purified His6-AhrC were analyzed by MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviation used is: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. (Analytical Biochemistry, Department of Pharmacy, University of Groningen, The Netherlands). Construction of Regulator Point Mutations—The argR and ahrC genes, amplified by PCR using the argR-NZ/argR-MAL2 and ahrC-NZ/ahrC-5 primer pairs, respectively, were blunt end-cloned into the SmaI restriction site of pUC19 (35Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). The proper constructs were picked up in E. coli XL1-Blue. Point mutations were introduced in argR and ahrC using the protocol of the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Whole-plasmid PCR was performed using the native Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to make the following ArgR and AhrC mutations (primers used are shown in parentheses): ArgR-A126D (argR-MG(A126D)-1/argR-MG(A126D)-2); ArgR-D127G (argR-MG(D127G)-1/argR-MG(D127G)-2); AhrC-D124G (ahrC-MG-(D124G)-1/ahrC-MG(D124G)-2); AhrC-D126G (ahrC-MG(D126G)-1/ahrC-MG(D126G)-2) (see Table II). Mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing, and mutated genes were subsequently cloned as RcaI/HindIII and RcaI/XbaI restriction fragments into the NcoI/HindIII and NcoI/XbaI sites of the PnisA expression vector pNG8048E, respectively, using L. lactis NZ9000 as the cloning host. The plasmid constructs were again verified by nucleotide sequencing and used to transform L. lactis strains NZΔahrC and NZΔargRahrC. Gel Retardation Assays—DNA binding of His6-ArgR and His6-AhrC was investigated by gel retardation (band shift) assays, essentially as described by Ebbole and Zalkin (36Ebbole D.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were amplified using Pwo DNA polymerase with corresponding primer pairs as follows: PargC, argC-2/argC-5; ParcA, arcA-1/arcA-7rev; “glnA,” glnA-3/glnA-5; 1/1rev, arcA-1/arcA-1rev; 3/3rev, arcA-3/arcA-3rev; 4/4rev, arcA-4/arcA-4rev; 5/5rev, arcA-5/arcA-5rev; 6/6rev, arcA-6/arcA-6rev; 7/7rev, arcA-7/arcA-7rev; 10/10rev, arcA-10/arcA-10rev (see Table II). PCR products (∼2 μg) were end-labeled with 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating for 10 min at 70 °C, and labeled probes were purified with the Roche Applied Science PCR product purification kit. Binding reactions were performed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 8.7% (v/v) glycerol, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) with 5000 cpm of labeled probe, in a final volume of 20 μl. Varying concentrations of His6-ArgR, His6-AhrC, and arginine were used as specified. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis (∼1 h at 90 V) in 6% polyacrylamide gels, using the Protean II Minigel System (Bio-Rad) with TBE as electrophoresis buffer. Gels were vacuum-dried and developed using a Cyclone Phosphor Screen Storage system (Packard Bioscience) and OptiQuant software version 3.0 for analysis (Packard Instrument Co). The intensity of single bands was measured using Quantity One software, version 4.1.0 (Bio-Rad), and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated as the concentration of regulator at which 50% of the free probe was shifted. DNase I Footprinting Assays—His6-ArgR and His6-AhrC DNA binding sites were analyzed by DNase I footprinting (protection) assays, largely according to the protocol of the Sure Track Footprinting Kit (Amersham Biosciences). The PargC region was amplified with the argC-7 (forward) and argC-2 (reverse) primers, one of which was end-labeled (2 h at 37 °C) with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, before standard PCR with the respective unlabeled primers. The ParcA region was likewise amplified and labeled, using the arcA-1 (forward) and arcA-7rev (reverse) primers. Binding reactions were performed as described for the gel retardation assays (see above), except that the final volume was 40 μl, and 150,000 cpm of labeled DNA was used per lane. Concentrations of His6-ArgR, His6-AhrC, and arginine were as specified. DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) degradation and fragment separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (National Diagnostics) were performed as described previously (37Hamoen L.W. van Werkhoven A.F. Bijlsma J.J. Dubnau D. Venema G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Detection was performed as described for the gel retardations (see above). Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions were made from the footprinting probes according to Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and were run next to the footprinting lanes to determine the sizes of degradation fragments. RNA Isolation and Primer Extension—RNA was isolated from cells grown to the midexponential phase of growth (A600 = 0.6-0.7) in CDM15 with 0.1 or 10 mm arginine. RNA isolation was carried out using macaloid to remove DNA and the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). RNA quantity was determined spectrophotometrically (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and RNA quality was verified on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using RNA"

https://openalex.org/W2016062108,"Many Gram-positive bacteria produce ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, often termed bacteriocins. Genes encoding pediocin-like bacteriocins are generally cotranscribed with or in close vicinity to a gene encoding a cognate immunity protein that protects the bacteriocin-producer from their own bacteriocin. We present the first crystal structure of a pediocin-like immunity protein, EntA-im, conferring immunity to the bacteriocin enterocin A. Determination of the structure of this 103-amino acid protein revealed that it folds into an antiparallel four-helix bundle with a flexible C-terminal part. The fact that the immunity protein conferring immunity to carnobacteriocin B2 also consists of a four-helix bundle (Sprules, T., Kawulka, K. E., and Vederas, J. C. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 11740–11749) strongly indicates that this is a conserved structural motif in all pediocin-like immunity proteins. The C-terminal half of the immunity protein contains a region that recognizes the C-terminal half of the cognate bacteriocin, and the flexibility in the C-terminal end of the immunity protein might thus be an important characteristic that enables the immunity protein to interact with its cognate bacteriocin. By homology modeling of three other pediocin-like immunity proteins and calculation of the surface charge distribution for EntA-im and the three structure models, different charge distributions were observed. The differences in the latter part of helix 3, the beginning of helix 4, and the loop connecting these helices might also be of importance in determining the specificity.

The pediocin-like bacteriocins constitute an important and well-studied class of ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides produced by lactic acid bacteria. At least 20 different pediocin-like bacteriocins have been characterized (1Ennahar S. Sashihara T. Sonomoto K. Ishizaki A. FEMS Microbiol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9508-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They contain between 37 and 48 residues (1Ennahar S. Sashihara T. Sonomoto K. Ishizaki A. FEMS Microbiol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9508-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and they are all cationic, display antilisteria activity, and kill target cells by permeabilizing the cell membrane (4Chikindas M.L. García-Garcerá M.J. Driessen A.J. Ledeboer A.M. Nissen-Meyer J. Nes I.F. Abee T. Konings W.N. Venema G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3577-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Moll G.N. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Moreover, they have very similar primary structures, especially in the N-terminal domain (6Nes I.F. Holo H. Fimland G. Hauge H.H. Nissen-Meyer J. Dutton J.D. Haxell M.A. McArthur H.A.I. Wax R.G. Unmodified Peptide-Bacteriocins (Class II) Produced by Lactic Acid Bacteria. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2002: 81-115Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that pediocin-like bacteriocins contain two structural units, a cationic N-terminal β-sheet domain and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain (7Uteng M. Hauge H.H. Markwick P.R.

Markwick P.R. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Muhle-Goll C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11417-11426Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These two domains are separated by a flexible hinge that enables the two domains to move relative to each other. The N-terminal domain binds to the target cell surface (10Chen Y. Ludescher R.D.

Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas the more hydrophobic C-terminal domain enters the hydrophobic part of the cell membrane (3Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9508-9515Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Fimland G. Blingsmo O.R. Sletten K. Jung G. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ.

Despite their extensive sequence similarity, the pediocin-like bacteriocins differ markedly with respect to the bacteria they kill (6Nes I.F. Holo H. Fimland G. Hauge H.H. Nissen-Meyer J. Dutton J.D.

Middelhoven P.H. Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies show that the hydrophobic C-terminal domain of pediocin-like bacteriocins is important in determining this target cell specificity (15Johnsen L. Fimland G. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9243-9250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunity proteins protect bacteriocin-producing organisms against the antimicrobial activity of their own bacteriocin. The gene encoding an immunity protein is generally cotranscribed with or in close vicinity to the gene encoding the cognate pediocin-like bacteriocin (16Axelsson L. Holck A. J.

The primary structures of most immunity proteins of pediocin-like bacteriocins have been deduced from DNA sequences (22Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The proteins display 5–85% sequence similarities, contain between 88 and 115 amino acids, and have been classified into three subgroups (A, B, and C) based on sequence homology (14Eijsink V.G. Skeie M. Middelhoven P.H. Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3275-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The immunity proteins show a high degree of specificity with respect to the bacteriocin they recognize, although some immunity proteins render cells immune to a few pediocin-like bacteriocins in addition to their cognate bacteriocin (22Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Using hybrid immunity proteins and hybrid bacteriocins, it was recently shown that the C-terminal half of the immunity proteins contains a region that is involved in specific recognition of the C-terminal hairpin-like domain of the bacteriocin they confer immunity to (15Johnsen L. Fimland G. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9243-9250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The mode of action of the immunity proteins is not known, but their effectiveness is strain-dependent, and the functionality of the immunity proteins thus appears to depend partly on strain-dependent factors (22Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that they may act by disturbing the interaction between the bacteriocin and a (putative) membrane-located bacteriocin receptor (19Quadri L.E. Sailer M. Terebiznik M.R. Roy K.L.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The immunity proteins for pediocin-like bacteriocins have been shown to be located intracellularly, with only a small proportion (about 1%) possibly being associated with the cell membrane (17Dayem M.A. Fleury Y. Devilliers G. Chaboisseau E. Girard R. Nicolas P. Delfour A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 138: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quadri L.E. Sailer M. Terebiznik M.R. Roy K.L. Vederas J.C. Stiles M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1144-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Circular dichroism studies indicate that the immunity proteins do not interact extensively with membranes; exposing the proteins to lipid micelles does not induce gross alterations in the protein conformation (23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the pediocin-like immunity protein for carnobacteriocin B2 has recently been determined by NMR spectroscopy (26Sprules T. Kawulka K.E. Vederas J.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This is a globular protein, which belongs to subgroup C. It forms an antiparallel four-helix bundle (helices 1–4) with the C-terminal region (containing a fifth helix and an extended strand) oriented approximately perpendicularly across helices 3 and 4 (26Sprules T. Kawulka K.E. Vederas J.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we present the first x-ray structure, at 1.6-Å resolution, of an immunity protein (EntA-im) from lactic acid bacteria. The protein confers immunity to the pediocin-like bacteriocin enterocin A and belongs to subgroup A. Construction of Enterocin A Immunity Protein Expression Plasmid— PCR fragments containing the EntA-im gene with flanking NdelI and BamHI sites were cloned into the vector pET3a (Novagen), resulting in the plasmid pET3a/entA-im. Specific primers for PCR amplification were synthesized (Eurogentec), and the plasmid pEAIM, which contains the EntA-im gene (22Fimland G. Eijsink V.G. Nissen-Meyer J. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was used as template in the PCR. EntA-im contains only 1 methionine residue, which is located in the N terminus (start codon). To ensure an anomalous signal in the x-ray diffraction experiment, 2 leucine residues (Leu31 and Leu80), were mutated to methionine. The resulting mutated version of EntA-im is termed EntA-im-(L31M+L80M). The Leu31 and Leu80 residues were selected on the basis of a secondary structure prediction (Predator (27Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1997; 27: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar)), which indicated that these 2 residues are located in α-helix regions. The mutations were made by site-directed mutagenesis, and the DNA sequence of the mutated plasmid, pET3a/entA-im-(L31M+L80M), was verified by automated DNA sequencing using a MegaBase DNA analysis system and the DYEnamic reverse transcription dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (GE Healthcare). Protein Expression and Purification—The selenomethionine (Se-Met) 1The abbreviations used are: Se-Met, selenomethionine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.-labeled mutant version of EntA-im (Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M)) was overexpressed in B834(DE3) pLysS cells transformed with pET3a/entA-im-(L31M+L80M) and subsequently purified to homogeneity. Initially, B834(DE3) pLysS cells transformed with pET3a/entA-im-(L31M+L80M) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0 in 200 ml of minimal medium containing methionine (50 mg/liter). Before induction, the cells were spun down, the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of minimal medium, and the cells were starved for 4–8 h at 37 °C before the addition of seleno-l-methionine (50 mg/liter). The cells were then incubated for 30 min before isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the induction was conducted at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min) and frozen before resuspension in Bugbuster Protein Extraction Reagent (20 ml/liter cell culture; Novagen) and addition of Benzonase Nuclease (20 μl/liter cell culture; Novagen). Clarified cell extract was obtained after incubation for 20 min at room temperature and centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 20 min). The cell extract was diluted in 50 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 6) before it was applied on a SP Sepharose Fast Flow cation-exchange column (GE Healthcare). Excess protein was removed by washing with phosphate buffer before Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) was eluted with 0.4 m NaCl. The 0.4 m NaCl fraction from the cation exchanger was diluted in phosphate buffer and then applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a low-pressure Resource Mono S column (GE Healthcare). Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) binds to the column and was detected as the major peak on the optical density profile upon elution with a 0–0.25 m linear NaCl gradient. The protein solution was dialyzed against water overnight before being concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon concentrators (molecular weight cutoff, 3,000; Millipore). The primary structure was confirmed by mass spectrometry on a Voyager-DE RP matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems), with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid used as the matrix. The experimental procedure for purification of native EntA-im has been described previously (28Dalhus B. Johnsen L. Nissen-Meyer J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) were obtained by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop technique in combination with microseeding. The reservoir solution contained 15–30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 and 200 mm sodium tartrate. Two μl of protein solution (typically 3–5 mg/ml protein) were mixed with the same volume of precipitant solution. The drops were allowed to equilibrate for about 24 h before crystal nuclei were transferred from previously obtained thin needle-shaped crystals by use of a cat whisker. Crystals grew within 7–14 days at room temperature. The new crystals were generally thicker than the crystals obtained without seeding. The experimental procedures for crystallization of native EntA-im and subsequent data collection have been described previously (28Dalhus B. Johnsen L. Nissen-Meyer J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Data for Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) were collected at beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) using a ADSC Q210 charge-coupled device detector. Statistics for the data collection are summarized in Table I. All data were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM (29Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF/EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; 26Google Scholar) and thereafter scaled and merged using SCALA (30Collaborative Computational Project Number Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The intensities were converted to structure factors using TRUNCATE in CCP4 (30Collaborative Computational Project Number Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Data collected at the peak of the selenium K-absorption edge (λ = 0.9792 Å) extending to 2.2-Å resolution were scaled but not merged in SCALA (30Collaborative Computational Project Number Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and used as input to SOLVE (31Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) in “SAD mode.” Two selenium positions were located automatically in the asymmetric unit, and the resulting overall figure of merit after SOLVE was 0.36 with an overall Z-score of 9.3. These initial phases were further improved with statistical solvent flattening using RESOLVE (31Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), which resulted in a much improved electron density map and gave an overall figure of merit of 0.65. Subsequently, ARP/wARP (32Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar) was used to autotrace the structure, and 80 of the 103 residues in a single protein chain, constituting the asymmetric unit, were correctly placed. Refinement of the Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) model was performed with CNS1.1 (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Gosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar), and several cycles of refinement interspersed with manual rebuilding gave final Rwork and Rfree values of 21.0% and 26.2%, respectively. About one-third of the 47 water molecules were located automatically with the water-picking procedure within CNS1.1, whereas the rest of the water molecules were built into the present model by manual inspection of the mFo – DFc and 2mFo – DFc difference Fourier maps in O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) The final model consists of 79 residues. The statistics from phasing and refinement are shown in Table I. Structure Solution and Refinement of Native EntA-im—Diffraction data for a crystal with native EntA-im were collected at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Protein crystallization, data collection procedures, and processing and analysis of the data have been presented (28Dalhus B. Johnsen L. Nissen-Meyer J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1291-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The refined Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) model was used as a search model in molecular replacement against the data of the native protein, using the program EPMR (35Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Two unique solutions were located, giving a model R-factor of ∼40. A third molecule was identified and auto-built using ARP/wARP (∼250 residues in total were built). Subsequent refinement and water picking in CNS, as well as manual modeling using the mFo – DFc and 2mFo – DFc difference Fourier maps in O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar), has resulted in the present model containing 264 residues and 361 water molecules as well as two copies of a citrate anion from the crystallization solution. Final Rwork and Rfree values are 21.9% and 24.3%, respectively. The addition of citrate or tartrate proved to be crucial for crystal formation, and in the case of native EntA-im with two citrate anions bonded to the protein, these negatively charged polyanions seem to stabilize the molecular packing of molecules B and C by interacting with many positively charged residues in these two molecules. Atomic coordinates and structure factor data for both native EntA-im and Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 2BL8/R2BL8SF and 2BL7/R2BL7SF, respectively. Model Quality—More than 98% of the located residues in both the native EntA-im and Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) have backbone conformation within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot (Procheck (36Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar)). Fig. 1 gives a representative view of the quality of the 2mFo – DFc map after final refinement for native EntA-im. Sequence Alignment and Homology Modeling—The sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55638) Google Scholar). The sequences were imported to Swiss-Pdb Viewer (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar), and after adjustment of the alignment, they were fitted to the EntA-im structure. Side chain conformations were selected on the basis of the known crystal structure, except in cases with obvious steric conflicts. Such problems were resolved by selecting the energetically most favored rotamer using the built-in tools of Swiss-Pdb Viewer. Crystallization—The native immunity protein, EntA-im, and the Se-Met-labeled mutant version, EntA-im-(L31M+L80M), were crystallized under slightly different conditions, resulting in two different forms. Native EntA-im crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2 in the presence of citrate, whereas Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) crystallized in the triogonal space group P3121 in the presence of tartrate (Table I). In the crystal containing native EntA-im, there are three molecules in the asymmetric unit (molecules A, B, and C; see Fig. 2). The crystallographically independent native EntA-im molecules have an r.m.s.d. of <0.9 Å for C-α superimpositions of corresponding residues between the three monomers, A–C. The crystal with Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M), on the other hand, has only a single protein chain in the asymmetric unit. There are no significant differences between the native and mutant EntA-im as far as main chain conformation is concerned. Overall Structure—The crystal structure of EntA-im reveals that it folds into an antiparallel four-helix bundle with a flexible C-terminal part; the final model of Se-Met-EntA-im-(31M+L80M) consists of residues 3–81 with no electron density for the first 2 residues and the last 22 residues. There is a well-defined electron density for the backbone part of the four helices of the α-bundle and in all three loops connecting them. Conversely, the three crystallographically independent molecules in the structure of native EntA-im display individual differences with respect to the number of well-defined loop regions (Fig. 2; Table I). The structure of molecule A has a flexible loop between helix 2 and 3, whereas the entire C-terminal part adopts a well-defined random coil conformation (Figs. 2 and 3). The structure of molecule B consists of bundle core residues 4–84, with no visible C terminus (Fig. 2). Finally, the structure of molecule C has a flexible loop between helix 4 and the last 10 residues, which form a terminal coil with the same conformation and relative position as in molecule A (Fig. 2). This last observation suggests that the C-terminal might actually have a preferred conformation. However, the absence of a single main chain conformation of the C-terminal part in the structure of Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) and that of molecule B points to a flexible C terminus. In molecule A, the distinct folding of the C terminus, being located between molecules A and C, could be due to molecular packing in the crystal, and not an intrinsic structural element. The same is true for the well-ordered short C terminus of molecule C, intercalated between molecule C and another copy of molecule A. Interestingly, using hybrid immunity proteins, it has recently been shown that the C terminus of the immunity proteins specifically interacts (directly or indirectly) with their cognate bacteriocins (23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Flexibility in the C-terminal end might thus be an important characteristic that enables the immunity protein to interact with its cognate bacteriocin. A few charged residues in the loops on the protein surface do not have well-defined electron density for the full length of the side chains and probably exhibit some flexibility in solution. Nevertheless, they are included in the final models with an extended conformation. This is especially true for residues Lys40, Lys42, and Glu44, all in the loop between helices 2 and 3. Comparison of EntA-im to the Carnobacteriocin B2 Immunity Protein (CarB2-im)—Recently, the first three-dimensional structure of an immunity protein to a pediocin-like bacteriocin, CarB2-im, was solved using NMR spectoscopy (26Sprules T. Kawulka K.E. Vederas J.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This immunity protein belongs to subgroup C. EntA-im, with 103 residues, belongs to subgroup A and is slightly shorter than carB2-im, which has 111 residues. The EntA-im and CarB2-im proteins display 13% sequence identity (Fig. 4A). Despite their low sequence similarity, these two proteins have some common three-dimensional structural features. They are both left-turning, four-helix bundles that fold around a hydrophobic core (Fig. 3). CarB2-im has a short α-helical turn between helices 1 and 2, whereas EntA-im has a one-turn α-helix between helices 2 and 3. The most obvious structural difference is that CarB2-im has an additional fifth helix in the C-terminal end, which is either flexible or random coil in EntA-im. Their α-helices also pack together with different interhelical angles (Fig. 3). The C-α superposition of CarB2-im and EntA-im (molecule B with complete α-helix bundle core) gives an r.m.s.d. of 2.1 Å. The fact that two immunity proteins that belong to different subclasses consist of a four-helix bundle strongly indicates that this is a conserved structural motif in many, if not all, pediocin-like immunity proteins. Comparison of Molecular Surfaces of Subgroup A Immunity Proteins—Calculation of the surface charge distribution in EntA-im (using Swiss-Pdb Viewer (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9561) Google Scholar)) reveals a relatively large positively charged region formed by residues in helices 2 and 3 (Lys33, Lys37, and Arg53) and the loop between the two helices (Lys40 and Lys42) (Fig. 5, a and b). The latter 2 residues are flexible because no single dominant conformation is apparent in the electron density map. However, with an all-trans extended side chain conformation, the residues will be part of the positively charged region. On the opposite side of the molecule (Fig. 5, c and d), a negatively charged surface region is formed by residues in helix 1 (Glu11) and helix 4 (Glu71, Glu74, and Glu75). Based on the high sequence identity with EntA-im (>40%; Fig. 4B) and the use of homology modeling, structure models were predicted for three other subgroup A immunity proteins: LeuA-im (39Hastings J.W. Sailer M. Johnson K. Roy K.L. Vederas J.C. Stiles M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7491-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), MesY-im (40Fremaux C. Héchard Y. Cenatiempo Y. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 1637-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and DivI-im (41Métivier A. Pilet M.F. Dousset X. Sorokine O. Anglade P. Zagorec M. Piard J.C. Marion D. Cenatiempo Y. Fremaux C. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 2837-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Structural models were also predicted for two hybrid immunity proteins (EntA/LeuA-im and LeuA/EntA-im) that have been constructed by combining the N- and C-terminal halfs of two subgroup A immunity proteins (EntA-im and LeuA-im) (23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Both of these hybrid immunity proteins were active (23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that the three-dimensional structure of LeuA-im is similar to that of EntA-im. Because the C-terminal random coil could be flexible in solution, only the four-helix bundle core was used as a template. The molecular surface charge distribution was calculated for all predicted structure models (Fig. 5, a–d). The positive region observed in EntA-im is less prominent in LeuA-im and DivI-im (Fig. 5, a and b), although Lys37 and Arg53 are conserved in all four proteins. The negative region observed in EntA-im (Fig. 5d) is more pronounced in LeuA-im and DivI-im, whereas it is positive in MesY-im. This is in good agreement with the calculated pI values of 8.7 for EntA-im, 7.8 for LeuA-im, 5.7 for DivI-im, and 8.6 for MesY-im. Recent studies have shown that the C-terminal part of the immunity proteins for the pediocin-like bacteriocins contains a domain that is involved in the specific recognition of the bacteriocins they confer immunity to (23Johnsen L. Fimland G. Mantzilas D. Nissen-Meyer J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Whereas EntA-im and LeuA-im have different specificity (i.e. they recognize and confer immunity to different bacteriocins), EntA-im and the hybrid LeuA/EntA-im have similar specificity. Likewise, the LeuA-im and hybrid EntA/LeuA-im proteins also have similar specificity. Most of the charge differences discussed above are not located in the C-terminal part of these proteins and are consequently not likely to be involved in the specific recognition of the cognate bacteriocin. Certain differences were, however, noticed in the C-terminal part, and these might be of importance for specificity. A positive patch due to Lys71 is present in LeuA-im and EntA/LeuA-im, whereas a negative patch due to Glu71 is present in EntA-im and LeuA/EntA-im (Fig. 5c). Another difference is the positive patch due to Arg59 in LeuA-im and EntA/LeuA-im, which is absent in EntA-im and LeuA/EntA-im (Fig. 5c). It is also worth noting that both EntA-im and LeuA/EntA-im have a protruding aromatic residue (Tyr) in position 63 that is not found in LeuA-im or EntA/LeuA-im. (Fig. 5, b and d). The 1.6-Å x-ray structure of EntA-im reveals that it is a globular protein consisting of an antiparallel four-helix bundle with a flexible C-terminal part. The four-helix bundle appears to be a conserved structural motif in the pediocin-like immunity proteins (at least in subgroups A and C) (26Sprules T. Kawulka K.E. Vederas J.C. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11740-11749Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is clear that the C-terminal part of these immunity proteins (directly or indirectly) specifically interacts with their cognate bacteriocins and thereby confers immunity. In this study we determined the structure of EntA-im and thereby gained insight into structural features of the C-terminal half that might be important for specificity. Interestingly, our results indicate that approximately the last 20 residues of the C-terminal part seem to form a flexible structural element that might be involved in specific interactions with bacteriocins or other cellular components that may interact with bacteriocins. Another possibility is that the specificity is determined by the different charged patches found in the latter part of helix 3, helix 4, and the loop combining these two helices. These results on the structure of the pediocin-like immunity proteins will make it easier to design new hybrid immunity proteins as well as immunity protein mutants that will clarify which structured features and/or specific residues are determinants for recognition of cognate bacteriocins."

Few compounds are as ubiquitous and highly connected as adenine nucleotides (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). ATP functions as a carrier of chemical energy, ADP, AMP, ADP-ribosyl, adenylyl moieties as enzyme regulators, and cAMP as a second messenger. The nucleotide coenzymes NADH, FAD, and coenzyme A contain an adenosyl group that without direct participation in catalysis assists in binding to the apoenzyme.

Dha kinases are a family of sequence-related enzymes that can be divided into two groups according to their phosphate donor, namely ATP or a phosphoprotein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) (2Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). ATP-dependent kinases occur in bacteria, yeast, animals, and plants; Dha kinases dependent on the PTS, a dedicated energy transducing system involved in carbohydrate uptake and control of carbon metabolism (3Postma P.W.

In methylotrophic yeast, free Dha is the product of a transketolase reaction between ribulose-5-phosphate and formaldehyde derived from methanol. In bacteria, Dha is formed by oxidation of glycerol (5Forage R.G. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 591-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Luers G.H. Advani R. Wenzel T. Subramani S.

For yeast it has been shown that Dha kinases fulfill a “housecleaning” function by removing chemically reactive (8Molin M. Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1415-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and potentially hazardous short chain carbohydrates (9Tessier F.J. Monnier V.M. Sayre L.A. Kornfield J.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 705-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Dha kinases of C. freundii (DAK) and of E. coli (DhaK, DhaL) are prototypes of ATP- and PTS-dependent kinase, respectively (2Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Daniel R. Stuertz K. Gottschalk G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4392-4401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Garcia-Alles L.F.

The former consists of two domains that are connected by a long flexible linker, the latter of two subunits (DhaK and DhaL) that show homology with DAK throughout their combined lengths. DhaK contains the Dha binding site, DhaL the nucleotide binding site (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The DhaL fold, an eight-helix barrel of regular up-down topology, constitutes a new scaffold of nucleotide-binding proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). The PTS-dependent kinases utilize an additional subunit (DhaM) that serves as a phosphate shuttle between the general phosphoryl carrier protein HPr of the PTS and the kinase (Fig. 1A). DhaM subunits are made up of one domain that delivers the phosphate to the kinase and (species-dependent) one or two additional domains that form a phospho-histidine relay to the PTS. All three domains are homologous to known proteins of the PTS (2Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sequence and functional similarity between PTS- and ATP-dependent kinases points to their common origin. A phylogenetic tree generated from 41 DhaL subunits and domains shows three distinct protein clusters (Fig. 1D). The first contains the DhaL-like domains from ATP-dependent kinases of animals, plants, yeast, and bacteria. The second contains three types of DhaL subunits: (i) DhaL encoded by operons containing genes for DhaK subunits and multidomain (M) or single-domain (m) DhaM, (ii) DhaL encoded in dhaKL operons without a dhaM gene (x), and (iii) DhaL paralogs encoded in an operon together with a protein that itself consists of a SorC-type transcription factor and a DhaK-like domain (12Siebold C.

The two subunits are presumed to control Dha kinase expression (14Bächler C. Schneider P. Bähler P. Lustig A. Erni B. EMBO J. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). The third cluster contains domains from proteins of unknown function that are related to DhaL only by similarity of fold (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The evolutionary relationship between ATP- and PTS-dependent kinases is elucidated by the observation of an isotope exchange between Dha and Dha phosphate (DhaP). It pointed to a double displacement mechanism, and together with our previous failure to detect a covalent phospho-histidine or phospho-aspartate intermediate (2) it eventually led to the identification of a tightly bound ADP acting as phosphate acceptor in the kinetically active intermediate. Protein Purification and Activity Assays—Proteins were purified as previously described (2Gutknecht R. Beutler R. Garcia Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2480-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Mao Q. Schunk T. Flükiger K. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5258-5265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All activity assays and analytical gel filtrations of DhaL were done in salt buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 10 μm ADP unless indicated otherwise). Equilibrium phosphate exchange assays contained per 0.1 ml: 1 μm DhaK, 0.1 mm [14C]Dha, 0.8 mm DhaP, and DhaL or DhaM as indicated. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by dilution with 2 ml of ice-cold water, and [14C]DhaP was separated by ion exchange chromatography and determined by liquid scintillation counting as described (16Kundig W. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1392-1406Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Dha kinase assays contained per 0.1 ml: 0.1 mm [14C]Dha (1000 cpm/nmol) as substrate, 0.5 mm P-enolpyruvate, 0.08 μm EI, 3.5 μm HPr, 1.5 μm DhaM, 1 μm DhaK, and 0.03 μm DhaL (or as indicated). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C the reaction was stopped and analyzed as indicated above. DhaL·ADP (10 μm in 0.2 ml) was phosphorylated with 60 μm [32P]P-enolpyruvate in the presence of 0.08 μm EI, 0.3 μm HPr, 0.15 μm DhaM. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, DhaL·[γ-32P]ATP and apo-DhaL were separated from [32P]P-enolpyruvate and free [γ-32P]ATP on a HI Trap desalting column at 20 °C in the absence and presence of 10 mm EDTA, respectively. ATP and DhaP were separated by thin layer chromatography (polyethyleneimine cellulose, eluent 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 0.84 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4, and 0.25 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid). Initial burst assays for (i) ATPase activity of DhaL and (ii) the formation of DhaL·ATP from DhaL·ADP were done as follows. (i) 2 μm apo-DhaL (wild-type or mutants) were incubated with 10 μm [α-32P]ATP in 20 μl of standard buffer at 30 °C for the indicated time, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of 1 m formic acid. [α-32P]ADP and [α-32P]ATP produced were separated by thin layer chromatography (polyethyleneimine cellulose, 0.4 m K2HPO4, 0.7 m B(OH)3) (17Weiss D.S. Batut J. Klose K.E. Keener J. Kustu S. Cell. 1991; 67: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) of 5-μl aliquots and quantified with Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimaging. (ii) 2 μm DhaL·ADP (wild-type or mutants) were equilibrated with 10 μm [α-32P]ADP in 100 μl of standard buffer containing 0.02 μm EI, 0.1 μm HPr, 0.1 μm DhaM at 37 °C. The phosphorylation reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mm P-enolpyruvate. Aliquots were withdrawn, and [α-32P]ATP produced in the burst was separated from [α-32P]ADP as indicated under (i). [32P]P-enolpyruvate was prepared as described (18Roossien F.F. Brink J. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). [α-32P]ADP was prepared from [α-32P]ATP by incubation with hexokinase and an excess of glucose. The incubation mixture contained 0.1-0.1 mm ATP, 0.45 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm glucose, 20 μg of hexokinase/1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Hexokinase was inactivated by heating at 80 °C for 10 min, and [α-32P]ADP was used without further purification. Protein Unfolding—Temperature-induced unfolding was monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 222 nm in a Jasco spectropolarimeter (J715-A) using a 0.5-mm light-path cell. 20 μm DhaL and 100 μm indicated nucleotide were heated at a rate of 60 °C h-1 in buffer A (5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol). Data were normalized to the difference of the linear changes above and below the transition region. Isotope Exchange Experiments—The DhaL·[α-32P]ADP complex was prepared by incubation of 0.67 ml of 80 μm DhaL·ADP in buffer A containing 100 μm free ADP and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP overnight at 20 °C. During this time [α-32P]ADP was formed by the intrinsic ATPase activity of DhaL, and isotopic equilibrium with ADP was established. The DhaL·[α-32P]ADP complex was then separated from free [α-32P]ADP by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A at room temperature. Peak fractions containing DhaL·[α-32P]ADP were pooled. The ADP/DhaL molar ratio in the peak fractions was between 0.9 and 0.95. ADP exchange was initiated by the addition of a 166-fold molar excess of cold ADP (10 μl of 20 mm ADP) to 190 μl of 6 μm DhaL·[α-32P]ADP. After incubation at 37 °C for the time indicated, the DhaL·[α-32P]ADP complex was separated from free [α-32P]ADP by gel filtration on a HI Trap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer A. The koff rate was calculated by non-linear least square fitting of the radioactivity counts in the two fractions to the equations cpm (t) = cpm0 exp - {koff·t} and cpm (t) = cpm0 (1 - exp - {koff·t}), respectively. Sequence Analysis—Amino acid sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW. Analyses were performed with 41 of 61 representative sequences from bacteria and eukaryotes. Sequences of paralogs were included; orthologs of closely related organisms were omitted. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with Gene-Bee (13Siebold C. Garcia-Alles L.F. Erni B. Baumann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8188-8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the default parameters. Swiss-Prot primary accession numbers are given. The sequences of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycobacterium smegmatis were obtained at genome.wustl.edu/projects/bacterial/kpneumoniae/ and tigrblast.tigr.org/ufmg/index.cgi?database=m_smegmatisseq. The DhaL Subunit of the PTS-dependent Dha Kinase Is Transiently Phosphorylated—The Dha binding subunit DhaK, [14C]-labeled Dha, and unlabeled DhaP were incubated without and with DhaL. [14C]DhaP was formed only in the presence of DhaL. Addition of the phosphotransferase subunit DhaM did not support phosphate transfer or stimulate the DhaL-dependent reaction (Fig. 2), indicating that DhaL was necessary and sufficient as the phosphate transferring subunit. His-38 of DhaL appeared as a prime candidate for a protein phosphorylation site (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) because (i) it is invariant in all PTS-dependent kinases, (ii) the H38T and the H38A mutants were inactive, (iii) His-38 corresponds to the nucleotide binding Thr-388 of the Citrobacter freundii kinase (Fig. 1, B and C), and (iv) PTS proteins generally are phosphorylated at histidines (3Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After incubation of DhaL with [32P]P-enolpyruvate (phosphoenolpyruvate) and catalytic amounts of EI, HPr, and DhaM, the 32P label comigrated with DhaL on gel filtration in EDTA-free buffer while it was released in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3, A and B). 32P-labeled, histidine-tagged DhaL could be affinity captured with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads but could not be detected in non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (not shown). The EDTA sensitivity, and the fact that the nucleotide is coordinated by two well ordered magnesium ions in the x-ray structure of the C. freundii kinase (Fig. 1C) (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggested that a nucleotide may also play a role in the PTS-dependent Dha kinases. To demonstrate that the [32P]phosphate comigrating with DhaL is the γ phosphate of ATP and that this γ phosphate is actually transferred to Dha, the peak fraction from the gel filtration (Fig. 3A) was split in two. DhaK and Dha were added to one half and EDTA (5 mm) to the other. Phosphate was transferred quantitatively to Dha in the presence of DhaK while [γ-32P]ATP was released in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 3C, lanes a and b). This demonstrates that DhaL·ATP is the catalytically competent intermediate and that hydrolysis of ATP to ADP does not represent a control mechanism, for instance to turn off the enzyme. DhaL Contains ADP as a Coenzyme—To further support this proposition, histidine-tagged DhaL was purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration in the presence of EDTA. DhaL thus purified is inactive, severely unstable, and prone to precipitate at room temperature. Addition of ADP or ATP restored activity, whereas the non-hydrolyzable analogue AMPPNP, the structural analogue ADPβS, AMP-vanadate, and AMP did not (Fig. 4A). The ADP concentration necessary for half maximal activity (AC50) is 18 nm. The H38T mutant also could be activated by ADP, but it had a 1000-fold higher AC50 of 38 μm (Fig. 4B), indicating that His-38 is critical for strong binding of the ADP cofactor and not, as presumed, as a phosphorylation site. The dissociation rate of the DhaL·ADP complex (koff rate) was measured by isotope exchange between the purified DhaL·[α-32P]ADP complex and a 166-fold molar excess of unlabeled ADP (Fig. 5A). The koff rate calculated from the decay curve is 11.2 ± 1.3·10-5 s-1. This corresponds to a half-life (t½) of 100 min for the Dha·ADP complex, which is three times the generation time of a rapidly dividing E. coli cell. Taking the AC50 value of 18 nm (Fig. 4B) as an estimate for Kd, the calculated kon rate for the DhaL ADP association thus is 6.2·103 s-1M-1. This value is three orders of magnitude slower than the average association rate constants of enzymes that bind nucleotides as substrates and after each turnover release them as products (19Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: a Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman, New York1999Google Scholar). The slow association rate may be due to desolvation requirement (19Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: a Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman, New York1999Google Scholar) or, more likely, to a major conformational adjustment required for the opening of the ADP binding site.Fig. 5ADP binding to DhaL is essentially irreversible. A, isotope exchange reaction between DhaL·[α-32P]ADP and a 166-fold molar excess of free ADP. DhaL·[α-32P]ADP and released [α-32P]ADP were separated by gel filtration. Shown are the fraction of DhaL·[α-32P]ADP remaining (circles) and the fraction of [α-32P]ADP released (squares) at time t (for details see “Materials and Methods”). B and C, temperature-induced unfolding of DhaL holo- and apoenzyme. The DhaL·ADP holoenzyme is stable; the apoenzymes and complexes with other nucleoside phosphates are destabilized. The DhaL H38T (dashed line) and DhaL H38A (dotted line) mutants are only marginally stabilized by ADP. For details see “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complexation with ADP increases the thermal unfolding temperature of the DhaL apoenzyme from 41.5 to 65.7 °C (Fig. 5B), providing additional evidence for an essentially irreversible apoenzyme-coenzyme complex and the important role of ADP in stabilizing the protein. AMPPNP and ADPβS increase the unfolding temperature of DhaL by 9 and 12 °C, respectively, relative to the nucleotide-free form. The H38T and H38A mutants, which have a 1000-fold lower affinity for ADP, are moderately stabilized by the nucleotide (Fig. 5C). The fact that ADP and ATP have the same cofactor activity whereas AMPPNP has none (Fig. 4A) supports the proposition that ADP is the active moiety. DhaL has a weak ATPase activity that produces a burst of one [α-32P]ADP/DhaL upon incubation of apo-DhaL with [α-32P]ATP (Fig. 6A). Conversely, a stoichiometric amount of [γ-32P]ATP is rapidly formed but not released when the DhaL·ADP complex is incubated with [32P]P-enolpyruvate in the presence of DhaM and the general phosphoryl carrier proteins of the PTS (Fig. 6B). The two burst reactions indicate that ADP and ATP are not exchanged on a time scale of several minutes. In contrast, the H38T mutant with low affinity to ADP catalyzed the slow and continuous hydrolysis of ATP as well as a PTS-dependent production of ATP from ADP (Fig. 6, A and B). Congruent with the observed nucleotide exchange is the weak ATP-dependent Dha kinase activity of the H38T mutant (Fig. 6D). Not unexpected for a single site mutation, this increase is modest and the activity remains 400 times lower than the PTS-dependent activity (Fig. 6C). ATP- and ADP-dependent DhaL Have a Common Origin—The tightly bound ADP participates in a double displacement phosphoryl transfer reaction and thus plays the same role as histidines, cysteines, and aspartic acids in other phosphoprotein intermediates. Such a cofactor function of ADP has to the best of our knowledge not been described before. Retaining ADP as cofactor instead of evolving an amino acid such as a histidine into a phosphorylation site is an unprecedented example for parsimony in functional evolution during the switch of a kinase from ATP to the PTS as source of high energy phosphate. Which modifications of the nucleotide binding site accompanied this switch? In loop 1 (LDXXXGDGD(T/H)GXNM) of the helix barrel, the threonine that is in hydrogen bonding distance to the α phosphate of ATP (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in the ATP-dependent kinase of C. freundii is replaced by a histidine that is invariant in the PTS-dependent forms. Although interactions of nucleotide oxygens with aspartate, serine, threonine, lysine, and arginine are frequent, interactions with histidine were not detected in over 3000 contacts analyzed (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 1-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), adding evidence to our finding (Fig. 4B) that this histidine may be important for tight binding of ADP. In loop 3 (GG(S/A)SGXLYG) a serine/threonine that coordinates with the γ phosphate in the ATP-dependent kinase (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) is replaced by an alanine in most PTS-dependent kinases. In the conserved sequence of loop 5 (GXXAXXGDKTM) no conspicuous differences between the two forms can be detected. The most remarkable of the four loops surrounding the nucleotide binding site is loop 7 (GRASYL(X/G)(X/E)(X/R)(X/S)(X/L)(X/G)XXDPGA). The middle section of this long loop is highly variable in the ATP-dependent kinases, and the loop is disordered in the x-ray structure of the C. freundii kinase in complex with AMPPNP (12Siebold C. Arnold I. Garcia-Alles L.F. Baumann U. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48236-48244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the PTS-dependent DhaL, however, not only the flanking region (GRASYL and DPGA) but also the central portion (GERSLG) is almost invariant. Loop 7 is long enough to latch over the nucleotide binding pocket, and the rigidity of this loop could determine the rate of nucleotide exchange. Instead of being exchanged after each round of phosphate transfer, ATP is regenerated from ADP in situ by DhaM, a dedicated phosphoprotein of the PTS. Evolution of DhaM must have occurred by the more “conventional” path involving gene duplication, fusion, and specialization of protein modules of the PTS that already have the intrinsic property of multiply interacting with proteins as diverse as carbohydrate transporters, enzymes, and transcriptional regulators. It is noteworthy that some bacteria (Sinorhizobium, Mycobacterium, Listeria, and Klebsiella) have genes for more than one DhaL-like subunit or domain that according to the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1D) arose by gene duplication from a common ancestor. The association of these paralogs with transcription regulators indicates that they act as coactivators or corepressors of transcription. It thus appears that the use of ADP as cofactor has been invented only once in evolution and is now being used for both catalysis and signaling. A double function as enzyme subunit and autoactivator of transcription has been described for DhaL of E. coli (20Bachler C. Schneider P. Bahler P. Lustig A. Erni B. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We thank C. Siebold for preparation of Fig. 1B."

TrkA is the preferred receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkB is the preferred receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4/5, and TrkC preferentially binds NT-3 (2Meakin S.O.

In the course of our studies to identify signaling proteins unique to specific Trk receptors, we identified tumorous imaginal disc 1 (TID1), the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila protein TID56, as an interacting protein by the yeast two-hybrid screen using the ICD of TrkC as bait. Human TID1, a DnaJ domain-containing protein that is evolutionarily highly conserved, displays 54.9% amino acid identity with its Drosophila counterpart TID56 (16Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Two isoforms of TID1 have been identified in human: TID1L (long form, 43 kDa) and TID1S (short form, 40 kDa) (17Syken J. Macian F. Agarwal S. Rao A. Munger K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4636-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Macian F. Agarwal S. Rao A. Munger K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4636-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). TID1 also binds to Tax, an oncogenic viral protein encoded by the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (21Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), regulating NF-κB activity (22Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Tao M. Parks W.P. Cheng-Mayer C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20605-20610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Moreover TID1 interacts with p120 GT-Pase-activating protein, an activator of Ras, independently of TID1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In response to epidermal growth factor stimulation, TID1 and p120 GTPase-activating protein co-localize to distinct perinuclear subdomains resembling mitochondrial membranes (19Trentin G.A. Yin X. Tahir S. Lhotak S. Farhang-Fallah J. Li Y. Rozakis-Adcock M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13087-13095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been reported that TID1 interacts with the ErbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase. TID1 overexpression down-regulates ErbB-2 expression in breast cancer cells and hence inhibits tumorigenesis induced by ErbB-2 activation in some tumor cell lines (23Kim S.W. Chao T.H. Xiang R. Lo J.F. Campbell M.J. Fearns C. Lee J.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7732-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally TID1 interacts with Jak2 and the interferon-γ receptor subunit, interferon-γ R2, to regulate interferon-γ-mediated transcriptional activity (24Sarkar S. Pollack B.P. Lin K.T. Kotenko S.V. Cook J.R. Lewis A. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49034-49042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally TID1 expression is up-regulated by cellular senescence in rat and mouse embryo fibroblasts and also by premature senescence in rat embryo fibroblasts where TID1 acts as a repressor of NF-κB (25Tarunina M. Alger L. Chu G. Munger K. Gudkov A. Jat P.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10792-10801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was reported that a complete loss of TID1 results in embryonic death between embryonic days 4.5 and 7.5. Moreover TID1 removal in mouse embryo fibroblasts leads to massive cell death, which can be rescued by ectopic expression of wild-type TID1 (26Lo J.F. Hayashi M. Woo-Kim S. Tian B. Huang J.F. Fearns C. Takayama S. Zapata J.M. Yang Y. Lee J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2226-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TID1 is important for sustaining embryonic cell survival. This function of TID1 is possibly dependent on Hsp70 co-activation as cell death was not rescued by overexpression of the dominant negative TID1 mutant incapable of binding to Hsp70 (26Lo J.F. Hayashi M. Woo-Kim S. Tian B. Huang J.F. Fearns C. Takayama S. Zapata J.M. Yang Y. Lee J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2226-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we followed up on our initial yeast two-hybrid observation and investigated a role for TID1 in neurotrophin signaling via the Trk receptors. We demonstrated that TID1 bound to the Trk receptors in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner at the tandem tyrosine residues Tyr683-Tyr684 of the activation loop. More importantly, TID1 was tyrosine phosphorylated by the activated Trk RTKs in response to neurotrophins in both transfected cells and primary hippocampal neurons. Functionally TID1 overexpression significantly enhanced NGF-induced neurite outgrowth as well as levels of activated MAP kinase in TrkA-expressing nnr5 cells. Finally we showed that TID1 knock-down, mediated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), significantly reduced neurite outgrowth in PC12-derived neurotrophin-dependent cells. Collectively these data support a model that TID1 is a novel intracellular mediator of neurotrophin signaling and facilitates neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth through a mechanism that appears to involve increased levels of MAP kinase activation. Materials and Antibodies—Mouse NGF (2.5 S) was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science. Recombinant BDNF and NT-3 were gifts from A. A. Welcher (Amgen Inc.). The Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor K-252a (Calbiochem) was reconstituted in Me2SO and stored at –20 °C in the dark. The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-Gal4 DBD (RK5C1) and anti-Gal4 TA (C-10) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-MYC (9E10), anti-TID1 (RS13), and anti-Trk (C-14 and MCTrks). The anti-HA (3F10) antibody was from Roche Diagnostics. The mouse anti-MYC monoclonal antibody (9E10) and the rabbit anti-Trk (J203) polyclonal antibodies were prepared as reported using standard procedures (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18225-18233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The anti-TID1 monoclonal antibody (RS13 clone) was the generous gift of Dr. K. Münger (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). We also generated a rabbit anti-TID1N antibody directed against a 15-amino acid epitope of TID1 (119CKYHPDTNKDDPKAKE133) (Genemed Synthesis, San Francisco, CA). The anti-TID1N antibody was affinity-purified by standard procedures using N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Normal rabbit IgG was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The recombinant anti-Tyr(P) antibody (RC20H) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. The antibodies against both phospho- and regular ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology. Expression Constructs and Protein-Protein Interaction Studies—The wild type and mutant TrkA receptor, including A3 (a deletion of Δ493IMENP497), A17 (a deletion of Δ450KFG452), A8 (Y499F), A9 (Y794F), A26 (Y679A), A13 (Y683E/Y684E), A13e (Y683E), A13g (Y684E), and A11 (kinase-inactive mutation, K547A), as shown in Fig. 5A, have been described previously (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Biol.

The expression plasmids for wild type TrkB and TrkC were described before (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Kinase-inactive mutations for TrkB and TrkC (K571A for TrkB and K572A for TrkC, respectively) were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All wild type and mutant Trk receptors contain an amino-terminal HA epitope and were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMX (28Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V.V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed as described previously (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For protein-protein interaction studies in yeast, the ICDs of wild type and mutant TrkA (including A8, A13, A13e, and A13g), fused to the Gal4 DBD in pAS2.1, were used as bait. Yeast strain PJ69-4A cells were co-transformed with the TrkA ICD bait constructs and either TID1L or ShcB in pACT2 (Clontech). Co-transformants were allowed to grow up on plates with synthetic complete media minus Leu and Trp (-LT media); cultures were then grown in synthetic complete medium minus His, adenine (ADE), Leu, and Trp (-HALT media) with 20 mm 3-aminotriazole for those expressing the HIS and ADE reporters. The pACT2 vector alone served as the negative control. For positive controls, pACT2-ShcB was used as ShcB has been shown to interact well with the wild type and mutant TrkA receptors except the A8 mutant as shown in Fig. 4A (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The pACT2-TID1 construct containing a carboxyl-terminal fragment (Phe217–Ser480) of human TID1L (16Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) was isolated from a mammary gland cDNA library (Clontech) by a yeast two-hybrid screen using the TrkC ICD as bait. The TID1 Phe217–Ser480 fragment was subsequently cut from pACT2-TID1 and then ligated into pEBG3 (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18225-18233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to make a GST-TID1 fusion protein. Full-length human TID1L and TID1S cDNAs were obtained from K. Münger (Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and cloned into pRK5 to generate MYC-tagged products (29Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The TID1 truncated deletions were generated by PCR using pRK5-TID1S as the template. The digested PCR products were then ligated into pRK5. To facilitate the stable expression of TID1L and TID1S, MYC-tagged TID1L and TID1S were cut from pRK5 and cloned into pVgRXR between EcoRI and XhoI sites (Invitrogen). All constructs used in this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Robarts Research Institute). Cells and Transfection—COS7 and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with gentamycin sulfate. PC12-derived nnr5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum and 5% horse serum with gentamycin (PC12 media). TrkA-expressing nnr5 cells (B5 clone), as described before (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), were maintained in PC12 media plus 100 μg/ml G418 (B5 media). To make stable expression cell lines for both TID1L and TID1S isoforms, the nnr5-TrkA cells were transfected with pZeoExp-TID1L or pZeoExp-TID1S by Lipofectamine™ 2000, and clones were selected in media supplemented with 500 μg/ml Zeocin™ (Invitrogen) at least for a week. Surviving clones, designated nnr5-TrkA-TID1L and nnr5-TrkA-TID1S, were kept in B5 media plus 100 μg/ml Zeocin™ to maintain selective pressure for TID1 expression. For transfection, cells were grown to ∼50–70% confluency in 60-mm plates, and DNA transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation for 293T cells or by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for other cell lines. Immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down, and Western Blot—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0)) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. For immunoprecipitations, cells were stimulated with selected neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, or NT-3 at 100 ng/ml for 5 min or as indicated), and lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies (1–5 μg of IgG) in the presence of GammaBind™ plus Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant mixing. After washing, bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer (100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 3% SDS) and analyzed by Western blotting. For GST pull-down experiments, GST-TID1 fusion proteins in pEBG3 (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and HA-TrkA were co-expressed in COS cells. After stimulation with NGF (50 ng/ml, 5 min), lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) on a rotating shaker overnight at 4 °C. Bound proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed twice with lysis buffer, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. Equivalent aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blots with the indicated antibody. Hippocampal Neurons—Hippocampi were dissected from postnatal day 3 Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (30Gosilin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Gosilin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. 386. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar, 31Brewer G.J. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 71: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). After careful removal of the meninges, the sliced hippocampal tissues were dissociated in papain solution (40 units/ml papain in Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 0.02% DNase, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm cysteine-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by trituration with a P-1000 pipette tip. The hippocampal neurons, collected by centrifugation through a 30% fetal bovine serum cushion at 150 × g for 15 min, were resuspended in Neurobasal™-A media supplemented with 0.5 mm glutamine, gentamycin, and the synthetic mixture B27 (1:50) (Invitrogen) and plated on a poly-d-lysine substrate at 375 neurons/mm2. Culture medium was refreshed every other day. One hour prior to harvest, hippocampal neurons were washed extensively. After stimulation with medium alone or 100 ng/ml BDNF for 5 min, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and then lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described above. To observe tyrosine phosphorylation of TID1 and Trk, lysates (400 μg) were immunoprecipitated with the purified anti-TID1N (2 μg) or anti-Trk (C-14) (1 μg) antibodies or rabbit IgG (2 μg) as the control. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and then assayed by Western blotting with the anti-Tyr(P) RC20H antibody (1:1000). To show TID1 expression in hippocampal neurons, the precipitated proteins were also probed with the anti-TID1 RS13 antibody (1:1000). To identify TID1-Trk co-immunoprecipitation, the anti-TID1 precipitated proteins were probed with the anti-Trk MCTrk antibody (1:1000). RNA Interference—A mammalian system for stable expression of shRNA, pZeoH1, was developed by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter with the H1 RNA promoter in pVgRXR (Invitrogen) between the XhoI and NdeI sites. 2H.-Y. Liu and S. O. Meakin, unpublished data.. The sequences used for targeting TID1 were GAT CCC CAG CCT ATT ATC AGC TTG CCT TCA AGA GAG GCA AGC TGA TAA TAG GCT TTT TTG GAA A (sense) and AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA GCC TAT TAT CAG CTT GCC TCT CTT GAA GGC AAG CTG ATA ATA GGC TGG G (antisense). The same sequences in the reverse orientation, GAT CCC CCC GTT CGA CTA TTA TCC GAT TCA AGA GAT CGG ATA ATA GTC GAA CGG TTT TTG GAA A (sense) and AGC TTT TCC AAA AAC CGT TCG ACT ATT ATC CGA TCT CTT GAA TCG GAT AAT AGT CGA ACG GGG G (antisense), were used as the control. The sequences were annealed and then ligated into pZeoH1. To make stably expressing cell lines, plasmids were transfected into nnr5-TrkA cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were selected in B5 media containing 500 μg/ml Zeocin for a week and then kept in 100 μg/ml Zeocin. A total of 10 clones were expanded and screened for TID1 expression. As shown in Fig. 7, four clones with significant reduced TID1 expression were used in this study. As the control, four clones with pZeoH1 vector alone were also generated. Viability and Neurite Outgrowth Assays—For neurite outgrowth assays, nnr5-TrkA cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plates at low density (500 cells/mm2). Cells were allowed to grow in media with or without the indicated concentration of NGF. The media with fresh NGF were changed every 24 h. The cells were observed twice a day on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX50), and images were captured with a video camera (Sony 3CCD, model DXC-950) using Image-Pro software. Neurites were measured with the MCID™ analysis software (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 independent fields (120–151 cells). The results are presented as cells bearing neurites and the length of neurites (μm). Three independent experiments were performed. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism, version 4.0. A oneway analysis of variance with posthoc analysis by Student-Neuman-Keuls test was used to compare the differences between the groups. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Identification of TID1 as an Interacting Protein with the Trk Receptors—As part of our ongoing work to understand the complexity of Trk-mediated signaling pathways, we carried out several yeast two-hybrid screens using the ICDs of the TrkA, -B, and -C receptors as baits as reported elsewhere (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26046-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol.

During the course of this work, we isolated a clone corresponding to a carboxyl-terminal fragment (Phe217–Ser480) of human TID1L (16Schilling B. De-Medina T. Syken J. Vidal M. Munger K. Virology. 1998; 247: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Syken J. De-Medina T. Munger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) from a mammary gland cDNA library (Clontech) as an interacting partner of the TrkC ICD. As shown in Fig. 1A, TID1, TrkC, or vector alone did not support yeast growth in –HALT media, whereas TID1 and TrkC co-transformants did (right panel, lower row). Further experiments showed that this TID1 fragment also interacted with the ICD of TrkA in a phosphotyrosine-dependent fashion with no growth in –HALT media observed upon co-expression with the kinase-inactive TrkA11 (Fig. 1B). Although yeast contain no endogenous tyrosine kinases the intracellular domain of TrkC used in this study maintained kinase activity and indeed underwent autophosphorylation as a result of fusion protein dimerization. This phenomenon has been observed in yeast transfected with the ICD of TrkA (13Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D.

To further investigate the interaction between TID1 and Trk in mammalian cells, the TID1 Phe217–Ser480 fragment was expressed as a GST-TID1 fusion protein. GST-TID1 was co-transfected with HA-TrkA, HA-TrkB, or HA-TrkC in COS cells. After stimulation with neurotrophins, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose. Bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, all three Trk receptors were precipitated with GST-TID 1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with no precipitation observed with kinase-inactive HA-Trks (A11, B11, and C11, respectively). The doublet Trk bands shown in the Trk expression panel (Fig. 1C, bottom panel) and in other figures thereafter indicate different glycosylation states of the receptors (10Liu H.Y. Meakin S.O. J.

TID1 Is Tyrosine Phosphorylated by Trk Kinases—To evaluate whether TID1 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Trk in mammalian cells, MYC-TID1L and HA-Trks (wild type and kinase-inactive mutants) were co-expressed in COS cells. After stimulation with neurotrophins, cell lysates were precipitated with the anti-MYC antibody. The precipitated proteins were then detected by Western blotting with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 2A). No phosphorylated TID1L was detected in lysates expressing TID1L alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Consistent with the previous observation showing that GST-TID1 bound Trk receptors in a phosphotyrosine-dependent fashion, TID1L was tyrosine phos"

Rather than fleeing the country, often for good, more and more young scientists now are opting to stay or at least return to India. Not only are living conditions improving, but opportunities for exciting work are exploding owing to a growing roster of research and development (R&D) centers that multinational companies have been establishing there in recent years. Moreover, India9s indigenous R&D culture is shifting from one of emulation to one of innovation across categories ranging from biopharmaceuticals to automotive engineering, according to Raghunath A. Mashelkar, director general of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), a chain of 38 publicly funded industrial R&D institutions in India. A returnee himself years ago even as his peers were leaving India, he argues that a positive-feedback dynamic--one that even might be abetted by pedagogical innovations that could quickly shrink the country9s illiteracy problem--has set in, opening the possibility that India, a country of 1 billion people, could become the world9s top center of knowledge production by 2020.

https://openalex.org/W2023109894,"In vitro studies suggest that effective tumor suppression by p53 requires multiple domains to execute transcription-dependent and transcription-independent functions. We generated a mutant p53 allele in mice, p53W25QL26S (p53QS), containing an inactive transactivation domain to evaluate the importance of transactivation for p53-mediated tumor suppression. Recently, we discovered that the allele also contains a valine substitution for alanine at codon 135, which borders the DNA-binding domain. We found that p53QSval135 bound to chromatin albeit less well than p53QSala135, but both were equally deficient in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis induction in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and suppression of tumor formation by E1A, Ha-Ras transformed MEFs. p53QSval135 mice and p53-null mice exhibited identical tumor development kinetics and spectra in spontaneous and oncogene-initiated tumorigenicity assays, when tested in a homo- and heterozygous configuration. The p53QSval135 allele did not have dominant negative functions and behaved as a null allele. Taken together, these data indicate that effective tumor suppression requires the transcriptional regulation function of p53, and they suggest that transactivation independent functions of p53 are unlikely to contribute significantly to tumor suppression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1997055713,"Recent studies from our lab found that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel activation and subsequently activates JNK signaling pathway resulting in apoptosis. The present study in rabbit corneal epithelial (RCE) cells is to investigate mechanisms of UV irradiation-induced Kv channel activity involving p53 activation in parallel to DNA damage-induced signaling pathway. UV irradiation-induced signaling events were characterized by measurements of JNK activation and further downstream p53 phosphorylation. UV irradiation elicited an early response in the cell membrane through activation of Kv channels to activate the JNK signaling pathway and p53 phosphorylation. Exposure of RCE cells to UV irradiation within a few min resulted in JNK and p53 activations that were markedly inhibited by suppression of Kv channel activity. However, suppression of Kv channel activity failed to prevent p53 activation induced by extended DNA damages through prolonging UV exposure time (more than 15 min). In addition, caffeine inhibited UV-induced activation of SEK, an upstream MAPK kinase of JNK, resulting in suppression of both Kv channel-involved and DNA damage-induced p53 activation. Our results indicate in these cells that UV irradiation induces earlier and later intracellular events that link to activation of JNK and p53. The early event in response to UV irradiation is initiated by activating Kv channels in the cell membrane, and the later event is predominated by UV irradiation-caused DNA damage."

All of the three aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) are potent allosteric activators of M. tuberculosis PDT. We also provide in vitro evidence that M. tuberculosis PDT does not possess any chorismate mutase activity, which suggests that, unlike many other enteric bacteria (where PDT exists as a fusion protein with chorismate mutase), M. tuberculosis PDT is a monofunctional and a non-fusion protein. Finally, the biochemical and biophysical properties of the catalytic and regulatory domains (ACT domain) of M. tuberculosis PDT were studied to observe that, in the absence of the ACT domain, the enzyme not only loses its regulatory activity but also its catalytic activity. These novel results provide evidence for a monofunctional prephenate dehydratase enzyme from a pathogenic bacterium that exhibits extensive allosteric activation by aromatic amino acids and is absolutely dependent upon the presence of catalytic as well as the regulatory domains for optimum enzyme activity. Prephenate dehydratase (PDT) is a key regulatory enzyme in l-phenylalanine biosynthesis. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, expression of pheA, the gene encoding PDT, has been earlier reported to be iron-dependent (1Gold B. Rodriguez G.M. Marras S.A. Pentecost M. Smith I. Mol.

The absence of a human counterpart of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway makes the member enzymes promising targets for therapeutic interventions against pathogenic microbes. In the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as well, the aromatic amino acid pathway has been proven to be essential for the survival of this pathogen (3Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3069-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acid auxotrophs of M. tuberculosis do not survive or multiply in macrophages (5Bange F.C. Brown A.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1794-1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gordhan B.G. Smith D.A. Alderton H. McAdam R.A. Bancroft G.J. Mizrahi V. Infect.

Prephenate dehydratase (PDT) 1The abbreviations used are: PDT, prephenate dehydratase; CM, chorismate mutase; ACT, aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA; ORF, open reading frame; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; CPB, citrate phosphate buffer. is a terminal enzyme of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway that catalyzes the conversion of prephenate to phenylpyruvate with the elimination of water and carbon dioxide. Further, with the action of aromatic aminotransferase, phenylpyruvate is converted to phenylalanine (Fig. 1). In enteric bacteria, PDT usually exists as a fusion protein with chorismate mutase (CM), thereby catalyzing the first two steps in the biosynthesis of phenylalanine. In Escherichia coli as well, CM and PDT are fusion partners of the bifunctional P-protein, coded by pheA (7Pittard A.J. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 368-394Google Scholar). The N-terminal end of the bifunctional P-protein of E. coli specifies the chorismate mutase activity, whereas the remainder of the sequence specifies the prephenate dehydratase enzymatic activity (8Zhang S. Pohnert G. Kongsaeree P. Wilson D.B. Clardy J. Ganem B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6248-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In few bacteria, PDT is a monofunctional protein that aligns well with the C-terminal part of P-proteins (9Fischer R. Jensen R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PDT is a highly regulated enzyme in bacterial systems (10Pohnert G. Zhang S. Husain A. Wilson D.B. Ganem B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12212-12217Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Regulatory domains or the ACT domains (named after the regulatory domains of aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA (prephenate dehydrogenase) are present in many metabolic enzymes, including enzymes of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis family (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1023-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 12Chipman D.M. Shaanan B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The prephenate dehydratase enzyme of M. tuberculosis also possesses a discrete ACT domain that is predicted to impart regulatory properties to the enzyme. In M. tuberculosis, expression of pheA (the gene encoding PDT) has earlier been reported to be dependent on the transcription factor IdeR (1Gold B. Rodriguez G.M. Marras S.A. Pentecost M. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Rodriguez G.M. Voskuil M.I. Gold B. Schoolnik G.K. Smith I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This study was initiated to determine whether, apart from genetic regulation, M. tuberculosis pheA is also regulated at the enzymatic level. The experimental approach involved expression of the M. tuberculosis ORF Rv3838c in E. coli and determination of the biochemical parameters of the encoded protein. We have described the kinetic and regulatory properties of M. tuberculosis PDT and also dissected the role of the catalytic and regulatory domains of the recombinant protein. The significance of a differential feedback regulation of the terminal enzymes of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway of M. tuberculosis has also been discussed. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli XL1Blue and E. coli BL21 DE3 strains were used, respectively, as hosts for cloning and recombinant protein expression purposes using the pET23a (Novagen) expression vector. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of M. tuberculosis PDT and PDT-N and PDT-C—The ORF Rv3838c encoding the prephenate dehydratase enzyme of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was amplified from the bacterial genomic DNA using primers carrying specific restriction enzyme sites (Table I). The amplicons were digested with NdeI/XhoI enzymes and cloned into the corresponding sites of pET23a expression vector. The N and the C terminus of M. tuberculosis PDT, corresponding to the catalytic and regulatory domains, were cloned separately using other sets of primers described in Table I. The resultant plasmids were labeled as pET3838, pET3838N, and pET3838C.Table ISequences of primers used for PCR amplification of M. tuberculosis prephenate dehydratase (coded by ORF Rv3838c) and its N and C termini (catalytic and regulatory domains) Nucleotides in bold italics represent the restriction enzyme sequence appended to the primers to enable directional cloning in pET23a expression vector.GeneForward primer sequenceReverse primer sequenceRv3838cNdeIXhoIATACATATGGTGGTGCGTATCGCTTACCTCGGTATCTCGAGTGCTTGCGCCCCCTGGTRv3838NNdeIXhoIATACATATGGTGGTGCGTATCGCTTACCTCGGTATCTCGAGATCGGCTCCGGTGCGCGRv3838CNdeIXhoIATACATATGCGCACGTCTGCAGTGCTGCATCTCGAGTTGCTTGCGCCCCCTGGT Open table in a new tab The chimeric constructs were used to transform E. coli BL21DE3 cells, and the transformants were grown in 1 liter of LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 4% glycerol. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the culture was further incubated for 5 h at 27 °C to allow protein expression. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted using a sonicator. A second round of centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min was carried out to remove particulate matter and cell debris. The resulting supernatant was applied to Talon resin (Clontech). The supernatant containing a mixture of soluble protein was allowed to bind to Talon resin packed in a polypropylene column. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 30 mm imidazole followed by elution with 250 mm imidazole. The purified protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against Tris buffer to remove salts and imidazole. Enzyme Assays and Kinetic Studies—Prephenate dehydratase activity assays were carried out as described earlier (13Gething M.J. Davidson B.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Essentially, the dehydratase activity of rRv3838c was assayed by measuring the rate of conversion of prephenate to phenylpyruvate. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1–2 mm barium prephenate in a total volume of 400 μl. The sample was pre-incubated at 37 °C followed by the addition of 20–100 pmol of purified recombinant M. tuberculosis PDT. After a second round of incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 800 μl of 1.5 m NaOH. Phenylpyruvate was measured spectrophotometrically at 320 nm. Appropriate blanks without the enzyme were kept as controls. The optimum pH for the activity of M. tuberculosis PDT was determined using buffers of different pKa (CPB, pH values 4 and 4.5; MES, 6; HEPES, 7; and Tris-HCl, pH values 7.5 and 8). PDT activity was also assessed at different temperatures (15–80 °C). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme required to form 1 μmol of product/min at 37 °C. Allosteric regulation of PDT activity by l-Phe, l-Tyr, and l-Trp was measured at 100–500 μm concentrations of the effectors. Chorismate mutase activity assays were carried out exactly as described by Davidson and Hudson (14Davidson B.E. Hudson G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 440-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration or size exclusion chromatography was used to determine the oligomeric state of M. tuberculosis PDT, as well as the individually expressed catalytic and regulatory domains. The chromatography experiment was performed on Superdex 200 (for PDT) and Superdex 75 (for PDT-N and PDT-C) fast protein liquid chromatography columns from Amersham Biosciences using 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as the running buffer. Void volume of the column was determined using blue dextran 2000. Elution time of all the recombinant proteins was recorded, and the molecular weight was calculated by estimating the elution volumes of standards of known molecular weight. The recombinant proteins were loaded on the gel filtration column at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. Phenylalanine Binding Assays/Fluorimetric Procedures—Binding of phenylalanine to the recombinant proteins was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra of individual proteins were recorded in the presence and absence of phenylalanine on a PerkinElmer LS-3B spectrofluorometer. Briefly, the recombinant proteins were excited using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and the tryptophan emission spectra were recorded from 305 to 440 nm at 37 °C. The fluorescence slit width of excitation and emission were kept at 4 nm, and the scan speed was 50 nm/s. Protein concentrations were kept at 2.5 μm in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, and the buffer signal was subtracted from the spectrum of recombinant proteins. pheA (ORF Rv3838c) of M. tuberculosis Encodes a Functional Prephenate Dehydratase Enzyme—The recombinant protein corresponding to ORF Rv3838c, predicted to be the PDT enzyme of the bacterium, was purified using affinity chromatography procedures (Fig. 2, Inset). The purified protein was quantified using the Bradford assay and used for prephenate dehydratase activity assays. As evident from the substrate saturation plot, M. tuberculosis PDT followed Michaelis-Menten's kinetics. The double reciprocal plot of the enzyme was linear, and Km for the enzyme was calculated as 500 μm and Vmax as 125 μmoles/min/mg (Fig. 2). Specific activity of the enzyme was determined as 125 units/mg pure protein. The effect of temperature and pH on enzyme activity was also studied. It was observed that the enzyme is maximally active between temperatures 37 and 42 °C and pH 6 and 7 (Fig. 3). Although other bacterial PDTs are active at an acidic pH (15Friedrich B. Friedrich C.G. Schlegel H.G. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 712-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), M. tuberculosis PDT was found to be active in mildly acidic to near neutral pH.Fig. 3The PDT activity of rRv3838c is pH- and temperature-dependent. Maximal enzyme activity was obtained in a mildly acidic pH. Temperatures above 50 °C completely inactivate the enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ionic Interactions Are Required for Optimum Prephenate Dehydratase Activity—To determine whether ionic interactions are important for the activity of M. tuberculosis PDT, the enzyme was assayed in the presence of various concentrations of NaCl. It was observed that the enzyme activity was completely abolished in the presence of 200 mm and higher concentrations of NaCl (Fig. 4). This suggests that enzyme substrate interactions are brought about by ionic interactions, and disruption of the same leads to inhibition of enzyme activity. Aromatic Amino Acids Are Potent Allosteric Activators of M. tuberculosis Prephenate Dehydratase—Control of the terminal enzymes in any biosynthetic pathway is crucial for maintaining the correct balance of the end product in accordance with the requirement of the organism. This holds true for the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis as well. PDT being a terminal enzyme in phenylalanine biosynthesis, we decided to determine the effect of phenylalanine as well as other cross-pathway-specific aromatic amino acids (tyrosine and tryptophan) on prephenate dehydratase activity. Results showed that M. tuberculosis PDT was inhibited by low concentrations of aromatic amino acids (up to ∼100 μm) and highly activated at higher concentrations (Fig. 5). This property of M. tuberculosis PDT was exactly opposite to that of M. tuberculosis CM, as recent work from our laboratory has shown that M. tuberculosis CM is activated by lower concentrations of aromatic amino acids (up to ∼100 μm) and inhibited by higher concentrations (16Prakash P. Aruna B. Sardesai A.A. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (February 28, 10.1074/jbc.M413026200)Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis Prephenate Dehydratase Does Not Display Any Chorismate Mutase Activity—In E. coli, pheA codes for a bifunctional P-protein carrying both CM and PDT activities, whereas in several other bacteria, PDT is a monofunctional protein. M. tuberculosis PDT does not have a predicted CM domain. However, on account of several examples of convergent evolution of enzyme reaction mechanisms, it was decided to determine whether PDT has any associated CM activity. Recombinant M. tuberculosis PDT was therefore used in a chorismate mutase activity assay. It was observed that M. tuberculosis PDT is completely devoid of CM activity (Table II), confirming that M. tuberculosis PDT is a monofunctional protein.Table IIActivity profile of the engineered M. tuberculosis PDT proteinsClonesProteinAmino acid residuesPurified protein activityPDTCMpET3838PDT1–321125 units/mg—pET3838NPDT-N4–192—a—, not detectable—pET3838CPDT-C202–279——PDT-C + PDT-N——a —, not detectable Open table in a new tab The Individually Cloned, Expressed, and Purified Catalytic and Regulatory Domains of M. tuberculosis Prephenate Dehydratase Are Inactive in Catalyzing the Conversion of Prephenate to Phenylpyruvate—M. tuberculosis PDT has a distinct predicted catalytic and regulatory domain (Fig. 6A). Hence, it was decided to test whether the catalytic activity of M. tuberculosis PDT is independent of the regulatory domain or it requires both the domains for optimum activity. For this purpose, the catalytic and regulatory domains of M. tuberculosis PDT were individually cloned in the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET23a vector, expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells and purified as recombinant proteins (Fig. 6, B and C, insets). These proteins were labeled as PDT-N and PDT-C and were used in prephenate dehydratase activity assay. Although the regulatory domain was enzymatically completely inactive, surprisingly even the individually cloned catalytic domain of M. tuberculosis PDT did not show any PDT activity (Fig. 6). Reconstitution of the enzyme was attempted by taking equimolar ratios of the catalytic and regulatory domains and using it in PDT activity assays. However, the activity assay demonstrated that the catalytic and regulatory domains cannot be reconstituted in vitro to generate an active enzyme. These results (Table II) demonstrate that, despite having a predicted catalytic and regulatory domain, in M. tuberculosis PDT, these domains individually did not display enzyme activity, even when the two are supplied in trans. Phenylalanine Binding Leads to a Conformational Change in M. tuberculosis Prephenate Dehydratase Enzyme and Its Regulatory Domain—The chorismate mutase enzyme of M. tuberculosis undergoes a conformational change as a consequence of ligand binding (16Prakash P. Aruna B. Sardesai A.A. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; (February 28, 10.1074/jbc.M413026200)Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the question of whether M. tuberculosis PDT (which is activated by pathway-specific as well as cross-pathway-specific amino acids) also undergoes conformational change after treatment with these ligands. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to determine such conformational change in M. tuberculosis PDT using full-length M. tuberculosis PDT as well as individual catalytic and regulatory domains. Tryptophan emission spectra for all the three recombinant proteins were monitored in the presence and absence of phenylalanine. M. tuberculosis PDT possesses four tryptophan residues, and the individual catalytic and regulatory domains have two tryptophan residues each. As evident from the graph, the addition of phenylalanine leads to a change in the fluorescence emission spectrum of only the full-length M. tuberculosis PDT and PDT-C (Fig. 7, A and B). The fluorescence emission spectrum of the catalytic domain or PDT-N remained unchanged even in the presence of phenylalanine (Fig. 7C). In case of full-length M. tuberculosis PDT, a blue shift in the fluorescence spectrum, along with quenching of fluorescence, was seen (Fig. 7A), whereas in the case of PDT-C only, quenching of fluorescence was seen (Fig. 7B). A blue shift in the fluorescence spectrum and quenching indicates that the tryptophan residues of the native protein are buried inside as a consequence of the conformational change that results from the binding of phenylalanine. Size Exclusion Chromatography Reveals That M. tuberculosis PDT Is an Oligomer and PDT-N and PDT-C are Monomers—Size exclusion chromatography was performed to determine the oligomeric state of M. tuberculosis PDT and its individual catalytic and regulatory domains. As the individual domains were catalytically inactive, this experiment was expected to give insights into the possible reasons behind the catalytic insufficiency of the individual domain. All the three proteins eluted as a single peak (Fig. 8). The molecular weight of all the proteins were calculated using a standard curve using the elution parameters of proteins of known molecular weights. The results showed that M. tuberculosis PDT is a dimeric protein and its individual catalytic and regulatory domains elute as monomers. PDT exists both as a monofunctional protein and as a fusion protein with chorismate mutase. In E. coli, both CM and PDT activities reside in a single, bifunctional protein known as the P-protein, encoded by pheA (7Pittard A.J. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 368-394Google Scholar). Among the monofunctional PDTs, almost all possess an ACT or amino acid binding domain that brings about allosteric regulation of the enzyme. In this work, M. tuberculosis PDT, an apparently monofunctional protein, was proved to be so using a biochemical approach. The specific activity of full-length recombinant PDT was very high (125 units/mg pure protein), and the enzyme was extensively allosterically activated by all of the three aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, and Trp). Earlier reports have shown that M. tuberculosis pheA is an IdeR-regulated gene (1Gold B. Rodriguez G.M. Marras S.A. Pentecost M. Smith I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 851-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Rodriguez G.M. Voskuil M.I. Gold B. Schoolnik G.K. Smith I. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The present work demonstrates that M. tuberculosis pheA is also regulated at the protein level by aromatic amino acids. The high energy cost for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (17Atkinson D.E. Cellular Energy and Metabolism and Its Regulation. Academic Press, New York1977Google Scholar) could be responsible for the dual regulation (gene level as well as protein level) of M. tuberculosis PDT. However, dual regulation (specifically by IdeR) also suggests the involvement of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis pathway in the biosynthesis of iron acquisition systems. Although phenylalanine, as a precursor of salicylate via the phenyl ammonia lyase pathway, is well documented in plants, this route of salicylate biosynthesis is not at all reported in bacteria (18Wildermuth M.C. Dewdney J. Wu G. Ausubel F.M. Nature. 2001; 414: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that M. tuberculosis could have an additional mechanism of salicylate biosynthesis that involves PDT. The dual regulation of M. tuberculosis PDT and, specifically, activation by aromatic amino acids differentiates it from all other bacteria. When the regulatory properties of M. tuberculosis CM and M. tuberculosis PDT were compared, the first observation was that both the enzymes display an exactly opposite pattern of regulation. Although M. tuberculosis CM shows moderate activation by low concentrations of aromatic amino acids, activity was greatly inhibited at higher concentrations. The reverse holds true for M. tuberculosis PDT, i.e. the enzyme is inhibited by low concentrations of aromatic amino acids and highly activated by higher concentrations. These results demonstrate for the first time that, despite the occurrence of CM and PDT as monofunctional proteins in M. tuberculosis, correct balance of aromatic amino acids is brought about by opposite regulation of these two enzymes at the protein level. Another important goal of the present study was to ascertain whether the predicted catalytic domain of M. tuberculosis PDT, which lies in the N terminus, is independent of the regulatory domain that is part of the C terminus. Results presented in this report indicate that a discrete regulatory (ACT) domain along with a catalytic domain is required for an optimally active M. tuberculosis PDT. These observations were found to be unlike what was reported for E. coli P-protein, where discrete domains of the complex P-protein retain their original activity (8Zhang S. Pohnert G. Kongsaeree P. Wilson D.B. Clardy J. Ganem B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6248-6253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, in the case of E. coli T-protein, wherein although CM and PDH domains can be expressed independently as functional proteins, the efficiency of the enzymes in isolation is much reduced as compared with the entire fusion protein (19Chen S. Vincent S. Wilson D.B. Ganem B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In neither case, however, is the activity completely abolished when the PDH or PDT domains were taken separately. Various possible explanations can be considered for the complete loss of PDT activity upon removal of the regulatory domain. The dissociation of the oligomeric state of the enzyme upon removal of the C terminus could be one possible reason. It is also possible that in the individually expressed and purified N terminus of M. tuberculosis PDT, the substrate binding site is mechanistically altered, leading to a loss of activity. Although the catalytic domain of M. tuberculosis PDT in isolation was functionally inactive, at least the individually cloned C terminus of M. tuberculosis PDT retained its regulatory properties. Proof of the same was obtained using fluorimetric assays. These experiments generated a sufficient line of evidence to conclude that there is a definite conformational change in the regulatory domain of M. tuberculosis PDT in the presence of phenylalanine. On the other hand, fluorescence emission spectra of the catalytic domain of M. tuberculosis PDT remained unchanged, even in the presence of phenylalanine. It is possible that the C terminus of M. tuberculosis PDT may serve as a modular regulatory domain that can be used to impart regulatory properties to other proteins of interest. These proteins can, in turn, be used as biosensors. In summary, this study is the first report of a prephenate dehydratase enzyme that shows allosteric activation by aromatic amino acids. Furthermore, the catalytic as well as the regulatory domains are absolutely required for optimum enzyme activity. The various levels at which the regulation of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis is brought about in Mycobacterium tuberculosis suggest that expression of the corresponding genes are strictly dependent upon the requirement of the bacterium. Additionally, considering the absence of a human homologue of PDT, the enzyme might serve as a novel target for the design of novel chemotherapeutic compounds."

Therefore, we examined the effects of GAGs (keratan sulfate, hyaluronan, chondroitin, chondroitin sulfate, and heparin sulfate) disaccharides on production of interleukin (IL)-12, a pivotal cytokine in the Th-1 type immune system. Among the GAG disaccharides, only a keratan sulfate disaccharide, Gal(6-SO<sub>3</sub>)-GlcNAc(6-SO<sub>3</sub>) (L4), suppressed IL-12 production in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides and interferon-γ. Neither keratan sulfate chains nor keratan sulfate tetrasaccharides elicited any change in the IL-12 production. <i>N</i>-Acetyl-lactosamine, Gal-GlcNAc (LacNAc), also did not change IL-12 production. These results indicated that a certain size, <i>i.e.</i> disaccharide and sulfate, are essential to suppress IL-12 production. L4 was then applied to MRL-<i>lpr/lpr</i> mice, a Th-1 type autoimmune disease model. The treatment of MRL-<i>lpr/lpr</i> mice with L4 1) decreased in serum IL-12, 2) induced apoptosis in T cells in lymph nodes thereby suppressing lymphoaccumulation, and 3) suppressed hypergammaglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis. We showed previously that IL-12 suppresses cell death of T cells, thereby enhancing the lymphoaccumulation in MRL-<i>lpr/lpr</i> mice. Moreover, it has been reported that IL-12 deficiency in MRL-<i>lpr/lpr</i> mice diminishes lymphoaccumulation and delays glomerulonephritis. The treatment with L4 suppressed phosphoprotein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase expression in macrophages, suggesting that L4 suppresses IL-12 production by inhibiting phosphoprotein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1988196375,"Adenylate kinases participate in maintaining the homeostasis of cellular nucleotides. Depending on the yeast strains, the GTP:AMP phosphotransferase is encoded by the nuclear gene ADK2 with or without a single base pair deletion/insertion near the 3′ end of the open reading frame, and the corresponding protein exists as either Adk2p (short) or Adk2p (long) in the mitochondrial matrix. These two forms are identical except that the three C-terminal residues of Adk2p (short) are changed in Adk2p (long), and the latter contains an additional nine amino acids at the C terminus of the protein. The short form of Adk2p has so far been considered to be inactive (Schricker, R., Magdolen, V., Strobel, G., Bogengruber, E., Breitenbach, M., and Bandlow, W. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 31103–31110). Using purified proteins, we show that at the physiological temperature for yeast growth (30 °C), both short and long forms of Adk2p are enzymatically active. However, in contrast to the short form, Adk2p (long) is quite resistant to thermal inactivation, urea denaturation, and degradation by trypsin. Unfolding of the long form by high concentrations of urea greatly stimulated its import into isolated mitochondria. Using an integration-based gene-swapping approach, we found that regardless of the yeast strains used, the steady state levels of endogenous Adk2p (long) in mitochondria were 5–10-fold lower compared with those of Adk2p (short). Together, these results suggest that the modified C-terminal domain in Adk2p (long) is not essential for enzyme activity, but it contributes to and strengthens protein folding and/or stability and is particularly important for maintaining enzyme activity under stress conditions."
