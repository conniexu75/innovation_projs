https://openalex.org/W2049009766,"The Drosophila melanogaster gene insulin-like receptor ( InR ) is homologous to mammalian insulin receptors as well as to Caenorhabditis elegans daf-2 , a signal transducer regulating worm dauer formation and adult longevity. We describe a heteroallelic, hypomorphic genotype of mutant InR , which yields dwarf females with up to an 85% extension of adult longevity and dwarf males with reduced late age-specific mortality. Treatment of the long-lived InR dwarfs with a juvenile hormone analog restores life expectancy toward that of wild-type controls. We conclude that juvenile hormone deficiency, which results from InR signal pathway mutation, is sufficient to extend life-span, and that in flies, insulin-like ligands nonautonomously mediate aging through retardation of growth or activation of specific endocrine tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2047683380,"The Drosophila melanogaster gene chico encodes an insulin receptor substrate that functions in an insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , insulin/IGF signaling regulates adult longevity. We found that mutation of chico extends fruit fly median life-span by up to 48% in homozygotes and 36% in heterozygotes. Extension of life-span was not a result of impaired oogenesis in chico females, nor was it consistently correlated with increased stress resistance. The dwarf phenotype of chico homozygotes was also unnecessary for extension of life-span. The role of insulin/IGF signaling in regulating animal aging is therefore evolutionarily conserved."

To examine the molecular basis of these and other changes, gene expression profiles of human foreskin fibroblasts infected with Toxoplasma were studied using human cDNA microarrays consisting of ∼22,000 known genes and uncharacterized expressed sequence tags. Early during infection (1–2 h), <1% of all genes show a significant change in the abundance of their transcripts. Of the 63 known genes in this group, 27 encode proteins associated with the immune response. These genes are also up-regulated by secreted, soluble factors from extracellular parasites indicating that the early response does not require parasite invasion. Later during infection, genes involved in numerous host cell processes, including glucose and mevalonate metabolism, are modulated. Many of these late genes are dependent on the direct presence of the parasite;i.e. secreted products from either the parasite or infected cells are insufficient to induce these changes. These results reveal several previously unknown effects on the host cell and lay the foundation for detailed analysis of their role in the host-pathogen interaction.

Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Immediately following invasion,T. gondii resides and replicates within a parasitophorous vacuole that, although free of host membrane proteins, is surrounded by host mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (2Sinai A.P. Webster P. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2117-2128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the parasite begins growing and dividing within the parasitophorous vacuole, it must acquire nutrients such as purine nucleosides and cholesterol from the host cell (3Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the morphological and metabolic changes to the host cell occur are unknown. T. gondii infection also causes the induction of numerous immune modulators that activate both the innate and adaptive immune responses (4Li Z.Y. Manthey C.L. Perera P.Y. Sher A. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3434-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Brenier-Pinchart M.P. Pelloux H. Simon J. Ricard J. Bosson J.L. Ambroise-Thomas P. Mol.

Immun. 1999; 67: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both live parasites and parasite extracts stimulate IFN-γ1 synthesis, which is required for protection, primarily via dendritic cell activation (6Yap G.S. Sher A. Immunobiology. 1999; 201: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 8Alexander J. Scharton-Kersten T.M. Yap G. Roberts C.W. Liew F.Y. Sher A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

However, the mechanism by which infected cells activate and recruit dendritic cells remain unclear but presumably requires synthesis of C-C chemokines that bind and activate the C-C chemokine receptor, CCR5 (10Aliberti J. Sousa C.R.E. Schito M. Hieny S. Wells T. Huffnagel G.B. Sher A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although previous data demonstrated that T. gondii-infected cells produce these chemokines, the molecular mechanisms that regulate their expression are still unknown (4Li Z.Y. Manthey C.L. Perera P.Y. Sher A. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3434-3440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Brenier-Pinchart M.P. Pelloux H. Simon J. Ricard J. Bosson J.L. Ambroise-Thomas P. Mol.

Moreover, the full repertoire of host genes whose expression is modulated by T. gondii as well as the signal transduction cascades underlying these changes are also unknown. Recently, the study of host-parasite interactions has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays (11Manger I.D. Relman D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Spotted with grids of highly dense and organized spots of DNA, cDNA microarrays are hybridized to two different cDNA samples each labeled with a different fluorophore thus allowing the simultaneous monitoring of differential gene expression for thousands of genes (12Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Recent studies using microarrays have enhanced our knowledge of the host response to viruses (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, and coxsackievirus) and bacteria (e.g. Salmonella typhimurium,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes) (13Zhu H.

Microarrays demonstrated that the transcriptional response of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide andSalmonella are largely overlapping, suggesting that lipopolysaccharide may be largely responsible for the inflammatory response to Salmonella (14Rosenberger C.M. Scott M.G. Gold M.R. Hancock R.E. Finlay B.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5894-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The goal of our study was to analyze the global changes that occur when a protozoan intracellular parasite infects a mammalian host cell. Thus, we examined the transcriptional profile of HFFs in response to T. gondii infection. Intact parasites, as well as soluble parasite-derived factors, rapidly increase the abundance of transcripts associated with the immune response. Later following infection, numerous host genes were modulated that are involved in diverse cellular processes, including metabolism, transcription, protein targeting, and apoptosis. Finally, we were able to discriminate between genes that are modulated due to either parasite- or host cell-derived secreted factors and those that are modulated only in the presence of intracellular parasites. HFFs (passage 10–16 post-isolation) were used for all assays. The PDS strain of T. gondii, cloned from ME49 (19Boothroyd J.C. Black M. Bonnefoy S. Hehl A. Knoll L.J. Manger I.D. Ortega-Barria E. Tomavo S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was routinely passaged in HFFs using standard T. gondii culture conditions (19Boothroyd J.C. Black M. Bonnefoy S. Hehl A. Knoll L.J. Manger I.D. Ortega-Barria E. Tomavo S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and gentamicin (Life Technologies; Rockville, MD). HFF and parasite strains were regularly inspected for mycoplasma, and found to be negative, using a Mycoplasma PCR ELISA detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; Indianapolis, IN). Parasites were harvested from infected HFF monolayers when lysis by infection was almost completed and few, if any, intact host cells remained. The flasks were then scraped, and the entire material harvested and passed twice through a 27-gauge needle to rupture any remaining HFFs and release the parasites within. The resulting material was pelleted at 600 × g, washed three times in serum-free DMEM, and parasites counted by light microscopy. No intact host cells could be detected in this preparation. Parasites were added to HFF monolayers (4–7 days old) at an multiplicity of infection of 5–10. Infection assays were routinely performed with HFF monolayers in 75-cm2 flasks grown in 15 ml of media or a proportionate volume for different size flasks for the indicated times. For the Transwell experiments, HFFs were plated in the lower chamber of a 10-cm Transwell tissue culture insert (final volume 10 ml; Corning-Costar, Corning, NY) with 5 ml of media in the upper chamber. Parasites, in serum free media, were added to the upper chamber, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. Total RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The amount of T. gondiitotal RNA co-purified 24 hpi was estimated to be ∼20% by comparing ribosomal RNA band intensities of total RNA separated by agarose gel electrophoresis (not shown). cDNA microarrays were synthesized at Stanford University using standard protocols (12Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The microarrays were spotted with 18,000–27,000 sequence-verified clones that are available from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). cDNA probe preparation was performed essentially as described previously (12Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (20–25 μg) was converted to first-strand cDNA using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) with oligo-dT18 (New England BioLabs, Bedford, MA). The cDNA was labeled with Cy3-dUTP (infected) or Cy5-dUTP (uninfected) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) via a random prime reaction using random nanomer. We found that labeling cDNA with random nanomer versus direct dye incorporation during the first-stand cDNA synthesis reaction (12Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) did not indicate any significant difference between the two protocols (not shown). Microarrays were hybridized overnight at 65 °C, washed as described (12Eisen M.B. Brown P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) and scanned with a GenePix 4000 microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, South San Francisco, CA). Each time point and condition was repeated typically three-five times. Microarrays were analyzed with the Scanalyze program (written by Mike Eisen and available on the Web) to determine the fluorescent intensities of the two dyes for each spot. The fluorescence intensities were normalized by applying a scaling factor so that the median fluorescence ratio of all spots with detectable signals above background on each microarray was 1.0 (20Alizadeh A.A. Eisen M.B. Davis R.E. Ma C. Lossos I.S. Rosenwald A. Boldrick J.C. Sabet H. Tran T., Yu, X. Powell J.I. Yang L. Marti G.E. Moore T. Hudson Jr., J. Lu L. Lewis D.B. Tibshirani R. Sherlock G. Chan W.C.

The data were then filtered such that only spots with intensities that were three times greater than background in either channel were used in the analysis. Only those spots that displayed a 2-fold or greater difference in fluorescence intensities between the two dyes were used to generate gene clusters. For all such clusters, each spot was manually examined to assess its quality and those that exhibited poor quality throughout the analysis were removed. Spots of poor quality in individual microarrays were discarded from the dataset and are represented in the gene clusters as gray bars. Poor quality spots were removed if they were 1) very small, 2) irregularly shaped, or 3) with pixels that were not uniformly distributed throughout the spot. In the gene clusters, black bars represent genes that displayed -fold changes of 2 or less. Data clustering was performed using the Cluster program and figures generated using Tree View (both available on the Web) (21Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar). Total RNA (5 μg) was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis using standard molecular biological techniques.GRO1 cDNA was prepared by RT-PCR from total RNA fromT. gondii-infected HFFs using the following oligonucleotides: GRO1-F 5′-CGGAAAGCTTGCCTCAATCCT-3′ and GRO1-R 5′-GATCCGCCAGCCTCTATCACA-3′. β-actin (IMAGE: 867606) and DKK1 (IMAGE: 669375) cDNAs were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and were sequenced-verified. Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dGTP with the Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) and hybridized with Express-Hyb (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were exposed to film, and the autoradiographs were scanned and analyzed using the ImageQuaNT analysis program (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) Secreted GRO1 protein was detected by ELISA using the GRO1 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To characterize the host cell response to T. gondii infection, we employed cDNA microarray analysis, which is a powerful tool for analyzing global changes in gene expression. Because this technique can be subject to variability due to a combination of RNA preparation and handling, spot quality, and data analysis (15Cohen P. Bouaboula M. Bellis M. Baron V. Jbilo O. Poinot-Chazel C. Galiegue S. Hadibi E.H. Casellas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11181-11190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it is necessary first to determine the experimental error for the conditions being used. Once determined, these variables allow thresholds to be set below which changes are not regarded as significant. Thus, HFF cultures were mock-infected or infected with T. gondii tachyzoites for 14 h in duplicate, and RNA was isolated from infected and mock-infected cells. HFFs were used in this study, because they are a well characterized T. gondii cell culture model. Moreover, they are non-transformed and do not require pretreatment with differentiation factors, such as growth factors or phorbol esters, which limit the extent of variability between cell preparations. Microarrays were then hybridized with cDNA probes synthesized using RNA from the infected and the mock-infected samples. We compared the difference between infected and uninfected cells for each spot whose signal intensity in either channel was at least 500 fluorescence units, which corresponds to three times greater than background. Using this filter, 11,976 spots (45% of the total number of spots) were included in the analysis. To assess assay reproducibility, the fold difference for each spot was plotted for the two duplicate experiments (Fig.1 A). The data showed a linear regression of 0.88, indicating a generally high level of correlation. Next, the 11,976 spots were filtered to include only spots of high quality that displayed a fluorescence ratio between infected and uninfected cells of >2 in either microarray. Using these criteria, a total of 1503 spots (∼6% of the original 11,976 spots) were analyzed with a regression correlation of r = 0.95 (Fig.1 B). Similar analysis demonstrated that no significant bias was observed when the Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP labels were reversed (not shown). Because T. gondii is an intracellular parasite, the RNA preparation protocol used resulted in the purification of not only HFF RNA but also parasite RNA. Thus, the apparent gene modulation observed could have conceivably been an artifact due to cross-hybridization between T. gondii cDNA and spots on the human microarray. To control for this, a human cDNA microarray was hybridized with Cy5-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe made from 20 μg of uninfected HFF RNA and Cy3-dUTP-labeled cDNA probe made from 16 μg of uninfected HFF RNA to which 4 μg (20%) total parasite RNA, prepared from washed and filtered tachyzoites, was added. Data analysis indicated that T. gondii cDNA does not cross-hybridize to any measurable extent with any spot on the human microarray (not shown). Because the parasites were cultured in vitro in HFF monolayers and purified by syringe-lysis, host cell debris remaining in the parasite preparation could have modulated gene expression in uninfected monolayers. Thus, the response of HFFs infected for 2 h with T. gondii were compared with HFFs treated with an equivalent preparation of uninfected HFFs, which were scraped and prepared using conditions identical to those used to prepare the parasites. Two different microarrays were hybridized with either cDNA from the parasite-infected or debris-treated cells against cDNA from untreated HFFs. The microarray from the cell debris-treated sample showed no significant changes in gene expression whereas the infected cells displayed the usual profile of gene induction (not shown). These data indicate that the changes in gene expression detected by microarrays are real, reproducible, and the result of T. gondii infection. To dissect the temporal response of HFFs infected withT. gondii, a time course was performed during which RNA was purified from HFFs that were mock- or parasite-infected for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hpi with T. gondii tachyzoites. To minimize host cell lysis following parasite egress, the time course was limited to 24 h and we used the PDS strain, a ME49 clonal derivative, that grows more slowly than the highly virulent Type 1 RH strain (doubling time of ∼12 h (PDS) versus ∼6–8 h (RH)) (19Boothroyd J.C. Black M. Bonnefoy S. Hehl A. Knoll L.J. Manger I.D. Ortega-Barria E. Tomavo S. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1997; 352: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For each time point, a microarray was used to compare cDNA prepared from mock-infected versus parasite-infected cells. Following hybridization, the data were filtered based on the criteria described above: spots were three times greater than background in at least one channel, of high quality, and displayed a 2-fold change or greater (relative to uninfected) in at least one time point during the experiment. The filtered data were organized into temporal gene expression clusters. This approach was previously used to classify cell-cycle-regulated genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identify serum responsive genes in HFFs (21Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar, 22Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C. f. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson J.

Brown P.O. Botstein D. Futcher D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3273-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). Clustering of the time course data indicated that two distinct gene expression patterns were present: genes that are modulated rapidly after infection (1–2 hpi) and those that are modulated later (>6 hpi) (Fig.2). Due to the large number of genes modulated during the time course, only data related to genes that have some functional information are shown and discussed. The full group, including ESTs and genes not discussed here, can be downloaded from J.C.B.'s website at Stanford University. During the first 2 h of infection, a total of 63 unique, known genes exhibited a 2-fold or greater increase in their abundance, whereas 15 unique, known genes exhibited a 2-fold or greater decrease. A high proportion of the induced genes (27 genes, 43%), are genes previously known to be associated with the immune response. These immunomodulatory molecules include chemokines (GRO1,GRO2, LIF, and MCP1), cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6), cell matrix and adhesion proteins (ICAM1 and matrix metalloproteinase 3), apoptotic (superoxide dismutase 2) and transcriptional regulatory factors (REL-B, NF-κB p105, I-κBα). Several additional cytokines previously shown to be important in T. gondiiinfection, such as β-interferon,IL-10, and IL-12 (24Schmitz J.L. Carlin J.M. Borden E.C. Byrne G.I. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3254-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hunter C.A. Subauste C.S. Van Cleave V.H. Remington J.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2818-2824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were not among the genes spotted on the microarrays and therefore were not included in this analysis. Although TNF-α and IFN-γ, which is not normally expressed in HFFs, were not spotted on the microarrays used for this time course, subsequent microarray experiments, using microarrays that included TNF-α andIFN-γ, showed that they were not induced even by 24 hpi (not shown). Although the early induced genes are predominantly associated with the immune response, these represent a relatively small number of immune response genes spotted on the microarrays. For example, only 4 out of 24 genes encoding chemokines and 2 out of 41 genes encoding interleukins or their receptors were up-regulated byT. gondii 2 hpi. Although microarrays are a powerful tool to study global transcriptional responses to infection, it is important to confirm microarray data using independent methods such as Northern blot analysis, ribonuclease protection assay, or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Northern blots of representative genes from among those induced, repressed, or unchanged by infection were performed to verify the microaray data. RNA prepared from uninfected and infected cells (2 and 24 hpi) were used to make cDNA for hybridization to the microarrays and for analysis by Northern blotting using probes for an up-regulated gene (GRO1), a down-regulated gene (DKK1), and an unmodulated gene (β-actin). The Northern blot data were consistent with the microarrays providing an independent validation of the microarray data (Fig. 3). Although β-actin remained unchanged by both microarray and Northern blot analysis, it was observed that GRO1 was up-regulated andDKK1 was down-regulated with both techniques. Importantly, the Northern blot data corroborated the microarray GRO1induction trend, i.e. 8- and 20-fold induction (2 hpi) and 38- and 95-fold induction (24 hpi) (microarray and Northern, respectively). To determine whether the change in GRO1 mRNA levels reflects a change in the GRO1 protein produced, we used an ELISA-based assay to determine the amount of this chemokine in the medium of uninfected versus T. gondii-infected HFF cultures. The results indicated that 4 hpi of T. gondiistimulated an increase in the GRO1 concentration from ∼600 to ∼9000 pg/ml (data not shown). These results are in good agreement with the 8- to 20-fold induction of GRO1 mRNA indicated by the microarray and Northern blot data. To examine the late pattern of gene expression in greater detail, two independent 24-h infections were analyzed with microarrays. The data were filtered to identify genes whose spots were of high quality and in both experiments were up- or down-modulated at least 2-fold. Using these criteria, 567 unique genes were identified of which 376 corresponded to previously characterized genes with some functional information while 191 were ESTs or genes of unknown function. Categorizing the known genes by function indicated that numerous cellular processes are modulated during T. gondii infection. These included genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (13.7%); transcriptional regulation (13.2%); protein synthesis, targeting, and degradation (12.3%); cell signaling (11.4%); inflammation (8.2%); cell adhesion and cytoskeleton (8.2%); nucleotide and amino acid metabolism (4.7%); cell cycle (4.1%); and apoptosis (3%). It is important to note that this type of functional annotation may be misleading, because some genes may be involved in more than one process but have been arbitrarily grouped into a single class. For example, although ICAM1 is an adhesion molecule, its expression is often associated with the inflammatory response (26van de Stolpe A. van der Saag P.T. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 13-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Because the list of modulated known genes and unknown ESTs is too large to be presented in this report, the list can be downloaded from J.C.B.'s website at Stanford University. Examination of those down-regulated genes revealed no clear trends for any group of genes involved in a particular function or pathway. Examination of the up-regulated genes, however, showed some clear functional groupings and is discussed below. Similar to other intracellular parasites, T. gondii must scavenge from its host nutrients such as glucose and cholesterol (27Sinai A.P. Joiner K.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 415-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our results show that many enzymes associated with these pathways are up-regulated during infection. Glycolysis is a 10-step metabolic pathway that converts glucose to 2 molar equivalents of pyruvate with a net yield of 2 molar equivalents of ATP. Genes encoding each of the host glycolytic enzymes were present on these microarrays. Of these genes,hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase 1, triose phosphate isomerase 1, phosphoglycerate kinase,phosphoglycerate mutase 1, and enolase 2 were significantly up-regulated ≥2-fold (Fig.4). However, glucose phosphate isomerase, aldolase A, and pyruvate kinase 1were not significantly changed. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was up-regulated (3.7-fold) in one experiment, and in the second, it was up-regulated ∼1.8-fold, which is below the minimal threshold of significance. Depending on the aerobic status of the host, pyruvate is further metabolized to either lactate or acetyl-CoA. Microarray data indicated that lactate dehydrogenase-A (muscle isoform) was up-regulated 24 hpi. Besides lactate dehydrogenase-A, two other lactate dehydrogenase isoforms have been previously characterized (lactate dehydrogenase-B (heart isoform) and lactate dehydrogenase-C (sperm isoform)) (28Ansari A.A. Baig M.A. Malling H.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Of these, lactate dehydrogenase-B was not spotted on the microarrays, and the spot for lactate dehydrogenase-C was of insufficient intensity to be included in our analysis, suggesting that it is not expressed in HFFs. Acetyl-CoA, which is generated from pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, can be utilized by the TCA cycle that is coupled to oxidative phosphorylation. We found that expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex genes was not significantly changed duringT. gondii infection. Moreover, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoenzyme 1, which is a negative regulator of pyruvate dehydrogenase, was up-regulated ∼2.5-fold.Fructose-bisphosphatase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in gluconeogenesis, was not significantly altered 24 hpi. Genes encoding components of the nine TCA cycle holoenzymes, exceptsuccinyl-CoA synthase, were spotted on the microarrays, and none were significantly induced or repressed during infection. Similarly, no significant changes were observed in the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in either amino acid catabolism, which yield either pyruvate or acetyl-CoA, or in the p"

Several cell types, including neuroendocrine chromaffin cells, have evolved to sense oxygen levels and initiate specific adaptive responses to hypoxia. Here we report that under hypoxic conditions, rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells are resistant to apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and chemotherapy treatment. This effect is also observed after treatment with deferoxamine, a compound that mimics many of the effects of hypoxia. The hypoxia-dependent protection from apoptosis correlates with activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which is detected after 3–4 h of hypoxic or deferoxamine treatment and is sustained while hypoxic conditions are maintained. Hypoxia-induced Akt activation can be prevented by treatment with cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting that de novoprotein synthesis is required. Finally, inhibition of PI3K impairs both the protection against apoptosis and the activation of Akt in response to hypoxia, suggesting a functional link between these two phenomena. Thus, reduced oxygen tension regulates apoptosis in PC12 cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.

Organisms respond to changes in oxygen tension with specific local and systemic adaptations aimed to restore a normal oxygen supply. Several tissues and cell types are responsible for the detection of blood pO2 and the induction of specific adaptive responses; among them, the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla play a critical role by releasing catecholamines in response to hypoxia (1Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). PC12, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line derived from a tumor of adrenal medulla chromaffin tissue, is an oxygen-sensitive cell type that provides a useful system to study the effects of hypoxia on catecholamine gene expression (2Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). PC12 cells are exquisitely sensitive to hypoxia, because very small reductions in atmospheric oxygen dramatically induce tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression and mRNA stability (3Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In response to hypoxia several transcription factors are activated in PC12 cells. These include the cAMP response element-binding protein, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-2 or EPAS),1 and c-Fos (2Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol.

Neurol. 1994; 348: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). PC12 cells also express hypoxia-regulated ion channels, as shown by the finding that PC12 cells depolarize under hypoxia via an oxygen-regulated K+ current; as a consequence of depolarization, they secrete dopamine and norepinephrine. In addition, PC12 cells have been used extensively as a model to study programmed cell death. Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is an evolutionary conserved mechanism of cellular demise developed by animals to delete damaged, misplaced, or redundant cells during development and tissue homeostasis. Apoptosis was first described as cell death with specific morphologic features (6Kerr J. Wyllie A. Currie A. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12874) Google Scholar). In addition to the characteristic morphology, apoptotic cells present specific biochemical alterations including exposure of phosphatidylserine to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane and activation of specific proteases (caspases). Upon activation, caspases cleave several intracellular molecules, leading to the functional and morphological changes observed during apoptosis. Caspase processing also leads to the activation of specific nucleases, which in turn cleave genomic DNA, giving rise to a characteristic pattern of DNA degradation that is considered a hallmark of apoptosis (7Saraste A. Pulkki K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). Cell fate is largely dependent upon extracellular survival signals that prevent the activation of the apoptotic machinery (8Raff M.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). Studies on the survival effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) on PC12 cells provided the first evidence that activation of the enzyme PI3K was critical for its protective effect (9Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PI3K phosphorylates membrane phosphoinositides at the D-3 position. These 3′-phosphorylated phospholipids act as second messengers that mediate the diverse cellular functions of PI3K. One of the targets of these lipid second messengers is the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (10Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Akt contains a pleckstrin homology domain that is thought to directly bind the phospholipid products of PI3K activation. This binding recruits Akt to the plasma membrane and induces a conformational change that allows the phosphorylation of Akt by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinases I and II at the residues Thr-308 and Ser-473, respectively (11Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Akt results in the full activation of its kinase activity and the subsequent regulation of multiple cellular processes, including the transmission of growth factor-dependent survival signals. The effects of PI3K are controlled by the product of the tumor suppressor gene pten, which encodes a phosphatase that dephosphorylates 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (12Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in response to a large number of stimuli (13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In addition to many different agonists, it has been described that Akt is also activated in response to several types of stress including oxidative stress (14Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 19: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Importantly, the activation of this pathway, even by stress signals, results in an antiapoptotic effect. Finally, it has recently been shown that hypoxia activates Akt in pten-deficient glioma cells (15Zundel W. Schindler C. Haas-Kogan D. Koong A. Kaper F. Chen E. Gottschalk A.R. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Jefferson A.B. Stokoe D. Giaccia A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we show that hypoxia results in the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in PC12 cells by a novel mechanism that involvesde novo protein synthesis. The activation of this pathway by hypoxia results in the protection against apoptosis induced by different stimuli. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with GLUTAMAX-I (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Hypoxia (1% O2) was induced by culture of cells inside an air-tight chamber with inflow and outflow valves that was infused with a mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2 (S.E. Carburos Metalicos S.A., Madrid, Spain); in those experiments using mild hypoxia (5% O2) the mixture used was 5% O2, 5% CO2, 90% N2 (S.E. Carburos Metalicos S.A.). Prior to transferring to the hypoxia chamber, the medium was removed from the plates, cells were washed, and fresh (complete or serum-free) medium was added to the plates. In experiments in which drugs were used, the compounds were added immediately prior to transfer to hypoxia/normoxia conditions. For experiments using kinase inhibitors, cells were pretreated during 1 h with the different inhibitors or vehicle and then placed in hypoxia chambers. After treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in 70 or 200 μl (P35 or P60mm dishes, respectively) of a lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.004% bromphenol blue. Lysates were sonicated for 4 s in a Sonicator 150 (MSE) and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 2 min at 14,000 × g. Lysates were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using electroblotting procedures. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (anti-Akt (number 9272) and anti-phospho-Akt serine 473 (number 9271) from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA; anti-HIF-2α/EPAS from Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Immunolabeling was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle after DNA staining with propidium iodide (PI) as described (16J. P. Robinson Z. Darzynkiewicz P. N. Dean A. Orfao Rabinovitch A. Stewart P.S. Tanke C.C. WeelessL. L. H.J. Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 6-well plates until they reached ∼50% confluence (typically 24–48 h). Medium was then replaced with complete or serum-free medium (where indicated, specific compounds were included in culture medium), and cells were placed in normoxic or hypoxic conditions for the indicated periods of time. After treatment, cells that remained attached to plates were harvested in PBS/EDTA (5 mm EDTA in PBS) and collected together with those floating (detached) dead cells. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at ∼200 × g, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS by pipetting thoroughly to avoid cell clumping. The cell suspension was transferred to 4.5 ml of 70% cold ethanol and kept in this fixative for a minimum of 2 h. Ethanol-fixed cells were centrifuged for 5 min at ∼200 ×g and washed once with 10 ml of PBS. Finally, the cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml of PI/Triton X-100 staining solution (0.1% Trixon X-100, 20 μg/ml PI, 0.2 mg/ml RNase in PBS) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Beckton Dickinson). The analysis of samples included a first selection (gate 1) in which events with the appropriate size (forward scatter) and complexity (side scatter) were selected. Then selected events were analyzed to discard doublets using a PI intensity-width versus PI intensity-area dot plot (gate 2). Finally, events (cells) that were contained in gates 1 and 2 were plotted in a histogram representing the number of events (cells) containing a specific PI intensity-area (e.g.specific amount of DNA). Apoptosis was measured as the percentage of cells with a sub G0/G1 DNA content in the PI intensity-area histogram plot (16J. P. Robinson Z. Darzynkiewicz P. N. Dean A. Orfao Rabinovitch A. Stewart P.S. Tanke C.C. WeelessL. L. H.J. Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Viability was measured by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) method as described (17Lobner D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 96: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on poly-l-lysine pre-coated 96-well plates and grown in complete medium until they reached 30–50% confluence (usually 12–24 h). Then medium was replaced with complete or serum-free medium, and cells were placed under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic conditions (1% O2) for 18–24 h. After treatments MTT (Sigma) diluted in PBS was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, and all samples were incubated at 37 °C for 2–4 h under normoxic conditions. Finally, medium was removed, and precipitated MTT salts were solubilized in 0.04n HCl diluted in isopropanol. Product formation was monitored by reading absorbance at 550 nm using a microplate reader. Cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes and grown in complete medium until they reached ∼80% confluence. Thereafter, culture medium was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were placed under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic conditions (1% O2) for 12 h. Where indicated, cells were stimulated with 100–150 ng/ml NGF for 10 min. After treatments, cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; for PI3K assays 1 mm CaCl2 was included). About 10% of each lysate was saved to assay for proteins in the lysate, and the remaining was immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling; number 9271) or 2.5 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; number 05–321) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed, and inmunocomplexes were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using histone H2B (Akt assay) or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI3K assay) as substrates (18Gonzalez-Garcia A.

Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Where indicated, experimental data were analyzed using the PrismTM GraphPad (version 2.0) software. Data were analyzed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by the Newman-Keuls test; the p values obtained in this analysis are indicated in the text and figures. Similar results (statistical significance) were obtained when using the Tukey or Bonferroni test after ANOVA or when comparing relevant pairs of data by the Student's t test. To assess the effect of hypoxia on apoptosis, PC12 cells were treated with different combinations of either complete or serum-free medium and normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic conditions (1% O2) for various periods of time (Fig. 1 A). After treatments, apoptosis was measured as the percentage of cells with a content of DNA lower than G0/G1 by analysis of the cell cycle by flow cytometry (16J. P. Robinson Z. Darzynkiewicz P. N. Dean A. Orfao Rabinovitch A. Stewart P.S. Tanke C.C. WeelessL. L. H.J. Current Protocols in Cytometry. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Ashows that hypoxia itself can induce apoptosis in PC12 cells, as previously reported (20Yoshimura S. Banno Y. Nakashima S. Takenaka K. Sakai H. Nishimura Y. Sakai N. Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6921-6927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but its importance is only significant after longer than 36 h in low oxygen conditions (Fig. 1 A,inset). In contrast, serum withdrawal, which is a potent apoptotic signal for PC12 cells (21Lindenboim L. Diamond R. Rothenberg E. Stein R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1242-1247PubMed Google Scholar), results in a significant percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis as early as 9 h (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, the induction of apoptosis upon serum withdrawal was greatly reduced when cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 1 A). The reduction of apoptosis was statistically significant at 12 (p < 0.001), 24 (p < 0.001), and 36 (p < 0.01) h after serum removal (57, 68, and 62% inhibition, respectively). Fig.1 B shows the cell cycle profile of PC12 cells 24 h after the indicated treatments in a representative experiment. The effect of hypoxia on cellular viability was confirmed using the MTT assay (17Lobner D. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2000; 96: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Whereas hypoxia (1% O2 for 20 h) itself had little effect on cell viability (14% reduction in viability as compared with cells in normoxia), serum starvation for 20 h reduced viability to 53% as compared with control cells (Fig.1 C). In agreement with flow cytometry data, the reduction of cell viability caused by serum withdrawal was decreased under hypoxic conditions (21% reduction of cell viability as compared with cells in normoxia) (Fig. 1 C). The cellular responses to hypoxia can be observed at higher concentrations of oxygen, although with less efficiency. Consistently, a significant reduction in apoptosis, triggered by serum withdrawal, was also observed at 5% O2(Fig. 2 A), which corresponds to a pO2 (36 torr) within the physiological range found in venous blood in vivo. Moreover, treatment with deferoxamine or cobalt chloride (CoCl2), 2M. Álvarez-Tejado, M. O. Landázuri, and L. del Peso, unpublished observations. two compounds widely used to mimic many of the effects of hypoxia (23Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a reduction of apoptosis (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Hypoxia protects from apoptosis. A, PC12 cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown until they reached 40–50% confluence. Thereafter, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free (−) or complete culture medium (+), and cells were incubated at the indicated concentrations of oxygen. Where indicated, deferoxamine was included in the culture medium at a final concentration of 75 μm(75DFX) or 150 μm (150DFX), and cells were incubated in 21% O2. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry 18–24 h after treatments. B, PC12 cells were grown as in A. Thereafter, the culture medium was replaced with fresh complete culture medium supplemented, where indicated, with 1 μg/ml taxol or 50 μg/ml fluorouracil (5FU). Cells were incubated for 12–15 h under normoxic (21% O2,N) or hypoxic conditions (1% O2, H), and apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. Results from five independent experiments are shown. Each symbol represents the percentage of apoptosis in samples from a single experiment (Exp.). The horizontal bars(Aver.) represent the means of all the experiments shown. The statistical significance of the results (see “Experimental Procedures”) is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether hypoxia was able to protect against apoptotic stimuli other than serum withdrawal. Treatment of PC12 cells with the anti-cancer drugs taxol or fluorouracil (5-fluoro-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione) for 12–18 h induced a low, but significant, percentage of apoptosis (Fig. 2 B). As seen for serum withdrawal, under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) PC12 cells were significantly protected against apoptosis (p< 0.05 for taxol and p < 0.001 for fluorouracil) induced by the chemotherapeutic drugs (Fig. 2 B). Thus, hypoxic conditions induced by low oxygen or the drug deferoxamine are able to prevent apoptosis induced by different stimuli in PC12 cells. To identify the mechanism responsible for the pro-survival effect of hypoxia, we decided to study the effect of hypoxia on the proto-oncogenic serine/threonine kinase Akt, a molecule involved in the transduction of antiapoptotic signals (13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 24Nunez G. del Peso L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt can be easily detected by Western blotting with antibodies that specifically recognize Akt molecules phosphorylated at serine 473, because this phosphorylation correlates with Akt activity (13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Hypoxia treatment resulted in phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 (Fig. 3 A). The hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of Akt was observed regardless of the presence or absence of serum or the type of culture substrate used (Fig.3 A). Phosphorylation of Akt on serine 473 reflects its activation as demonstrated by increased kinase activity of immunoprecipitated Akt from hypoxia-treated cells (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, the activation of PI3K/Akt does not seem to be a general cellular response to hypoxia, because Akt phosphorylation was not observed in other cell lines tested2 including human vascular endothelial cells, neuroblastoma-69 cells, human embryo kidney 293 cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, COS cells, and Hepa cells. However, it seems to be a response restricted to specific cell types, because, in addition to the PC12 cell line, Akt phosphorylation was observed in primary chromaffin cells from cow adrenal gland and neuro-2A cells under hypoxic conditions.2 Akt phosphorylation was also observed in PC12 cells that were differentiated to a neuronal phenotype by treatment with NGF for 3–6 days, and it correlated with protection against apoptosis.2 Kinetic studies showed that Akt phosphorylation was detected 4–6 h after initiation of hypoxic treatment (Fig.4 A). The time course of Akt activation in response to hypoxia was distinct from that observed after challenge with NGF; whereas hypoxia requires several hours to induce Akt activation, stimulation with NGF activates Akt within minutes (Fig.4 B). Moreover, hypoxia-induced Akt phosphorylation was sustained, in contrast with the transient effect found after NGF stimulation (Fig. 4 B). The activation of hypoxia-induced signaling pathways was monitored by the stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor, EPAS, one of the best characterized intracellular responses to oxygen deprivation (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, hypoxia-activated transcription, assessed by EPAS stabilization, preceded Akt activation (Fig. 4, A andB). The activation of Akt by deferoxamine, a chemical that mimics hypoxia, followed a similar time course to that observed under hypoxia (Fig. 4 B). The difference in the kinetics of EPAS stabilization and Akt activation was particularly evident after deferoxamine treatment (Fig. 4 B). In addition, activation of Akt by deferoxamine was only observed at doses capable of activating hypoxia-like signaling pathways, as measured by EPAS stabilization (Fig. 4 C). Moderate hypoxia (5% O2) also resulted in Akt phosphorylation.2 Finally, Akt phosphorylation was also observed by treatment with the hypoxia-mimetic CoCl2 (Fig. 4 C). Next, we studied the molecular mechanism by which hypoxia induced Akt activation. Because Akt activation, in most instances, is dependent on PI3K activation (13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), we first analyzed whether PI3K activity was affected by hypoxia. As shown in Fig.5 A, PI3K was activated by hypoxia in PC12 cells. Interestingly, the PI3K activity shown in Fig.5 A was detected in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from hypoxic cells, suggesting that hypoxia resulted in the activation of a tyrosine kinase upstream of PI3K/Akt. To confirm the involvement of PI3K, we tested the effect of two structurally nonrelated PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. Both inhibitors completely prevented Akt phosphorylation induced by hypoxia (Fig.5 B). The delayed time course of Akt activation (Fig. 4), together with the observation that it occurred after the induction of hypoxia-responsible transcription factors such as EPAS (Fig. 4), suggested that Akt activation by hypoxia required gene expression. Thus, treatment of cells with inhibitors of RNA (actinomycin D) or protein (cycloheximide) synthesis completely prevented hypoxia-induced Akt activation (Fig.5 B). The effect of actinomycin or cycloheximide was not due to a toxic or nonspecific effect, because pretreatment with these compounds for several hours did not affect NGF-induced Akt phosphorylation.2 Finally, we tested whether other signaling pathways contributed to Akt phosphorylation. The calmodulin-regulated and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are activated by hypoxia and mediate some of its effects in PC12 cells (25Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Conrad P.W. Millhorn D.E. Beitner-Johnson D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 293-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Beitner-Johnson D. Leibold J. Millhorn D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inhibition of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), one of the upstream kinases in the MAPK cascade, with PD59098 or treatment with antagonists of calmodulin signaling (W12 and W132; calmidazolium) had no effect on Akt phosphorylation induced by hypoxia (Fig. 5 B). The lack of effect of calmodulin antagonists is particularly relevant because the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase was recently shown to be able to phosphorylate and activate Akt (13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Hence, activation of Akt by hypoxia required de novosynthesis of proteins and was dependent on PI3K activity but not MAPK cascade or calmodulin signaling. Importantly, a conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated PC12 cells was unable to induce Akt activation in normoxic cells,2 suggesting that the effect of hypoxia was not due to the synthesis of a soluble factor able to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. We have shown that hypoxia prevents apoptosis in response to several stimuli and that this effect correlates with the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. To investigate whether there was a functional link between these two phenomena, we investigated the effect of PI3K inhibitors on the protective effect of hypoxia. As shown in Fig.6, the reduction of apoptosis, upon serum removal, observed under hypoxia was completely prevented by treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin. These results indicate that the protection against apoptosis induced by hypoxia depends on the activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway. In addition to the PI3K/Akt pathway, the MAPK cascade has an important role in survival of PC12 cells (28Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar). However, the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) had no effect on the protective effect of hypoxia (Fig. 6), despite increasing the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis upon serum withdrawal under normoxic conditions (Fig. 6). In agreement with these results, the protective effects of deferoxamine and CoCl2treatment on apoptosis upon serum withdrawal (Fig. 2 A) were also abrogated by inhibition of PI3K.2 Reduction of oxygen supply has deleterious effects on many tissues. Neurons and cardiac muscle cells are particularly sensitive because they suffer both necrotic and apoptotic cell death when deprived of oxygen, which occurs during ischemia (29Williams R.S. Benjamin I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 30Lee J.-M. Grabb M.C. Zipfel G.J. Choi D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, hypoxia is not always lethal. Faced with this stress, some cell types undergo cell cycle arrest but remain viable (31Schmaltz C. Hardenbergh P.H. Wells A. Fisher D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and others remain unaltered. Moreover, the induction of apoptosis observed after long periods of hypoxia could be due to acidosis rather than to a direct effect of hypoxia (31Schmaltz C. Hardenbergh P.H. Wells A. Fisher D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In addition, organisms are able to respond to both acute and chronic reductions in oxygen tension with specific adaptive responses aimed to restore appropriate oxygen supply. Some of these responses, such as induction of angiogenesis, are local, whereas others are systemic. The systemic responses include hyperventilation, increase in heart output, increase in erythropoiesis, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and carotid body hypertrophy, among others. The induction of these responses is under the control of specific cell types that have evolved to sense oxygen levels. These cell types include the glomus cells of the carotid body, the cells of the neuroepithelial bodies in the lung, and the chromaffin cells of the medulla of the adrenal gland, among others. In particular, the chromaffin cells are critical players in the response to oxygen deprivation in fetuses and neonates (1Tian H. Hammer R.E. Matsumoto A.M. Russell D.W. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, it is feasible that these cell types have developed specific mechanisms ensuring their viability and functionality during hypoxia. In this study, we have shown that under hypoxic conditions PC12 cells are protected against apoptosis triggered by different stimuli. The protection against apoptosis is observed at pO2levels within the physiopathological range, and it can be induced by pharmacological agents that mimic hypoxia. This effect is paralleled by activation of the pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway through a mechanism that requires de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K not only prevents Akt activation but also the antiapoptotic effect of hypoxia. Thus, it is likely that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by hypoxia is the mechanism responsible for its antiapoptotic effect. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that, at least in specific cell types, hypoxia is able to promote survival. Our data concur with a previous report describing deferoxamine treatment as being able to prevent apoptosis (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K.I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G.L. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning (33Semenza G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), the partial resistance to ischemia-induced damage found after a previous episode of moderate ischemia, is due to a mechanism similar to the one described here will require further work. However, it is intriguing that preconditioning, similar to activation of Akt, requires de novo protein synthesis (29Williams R.S. Benjamin I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that hypoxia renders cells resistant to apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic drugs taxol and fluorouracil, an effect that might contribute to the partial resistance to therapy observed in the hypoxic regions of tumors as compared with the normoxic areas of the same tumors (34Teicher B.A. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 139-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this is not the only example in which proapoptotic stimuli induce an antiapoptotic response. Exposure of cells to H2O2 results in the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and resistance to induction of apoptosis (14Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 19: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Hence, activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway could be a general cellular response to cell and tissue injury. The activation of Akt by hypoxia in cells derived frompten−/− tumors has recently been described (15Zundel W. Schindler C. Haas-Kogan D. Koong A. Kaper F. Chen E. Gottschalk A.R. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Jefferson A.B. Stokoe D. Giaccia A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by hypoxia also occurs in some specific cells that are apparently normal forpten (35Lachyankar M.B. Sultana N. Schonhoff C.M. Mitra P. Poluha W. Lambert S. Quesenberry P.J. Litofsky N.S. Recht L.D. Nabi R. Miller S.J. Ohta S. Neel B.G. Ross A.H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1404-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including PC12 cells and primary chromaffin cells from cow adrenal gland medulla. This seems to be a specific response, restricted to at least cells of chromaffin lineage, rather than a general effect of hypoxia, because we did not detect any significant phosphorylation of Akt in other cell types tested. The lack of Akt activation in these cell lines was not the result of defective responses to hypoxia, because in all cases hypoxia-inducible factors were stabilized in response to hypoxia.2 In addition, the mechanism, involving de novo protein synthesis, and the sustained activation of Akt have not been described previously. One remaining question about this novel mechanism of Akt activation is the nature of the protein whose synthesis is required for the activation of Akt. Most likely it is not a soluble factor, at least not a stable one, released by hypoxic cells, because conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated cells failed to induce Akt activation in PC12 cells grown in normoxia.2 It is still possible that the effect is mediated by the induction of a nonsecreted membrane-bound ligand or by the induction of both a soluble factor and its receptor. One further possibility is that the synthesized molecule acts in a cell-autonomous manner by direct activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway from inside the cell. Further work will be required to differentiate among these possibilities. The identification of such a molecule could explain why the effect of hypoxia on Akt is restricted to some cell types. Hypoxia treatment results in changes in gene expression that are mediated by the activation of different transcription factors. Hypoxia-inducible factors are the best characterized; others include cAMP response element-binding protein (4Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19834-19839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), NF-κB (36Koong A.C. Chen E.Y. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1425-1430PubMed Google Scholar), and c-Fos (2Norris M.L. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23774-23779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although we cannot formally rule out that hypoxia-inducible transcription factors are involved in Akt activation, indirect evidence suggests that it is not the case, because both calmodulin antagonists and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 prevent EPAS activity in PC12 cells (25Conrad P.W. Freeman T.L. Beitner-Johnson D. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33709-33713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) without affecting hypoxia-induced Akt activation. We suggest that the activation of survival pathways by hypoxia, at least in chromaffin cells, ensures that the cells remain viable and able to trigger the responses required for the adaptation to varying oxygen tension. Finally, activation of Akt has many other effects, in addition to promoting survival. Among these effects are changes in gene expression, induction of cell proliferation, and increasing glucose uptake (13Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that many other effects of hypoxia in cell biology, in this cell type, could be mediated by activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. We thank M.

In the majority of these investigations, activation of one or more MAPKs resulted in stabilization of the target mRNA, which was dependent on regulatory elements contained within the 3′-UTR of the message. Post-transcriptional regulation is not limited to changes in message stability. Sequences within the 3′-UTR of mRNAs have also been shown to be important for enhancing message translation as well as for translational silencing (25Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell.

COX-2 is rapidly induced in response to IL-1β and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (16Guan Z. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol.

The cellular mechanism of IL-1β signaling in renal mesangial cells, although not yet fully defined, includes activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways (18Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Miller B.W. Springer L.D. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28670-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Blocking either of these pathways attenuates the IL-1β-induced expression of COX-2 protein and reduces COX-2 mRNA levels. It is believed that increased COX-2 expression is due to regulation of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events. We have previously shown that IL-1β increases the half-life of COX-2 mRNA and is associated with the induction of RNA-binding proteins that interact with sequences in the 3′-UTR of COX-2 (34Srivastava S.K. Tetsuka T. Daphna-Iken D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F504-F508PubMed Google Scholar). These binding proteins interact with the first 150 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR, which contains highly conserved adenosine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs). The results support a critical role for the AREs of COX-2 in IL-1β-dependent gene expression in mesangial cells. Thus, it appears that a common mechanism for control of gene expression by MAPK signaling pathways is through post-transcriptional gene regulation, which requires the 3′-UTR of the target gene. Other investigators have shown the importance of AREs in COX-2 gene expression (35Gou Q. Liu C.H. Ben Av P. Hla T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6628-6635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The majority of the AREs of COX-2 reside within the first 100 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR. This region of the 3′-UTR was shown to regulate message stability and translational efficiency of hybrid reporter genes. The entire 3′-UTR of COX-2 encompasses >2000 bases, and it seems likely that regions of the 3′-UTR outside of the AREs may also play a role in regulating COX-2 expression. To determine whether additional regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 regulate gene expression in mesangial cells, we constructed a series of reporter gene expression vectors containing various regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2. Based on the results of reporter gene expression, we determined that the 3′-UTR of COX-2 contains multiple control elements that regulate message stability and message translation, many of which represent novel control elements that lie outside of the first 100 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR. Thus, the level of expression for COX-2 in renal mesangial cells is determined in part by integration of multiple signals regulating post-transcriptional events that are dependent on sequences that reside in the 3′-UTR of the message.

Where indicated, mesangial cells were stimulated with IL-1β (100 units/ml). All experiments were performed with confluent cells and used at passages 3–6. Mouse immortalized mesangial cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1927). Cells were grown in a 3:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using cells at 70–80% confluency. Bluescript SK−containing DNA that encodes the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2 was generated as previously described (34Srivastava S.K.

Various regions of the DNA were amplified by PCR using primers terminating in an XbaI recognition sequence. PCR products were ligated into the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subsequently excised withXbaI. DNA fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and extracted using a Geneclean III kit (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). DNA inserts were ligated into the unique XbaI site of the pGL3-control vector, located in the 3′-UTR of the firefly luciferase gene. Mesangial cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). Cells were plated in six-well cluster plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated overnight. Mixtures of 2.5 μg of reporter gene plasmid DNA in 75 μl of serum-free medium and 15 μl of SuperFect reagent were incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature, followed by dilution to 0.5 ml with complete medium. The DNA·SuperFect complex was layered onto mesangial cells (2.5 μg of DNA/well); after a 2–3-h incubation, the medium was changed, and cells were incubated overnight for gene expression. Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cell monolayers in six-well clusters were removed by scraping into 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 s at 12,000 × g. Luciferase activity was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Assays were performed by injecting 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent into 20 μl of supernatant diluted 1:10. Light output was measured over a 10-s time period. Activity is expressed as relative light units and was normalized to cell protein. In some instances, cells were cotransfected with a Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pRL-TK, Promega), and firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity (data not shown). Results were equivalent to those obtained by normalization to protein content, and only data normalized to protein levels are reported. Total RNA was isolated from cells by a modified single-step acid/guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA was treated with DNase I (10 units, 37 °C, 30 min), followed by re-isolation of RNA with RNA STAT-60 reagent. DNase I treatment was repeated twice to eliminate amplification of reporter plasmid DNA and genomic DNA. RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) using random hexamer primers. After first-strand synthesis, the cDNA was quantified by TaqMan real-time PCR using gene-specific primers and the double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR green I. Fluorescence was detected with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Luciferase amplification primers were GCCTGAAGTCTCTGATTAAGT for the forward primer and ACACCTGCGTCGAAGATGT for the reverse primer. Amplification primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH) were TGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTGCC for the forward primer and AAGATGGTGATGGGCTTCCCG for the reverse primer. The amplicon was designed to be <150 base pairs and to have a melting temperature of 78–84 °C. Primer pairs were tested to ensure a robust amplification signal of the expected size with no additional bands. Melting curves were generated to determine the temperature that maximized fluorescence from SYBR green I binding to the amplicon and that minimized fluorescence due to primer dimers. The amount of luciferase message in each RNA sample was quantified and normalized to GAPDH content. Relative amounts of luciferase cDNA were calculated by the comparative CTmethod (49PE Biosystems, PE Biosystems User Bulletin 2, 1997, Foster City, CA.Google Scholar) and are expressed as a percentage of luciferase cDNA measured in cells transfected with pGL3-control. Mesangial cells were transiently transfected and incubated for 24 h for luciferase gene expression. Transcription was inhibited at this point by adding actinomycin D (10 μg/ml) to the cell culture medium. Total RNA was isolated at various times after actinomycin D addition, and luciferase mRNA content was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR as described above. Luciferase mRNA levels were normalized to GAPDH mRNA content and are expressed as a percentage of the mRNA level at the 0-h time point. Total RNA was translated in vitro using the wheat germ translation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Translation reactions contained 24 μl of wheat germ extract, 1.2 μl each of Master Mix−Leu and Master Mix−Met (a mixture of all the amino acids except the one indicated), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 4–8 μg of total RNA in total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C and stopped by placing tubes on ice. Duplicate samples containing 20 μl of the translation reaction were assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay described above. The amount of translated protein is expressed as luciferase activity normalized to total RNA content. All experiments were performed at least three times, each in duplicate. Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Comparison of means was performed using Student'st test. To determine the effect of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 on gene expression, reporter gene constructs were created by inserting DNA encoding various regions of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2 message into the 3′-UTR of the luciferase gene (Fig.1). Each construct contained the luciferase coding sequence under the control of the SV40 promoter and enhancer elements, followed by the 3′-UTR of luciferase and the SV40 late poly(A) signal. The reporter constructs differed only in the regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 that were inserted into the luciferase 3′-UTR. Regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 included the full-length 3′-UTR (nucleotides 1–2232), serial deletions from the distal and proximal ends of the 3′-UTR, and two internal regions of the 3′-UTR. Since all reporter constructs contained identical promoter elements, differences in luciferase activity reflect differences in regulation as a result of post-transcriptional events. We used a mouse immortalized mesangial cell line as a model system to study regulation of COX-2 in renal mesangial cells. Reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into this cell line, incubated overnight, and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity measured in cells transfected with the pGL3-control vector lacking 3′-UTR sequences of COX-2 was designated as 100%. Inserting the entire 3′-UTR (nucleotides 1–2232) of COX-2 into the 3′-UTR of luciferase resulted in a 70% decrease in luciferase activity (Fig.2), suggesting the presence of negative regulatory element(s) within the 3′-UTR of the COX-2 message. Compared with the full-length 3′-UTR, truncation of the distal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 to nucleotide 1558 or 1384 had no additional effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A). Removal of nucleotides 792 to 1384 caused a significant increase in luciferase activity (p < 0.05) to 66% of the control. This increase suggests the presence of a negative element between nucleotides 792 and 1384. In support of this conclusion, insertion of only nucleotides 792–1384 alone lowered luciferase activity to 24% of the control (Fig. 2 B). Further truncation from nucleotide 792 to 373 resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase activity (p < 0.001) to a level of activity that was 12% of the control (Fig. 2 A). This result suggested the presence of a positive element between nucleotides 792 and 373. Surprisingly, inclusion of nucleotides 373–792 not only failed to increase luciferase activity, but rather decreased luciferase activity (Fig.2 B). Thus, this region appears to modulate regulation of gene expression in a positive manner through interaction with the first 373 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR, but cannot increase gene expression by itself. Inclusion of only the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 decreased reporter gene activity to 10% of the control (Fig.2 A). This region of the 3′-UTR contains 7 of the 12 AUUUA consensus sequences, suggesting that the AREs in the 3′-UTR of COX-2 negatively regulate gene expression. Truncation from the proximal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 revealed the presence of an additional negative element. Removal of the first 60 nucleotides resulted in an increase in luciferase activity to 70% of the control. This region contains seven AUUUA consensus sequences, suggesting that they account for the decreased luciferase activity measured with the construct containing the full-length 3′UTR. However, truncation to nucleotide 373 or 792 reduced luciferase activity to a level equivalent to that of the full-length 3′-UTR, and inclusion of only the terminal 674 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 (nucleotides 1558–2232) caused a significant decrease in luciferase activity to nearly 5% of the control (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that additional negative elements are present within the 3′-UTR that are affected by the “context” in which they are presented. The terminal region contains three AUUUA consensus sequences, further supporting a negative role for AREs in the 3′-UTR of COX-2. Measurement of luciferase activity was used to quantitate the amount of reporter enzyme synthesized by transfected cells. Changes in luciferase activity could be due to either alterations in message stability or rates of mRNA translation. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the steady-state levels of luciferase mRNA using reverse transcriptase, followed by real-time PCR analysis. In this technique, the PCR product was measured as it accumulated, allowing for accurate quantitation of mRNA levels without the ambiguities associated with traditional reverse transcriptase-PCR. Luciferase mRNA levels in cells transfected with reporter gene constructs were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels and are expressed as a percentage of luciferase mRNA measured in cells transfected with the pGL3-control vector (Fig. 3). If loss of luciferase activity were due to decreased message stability, then we would observe comparable changes in message levels. If decreased luciferase were due to inhibition of translation, then we would expect to measure no change or a disproportionate change in luciferase mRNA levels. Comparison of the results from luciferase activity measurements (Fig.2) and quantitation of luciferase mRNA levels (Fig. 3) indicated that decreased luciferase expression occurred through multiple mechanisms. Insertion of the entire 3′-UTR of COX-2 into the 3′-UTR of luciferase had no effect on steady-state mRNA levels (Fig.3 A, 1–2232 versus pGL3c). Likewise, luciferase message levels using the reporter construct containing nucleotides 1–792 were not significantly different compared with the control. Thus, the decreased luciferase activity measured using these reporter constructs was presumed to reflect a decreased rate of message translation. In contrast, inclusion of nucleotides 1–60, 373–792, 792–1384, or 1558–2232 caused a significant and dramatic drop in luciferase mRNA levels compared with the luciferase gene alone (pGL3-control) and compared with the construct containing the entire 3′-UTR of COX-2 (nucleotides 1–2232). In most cases, the magnitude of the decrease in luciferase mRNA levels was nearly equal to the corresponding decrease in luciferase activity, suggesting that reporter gene expression with these constructs is strongly dependent on message stability. Truncation of the 3′-UTR to nucleotide 60 lowered luciferase mRNA levels to 30% of the control (Fig. 3 A), whereas luciferase activity decreased further to 10% of the control (Fig.2 A), suggesting both altered message stability and translational regulation. To confirm that changes in steady-state luciferase mRNA levels reflect altered message stability, we directly measured message degradation in cells transfected with three different constructs (Fig.4). Mesangial cells were transiently transfected, incubated for 24 h, and treated with actinomycin D to stop transcription. Luciferase mRNA was measured at various times after inhibition of transcription. Luciferase message without any COX-2 sequences was very stable and exhibited little or no decay over the 10-h treatment period. Adding the full-length 3′-UTR of COX-2 (nucleotides 1–2232) to the luciferase message had no significant effect on its stability. In contrast, insertion of the proximal 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 into the 3′-UTR of luciferase mRNA caused a dramatic decrease in message stability. These findings are in complete agreement with steady-state mRNA measurements. The results presented above suggest that various regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 regulate gene expression by altering message stability and/or translational efficiency. Table I shows the ratio of luciferase mRNA levels and luciferase activity levels in cells expressing the various reporter constructs. This quotient reflects the relative contribution of translation and message stability to the regulation of reporter gene activity. A larger number indicates that a greater contribution of message translation occurred, and the closer the ratio is to 1, the greater the dependence of reporter gene expression was on message stability. Cells expressing reporter constructs containing regions 1–2232 and 1–60 had the highest ratio of mRNA levels to luciferase activity, indicating a strong effect on message translation. Reporter constructs containing regions 1–373, 60–2232, 792–2232, 1558–2232, 792–1384, and 373–792 of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 expressed luciferase mRNA at levels that corresponded to an equivalent change in luciferase activity. Accordingly, these constructs had ratios nearly equal to 1, suggesting that the loss of reporter expression is due to decreased message stability. Results from the other constructs generated ratios that fell in between these extremes, suggesting a mixed effect on both message stability and message translation.Table IComparison of message and enzymatic activity levels of chimeric reporter gene constructsRegion of 3′-UTRmRNA levelLuciferase levelRatio1–223285.233.62.531–155854.221.82.491–138476.636.72.091–79212666.01.921–37322.411.81.891–6029.89.63.1060–223265.471.30.92373–223253.623.82.25792–223244.136.91.201558–22325.815.561.04792–138416.123.60.68373–79215.912.31.30Results from Fig. 3 (mRNA l"

A derivative of indolicidin, CP10A, has alanine residues substituted for proline residues and has improved activity against Gram-positive organisms. Transmission electron microscopy of Staphylococcus aureus andStaphylococcus epidermidis treated with CP10A showed mesosome-like structures in the cytoplasm. The peptide at 2-fold the minimal inhibitory concentration did not show significant killing ofS. aureus ISP67 (a histidine, uridine, and thymidine auxotroph) but did show an early effect on histidine and uridine incorporation and, later, an effect on thymidine incorporation. Upon interaction with liposomes, detergents, and lipoteichoic acid, CP10A was shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy to undergo a change in secondary structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the tryptophan residues were located at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface of liposomes and detergent micelles and were inaccessible to the aqueous quencher KI. The three-dimensional structure of CP10A in the lipid mimetic dodecylphosphocholine was determined using two-dimensional NMR methods and was characterized as a short, amphipathic helical structure, whereas indolicidin was previously shown to have an extended structure. These studies have introduced a cationic peptide with a unique structure and an ability to interact with membranes and to affect intracellular synthesis of proteins, RNA, and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2035298669,"We previously isolated and sequenced the ∼250-kDa type 1 receptor sorLA/LR11, a mosaic protein with elements characterizing the Vps10p domain receptor family as well as the low density lipoprotein receptor family. The N terminus of the Vps10p domain comprises a consensus sequence for cleavage by furin (50RRKR53) that precedes a truncation found in sorLA isolated from human brain. Here we show that sorLA, like sortilin-1/neurotensin receptor-3, whose lumenal domain consists of a Vps10p domain only, is synthesized as a proreceptor that is cleaved by furin in late Golgi compartments. We show that the truncation conditions the Vps10p domain for propeptide inhibitable binding of neuropeptides and the receptor-associated protein. We further demonstrate that avid binding of the receptor-associated protein, apolipoprotein E, and lipoprotein lipase not inhibited by propeptide occurs to sites located in other lumenal domains. In transfected cells, about 10% of full-length sorLA were expressed on the cell surface capable of mediating endocytosis. However, the major pool of receptors was found in late Golgi compartments, suggesting possible interaction with newly synthesized ligands. The results show that sorLA, following activation by truncation, binds multiple ligands and may mediate both endocytosis and sorting."
https://openalex.org/W2075121503,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has been shown to be a negative regulator of multiple signaling pathways in hematopoietic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SHP-1 dephosphorylates the lymphoid-specific Src family kinase Lck at Tyr-394 when both are transiently co-expressed in nonlymphoid cells. We also demonstrate that a GST-SHP-1 fusion protein specifically dephosphorylates Lck at Tyr-394 in vitro. Because phosphorylation of Tyr-394 activates Lck, the fact that SHP-1 specifically dephosphorylates this site suggests that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of Lck. The failure of SHP-1 to inactivate Lck may contribute to some of the lymphoid abnormalities observed in motheaten mice.

The failure of SHP-1 to inactivate Lck may contribute to some of the lymphoid abnormalities observed in motheaten mice. Src homology 2 glutathione S-transferase wild type Tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical control mechanism for growth, differentiation, cell cycle control, and cytoskeletal function. The signal transduction pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation are regulated by the concerted action of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Although much of the work has centered on the actions of the multitude of protein-tyrosine kinases, it is now apparent that the protein-tyrosine phosphatases play an equally diverse and important role. SHP-1 is a member of the SH21domain-containing family of nonmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatases that is predominately expressed in hematopoietic cells. SHP-1 and the related phosphatases SHP-2 and csw in Drosophilaall share a similar structure of two tandem SH2 domains in the N terminus followed by the catalytic domain and a C-terminal tail (1Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In resting cells, the SHP-1 SH2 domains sterically inhibit the catalytic activity of SHP-1 through interactions with the catalytic domain (2Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,3Martin A. Tsui H.W. Shulman M.J. Isenman D. Tsui F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21725-21734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following lymphocyte activation, the SH2 domains allow SHP-1 to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (4D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 5Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This binding serves to recruit SHP-1 to the membrane and relieve the steric inhibition, activating the phosphatase (2Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). A naturally occurring SHP-1 deficiency exists in the motheaten mouse. These mice do not express any detectable SHP-1 protein and exhibit a panoply of hematopoietic defects, ranging from the overproliferation of macrophages and neutrophils to abnormal B- and T-cell development and hyper-responsiveness (6Shultz L.D. Rajan T.V. Greiner D.L. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests that SHP-1 plays an inhibitory role in hematopoietic cells. Consistent with this idea, SHP-1 has been shown to negatively regulate signaling downstream of the erythropoietin receptor, c-Kit, the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, and the B- and T-cell antigen receptor (5Neel B.G.

In B cells, CD72 has been identified as anin vivo substrate of SHP-1 (10Wu Y. Nadler M.J. Brennan L.A. Gish G.D. Timms J.F. Fusaki N. Jongstra-Bilen J. Tada N. Pawson T. Wither J. Neel B.G. Hozumi N.

Additionally, SIRP-α and p62DOK have been identified as SHP-1 substrates in macrophages (11Timms J.F. Carlberg K. Gu H. Chen H. Kamatkar S. Nadler M.J. Rohrschneider L.R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

In T cells, the adapter protein SLP-76 and the cytosolic tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 have been shown to be substrates of SHP-1 (13Binstadt B.A. Billadeau D.D. Jevremovic D. Williams B.L. Fang N. Yi T.

We initially focused our efforts on Lck because of the prolonged Lck catalytic activity observed in motheaten thymocytes (15Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and because Lck is an upstream activator of ZAP-70 (16Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Lck is a lymphoid cell-specific member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that is essential for both the development of T cells in the thymus and the response of mature T cells to signals arising from the T-cell antigen receptor (17Molina T.J. Kishihara K. Siderovski D.P. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeham A. Paige C.J. Hartmann K.U. Veillette A. Davidson D. Mak T.W.

Like all Src family kinases, Lck is activated and inhibited by tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyr-394 is the site of stimulatory phosphorylation, whereas Tyr-505 is the site of inhibitory phosphorylation. Here we have examined whether SHP-1 directly regulates Lck phosphorylation. The cDNAs encoding wild-type murine Lck (WT), F505 Lck, F394 Lck, and ΔSH2 Lck have been described previously (19Voronova A.F. Sefton B.M.

For the transient transfections used in this study, the Lck cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). The SHP-1 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Matt Thomas (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The catalytically inactive SHP-1 cDNAs (D419A and C453S) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis. For transient transfections, the SHP-1 cDNAs were subcloned in frame into the vector CS3+MT (a kind gift from Dr. Jon Cooper, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA), which appends six copies of the Myc epitope tag to the N terminus. SHP-1 constructs lacking both SH2 domains (ΔΔSH2 and ΔΔSH2 D419A) were constructed by subcloning a restriction fragment encoding amino acids 203–595 in frame into the vector CS3+MT. The CD4 cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. Andrey Shaw (Washington University) and was subcloned into the vector pCMX (22Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). The GST-SHP-1 fusion protein constructs were created by the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the nucleotides encoding amino acids 214–595 from either wild-type SHP-1 or catalytically inactive SHP-1 (C453S). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned in frame into the vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fidelity of all polymerase chain reaction products was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.

Cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 × gfor 30 min. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using either a rabbit anti-Lck antibody or a monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody (OKT4). Immune complexes were collected on Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem), washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and used for subsequent analysis. Immunoprecipitated Lck and total cellular lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Western blotting was carried out with rabbit anti-Lck antibodies, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, or anti-Myc antibodies as described previously (23Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M.

Bound antibodies were detected either by enhanced chemiluminescence or by 125I-protein A (ICN) and a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) as indicated. 293 cells were transiently transfected with the DNA constructs as indicated.

The excised membrane containing the labeled Lck was then digested withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin as described previously (29Luo K. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M.

Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping was carried out on cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (EM Science) by electrophoresis at pH 8.9 in the first dimension followed by ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer in the second dimension as described previously (30Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). The labeled peptides were visualized using a PhosphorImager. 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs encoding WT Lck or F505 Lck and CD4. At 24 h post-transfection, the CD4-Lck complex was immunoprecipitated as described above with OKT4. The CD4-Lck immunoprecipitates were washed once in TN (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) and once in phosphatase assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated CD4-Lck was resuspended in phosphatase assay buffer and incubated with 5 μg of soluble, purified GST-SHP-1 fusion protein in a final reaction volume of 20 μl for 1 h at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. To terminate the reaction, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. For the two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis of the in vitro dephosphorylated products, the above procedure was employed except that the transfected 293 cells were labeled biosynthetically with 32Pi for 2 h prior to immunoprecipitation. Peptide dephosphorylation reactions were carried out using purified GST-SHP-1 and a Lck-derived phosphopeptide consisting of the sequence CIEDNEpYTAREGA in which pY represents phosphorylated Tyr-394. The Lck-derived phosphopeptide was synthesized by Jill Meisenhelder using an ABI 432A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) synthesis methods. The peptide was resuspended in SHP-1 assay buffer (50 mm NaOAc-HOAc, pH 5.0, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions were carried out in a volume of 20 μl in 96-well microtiter plates, and phosphate release was measured by malachite green assay (31Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The amount of phosphate released during the reaction was calculated from a standard curve generated using sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. To examine whether the phosphorylation of Lck on tyrosine was affected by SHP-1, we co-expressed Lck and SHP-1 by transient transfection in 293 cells. We immunoprecipitated Lck from these cells and analyzed the level of Lck tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.1). In all of our experiments, we used a mutant of SHP-1 lacking both SH2 domains to augment SHP-1 activity (ΔΔSH2). Deletion of the SH2 domains has been shown to increase catalytic activity by relieving the steric hindrance of the catalytic site by the SH2 domain (2Pei D. Lorenz U. Klingmuller U. Neel B.G.

We confirmed the increased catalytic activity of ΔΔSH2 SHP-1 and the absence of the activity of ΔΔSH2 D419A SHP-1 in vitro (data not shown). Lck is tyrosine-phosphorylated in 293 cells when expressed alone (Fig.1 A,lane 1). Multiple forms of Lck are observed when the protein is overexpressed in 293 cells. This heterogeneity is attributable to differing degrees of serine phosphorylation, which is catalyzed in part by activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (32Watts J.D. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23275-23282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When wild-type SHP-1 was co-expressed with Lck, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck was reduced ∼1.8-fold as quantified using a PhosphorImager (Fig. Fig.1 A, lane 2). Co-expression of catalytically inactive SHP-1 (D419A) did not reduce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Lck ( Fig.1 A,lane 3), indicating that the catalytic activity of SHP-1 was required for the reduction of Lck phosphotyrosine levels. The level of Lck protein was slightly higher in the immunoprecipitates from cells co-expressing Lck and SHP-1 compared with immunoprecipitates from cells expressing Lck alone ( Fig.1 B,lanes 2andFig.3 compared with lane 1). Therefore, the quantitation of the Lck phosphotyrosine levels was normalized for the Lck protein level present in the immunoprecipitates. The expression of wild-type and catalytically inactive SHP-1 was shown to be equivalent by Western blotting of the cell lysates using anti-Myc antibodies ( Fig.1C,lanes 2and3).Figure 3Analysis of Lck phosphorylation in 293 cells co-expressing SHP-1.

Therefore, the reduction of total Lck tyrosine phosphorylation induced by SHP-1 could be a result of the reduced phosphorylation of Tyr-394, Tyr-505, or both. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the effect of SHP-1 on the phosphorylation of two mutants of Lck, F505 Lck and F394 Lck. These mutants are tyrosine-phosphorylated only at Tyr-394 or Tyr-505, respectively. We co-expressed these mutants of Lck in 293 cells with either catalytically active ΔΔSH2 SHP-1 or catalytically inactive ΔΔSH2 D419A SHP-1 by transient transfection and analyzed Lck tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 2). As with wild-type Lck, both F505 Lck and F394 Lck were tyrosine-phosphorylated in 293 cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 4). The tyrosine phosphorylation of F505 Lck was reduced by co-expression of catalytically active SHP-1 (Fig.2 A, lane 2). Catalytically inactive SHP-1 did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of F505 Lck (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). In contrast, the tyrosine phosphorylation of F394 Lck was not affected by co-expression with catalytically active SHP-1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 5), suggesting that expression of SHP-1 does not alter the phosphorylation of Tyr-505. To confirm that the dephosphorylation of wild-type Lck by SHP-1 occurred at Tyr-394, we analyzed Lck phosphorylation by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis. To do this, we co-expressed wild-type Lck with either catalytically active SHP-1 or catalytically inactive SHP-1 and labeled the co-transfected cells biosynthetically with32Pi. Lck was isolated by immunoprecipitation, and its phosphorylation was analyzed by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis (Fig. 3). In cells expressing Lck alone, both Tyr-505 and Tyr-394 were phosphorylated with 1.4-fold more phosphate present at Tyr-505 than at Tyr-394 (Fig.3 A). The expression of catalytically active SHP-1 reduced the amount of phosphate at Tyr-394, increasing the ratio of phosphate in the Tyr-505-containing peptide to that of the Tyr-394-containing peptide to 5.6-fold (Fig. 3 B). Co-expression of catalytically inactive SHP-1 did not change the relative phosphorylation state of Tyr-394 or Tyr-505 (Fig. 3 C). These results demonstrate that SHP-1 causes the dephosphorylation of Lck at Tyr-394. The crystal structure of the inactive forms of Hck and c-Src, two other Src family kinases, shows that the SH2 domain binds intramolecularly to a conserved phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the extreme C terminus of the molecule, keeping the kinase in an inactive conformation (34Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 35Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Because Lck is activated either by mutation of this conserved tyrosine (Tyr-505) or by mutation of the SH2 domain (20Amrein K.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4247-4251Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 36Veillette A. Caron L. Fournel M. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 971-980PubMed Google Scholar), it is reasonable to infer that the SH2 domain of Lck interacts intramolecularly with the C-terminal tyrosine residue in the same manner as Hck or c-Src. It is a possibility that SHP-1 can dephosphorylate either Tyr-394 or Tyr-505, but the Lck SH2 domain interferes with the dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 by SHP-1, thus giving rise to the apparent preference of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate Tyr-394. Alternatively, the apparent preferential dephosphorylation of Tyr-394 could be specified by the amino acid sequences surrounding Tyr-394 and Tyr-505. To examine whether the Lck SH2 domain protected against dephosphorylation of Tyr-505, we co-expressed a mutant of Lck that lacks the SH2 domain (ΔSH2 Lck) with catalytically activated SHP-1 by transient transfection and analyzed Lck phosphorylation by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis (Fig.4). In cells expressing ΔSH2 Lck alone, both Tyr-505 and Tyr-394 were phosphorylated, although there was 0.57-fold less phosphate present at Tyr-505 than at Tyr-394 (Fig.4 A), the opposite of what we observed with wild-type Lck. The change in the ratio of phosphate between Tyr-394 and Tyr-505 in ΔSH2 Lck could be attributable to increased dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 by endogenous tyrosine phosphatases because this site is no longer protected by the SH2 domain, or it could be attributable to increased Lck phosphorylation at Tyr-394. Co-expression of catalytically active SHP-1 with ΔSH2 Lck reduced the amount of phosphate at Tyr-505, further decreasing the ratio of phosphate in the Tyr-505-containing peptide to that of the Tyr-394-containing peptide to 0.26-fold (Fig. 4 B). Co-expression of catalytically inactive SHP-1 with ΔSH2 Lck did not change the relative phosphorylation state of Tyr-394 or Tyr-505 (Fig.4 C). These results suggest that the specificity of SHP-1 for Tyr-394 is attributable in part to the Lck SH2 domain sterically hindering the access of SHP-1 to Tyr-505. The results of the co-expression experiments demonstrated that the expression of SHP-1 reduced the phosphorylation of Lck specifically at Tyr-394 in vivo. However, these experiments did not distinguish between direct dephosphorylation of Lck by SHP-1 or indirect induction of Lck dephosphorylation. To determine whether SHP-1 could dephosphorylate Lck directly, we expressed and purified recombinant GST fusion proteins consisting of the catalytic domain and the C terminus of either wild-type SHP-1 or a catalytically inactive SHP-1 (C453S). These purified GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins did not contain the tandem SH2 domains and are therefore fully active. To obtain a suitable substrate, we co-expressed CD4 and either F505 Lck or wild-type Lck in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated the CD4-Lck complex with anti-CD4 antibodies. We then incubated the immunoprecipitates with the recombinant GST-SHP-1 fusion proteins and analyzed Lck phosphorylation by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig.5). We isolated the CD4-Lck complex by immunoprecipitation of CD4 because our Lck antiserum contains anti-GST reactivity, and we wanted to avoid binding the GST-SHP-1 fusion protein to the immunoprecipitate during the in vitrodephosphorylation reaction. In addition, immunoprecipitation of the CD4-Lck complex by anti-CD4 antibodies eliminates the potential of interference because of the antibody directly bound to Lck. Wild-type GST-SHP-1 dephosphorylated both F505 Lck (Fig. 5 A, comparelane 2 with lane 1) and wild-type Lck (Fig.5 A, compare lane 5 with lane 4). The extent of dephosphorylation was considerably greater with F505 Lck. This suggested that SHP-1 directly dephosphorylated Lck at Tyr-394in vitro. In contrast, the catalytically inactive GST-SHP-1 did not dephosphorylate either F505 Lck or wild-type Lck (Fig.5 A, lanes 3 and 6). We used SHP-1 at a concentration of 3.5 μm in the above experiment. To determine how much SHP-1 was required for efficient dephosphorylation of Lck in vitro, we incubated CD4-F505 Lck immunoprecipitates with varying amounts of purified GST-SHP-1 and analyzed Lck phosphorylation by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Greater than 75% dephosphorylation could be achieved using GST-SHP-1 at a concentration of 70 nm (Fig. 5 C, lane 5), and 50% dephosphorylation was observed using a GST-SHP-1 at a concentration of 7 nm (Fig. 5 C, lane 7). We also determined the kinetics of dephosphorylation of a Lck-derived peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr-394 (data not shown). After establishing reaction conditions that allowed linear reaction rates as a function of both incubation time and phosphatase concentration, we measured dephosphorylation of the Lck peptide as a function of peptide concentration. The Lck peptide exhibited an averageKm of 118 ± 40 μm in four independent experiments. To examine the apparent specificity for Tyr-394 in vitro in another way, we co-expressed CD4 and wild-type Lck in 293 cells, labeled the cells biosynthetically with 32Pi, and isolated the CD4-Lck complex by immunoprecipitation. We then incubated the immunoprecipitates with active and inactive GST-SHP-1 catalytic domain fusion proteins in vitro and analyzed dephosphorylation of Lck by two-dimensional tryptic peptide analysis (Fig.6). The amount of phosphate at Tyr-505 and Tyr-394 in the substrate alone was approximately equal (Fig.6 A). Wild-type GST-SHP-1 dephosphorylated Tyr-394 preferentially, yielding a product that contained 10-fold more phosphate at Tyr-505 than at Tyr-394 (Fig. 6 B). As expected, catalytically inactive GST-SHP-1 or GST did not affect either Tyr-394 or Tyr-505 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D). In this experiment we chose to analyze Lck phosphorylation at the reaction end point instead of analyzing initial rates of dephosphorylation. Therefore, it is important to note that the difference in dephosphorylation of Tyr-394 versus Tyr-505 could actually be greater than the difference that we observed. We examined here whether the Src family kinase Lck was a substrate of the SHP-1 protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Our results demonstrate that Lck is dephosphorylated directly and specifically by SHP-1 at Tyr-394, a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop (37Casnellie J.E. Harrison M.L. Hellstrom K.E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13877-13879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Voronova A.F. Buss J.E. Patschinsky T. Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of Tyr-394 activates Lck (21Abraham N. Veillette A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 39Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), SHP-1 is therefore an inhibitor of Lck activity. In contrast to the phosphorylation of Tyr-394, phosphorylation of Tyr-505 in Lck by the ubiquitous tyrosine protein kinase Csk (40Thomas J.E. Soriano P. Brugge J.S. Science. 1991; 254: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 41Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) induces formation of a biologically inactive conformation by allowing intramolecular binding of the SH2 domain to the phosphorylated C terminus (34Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 42Bergman M. Mustelin T. Oetken C. Partanen J. Flint N.A. Amrein K.E. Autero M. Burn P. Alitalo K.

We did not observe any dephosphorylation of Tyr-505 in wild-type Lck or in F394 Lck by SHP-1. Both of these proteins contain an intact SH2 domain capable of intramolecular binding to phosphorylated Tyr-505, and this could protect Tyr-505 from dephosphorylation. Our results in Fig. 4 demonstrate that deletion of the SH2 domain renders Tyr-505 susceptible to dephosphorylation by SHP-1. Some of the specificity of SHP-1 for phosphorylated Tyr-394 therefore comes from the protection of phosphorylated Tyr-505 by the Lck SH2 domain. The tyrosine phosphatase CD45 has been shown to dephosphorylate either Tyr-394 or Tyr-505 in Lck (44Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 45Baker M. Gamble J. Tooze R. Higgins D. Yang F.T. O'Brien P.C. Coleman N. Pingel S. Turner M. Alexander D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4644-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that unlike CD45, SHP-1 is unable to displace the intramolecular interaction between the Lck SH2 domain and phosphorylated Tyr-505. This would suggest that in a physiological context, SHP-1 would only act on Lck phosphorylated at Tyr-394. However, it still is a possibility that SHP-1 could act on Lck phosphorylated at Tyr-505, although it presumably would require the prior displacement of the Lck SH2 domain by another molecule. Because we demonstrated dephosphorylation of Lck in vivo at Tyr-394 when SHP-1 was overexpressed or when Lck was incubated with a high concentration of SHP-1 in vitro (3.5 μm), it could be argued that our data do not provide evidence that Tyr-394 is a high affinity substrate of SHP-1. However, we were able to demonstrate significant dephosphorylation of Lck when it was incubated with as low a concentration as 7 nm SHP-1. In addition, the Km value of 118 ± 40 μm that we obtained for the Tyr-394-containing phosphopeptide is not dissimilar to the Km values (72 and 80 μm) of two peptides corresponding to two sites of SHP-1 dephosphorylation in the physiological substrate SIRP-α that have been confirmed by structural studies (46Yang J. Cheng Z. Niu T. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4066-4071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the Tyr-394 of Lck is a physiological substrate of SHP-1. Loss of SHP-1 is known to cause hyperactivity of T cells and lower T-cell selection thresholds (15Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates by SHP-1 plays a role in the regulation of T cell activation and selection in wild-type mice. Plas et al. (14Plas D.R.

Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that ZAP-70 may be a target of SHP-1. Because ZAP-70 phosphorylation and activity play an important role in T cell activation and maturation (52Chan A.C. Kadlecek T.A. Elder M.E. Filipovich A.H. Kuo W.L. Iwashima M. Parslow T.G. Weiss A.

Science. 1994; 264: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), a loss of ZAP-70 dephosphorylation attributable to SHP-1 deficiency could well contribute to the hyperactivation of T cells in motheaten mice. Our data demonstrate that Lck is also a direct target of SHP-1 and is inhibited by SHP-1. Because Lck activates ZAP-70 by phosphorylation at Tyr-493 in ZAP-70 (16Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), our results could suggest that the effects of SHP-1 on ZAP-70 phosphorylation and activity are indirect. However, it is equally possible that SHP-1 could act on both Lck and ZAP-70 to inhibit signaling. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the failure of SHP-1 to dephosphorylate Lck at Tyr-394 may contribute to the phenotype of motheaten mice. Indeed, our data are consistent with the prolonged activity of Lck in observed in motheaten thymocytes (15Lorenz U. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9624-9629Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and suggest strongly that SHP-1 directly inhibits Lck activity in vivo.

However, the biochemical and subcellular effects of hydrogen peroxide on tight junction (TJ) proteins have not been studied, nor have they been distinguished from effects due to partial ATP depletion. Short-term depletion and repletion of intracellular ATP in cultured cells has been used to study the disassembly and/or reassembly of junctions as a model of organ ischemia and reperfusion (16Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F737-750PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tsukamoto T. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

However, little is known about the reassembly of the tight junction after exposure to reactive oxygen species due to the lack of a reproducible model system. We have now developed and analyzed a model of reversible hydrogen peroxide-induced disassembly and reassembly of the TJ in vitro and show that the reassembly pathway, as monitored by physiological, biochemical, and immunocytochemical parameters, depends upon tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, the cellular and biochemical consequences of H2O2 exposure are distinct from those caused by ATP depletion-repletion. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, type II) were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and were passaged weekly. DMEM was from Cellgro (Herndon, VA), streptomycin, penicillin, and fetal calf serum from Sigma. Plasticware was from Falcon (Lincoln Park, NJ). Transwells were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA), the ohm meter (Millicell ERS) from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Anti-ZO-1 rat monoclonal antibody (R40.76) was kindly supplied by Dr. D. Goodenough (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Anti-E-cadherin antibodies were isolated from hybridoma cells (rr-1) kindly provided by Barry Gumbiner (University of California, San Francisco). Anti-ZO-2 and anti-occludin polyclonal rabbit antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate (4G10), Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. All other reagents used in these experiments were of analytical grade. Confluent monolayers were cultured in DMEM without fetal calf serum 24 h prior to the exposure with specific concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and throughout the experiment. To terminate the exposure to hydrogen peroxide, catalase was added into the media at a final concentration of 5000 units/ml. Control experiments were performed with monolayers in serum free DMEM with and without catalase or Me2SO. After treatment of MDCK monolayers with 5 mm H2O2 or 2-deoxy-d-glucose (dGlc) for various times, cells were washed with PBS twice, and exposed to 0.4% trypan blue in PBS supplemented with 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 2 mm MgCl2 for 5 min. The cells were examined using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope, and the number of viable and nonviable cells was determined. MDCK cells were grown to confluency on glass coverslips and exposed to H2O2 with or without treatment with catalase, genistein, or PP-2. After fixation of the monolayers with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, apoptosis was detected with the ApopTagTM Peroxidase kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY), labeling free 3′-OH termini of DNA strand breaks, according to the manufacturers instructions. Apoptotic cells were counted under an inverted microscope (Nikon). Depletion of intracellular ATP was achieved by using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose. In brief, confluent MDCK monolayers were serum starved in serum-free DMEM for 24 h, washed with PBS three times, and exposed to PBS containing 1.5 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 12 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose for different time periods. Repletion of intracellular ATP levels was achieved by changing the media to serum-free DMEM. Control experiments were performed in serum-free DMEM alone. MDCK cells were plated on polycarbonate filters (Transwell, Costar) at confluent density (roughly 2 × 105 cells/cm2) and maintained in serum containing media for 48 h to establish tight monolayers. 24 h before TER measurement cells were exposed to serum-free DMEM. In some experiments, known scavengers of hydrogen peroxide or modulators of intracellular signaling pathways were preincubated in serum-free DMEM before exposure to H2O2 on both sides of the transwell. TER was measured at different time points after treatment with these reagents and/or hydrogen peroxide with a Millipore electrical resistance system, as described previously (21Stuart R.O. Sun A. Panichas M. Hebert S.C. Brenner B.M. Nigam S.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 159: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Measurements were expressed in ohm × cm2, as a mean of the original readings after subtraction of background values. Basal TER measurement of confluent monolayers were recorded between 150 and 300 ohm × cm2. Measurements of total cellular ATP content were performed with a luciferase-based ATP determination kit (Sigma). After rinsing the monolayer with PBS three times, 300 μl of somatic cell ATP-releasing agent solubilized the cells. Cells were immediately scraped, aspirated, and cleared of insoluble material by spinning for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. The ATP content of 100 μl of supernatant was measured with 100 μl of Sigmas diluted luciferase-containing ATP assay mixture in an automated chemiluminescence counter (Berthold, Bad Wildholz, Germany). ATP levels are expressed as percent of the initial value after subtraction of background readings. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were grown on clear coverslips. At specific time points during the experiment, the monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS, fixed with 100% methanol (−80 °C) for 10 min for ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin staining, or 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (for anti-phosphotyrosine staining), and stored in PBS at 4 °C. After blocking (PBS, 5% (v/v) goat serum, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, cells were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies. After washing (4 × 5 min in PBS + 0,05 Triton X-100) the monolayers were incubated with Texas red or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. The cells were mounted in Fluoromount (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham, AL). The filters were viewed through a ×100 oil immersion objective with a laser scanning confocal system (model MRC-1024/2p, Bio-Rad, Cambridge, MA) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. Images were processed using Photoshop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA). The data are given as mean values ± S.E. (n), where n refers to the number of measurements performed. The paired Student's t test was used to compare mean values within one experimental series. Data from two groups were compared by unpaired t test. A p value of <0.05 was accepted to indicate statistical significance. Low concentrations of H2O2 (0.5 and 0.75 mm) had no detectable effect on TER even after treatment for 8 h and 1 mm H2O2 only lowered TER by 9 ± 2%. Intermediate concentrations of H2O2(2.5 mm) caused a gradual decrease in TER to values near zero over 8 h. Higher concentrations (5 and 10 mm) caused a more rapid loss of TER within the first 3 h (Fig.1 A). Treatment of MDCK monolayers with 5000 units/ml catalase reversed the decrease of TER for all H2O2 concentrations used. Recovery of TER to control values took about 3 h for cells treated with 2.5 mm H2O2, 4.5 h for cells treated with 5 mm H2O2, and did not occur within 8 h after exposure to 10 mmH2O2 (Fig. 1 B). However, 20 h after catalase treatment, TER values of the cells treated with 10 mm H2O2 reached baseline values (data not shown). Changing media or exposure to catalase alone had no effect on TER. Based on these results, a H2O2concentration of 5 mm was chosen for further experiments, as TER reproducibly decreased to 26 ± 3% (n = 35) of baseline within 30 min and complete recovery occurred within 4–6 h in the presence of catalase (Fig. 1 B). This represents a new and reproducible model for reversible H2O2-dependent disassembly and reassembly. In addition, the rate of recovery of TER after treatment with 5 mm H2O2 depended upon incubation time. Incubation of MDCK monolayers with 5 mmH2O2 for 45 or 60 min before treatment with 5000 units/ml catalase resulted in a slower recovery compared with incubation for 30 min (Fig. 1 C). Recovery to control values of TER was complete after ∼12 h for a 45-min incubation and 20 h for a 60-min incubation (data not shown). To test whether the recovery of TER after treatment with hydrogen peroxide and catalase is dependent on synthesis of new TJ or other proteins, MDCK monolayers were coincubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and 5 mmH2O2 before scavenging with catalase. Recovery of TER was nearly identical in cycloheximide-treated cells over the initial 6 h (Fig. 1 D). At later time points, TER began to drop in the cycloheximide-treated monolayers, most likely reflecting the general effects of inhibiting protein synthesis. This result indicates that, for the early recovery of barrier function, new protein synthesis is not necessary. Trypan blue uptake was observed in 0.1 ± 0.1% of the cells under baseline conditions. The number of trypan blue positive cells increased to 0.7 ± 0.1% after 30 min exposure to 5 mmH2O2 and 2.5 ± 0.6% after 6 h (Fig.2 A). After scavenging of H2O2 with catalase for 5.5 h, the number of trypan blue positive cells remained at the same value for 30 min of H2O2 exposure (0.7 ± 0.3%,n = 10). PP-2 and genistein did not increase the number of trypan blue positive cells (Fig. 2 B). The number of apoptotic cells was 0.18 ± 0.1% under control conditions and did not increase significantly after 30 min of exposure to 5 mm H2O2 or after exposure to PP-2 or genistein for 6 h with or without catalase (0.2% ± 0.1%, Fig. 2 C). After 6 h exposure to hydrogen peroxide 1.1 ± 0.06% of the cells stained positive for apoptosis. After establishing the conditions under which a constant fall and recovery of TER occurred reproducibly (5 mmH2O2 for 30 min), different scavengers or inhibitors of intracellular signaling pathways were used to determine whether the TER reduction was due to oxidative stress, and to investigate specific targets for hydrogen peroxide. Pyruvate scavenges hydrogen peroxide by direct nonenzymatic reduction of H2O2 to water while undergoing decarboxylation at the 1-carbon position (22Salahudeen A.K. Clark E.C. Nath K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1886-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Pyruvate is also readily taken up by cells and can thus serve as an intracellular scavenger of H2O2. Co-incubation of pyruvate (5 mm) with hydrogen peroxide completely abolished the loss of TER, indicating that pyruvate is effectively scavenging intracellular H2O2 (Fig.3 A, n = 4). In another set of experiments MDCK cells were preincubated with 5 mm pyruvate in serum-free DMEM for 16 h. Before exposure to H2O2, the cells were washed with PBS to eliminate extracellular pyruvate. This preincubation with pyruvate significantly reduced the drop in TER to 62 ± 5% of control. Recovery to baseline after addition of catalase was accelerated to ∼2 versus 5 h under control conditions (Fig. 3 A, n = 4). Pyruvate alone did not influence TER. Other scavengers were preincubated for 1 h and coincubated with hydrogen peroxide for 30 min and the fall in TER was recorded (Fig. 3 B). The reducing agent dithiothreitol reduced the initial fall of TER to 57 ± 7% (dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm, n = 7). Superoxide dismutase (30 units/ml, n = 7) had a similar effect in reducing the fall to 50 ± 4%. In marked contrast, the membrane permeable hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea (10 mm, n = 7) and the hydroxyl radical scavenger 5,5-dimethylpyrroline N-oxide (10 mm,n = 7) had no effect on the initial fall in TER. Preincubation for 1 h before exposure to H2O2, with the cell permeable heavy metal chelator TPEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine, 1 μm), which acts as an intracellular scavenger, reduced the fall in TER at 30 min to 58 ± 3% (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, the subsequent decline of TER was significantly reduced and recovery from the exposure to H2O2 was faster and complete after ∼2 h (Fig. 3B, n = 6). The cell permeable iron chelator deferoxamine (0.1 mm) was preincubated for 16 h and subsequently reduced the initial fall in TER to 56 ± 7% (Fig. 3 C, n = 6). Exposure to TPEN or deferoxamine alone had no effect on TER. TJ assembly is known to be modulated by a variety of signaling mechanisms (9Rao R. Baker R.D. Baker S.S. Biochem.

Physiol. 1999; 277: F524-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a broad screen of many inhibitors of signaling events known to modulate the TJ, the most consistent results were obtained with the two tyrosine kinase inhibitors PP-2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, 1 or 10 μm) and genistein (4′,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone, 50 or 100 μm), both of which inhibit Src family tyrosine kinases, although genistein is also a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor. MDCK cells were preincubated with these agents for 1 h before being exposed to 5 mm H2O2. The drop of TER was not different from a control experiment, but the recovery after 5000 units/ml catalase was virtually abolished (Fig.4, A and B,n = 6), indicating a role for tyrosine kinase in the reassembly of the TJ but not the initial disassembly. Control experiments with PP-2, genistein, or Me2SO alone showed no changes in baseline TER (n = 4, data not shown). Thus, tyrosine kinase activity, most likely due to a Src family member, appears to be important for the recovery of the TJ after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. PKC has also been shown to regulate TJ assembly in other models (24Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 29Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6072-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30Nigam S.K. Denisenko N. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Citi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Three PKC inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit the recovery of TER after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Calphostin C (500 nm, n = 7), bisindolylmaleimide I (500 nm, n = 7), and chelerythrine (1 μm, n = 7) reduced TER at 6 h by 73 ± 5, 55 ± 2, and 42 ± 5%, respectively, when compared with control (Fig. 4 C). The agents did not decrease TER in control experiments (n = 3). Intracellular ATP levels decrease in various cell lines after exposure to H2O2(31Aito H. Aalto T.K. Raivio K.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C878-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Andreoli S.P. McAteer J.A. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, ATP levels have been shown to decrease with 1 mm H2O2 (7Winter M. Wilson J.S. Bedell K. Shasby D.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In our experiments, exposure of MDCK monolayers to 5 mmH2O2 or 12 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose for 30 min resulted in a partial ATP depletion to 21.4 ± 4 and 20.7 ± 2% of control, respectively (Fig. 5, A andB, n = 4–8). Furthermore, the time course for the recovery of cellular ATP content after treatment with either 5000 units/ml catalase (H2O2 group) or repletion with control media (dGlc group) after 30 min was similar. Media changes or catalase treatment had no effect on the intracellular ATP concentration (98.7 ± 3 and 96.3 ± 4% after after 6 h, respectively). Therefore, 12 mm dGlc was used in the following experiments to examine the effect of partial ATP depletion on TER, extractability and localization of TJ proteins. In marked contrast to the effects of 5 mmH2O2 on TER (see Fig. 1), treatment with 12 mm dGlc was not associated with a detectable drop in transepithelial resistance. On the contrary, at later time points, a rise in TER of partially ATP depleted monolayers to 25.5 ± 5% above the TER of repleted monolayers was observed (Fig. 5 C,n = 4). Consistent with this finding, in dGlc-treated cells, no increase in trypan blue uptake was recorded (n = 10). The finding that TER is unchanged in cells ATP depleted to 20% of control levels is consistent with previous work that indicates that the threshold for ATP depletion-induced declines in TER occurs at around 5–10% of normal ATP levels (4Andreoli S.P. McAteer J.A. Seifert S.A. Kempson S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F377-384PubMed Google Scholar, 5Meng X. Reeves W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F83-F90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Winter M.

Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-1045PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy revealed that H2O2 induces a reversible, partial breakdown of ZO-1 in the TJ after 30 min (Fig.6 A, b, f, and j). Prolonged exposure of MDCK cells to 5 mmH2O2 resulted in a discontinuous ZO-1 staining pattern throughout the monolayer (Fig. 6 A, c, g,and k, n = 4 for each observation). Occludin and E-cadherin showed a similar pattern of redistribution and broadening of the staining. Treatment with 5000 units/ml catalase prevented the disruption of the TJ and after 6 h a normal distribution of all three junctional proteins was demonstrated (Fig.6 A, d, h, and l). The exposure of MDCK cells to 12 mm dGlc had no effect on the distribution of ZO-1, occludin, or E-cadherin, indicating that these changes, like the drop in TER, could not be explained by lower ATP levels (Fig. 6 B, a and b, data shown for ZO-1 only, n = 3 for each observation). The ZO-1 staining remained continuous but appeared slightly more jagged during later time points. Immunofluorescence of MDCK monolayers after double staining with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-ZO-1 antibodies showed intact staining of the tight junction junction 6 h after exposure to H2O2 and catalase or catalase alone (Fig. 7, a andb). In contrast, MDCK cell monolayers that were pretreated with 10 μm PP-2 (Fig. 7 c) or 100 μm genistein (Fig. 7 e) for 1 h and exposed to the same oxidative stress and catalase in the presence of the inhibitors showed a marked disruption in ZO-1 staining after 6 h that resembled the disruption without catalase scavenging (see Fig.6 c), consistent with the data indicating that these agents inhibit TER recovery (Fig. 4). Both inhibitors had no effect on the ZO-1 staining in the presence of catalase without oxidative stress (Fig. 7, d and f). Tyrosine phosphorylation occurred in the lateral membrane after short-term exposure to hydrogen peroxide (Fig.8 A, b) when compared with untreated monolayers (Fig. 8 A, a), as described before (34Rao R.K. Baker R.D. Baker S.S. Gupta A. Holycross M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G812-823PubMed Google Scholar,35Collares-Buzato C.B. Jepson M.A. Simmons N.L. Hirst B.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, strong tyrosine phosphorylation occurred in the lateral cell border 6 h after exposure to H2O2 and scavenging with catalase (Fig.8 A, f, same sample as Fig. 7 a). Analysis ofz-sections revealed that the staining for tyrosine phosphorylation and ZO-1 overlapped in the tight junction although additional phosphotyrosine staining was observed in the lateral membrane and the cytosol of the cells (Fig. 8 B). Both PP-2 and genistein prevented this tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 8 A, d and e), giving rise to a very weak and diffuse staining pattern which resembled the tyrosine phosphorylation of monolayers treated with H2O2 alone (Fig.8 A, c). Catalase treatment alone did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation in the cell junction (Fig. 8 A, g). These experiments imply that tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly in the lateral membrane near or in the TJ, occurs during TJ recovery, and that the ability of catalase to induce the recovery of the tight junction possibly requires these phosphorylation events. Oxidative stress is known to disturb the permeability barrier in renal epithelial cells in culture. Transepithelial resistance and intracellular ATP levels fall after exposure to hydrogen peroxide, whereas the permeability for small solutes across the monolayer increases (6Welsh M.J. Shasby D.M. Husted R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1155-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 7Winter M. Wilson J.S. Bedell K. Shasby D.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Initially, a reduced intracellular ATP level was thought to cause the disruption of the junction (36Hyslop P.A. Hinshaw D.B. Halsey Jr., W.A. Schraufstatter I.U. Sauerheber R.D. Spragg R.G. Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but later studies identified other potential regulators such as intracellular calcium activity (37Ueda N. Shah S.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F214-221PubMed Google Scholar), pH (38Kaufman D.S. Goligorsky M.S. Nord E.P. Graber M.L. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 1993; 301: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) during oxidative stress. Until now, the mechanisms of tight junction reassembly after oxidative stress that lead to a reconstituted and functional epithelial cell barrier have not been investigated. Here, we present a new model in which the disruptive effect of hydrogen peroxide on physiological, biochemical, and immunocytochemical parameters of TJ integrity is reversible. H2O2 (5 mm) consistently dropped transepithelial resistance to 23% of control. Thereafter, the epithelial cell monolayers completely recovered to baseline within 6 h. After recovery, the MDCK monolayers showed a stable TER for several days. The exposure time of 30 min used in our experiments was associated with only a small decrease in cell viability. This finding is in good agreement with previous studie"
https://openalex.org/W2021862499,"Type IV pilin monomers assemble to form fibers called pili that are required for a variety of bacterial functions. Pilin monomers oligomerize due to the interaction of part of their hydrophobic N-terminal alpha-helix. Engineering of a truncated pilin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain K122-4, where the first 28 residues are removed from the N terminus, yields a soluble, monomeric protein. This truncated pilin is shown to bind to its receptor and to decrease morbidity and mortality in mice upon administration 15 min before challenge with a heterologous strain of Pseudomonas. The structure of this truncated pilin reveals an alpha-helix at the N terminus that lies across a 4-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. A model for a pilus is proposed that takes into account both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of pilin subunits as well as previously published x-ray fiber diffraction data. Our model indicates that DNA or RNA cannot pass through the center of the pilus, however, the possibility exists for small organic molecules to pass through indicating a potential mechanism for signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2017713833,"Because individual species can play key roles, the loss of species through extinction or their gain through colonization can cause major changes in ecosystems. For almost 20 years after kangaroo rats were experimentally removed from a Chihuahuan desert ecosystem in the United States, other rodent species were unable to compensate and use the available resources. This changed abruptly in 1995, when an alien species of pocket mouse colonized the ecosystem, used most of the available resources, and compensated almost completely for the missing kangaroo rats. These results demonstrate the importance of individual species and of colonization and extinction events in the structure and dynamics of ecosystems."

The main fragments formed were identified as oxidation products of tyrosine, including dopamine, dopamine quinone, and dihydroxyindol. Further release of these oxidation products plus dityrosine was only seen after proteolytic degradation of the oxidatively modified hemoprotein. A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the formation of these oxidation products that includes cyclization, decarboxylation, and further oxidation of the intermediates. Release of dityrosine is proposed as a useful technique for evaluating selective proteolysis after an oxidative stress, because dityrosine is metabolically stable, and it is only released after enzymatic hydrolysis of the oxidatively modified protein. The measurement can be accomplished by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection or by high efficiency thin layer chromatography. Comparable results, in terms of dityrosine release, were obtained using red blood cells of different sources after exposing them to a flux of H2O2. Furthermore, dityrosine has been reported to occur in a wide variety of oxidatively modified proteins. These observations suggest that dityrosine formation and release can be used as a highly specific marker for protein oxidation and selective proteolysis.

One of these amino acid radicals in ferrylmyoglobin was identified as a tyrosyl radical, which is dissipated by pathways involving intermolecular diradical cross-linking of Tyr-103 to Tyr-151 of sperm whale myoglobin (19Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and covalent binding of the heme group to the protein (20Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the production of tyrosine oxidation products is correlated with the proteolytic degradation of hemoglobin by proteasome (21Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8752-8759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present paper, we studied the formation of tyrosine oxidation products after the oxidative modification of oxyhemoglobin solutions and intact RBC. Oxyhemoglobin and RBC were exposed to a continuous flow rate (or flux) of H2O2 produced by the glucose-glucose oxidase system, which resembles a physiological condition. The aims of this work were (i) to characterize these oxidation products, (ii) to provide a mechanism to explain their formation, and (iii) to test their feasibility as specific markers for selective proteolysis. Pronase, catalase, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, dopamine, l-tyrosine, sodium dithionite, perchloric acid, glucose, H2O2, and methemoglobin were purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Fresh oxyhemoglobin was prepared daily from bovine methemoglobin (2× crystallized) by using sodium dithionite in a 2-fold molar excess in deoxygenated 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8; Ref. 22Di Iorio E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Tritium-labeled hemoglobin ([3H]Hb) was prepared as previously described (4Grune T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 21Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8752-8759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dityrosine was prepared by the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation ofl-tyrosine according to Gross and Sizer (23Gross A.J. Sizer I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Tew and Montellano (19Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 25 mml-tyrosine and 3 μm horseradish peroxidase in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). Hydrogen peroxide (final concentration, 2 mm) was added sequentially during 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. The resulting mixture was centrifuged through a Centricom™ tube (molecular weight cutoff of 10,000) to remove the enzyme. Water from the resulting bottom filtrate was removed on a rotary evaporator, and the remaining residue was dissolved in ethanol and chromatographed on 20 × 20-cm preparative (250 μm) silica thin layer plates. The plates were developed with butanol:water:acetic acid (4:1:2, v/v/v). The plates were exposed to NH4OH, and the blue fluorescent band due to the tyrosine dimer (Rf = 0.26) was excised and extracted with methanol. Crude dityrosine was obtained after removing the solvent by bubbling with N2. This crude dityrosine was applied to a 20 × 20-cm preparative UNIPLATE (Analtech) silica thin layer plate with organic bounder and eluted with the same system as before. The blue fluorescent band due to dityrosine (Rf = 0.26) was excised and extracted with methanol, which was then removed by bubbling with N2. The white powder was dissolved in acetonitrile/H2O (70:20) and assessed for purity on a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) C-18 column, eluted isocratically with 93% acetonitrile and 7% water, both containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fresh human RBC were collected as previously reported (24Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from healthy donors. Glucose oxidase was placed in dialysis bags (molecular weight cutoff of 3,500), which were added just prior to experiments to different flasks containing either 0.2 mm oxyhemoglobin or 5% (v/v) intact RBC in 5 mm glucose and Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The rate of H2O2 production was measured spectrophotometrically at 402–417 nm in a Shimadzu UV-3000 double beam, dual wavelength spectrophotometer using the horseradish peroxidase assay according to Boveris et al. (25Boveris A. Martino E. Stoppani A.O.M. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The presence of the dialysis bag did not significantly affect the rate of hydrogen peroxide production by the glucose-glucose oxidase system. After 30 min of incubation the dialysis bags were removed, and the samples were precipitated with 0.54 m perchloric acid (PCA). The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were neutralized with 2 m KOH. The crystals of KClO4 formed were removed by centrifugation. An aliquot of the neutralized PCA supernatant was diluted with 0.5 mHEPES buffer (pH 9.0), and the fluorescence intensity was measured in an Aminco-Bowman spectrofluorometer, using quinine sulfate as a standard. Protein fragments present in the neutralized PCA supernatants were hydrolyzed with 10 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. Pronase was separated by centrifugation in Centricom™ tubes (molecular weight cutoff of 10,000). The hydrolysates were chromatographed by HPLC on a Novapak C-18 column and eluted with a linear gradient (flow rate, 0.8 ml/min) from 0 to 60% of solvent B in 60 min. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/methanol (75:25, v/v), and solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v). The eluent was monitored with a Shimadzu fluorescence detector (283 and 315 nm, excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively). The resulting profiles were compared with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopamine standards purchased from Sigma or synthesized in the laboratory with tyrosinase (26Leonard L.J. Townsend D. King R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6156-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is well known that modification of protein conformation and oxidation of amino acids occurs when proteins are exposed to H2O2. Indeed, hemoglobin is irreversibly oxidized during incubation with H2O2 (21Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8752-8759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); yet the oxidation products formed have not been well characterized. One purpose of this study was to identify oxidation products from oxyhemoglobin treated with H2O2. Consequently, bovine oxyhemoglobin (0.2 mm) was exposed to a flux of 120 μmH2O2/min, generated by the glucose-glucose oxidase system for 30 min at 37 °C, and after this treatment the protein samples were precipitated with PCA and neutralized (as described under “Materials and Methods”). The resulting neutralized supernatants exhibited a fluorescence intensity (excitation and emission wavelengths, 315 and 410 nm, respectively) with the following characteristics: (i) fluorescence intensity increased essentially linearly with both the rate of H2O2 generation (Fig.1 A) and the concentration of oxyhemoglobin used (Fig. 1 B), (ii) the increased fluorescence did not occur in the presence of 10,000 units of catalase (Fig. 1, A and B), (iii) the fluorescence was still observed after substituting perchloric acid precipitation with a centrifugation step in Centricom™ tubes (molecular weight cutoff of 3,000), excluding the possibility of a direct oxidation of protein by the acid treatment (Fig. 1, A andB). These results indicate that the fluorescence observed derived directly from protein fragments (molecular mass < 3 kDa) that contained oxidatively modified amino acids. Indeed, experiments carried out with [3H] oxyhemoglobin revealed a limited protein fragmentation (1–3%, calculated as percentage of acid-soluble counts), suggesting that a minor portion of the total protein contributed to the fluorescence intensity (Fig.2 A). A linear relationship (r = 0.98) was obtained between fluorescamine-reactive amino groups and the percentage of acid-soluble counts (Fig.2 B). Further studies were performed to characterize the oxidation products present in the neutralized PCA supernatants, by UV and fluorescence spectroscopies. The absorption maximum of the neutralized PCA supernatants in acid solution was found to occur at 283 nm compared with 275 nm for pure tyrosine. In alkaline solution, the maximum shifted to 320 nm, and the absorption increased on shifting from pH 2.0 to 9.0. The pH at which this bathochromic effect occurred was around 7.2 (data not shown). The pH dependence of the fluorescent and absorption spectra suggested the presence of a phenolic group with different characteristics from the tyrosine hydroxyl group (pKa = 10.0). The pH dependence of the fluorescence intensity of the PCA supernatants (Fig. 3 A) and tyrosine (Fig.3 B) revealed that only the PCA supernatants exhibited an increase in fluorescence intensity when excited at 315 nm. If the excitation wavelength was 283 nm, the PCA supernatants showed an increase in fluorescence intensity above pH 8.0 (Fig. 3 A), whereas tyrosine exhibited decreasing fluorescence intensity at higher pH values (Fig. 3 B). The decrease found near pH 9.0 for tyrosine must be due to the dissociation of the amino group (pKa = 9.11). The emission spectrum of the PCA supernatant (Fig. 3 A,inset) showed a small increase in fluorescence intensity at both 312 and 425 nm emission on going from pH 5 to 11, whereas tyrosine showed a decrease in fluorescence intensity under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3 B, inset). These results are in agreement with the production of oxidation products that are different from pure tyrosine or peptides containing unmodified tyrosine. High performance liquid chromatography analysis with fluorescent detection of both Pronase-treated PCA supernatants and Pronase-treated hemoglobin pointed to the occurrence of products derived from oxidatively modified tyrosine. Coelution of the products in the Pronase-treated PCA supernatants with synthetic standards indicated that dopamine, dopamine quinone, and 5,6-dihydroxyindol were the major products of tyrosine oxidation present in the fragments (TableI), whereasl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 5,6-dihydroxy-3-oxo-indol were minor products (data not shown). These products were further characterized by using different chromatographic conditions suitable for dopachrome-related products using electrochemical detection (26Leonard L.J. Townsend D. King R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6156-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Segura-Aguilar J. Lind C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1989; 72: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Importantly, no dityrosine was detectable in Pronase digests of the fragments, whereas dityrosine was clearly present in Pronase digests of intact Hb (Table I).Table ITyrosine oxidation products in hydrogen peroxide-treated hemoglobinPronase-digested samplesTyrosine oxidation products (peak height ratio of product/tyrosine)Dopamine quinone (1.34 min)Dopamine (3.27 min)Dihydroxyindol (7.38 min)Dityrosine (3.22 min)Hemoglobin fragments1.070.601.38Hemoglobin3.224.841.460.92Oxyhemoglobin (0.2 mm) was treated with 7.5 μg/ml glucose oxidase.

The detection was carried out with a Shimadzu fluorodetector at 284 nm excitation and 325 nm emission. Tyrosine and dityrosine were identified by the following experimental procedures: (i) comparison of the retention times of pure tyrosine and dityrosine and (ii) coinjection of pure standards with the samples. Measurement of tyrosine oxidation products was as follows.

Fluorescence detection was at 308 nm excitation and 395 nm emission. Dopamine, dopaminequinone, and 5,6-dihydroxiindol were identified by comparing retention times with standards synthesized from l-dopamine as follows. Dopamine (1 mm) was treated with mushroom tyrosinase or polyphenol oxidase (10 μg/ml) in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 at 0–4 °C.

After 15 min of incubation, aliquots of the reaction mixture were diluted 1:10 with mobile phase. Dityrosine, along with the other oxidation products already characterized, was identified by HPLC in H2O2-treated and Pronase-digested oxyhemoglobin (free of fragments) (Table I). No free dityrosine was measured in the neutralized PCA supernatants without using a proteolytic enzyme (i.e. trypsin, chymotrypsin, Pronase, RBC fraction II) to release it from the H2O2-treated oxyhemoglobin (data not shown). The Pronase hydrolysate so obtained and applied to a high efficiency thin layer chromatography plate resulted in one fluorescence spot with an Rf value coincident with that of synthetic dityrosine (Fig. 4 A). The fluorescence of the compound is rather weak in the presence of acetic acid, but it becomes brilliant after exposure of the plate to ammonia vapor, and the presence of a phenolic group was indicated by the positive reaction of the spot with Folin's phosphomolybdic acid reagent (Fig. 4 A). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of oxyhemoglobin after incubation with H2O2 (Fig. 4 B) showed that the monomeric protein (Mr = 14,000) is partially converted to dimeric (Mr = 25,000–30,000) and trimeric (Mr = 42,000) products. Laser scanning of the bands indicates that ∼10% (Fig.4 B, lane d) to 20% (Fig.4 B, lane e) of the protein is converted to dimer upon exposure of the protein to a bolus addition of H2O2. Although under the present experimental conditions we were not able to distinguish the composition of the dimer (i.e. type α2, β2, or αβ), the formation of a tyrosine radical was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy (see below). Experiments were carried out to determine the chemical requirements for the production of fluorescent compounds in hydrogen peroxide-treated oxyhemoglobin. The production of fluorescent compounds was dependent on the presence of both H2O2 and the heme (Table II), because absence of either H2O2 or the heme (in globin or by binding methemoglobin with cyanide) resulted in a negligible fluorescence intensity, indicating that the production of the original fluorescent products was halted or that other products with lower quantum yield had been formed. The latter possibility seemed unlikely under our experimental conditions, because the UV-visible spectrum of the supernatants from methemoglobin, hydrogen peroxide, and cyanide or globin plus hydrogen peroxide did not show the presence of products different from those obtained with methemoglobin plus hydrogen peroxide, and no new peaks were found by analyzing these supernatants by HPLC. Thus the majority of Hb oxidation products appear to be formed during the first H2O2-oxyhemoglobin interaction, and the remaining products must be formed during the subsequent reactions of methemoglobin with H2O2.Table IIFluorescent products formed from methemoglobin or globin treated with H2O2AdditionsFluorescence intensity ratioMethemoglobin + H2O22.18Methemoglobin + KCN1.00Methemoglobin + H2O2 + KCN1.30Globin + H2O21.10Assay conditions were as follows. 0.2 mm globin or hemoglobin in phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) was treated with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity of the neutralized supernatants was measured as described under “Materials & Methods.” A ratio of the fluorescence intensities (excitation and emission wavelengths were 300 and 410 nm, respectively) was obtained by dividing the intensity of protein plus the corresponding addition by the fluorescence intensity of methemoglobin alone. Open table in a new tab Assay conditions were as follows. 0.2 mm globin or hemoglobin in phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.4) was treated with 2 mm H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity of the neutralized supernatants was measured as described under “Materials & Methods.” A ratio of the fluorescence intensities (excitation and emission wavelengths were 300 and 410 nm, respectively) was obtained by dividing the intensity of protein plus the corresponding addition by the fluorescence intensity of methemoglobin alone. The small amount of fluorescent compounds found in the globin-H2O2 system (Table II) indicates that the majority of products formed in the Hb-H2O2 system are not the result of a direct oxidation of amino acids by H2O2 and that another oxidizing species (either the oxoferryl moiety or an oxidant species derived from it) is responsible for the formation of tyrosine oxidation products. In our model system, the possible candidates are as follows: (i) a hydroxyl radical (formed during the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 by oxyhemoglobin or deoxyhemoglobin), (ii) an oxoferryl moiety of ferrylhemoglobin (which with a redox potential of about 1.4 V (28Shiga T. Imaizumi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 167: 469-479Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar) should be able to effect a hydrogen abstraction, although the latter may be less efficient than hydroxyl radical because of a restricted steric hindrance), and (iii) a protein-centered radical. A role for ferrylhemoglobin, as the oxidant species during the oxidation of oxyhemoglobin by a continuous flux of H2O2, is substantiated by the following experimental results: (i) a transient visible spectrum ascribed to ferrylhemoglobin (Fig. 5 A), (ii) an EPR spectrum of the protein radical (Fig. 5 B), and (iii) the lack of a 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide-OH adduct EPR signal. Each of these results is considered in detail below. The oxidation of 0.2 mm oxyhemoglobin by the glucose-glucose oxidase system (120 μm H2O2/min) produced spectral changes in the visible region consisting of the transient appearance of two absorption peaks at 545 and 580 nm along with a decrease in the absorbance at 540 and 575.6 nm (Fig.5 A). At 60 min the resulting spectral profile showed a maximum absorbance at 630 nm, consistent with that of native methemoglobin. These spectral changes may be understood in terms of a transition from oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin, which proceeds through ferrylhemoglobin as an intermediate, as was discussed previously (24Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of a protein radical cannot be evaluated spectrophotometrically because HX-FeIV-OH and ·X-FeIV-OH are indistinguishable by visible spectroscopy.

In contrast, no signal ascribable to the hydroxyl radical was obtained with 0.2 mm oxyhemoglobin, glucose-glucose oxidase (120 μm H2O2/min), and the spin trap 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide at concentrations of 80–200 mm (data not shown). Although hydroxyl radical formation from hemoglobin-catalyzed homolytic cleavage of H2O2 has been previously reported, subsequent work suggests that the radical detected was formed by secondary reactions of the peroxide with iron released from the oxidatively damaged heme group (30Sadrzadeh S.M.H.

The Hb protein radical may well be localized in the α-Tyr-42 in bovine hemoglobin, which is close to the heme group and exposed to the surrounding medium (Fig.6).Figure 6Computer representation of hemoglobin.

(20Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for myoglobin, (ii) by dityrosine cross-link formation as in sperm whale myoglobin (19Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), or (iii) by an oxygen addition to the aromatic radical in either hemoglobin or myoglobin (32Prütz W.A. Butler J. Land E.J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1983; 44: 183-196Google Scholar, 33Cudina I. Josimovic L. Radiat. Res. 1987; 109: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The latter mechanism, oxygen addition to the aromatic radical, would yield a peroxyl tyrosine radical, which could be proposed as the initial step in the formation of oxidation products. This protein peroxyl radical was proposed to rationalize the epoxidation of styrene by hemoglobin and myoglobin (34Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Catalano C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9265-9271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, recent reports by the same group (35Allentoff A.J. Bolton J.L. Wils A. Thompson J.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 9744-9749Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and by others (36Hunter E.P. Desroisiers M.F. Simic M.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 6: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,37Kelman D.J. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 16: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) seem to rule out this possibility, and an iron-dioxygen complex (HX-FeII-O-O−) was proposed as an alternative oxidizing species. The starting step for the generation of these products (or other amino acid-derived oxidation products) could be accomplished by any of the oxidizing species discussed above (namely the protein radical, the oxoferryl moiety, or the iron-dioxygen complex). The formation of Tyr oxidation products might involve cyclization, decarboxylation, and further oxidation steps on either the apoprotein or fragments released from the protein. The chemistry of the reaction between hemoglobin and H2O2 is complicated not only because several oxidizing species might contribute to the formation of oxidized products, but also because the dynamic changes involved in this process (i.e. the translocation of the protein radical throughout the protein structure (38Giulivi C. Cadenas E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and the transfer of the radical character from carbon- to oxygen-centered radicals by oxygen addition to amino acid radicals) may obscure the possibility of defining a clear, accurate mechanism for the formation of these oxidized products. The formation of the tyrosine oxidation products discussed above can be explained by the participation of either one or two monomers of hemoglobin (α or β subunit), whereas the formation of dityrosine probably involves two monomeric molecules of hemoglobin, joined by intermolecular cross-linking, because intramolecular cross-linking among tyrosine residues located in the same molecule is rather difficult (Fig. 6). The mechanism proposed for the production of dityrosine (Fig. 7) includes the formation of tyrosyl radicals, subsequent diradical reaction, and finally enolization. Bovine, rabbit, or human intact RBC (5%, v/v) exposed to different flow rates of H2O2 for 30 min showed an increase in fluorescence intensity at 320/425 nm in the neutralized PCA supernatants (Fig. 8). Dityrosine contribution to this increased fluorescence was minimal (1–2%; calculated using pure dityrosine as standard), whereas the main contribution was from other oxidation products of tyrosine identified as described above. This minimum production of dityrosine could be attributed to the generation of dityrosine from free tyrosine in the RBC (39; see below). A major contribution of dityrosine to the total increased fluorescence (about 20%) was obtained after long periods of incubation (more than 4 h) of intact RBC or by the addition of exogenous proteolytic enzymes (i.e. Pronase) to lysed cells (data not shown). Bearing in mind that ferrylhemoglobin is a highly oxidizing species similar to Compound II of peroxidases, the formation of free dityrosine in RBC exposed to H2O2 can be explained by (i) a peroxidatic activity of ferrylhemoglobin using tyrosine (from the intracellular pool of amino acids) as a substrate or (ii) proteolytic release of dityrosine previously formed in the oxidatively modified protein. When a reaction mixture of 0.2 mm oxyhemoglobin and 1.7 mm H2O2 was supplemented with 25 mml-tyrosine to compete with any molecule of hemoglobin, the formation of free dityrosine was measured (Fig.9 A). Dityrosine was identified by HPLC, using synthetic dityrosine standards. For comparison, horseradish peroxidase was used in parallel experiments and was found to be six times (per heme) more efficient than hemoglobin in catalyzing the same reaction (Fig. 9 A, inset). Lysed RBC incubated with H2O2 and 25 mml -tyrosine also produced free dityrosine up to a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. At higher concentrations of protein, the amount of dityrosine produced decreased to almost zero (Fig. 9 B). Because catalase concentration increased with increasing concentration of protein additions, the experiment was repeated in the presence of 0.1 m3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (aminotriazole), an inhibitor of the catalase-hydrogen peroxide Complex I (40Margoliash E. Novogrodsky A. Schejter A. Biochem. J. 1960; 74: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 41Tephly T.R. Mannering G.J. Parks Jr., R.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The fluorescence intensity measured in lysed RBC with aminotriazole was comparable with the intensity measured with hemoglobin alone (Fig. 9 A) at 25 mm tyrosine. Aminotriazole did not exert any effect on dityrosine production by Hb (data not shown). This observation was supported by specific inhibition of catalase-hydrogen peroxide Complex I through the binding of aminotriazole to a His residue in the peptide VVHAK (43Chang J.Y. Schroeder W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 148: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); the target sequence is highly conserved among catalases from different species, but it is not present in hemoglobin or myoglobin. The results shown in Fig. 9 B indicate that RBC experiencing a flux of H2O2 do not produce dityrosine from free intracellular tyrosine, because the minimum tyrosine concentration needed to obtain measurable amounts of dityrosine in lysed RBC (without aminotriazole) is 5 × 10−4m (Fig.9 B, inset), a concentration eight times higher than the actual intracellular concentration of free tyrosine, corrected by the volume of water excluded by hemoglobin (60–70 μm). 2Given the volume of a spherical molecule ( 43πr 3) and the radius of Hb (r = 2.75 × 10−11 cm; Ref. 44Stryer L. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, CA1981: 59-64Google Scholar), the volume per molecule can be calculated as 8.7 × 10−20 cm3. Considering that [Hb] in RBC is 34 g/100 ml, Mr = 64,500, and the average volume of RBC for an adult man is 87 μm3 (44Stryer L. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, CA1981: 59-64Google Scholar,45Diem, K., and Lentner, C., eds (1974) Scientific Tables, pp. 574, 613, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Division of Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Ardsley, NY.Google Scholar), then the volume for unsolvated Hb molecules contained in a RBC is 2.4 × 10−11 cm3. This indicates that unsolvated Hb occupies 27.6% of the total volume of RBC. The partial specific volume for Hb can be estimated to be close to that of myoglobin (0.741 g/cm3; Ref. 46Tinoco, J. I., Sauer, K., and Wang, J. C. (1978)Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications in Biological Sciences, 3rd Ed., pp. 282, 308, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.Google Scholar), given the homologies between these two proteins. Thus, the partial specific volume of Hb (ῡ2) plus the specific volume of water (υ°1 = 1.00 cm3/g) times the amount of hydration (δ1) can be calculated from the following equation: (f/fo)3× ῡ2 = ῡ2 + δ1υ°1, wheref/fo = 1.105 (46Tinoco, J. I., Sauer, K., and Wang, J. C. (1978)Physical Chemistry: Principles and Applications in Biological Sciences, 3rd Ed., pp. 282, 308, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.Google Scholar). The volume of solvated Hb is 0.999 cm3/g, representing 34% of the total RBC volume (0.999 cm3/g × 2.96 × 10−11g of Hb). If we correct the concentration of free tyrosine in adult RBC (mean, 42 μm; Ref. 39Soupart P. Holden J.T. Amino Acid Pools. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1962: 263Google Scholar) considering the free water, then the concentration would be equal to 64 μm, about eight times lower than the threshold for dityrosine production. Further evidence that dityrosine was originated from proteolytic release of this dimer previously formed in the oxidatively modified protein was previously observed by using proteolytic inhibitors to prevent dityrosine release (21Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8752-8759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aims of the present study were as follows: (i) to characterize the oxidation products formed after exposing oxyhemoglobin to a flux of H2O2, (ii) to provide a plausible mechanism for the formation of these products, and (iii) to test the feasibility of dityrosine measurements as markers for oxidative stress and for selective proteolysis."

These limitations have been attributed to the inability of the antithrombin·heparin complex to inactivate clotting enzymes bound to components of the thrombus, particularly thrombin bound to fibrin (6Hogg P.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This heightens exosite I-mediated binding of thrombin to fibrin and likely increases the overall affinity of thrombin for fibrin. The formation of the ternary complex, therefore, is a consequence of the presence of two exosites on thrombin, which independently bind fibrin and heparin. Recently, we demonstrated that protection requires ligation of both of thrombin's exosites within the ternary heparin·thrombin·fibrin complex, a process that impairs access of inhibitor-bound heparin to exosite II on thrombin (15Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thrombin within the ternary complex is protected from inactivation by the heparin·heparin cofactor II (HCII)1 complex to a greater extent than the heparin·antithrombin complex (15Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), because access of the amino terminus of HCII to exosite I on thrombin, an obligatory part of the HCII inhibitory mechanism (16Tollefsen D.M.

Allosteric changes in the active site of thrombin induced upon formation of the ternary heparin·thrombin·fibrin complex may also contribute to the protection of fibrin-bound thrombin from inactivation by heparin·antithrombin and heparin·HCII complexes by limiting inhibitor reactivity with fibrin-bound thrombin (18Hogg P.J.

The purpose of this study was to confirm these findings using purified reagents and to elucidate the mechanism by which the DS·HCII complex, but not the heparin·HCII complex, inactivates fibrin-bound thrombin. Human HCII, isolated from plasma by affinity chromatography, was from Affinity Biologicals Inc. (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Human α- and γ-thrombin and fibrinogen were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Dermatan sulfate (DS) was from Mediolanum Farmaceutici (Milan, Italy). Heparin,N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide acetate (tGPR-pNA), gelatin-agarose, and Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide (GPRP-NH2) were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Enoxaparin, a commercial low-molecular-weight heparin, was from Rhône-Poulenc Rorer Canada (Montreal). Based on high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration analysis, the mean molecular masses of DS, heparin, and enoxaparin are 20 kDa (range 7–34 kDa), 15 kDa (range 5–30 kDa), and 4.5 kDa (range 3.5–5.5 kDa), respectively. Fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (FPRCK) was from Calbiochem Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA). FITC-FPRCK was from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Hexadimethrine bromide (Polybrene) was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI). Cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech (Dorval, Quebec). Human fibrinogen, treated with gelatin-agarose to remove fibronectin, was used to prepare soluble fibrin (SF), as described previously (15Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibrin clots were centrifuged and dialyzed versus water. The fibrin was then dissolved by dialysis versus 20 mm acetic acid, aliquoted, and stored at a concentration of about 100 μmat −70 °C. Polymerization of SF was blocked by addition of 5 mm GPRP-NH2 (26Kawasaki K. Hirase K. Miyano M. Tsuji T. Iwamoto M. Chem. Pharm. Bull. (Tokyo). 1992; 40: 3253-3260Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and the material was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a volume corresponding to 40% of the volume of SF, just prior to use. A molecular weight of 340,000 and ε 2801% value of 14.0 were used to calculate the soluble fibrin concentration. Fibrinogen was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B, treated with thrombin to convert it to fibrin monomer (FM), and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 nm NaCl (TBS) as described previously (15Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The influence of varying concentrations of heparin or DS on the second-order rate constants (k 2) for inhibition of thrombin by HCII were determined under pseudo-first-order conditions in the absence or presence of SF. Thrombin (10 nm) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature in TBS containing 0.6% PEG 8000 in the presence of various concentrations of heparin or DS (0–11 μm), SF (0–4 μm), and 10 mm GPRP-NH2. Reaction mixtures (10 μl) were aliquoted to 96-well round bottom microtiter plates and an equal volume of HCII (in a concentration at least 10-fold higher than that of thrombin) was added to each well at time intervals ranging from 2 s to 5 min. All reactions were terminated concomitantly by the addition of 200 μmchromogenic substrate (tGPR-pNA) in 200 μl of TBS containing 10 mg/ml Polybrene. Residual thrombin activity was calculated by measuring absorbance at 405 nm for 5 min using a Spectra Max 340 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The pseudo-first-order rate constants (k 1) for thrombin inhibition were determined by fitting the data to the equationk 1·t = ln([P]o/[P] t ), where [P]o is initial thrombin activity and [P] t is thrombin activity at time t. The second-order rate constant,k 2, was then determined by dividingk 1 by the HCII concentration (27Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thrombin blocked at its active site with FPRCK (FPR-thrombin) was radiolabeled with Na125I as described previously (28Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The binding of125I-FPR-thrombin to FM-Sepharose in the absence or presence of either heparin or DS (from 0 to 10 μm) was studied in TBS containing 0.6% PEG 8000 and 0.01% Tween 20. FM-Sepharose (9 μm) in 0.5 ml of buffer was incubated with 50 nm125I-FPR-thrombin by inverted mixing for 2 min. The tube was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at 15,000 × g, and a 100-μl aliquot of supernatant was removed for gamma counting. The aliquot was returned to the tube. This procedure was repeated following each addition of heparin or DS to the tube. The fraction of 125I-FPR-thrombin bound to FM-Sepharose as a function of the total amount of125I-FPR-thrombin present was calculated. DS (3 mg) was labeled with 1.0 mCi of Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Markham, Ontario, Canada) in a volume of 300 μl using the IODO-BEAD iodination reagent as described by the manufacturer (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Labeled DS catalyzed the inhibition of thrombin by HCII to the same extent as its unlabeled counterpart, indicating that the labeling procedure did not influence DS activity. A mixture of 500 nm125I-labeled DS and 5 μmFM-Sepharose was titrated with increasing concentrations of thrombin or γ-thrombin (from 0 to 3 μm). After centrifugation, residual 125I-labeled DS in the supernatant was quantified by gamma counting and used to determine the fraction of125I-labeled DS bound to FM-Sepharose. Thrombin labeled at the active site with anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (ANS-FPR-thrombin) was prepared using ATA-FPR (N-(acetylthio)acetyl-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl) as described by the supplier (Molecular Innovations Inc., Royal Oak, MI). Briefly, 10.6 μm thrombin was incubated for 30 min at 23 °C with a 2.5-fold molar excess of ATA-FPR in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (HBSE buffer). The reaction mixture was dialyzed against HBSE buffer, incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of 2-(4-(iodoacetamide)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (Molecular Probes Inc.) in the presence of hydroxylamine for 60 min at 23 °C in the dark and then redialyzed. 800 μl of 140 nmANS-FPR-thrombin in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.125m NaCl, 1 mg/ml PEG 8000, 5 mmGPRP-NH2 was added to a semi-micro quartz cuvette. Using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer with excitation wavelength set to 334 nm and excitation and emission slit widths set to 5 nm, the fluorescence emission spectrum from 380–580 nm of ANS-FPR-thrombin was monitored before and after the addition of 310 nm SF and/or 100 nm heparin or 3 μm DS. Soluble fibrin was neutralized by the addition of 40% v/v 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, just prior to use. Addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, had no effect on the fluorescence spectrum of ANS-FPR-thrombin (data not shown). Fluorescent derivatives of heparin and DS were prepared as follows (29Nagasawa K. Uchiyama H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 544: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 10 mg of heparin or DS were incubated with 15 mg of FITC in 2.5 ml of 1.0 mNa2CO3, pH 9.0 for 5 h at 23 °C. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min, 1 ml of the supernatant was applied to duplicate PD-10 gel filtration columns (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), equilibrated with H2O, and eluted with H2O under gravity. 0.5-ml fractions were collected, frozen, and lyophilized. Recovered material was pooled, weighed, and dissolved in TBS to a stock concentration of 10 mg/ml. FITC-labeled active site-blocked thrombin (f-FPR-thrombin) was prepared as previously described (28Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, thrombin was incubated with fluorescein-d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (f-FPRCK) until no residual thrombin chromogenic activity was detected. After dialysis to remove unincorporated f-FPRCK, the concentration of fluorescently labeled thrombin was determined by measuring absorbance using ε 2801% of 1.8 after correction for light scatter at 320 nm using the relationship A 280corr=A 280 − 1.7 ×A 320. The affinity of FITC-labeled ligands for fibrin was determined by measuring unbound ligand in supernatants of clots prepared by clotting varying concentrations of fibrinogen with 1 nm thrombin. Briefly, 200 μl of 2 mm CaCl2, 100 nm FITC-labeled ligand, various concentrations of fibrinogen (30–3000 nm), and 1 nm thrombin were mixed in a series of microcentrifuge tubes. After 1-h incubation at 23 °C, fibrin was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 15,000 × g and 100 μl of supernatant was removed and added to 300 μl of TBS. The fluorescence intensity of the samples was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 492 and 522 nm, respectively, and excitation and emission slit widths both set to 15 nm. K d values were calculated by plottingI/I o versus fibrinogen concentration, where I o and Irepresent the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the varying concentrations of fibrinogen, respectively. The parametersK d and ΔI were calculated by nonlinear regression (“Tablecurve,” Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) using the equation, II0=1+1+Kd+LP−1+Kd+LP2−4×LP×ΔI2Equation 1 where ΔI is the maximum fluorescence change,P is the initial concentration of f-heparin, f-DS, or f-FPR-thrombin, L is the total fibrinogen concentration, and a stoichiometry of 1 is assumed (28Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The affinities of heparin or DS for thrombin were determined by monitoring changes in intrinsic thrombin fluorescence when the enzyme was titrated with heparin or DS. The initial intensity reading of 100 nm thrombin in a 2-ml quartz cuvette (I o) was determined with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 280 and 340 nm, respectively, and excitation and emission slit widths set to 6 nm. Aliquots of either heparin or DS were then added to the cuvette, and, after mixing, changes in fluorescence were monitored (I). K d values were calculated by plotting I/I o versus glycosaminoglycan concentration and the data were fit by nonlinear regression to the equation given above. The association between HCII and either heparin, DS, or fibrin was monitored by the ligand-dependent fluorescence intensity change of anilinonaphthalene-6-sulfonic acid labeled HCII (ANS-HCII). ANS-HCII, prepared as previously described (30Weitz J.I. Young E. Johnston M. Stafford A.R. Fredenburgh J.C. Hirsh J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was added to a concentration of 100 nm to a quartz cuvette. The initial fluorescence intensity (I o) of ANS-HCII was determined at excitation and emission wavelengths set to 280 and 437 nm, respectively, and excitation and emission slit widths set to 10 nm, and an emission filter of 290 nm. Known quantities of either heparin, DS, or SF were then added to the cuvette and, after mixing, changes in fluorescence was monitored (I).K d values were calculated by plottingI/I o versus ligand concentration, and the data were fit by nonlinear regression to the equation given above. 500-μl suspensions of FM-Sepharose (9 μm FM) containing 50 nm125I-FPR-thrombin without glycosaminoglycan or with 2.5 μm DS in TBS/0.6% PEG/0.01% Tween 20 were mixed for 2 min. The amount of unbound 125I-FPR-thrombin in the suspension after each addition of an aliquot of 80 μmHCII was determined as described above. To verify the protective effect of SF on thrombin inhibition by HCII, we determined the rates of thrombin inhibition in the absence or presence of SF and heparin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, SF caused a dose-dependent decrease in the heparin-catalyzed rates of thrombin inhibition by HCII, which by two-way analysis of variance performed using Minitab (software version 11, State College, PA), was highly significant (p < 0.001). At 1 μmheparin and 4 μm SF, a maximal 240-fold decrease in the rate was observed, a value consistent with that reported previously (15Becker D.L. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6226-6233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, at a concentration of 4 μm SF, a significant (p < 0.001) but modest 3-fold decrease in the DS-catalyzed rates of thrombin inhibition by HCII was observed (Fig. 1 B). The assembly of the ternary heparin·thrombin·fibrin complex is postulated to occur through a series of binary interactions between thrombin·fibrin, thrombin·heparin, and fibrin·heparin (8Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Labanowski J.K. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

In this study, we determined the dissociation constants for these interactions, as well as those involving DS. The affinities of DS and heparin for thrombin were determined by monitoring changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence of thrombin when titrated with DS or heparin (not shown). DS and heparin bind saturably to thrombin with K d values of 2600 and 116 nm, respectively (TableI). The K d value for the thrombin·heparin interaction is in agreement with that determined by titration of ANS-labeled thrombin with increasing concentrations of heparin (K d = 59 nm) (10Hogg P.J.

Current evidence suggests that both heparin and DS bind to exosite II on thrombin (11Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gan Z.R. Li Y. Chen Z. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

This was confirmed in two ways. First, competitive binding studies were performed where thrombin-bound f-heparin was displaced by DS (Fig. 2). In this experiment, addition of thrombin to f-heparin resulted in an approximate 3.5% decrease in fluorescence intensity. Subsequent titration of the sample with DS resulted in a dose-dependent increase of fluorescence intensity to the value observed for f-heparin prior to binding to thrombin (I/I o of 1). Likewise, in the reciprocal experiment, the fluorescence decrease that occurred upon addition of thrombin to f-DS was negated in a dose-dependent fashion by titration with heparin (not shown). In a second approach, we used thrombin variants with impaired exosites to identify the DS binding site (not shown). DS binds to γ-thrombin, a proteolytic derivative of α-thrombin lacking exosite I (11Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a 2.6-fold lower affinity than α-thrombin (K d values of 6.8 μm and 2.6 μm, respectively). In contrast, DS binds RA-thrombin, a thrombin variant with three point mutations in exosite II that lower its affinity for heparin 20-fold (32Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a 7-fold lower affinity (K d = 17 μm). These studies confirm that, like heparin, DS also binds to exosite II on thrombin, albeit with lower affinity (Table I). The affinities of f-FPR-thrombin, f-heparin, and f-DS for fibrin were monitored by clotting varying concentrations of fibrinogen with a catalytic amount of thrombin in the presence of a fluorescently labeled ligand, and quantifying unbound ligand in the clot supernatant (not shown). As listed in Table I, f-FPR-thrombin and f-heparin bind to fibrin with K d values of 1500 and 187 nm, respectively, values consistent with previous reports (8Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. Labanowski J.K. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26088-26095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, f-DS does not bind to fibrin. Both heparin and DS bind to ANS-HCII, but the affinity of heparin for HCII is 5-fold higher (13 and 71 μm, respectively). Thus, DS binds to both HCII and thrombin with lower affinity than heparin. No binding of ANS-HCII to fibrin was detected (Table I). It has been shown previously that heparin enhances the binding of thrombin to fibrin, an effect that occurs regardless of whether heparin has high or low affinity for antithrombin, but occurring only with heparin chains of 11,200 Da or more (8Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the ability of DS to promote thrombin binding to FM-Sepharose with that of heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin. As shown in Fig.3, DS has little effect on125I-FPR-thrombin binding to FM-Sepharose, even at concentrations up to 10 μm. In contrast, at concentrations up to 250 nm, heparin enhances125I-FPR-thrombin binding to FM-Sepharose in a dose-dependent manner. At heparin concentrations above 250 nm, 125I-FPR-thrombin binding to fibrin monomer decreases, likely reflecting the accumulation of distinct heparin·fibrin and heparin·thrombin populations (8Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When thrombin and FM-Sepharose were titrated with low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin), there was only a small increase in the amount of thrombin bound, comparable to that observed with DS. Similar results were obtained with fibrin clots in place of FM-Sepharose (not shown). Our binding studies indicate that thrombin can interact with both fibrin and DS, via exosites I and II, respectively. These findings suggest that, like heparin, DS can form a three-component complex with thrombin and fibrin, even though DS does not bind fibrin. To explore this possibility, a mixture of 500 nm125I-labeled DS and 5 μm FM-Sepharose was titrated with increasing concentrations of thrombin or γ-thrombin (Fig.4). After centrifugation, residual125I-labeled DS in the supernatant was quantified and used to determine the fraction of 125I-labeled DS bound to FM-Sepharose. In the absence of thrombin, minimal amounts of125I-labeled DS bind to FM-Sepharose. With thrombin addition, 125I-labeled DS binds to FM-Sepharose in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, when γ-thrombin, a proteolytic derivative of thrombin that lacks exosite 1, is substituted for thrombin, there is no increase in the amount of125I-labeled DS that bind"
https://openalex.org/W2015355519,"Alterations in the expression level of genes may contribute to the development and pathophysiology of obesity. To find genes differentially expressed in adipose tissue during obesity, we performed suppression subtractive hybridization on epididymal fat mRNA from goldthioglucose (GTG) obese mice and from their lean littermates. We identified the secreted proteinacidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), a protein that mediates cell-matrix interactions and plays a role in modulation of cell adhesion, differentiation, and angiogenesis. SPARC mRNA expression in adipose tissue was markedly increased (between 3- and 6-fold) in three different models of obesity,i.e. GTG mice, ob/ob mice, and AKR mice, after 6 weeks of a high fat diet. Immunoblotting of adipocyte extracts revealed a similar increase in protein level. Using a SPARC-specific ELISA, we demonstrated that SPARC is secreted by isolated adipocytes. We found that insulin administration to mice increased SPARC mRNA in the adipose tissue. Food deprivation had no effect on SPARC expression, but after high fat refeeding SPARC mRNA levels were significantly increased. Our results reveal both hormonal and nutritional regulation of SPARC expression in the adipocyte, and importantly, its alteration in obesity. Finally, we show that purified SPARC increased mRNA levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in cultured rat adipose tissue suggesting that elevated adipocyte expression of SPARC might contribute to the abnormal expression of PAI-1 observed in obesity. We propose that SPARC is a newly identified autocrine/paracrine factor that could affect key functions in adipose tissue physiology and pathology."

Sequence analysis of this region showed the absence of both CAAT and TATA boxes and an initiator element.

The major transcription start site is located 63 base pairs upstream of the translation start site. Transfection experiments demonstrate that all the elements necessary to achieve significant basal transcription activity are located between positions −443 and −20 relative to the translational start.

This family contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of three zinc fingers close to the C terminus and serine-, threonine-, and glutamine-rich domains in their N-terminal regions. The 81-amino acid C2H2-type zinc finger region, which comprises the DNA-binding domain, is the most highly conserved part of the protein. The two glutamine-rich regions (termed A and B) can act as strong activation domains (5Courey A.J. Tjian R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), E2F (24Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the latter case the protein association increases Sp1 transcriptional activity.The GC-rich boxes bound by Sp1 are also recognized by Sp3. Thus, these two Sp family members compete for DNA binding, and the resulting Sp transcriptional activity depends on a given ratio of Sp1/Sp3. This ratio varies by cell type and is subject to changes in the cell cycle or cellular conditions (26Apt D. Watts R.M. Suske G. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1996; 224: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Discher D. Bishopric N.H. Wu X. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J. Biol.

It is also not clear whether Sp3 acts as an activator or as a repressor of Sp1-mediated transcription. Recent studies suggest that the GC box located in the promoter region of p21 is responsible for trichostatin A-induced promoter activation and that both Sp1 and Sp3 are the mediators of the activation of this GC box (28Xiao H. Haesgawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Also, the linkage between histone acetylation and Sp1-mediated transcription is not yet clear. It is speculated that Sp1 and Sp3 may form complexes with histone acetylase or deacetylase directly or indirectly. In fact, there is evidence that p300 is required for trichostatin A-induced, Sp1-mediated p21 transcription (29Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The function of Sp1 appears to be essential for differentiated cells after day 10 of development. According to results obtained inSp1−/− mice, thymidine kinase and the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 genes are key targets of Sp1 (41Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).Our interest in this work was to study the regulation of theSp1 gene itself. With this aim in mind, we cloned the 5′ region of the human Sp1 gene, analyzed the putative transcription factor binding sites, and investigated the regulation of this promoter. Most notably, we observed that the Sp1promoter is positively regulated by its own gene product, the Sp1 protein.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we isolated and identified 1593 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the human Sp1 gene (Fig. 1). This sequence allowed us to characterize the human Sp1 promoter region and identify cis-element regions involved in the regulation of the human Sp1 gene.The mapping of the transcriptional start using the primer extension assay demonstrated the presence of a start site located at −63 bp relative to the translation initiation start that was observed for the three cell lines analyzed: HeLa, 293T, and HepG2 codon (Fig. 3). This result is in contrast with that reported by Takahara et al.(45Takahara T. Kanazu S-I. Yanagisawa S. Akanuma H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38067-38072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) where the transcriptional start site was mapped at −171 relative to the ATG by primer extension in HepG2 cells. This difference could be due to the fact that we used a 47-mer in the primer extension reaction thus allowing a high specificity in the hybridization, whereas the group of Takahara used a 22-mer. The 5′-flanking region of the human transcription factor Sp1 lacks TATA and CAAT boxes (54Saltzman A.G. Weinmann R. FASEB J. 1989; 6: 1723-1733Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The TATA box is typically located 30 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site and helps to specify the transcription initiation site. There is also no initiator element (PyPyA+1N(T/A)PyPy) in the human Sp1 promoter that in the absence of a TATA box commonly drives transcriptional initiation (46Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In contrast, this region is GC-rich and contains potential binding sites for several well characterized transcription factors (Fig. 2). The absence of TATA or CAAT boxes and the presence of several GC boxes have been found primarily in housekeeping genes (47Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and might have been expected to result in initiation of transcription at several locations (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 48Roy A.L. Novina C.D. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, a major single initiation site was consistently found in human 293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells.We found that the 5′-flanking region including up to −281 relative to the translational initiation codon contains all the elements necessary to achieve basal promoter activity. Of particular note is the high GC content of this region; in fact computer analysis indicates the presence of two putative Sp1-binding sites between nucleotides −281 to −20 and two more between −281 and −443. Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that the transcription of other TATA-less promoters frequently involves the action of a proximal Sp1 site (49Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eucaryot. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar).By EMSA, we demonstrated that several DNA-protein complexes were produced with a probe including the proximal promoter (up to base −281 relative to the translational start) that contains 2 GC boxes. The same qualitative binding pattern was observed when using two different human cell lines (293T and HeLa cells). The broad band in Fig. 5 Ais composed of three bands when using the shorter probe FOR2D as clarified in Fig. 5 C. In Fig. 5 C, anti-Sp1 supershifted the two lower bands, and anti-Sp3 supershifted the upper one. These three bands within the broad band are due to the binding to the most downstream GC box in FOR2 probe as shown by the results obtained in Fig. 5 C and the competition assays between labeled FOR2 and unlabeled FOR2D (Fig. 5 E). Sp3 contributed also to the formation of two more bands in the gel shift performed with FOR2 probe, the uppermost (Fig. 5 B) and the lowermost bands (Fig. 5, B and C).On the other hand, the FOR2U probe gives rise to two bands in the gel shift with nuclear extracts that are not supershifted with either Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies. The inability of Sp1 in the nuclear extract to bind to the FOR2U probe could be due to the binding of other transcription factors to adjacent sites that would interfere with Sp1 binding or induce a DNA conformation at this level of the promoter. Because the FOR2U probe can be bound by recombinant Sp1 (Fig. 5 D,lane 3) it is likely that there is competition between Sp1 and other transcription factors present in the nuclear extract. The computational analysis of this promoter region revealed the presence of putative binding sites for C/EBP, NF-Y, CBP (CCAAT-binding protein), and AP2. Therefore, it is possible that a complex of transcription factors binds to this sequence. These results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC box located in the proximal promoter ofSp1 and that the downstream FOR2 GC box (the one contained in the FOR2D probe) is responsible for the major gel shift bands seen with the larger FOR2 probe.An interesting conclusion of this work is the fact that theSp1 gene is positively autoregulated. Indeed, co-transfection experiments of Sp1 proximal promoter constructs (pGL3FOR1 and pGL3FOR2) and a Sp1 expression vector in 293T cells demonstrate that Sp1 can activate its own transcription activity. The mechanism of positive autoregulation has already been described for other transcription factors such as NF-κB2 (50Liptay S. Schmid R.M. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7695-7703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human junD (51Berger I. Shaul Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CREB (52Meyer T.E. Waeber G. Lin J. Beckmann W. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For all these transcription factors, the actual binding of these proteins to their gene promoters has been shown, whereas for the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene promoter, the positive autoregulation is mediated through an ATF-2 binding site in the Rb promoter (53Park K. Choe J. Osifchin N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6083-6088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoregulation of Sp1 may be an important mechanism of modulating Sp1 activity. It is known that Sp1 protein is subjected to cell cycle regulation (38Noé V. Chen C. Alemany C. Nicolás M. Cargol I. Chasin L. Ciudad C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the rapid synthesis and degradation of a cell cycle-regulated gene may be facilitated by an autoregulation mechanism of the corresponding gene promoter. Future work will analyze the possible regulation of the Sp1 expression achieved by Sp3 alone or at different ratios with Sp1, given that we have observed that Sp3 also binds to the Sp1 promoter as well as the effect of other transcriptions factors like Ap2 and E2F whose binding sites are also present in the Sp1 promoter. Transcription factor Sp1 was originally identified by its binding to the multiple GC boxes in the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 2Gidoni D. Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Nature. 1984; 312: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 3Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) and the thymidine kinase promoter (4Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Sp1 belongs to a small protein family, which is presently composed of Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. This family contains a highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of three zinc fingers close to the C terminus and serine-, threonine-, and glutamine-rich domains in their N-terminal regions. The 81-amino acid C2H2-type zinc finger region, which comprises the DNA-binding domain, is the most highly conserved part of the protein. The two glutamine-rich regions (termed A and B) can act as strong activation domains (5Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 6Courey A.J. Holtzman A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Cell. 1989; 59: 827-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Synergistic activation of promoters by Sp1 through multiple GC boxes also requires a short C-terminal domain (termed D) (7Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). More recently, an inhibitory domain has been mapped to the N terminus (8Murata Y.H.G.K. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 can be phosphorylated, a modification that affects its binding to the DNA (9Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 10Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1988; 55: 125-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), which confers resistance to proteosome-dependent degradation (13Han I. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Sp1 is able to form homotypic interactions producing multimeric complexes (14Mastrangelo I.A. Courey A.J. Wall J.S. Jackson S.P. Hough P.V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5670-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) as well as many heterotypic interactions. Sp1 associates directly with members of the basal transcription machinery, including the TATA box binding protein (15Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the TATA box binding protein-associated factors dTAFII110/hTAFII130 (16Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and hTAFII55 (17Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Science. 1995; 267: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sp1 physically interacts and functionally cooperates with several transcription activators including OTF-1 (18Janson L. Pettersson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4732-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Oct-1 (19Ström A.-C. Forsberg M. Lillhager P. Westin G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 11: 1981-1986Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), transcription factor YY1 (identical to hTAFII55) (20Lee J.-K. Galvin M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and the CCAAT-binding transcription factor NF-YA (22Roder K. Wolf S.S. Larkin K.J. Schweizer M. Gene. 1999; 234: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 can interact with cell cycle regulators like p107 (23Datta P.K. Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), E2F (24Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and the retinoblastoma protein (25Noé V. Alemany C. Chasin L.A. Ciudad C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the latter case the protein association increases Sp1 transcriptional activity. The GC-rich boxes bound by Sp1 are also recognized by Sp3. Thus, these two Sp family members compete for DNA binding, and the resulting Sp transcriptional activity depends on a given ratio of Sp1/Sp3. This ratio varies by cell type and is subject to changes in the cell cycle or cellular conditions (26Apt D. Watts R.M. Suske G. Bernard H.U. Virology. 1996; 224: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Discher D. Bishopric N.H. Wu X. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26087-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is also not clear whether Sp3 acts as an activator or as a repressor of Sp1-mediated transcription. Recent studies suggest that the GC box located in the promoter region of p21 is responsible for trichostatin A-induced promoter activation and that both Sp1 and Sp3 are the mediators of the activation of this GC box (28Xiao H. Haesgawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Also, the linkage between histone acetylation and Sp1-mediated transcription is not yet clear. It is speculated that Sp1 and Sp3 may form complexes with histone acetylase or deacetylase directly or indirectly. In fact, there is evidence that p300 is required for trichostatin A-induced, Sp1-mediated p21 transcription (29Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The chromosomal localization of Sp1 is 12q13 (30Gaynor R.B. Shieh B.H. Klisak I. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1993; 64: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Matera A.G. Ward D.C. Genomics. 1993; 17: 793-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A partial human Sp1 cDNA was described in 1987 by Tjian and co-workers (Ref. 3Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number J03133); it encodes the 696 C-terminal amino acids of the human Sp1. More recently, highly conserved full-length Sp1 cDNA from rat (GenBankTM accession number D12768; Ref. 32Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Kobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y.

Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that has been implicated in the activation of a large number of genes. Although the activity of Sp1 is generally believed to be constitutive, it has been shown recently to participate in several cases of regulated gene transcription. There is now evidence that its activity can be modulated, as in the case in differentiation (36Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D. Mueller C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38067-38072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) where the transcriptional start site was mapped at −171 relative to the ATG by primer extension in HepG2 cells. This difference could be due to the fact that we used a 47-mer in the primer extension reaction thus allowing a high specificity in the hybridization, whereas the group of Takahara used a 22-mer. The 5′-flanking region of the human transcription factor Sp1 lacks TATA and CAAT boxes (54Saltzman A.G. Weinmann R. FASEB J. 1989; 6: 1723-1733Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The TATA box is typically located 30 bp upstream from the transcription initiation site and helps to specify the transcription initiation site. There is also no initiator element (PyPyA+1N(T/A)PyPy) in the human Sp1 promoter that in the absence of a TATA box commonly drives transcriptional initiation (46Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In contrast, this region is GC-rich and contains potential binding sites for several well characterized transcription factors (Fig. 2). The absence of TATA or CAAT boxes and the presence of several GC boxes have been found primarily in housekeeping genes (47Sehgal A. Patil N. Chao M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3160-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and might have been expected to result in initiation of transcription at several locations (1Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 48Roy A.L. Novina C.D. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 351-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, a major single initiation site was consistently found in human 293T, HeLa, and HepG2 cells. We found that the 5′-flanking region including up to −281 relative to the translational initiation codon contains all the elements necessary to achieve basal promoter activity. Of particular note is the high GC content of this region; in fact computer analysis indicates the presence of two putative Sp1-binding sites between nucleotides −281 to −20 and two more between −281 and −443. Our findings are consistent with previous studies showing that the transcription of other TATA-less promoters frequently involves the action of a proximal Sp1 site (49Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eucaryot. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). By EMSA, we demonstrated that several DNA-protein complexes were produced with a probe including the proximal promoter (up to base −281 relative to the translational start) that contains 2 GC boxes. The same qualitative binding pattern was observed when using two different human cell lines (293T and HeLa cells). The broad band in Fig. 5 Ais composed of three bands when using the shorter probe FOR2D as clarified in Fig. 5 C. In Fig. 5 C, anti-Sp1 supershifted the two lower bands, and anti-Sp3 supershifted the upper one. These three bands within the broad band are due to the binding to the most downstream GC box in FOR2 probe as shown by the results obtained in Fig. 5 C and the competition assays between labeled FOR2 and unlabeled FOR2D (Fig. 5 E). Sp3 contributed also to the formation of two more bands in the gel shift performed with FOR2 probe, the uppermost (Fig. 5 B) and the lowermost bands (Fig. 5, B and C). On the other hand, the FOR2U probe gives rise to two bands in the gel shift with nuclear extracts that are not supershifted with either Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies. The inability of Sp1 in the nuclear extract to bind to the FOR2U probe could be due to the binding of other transcription factors to adjacent sites that would interfere with Sp1 binding or induce a DNA conformation at this level of the promoter. Because the FOR2U probe can be bound by recombinant Sp1 (Fig. 5 D,lane 3) it is likely that there is competition between Sp1 and other transcription factors present in the nuclear extract. The computational analysis of this promoter region revealed the presence of putative binding sites for C/EBP, NF-Y, CBP (CCAAT-binding protein), and AP2. Therefore, it is possible that a complex of transcription factors binds to this sequence. These results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the GC box located in the proximal promoter ofSp1 and that the downstream FOR2 GC box (the one contained in the FOR2D probe) is responsible for the major gel shift bands seen with the larger FOR2 probe. An interesting conclusion of this work is the fact that theSp1 gene is positively autoregulated. Indeed, co-transfection experiments of Sp1 proximal promoter constructs (pGL3FOR1 and pGL3FOR2) and a Sp1 expression vector in 293T cells demonstrate that Sp1 can activate its own transcription activity. The mechanism of positive autoregulation has already been described for other transcription factors such as NF-κB2 (50Liptay S. Schmid R.M. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7695-7703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the human junD (51Berger I. Shaul Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and CREB (52Meyer T.E. Waeber G. Lin J. Beckmann W. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For all these transcription factors, the actual binding of these proteins to their gene promoters has been shown, whereas for the human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene promoter, the positive autoregulation is mediated through an ATF-2 binding site in the Rb promoter (53Park K. Choe J. Osifchin N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6083-6088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoregulation of Sp1 may be an important mechanism of modulating Sp1 activity. It is known that Sp1 protein is subjected to cell cycle regulation (38Noé V. Chen C. Alemany C. Nicolás M. Cargol I. Chasin L. Ciudad C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 39Black A.R. Jensen D. Lin S.Y. Azizkhan J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1207-1215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and the rapid synthesis and degradation of a cell cycle-regulated gene may be facilitated by an autoregulation mechanism of the corresponding gene promoter. Future work will analyze the possible regulation of the Sp1 expression achieved by Sp3 alone or at different ratios with Sp1, given that we have observed that Sp3 also binds to the Sp1 promoter as well as the effect of other transcriptions factors like Ap2 and E2F whose binding sites are also present in the Sp1 promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2045115383,"Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a cytokine supporting the differentiation and survival of a number of neural cell types. Its receptor complex consists of a ligand-binding component, CNTF receptor (CNTFR), associated with two signaling receptor components, gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Striking phenotypic differences between CNTF- and CNTFR-deficient mice suggest that CNTFR serves as a receptor for a second developmentally important ligand. We recently demonstrated that cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) associates with the soluble orphan receptor cytokine-like factor-1 (CLF) to form a heterodimeric cytokine that displayed activities only on cells expressing the tripartite CNTF receptor on their surface. In this present study we examined the membrane binding of the CLC/CLF composite cytokine and observed a preferential interaction of the cytokine with the CNTFR subunit. Signaling pathways recruited by the CLC/CLF complex in human neuroblastoma cell lines were also analyzed in detail. The results obtained showed an activation of Janus kinases (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 and LIFR. The phosphorylated signaling receptors served in turn as docking proteins for signal transducing molecules such as STAT3 and SHP-2. <i>In vitro</i> analysis revealed that the gp130-LIFR pathway could also stimulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In contrast to that reported before for CNTF, soluble CNTFR failed to promote the action CLC/CLF, and an absolute requirement of the membrane form of CNTFR was required to generate a functional response to the composite cytokine. This study reinforces the functional similarity between CNTF and the CLC/CLF composite cytokine defining the second ligand for CNTFR."

This homology is thought to underlie the atherogenicity of Lp(a) because apo(a) and its naturally occurring proteolytic fragments compete with plasminogen for fibrin(ogen) binding (3Harpel P.C.

The predicted apo(a)-mediated decrease in fibrinolysis may contribute to the accumulation of fibrin at sites of atherosclerotic lesion development. Apo(a) also exhibits additional proatherogenic properties including binding to fibronectin (5Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and decorin (6Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Zhu L. Scanu A.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 339: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar).The concentration of plasma and urinary apo(a) proteolytic fragments is increased concomitantly with elevated plasma Lp(a) levels (10Mooser V.

Invest. 1996; 97: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In some cases, the apo(a) fragments have a higher atherogenic potential than the intact Lp(a). For example, when the apo(a) moiety of Lp(a) is cleaved by protease to generate “mini-Lp(a)” (12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7385-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the resulting particle binds fibrinogen (12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J.

Because apo(a) fragments have potentially atherogenic properties and because they are also known to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions (14Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Smejkal G.B. Yashiro A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67–68: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the factors that regulate apo(a) proteolysis. Previous studies have focused on the role of serine proteases and metalloproteinase as relevant enzymes (5Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10019-10023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, the factors related to the proteolytic susceptibility of the various apo(a) domains have not been addressed.The presence of O-glycans is known in some cases to decrease the sensitivity of certain polypeptides to proteolytic cleavage (17Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Based on monosaccharide analysis, apo(a) is predicted to contain a high degree of O-glycosylation (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the high content of Ser and Thr residues in the interkringle linker domains suggested that these were the most likely sites for glycan attachment (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 19Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of apo(a) glycopeptides revealed that theO-glycans are clustered in the kringle IV linker domains (20Kratzin H. Armstrong V.W. Niehaus M. Hilschmann N. Seidel D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that apo(a) O-glycans could restrict proteolytic cleavage of the interkringle linkers. In the present work we have used exoglycosidase digestion and mass spectrometry to elucidate the structures of apo(a) glycans, and we investigated the potential importance of the major glycan species in modulating the sensitivity of apo(a) to thermolysin digestion.DISCUSSIONThe present studies utilized exoglycosidase sequencing techniques and mass spectrometry to determine the complete structure (including glycosidic linkage analysis) of human apo(a) oligosaccharides. The predicted monosaccharide composition was in general agreement with data published previously (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Seman L.J. Breckenridge W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the disialylated and non-sialylated O-glycan structures that were predicted previously to occur (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were found to account for only 10–20% of the apo(a) O-glycan pool (Fig. 3). The most abundant oligosaccharide was, in fact, a monosialylated core type 1O-glycan (Fig. 5), a structure that can also be deduced from the previous monosaccharide analysis (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Seman L.J. Breckenridge W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The slightly lower ratio of NeuNAc:Gal observed in our study is due to the finding that almost half of the biantennary N-glycans (which accounted for ∼17% of total apo(a) glycans) were present in a monosialylated state. In earlier studies (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), NeuNAc and Gal were present at equimolar ratios, suggesting an absence of monosialylatedN-glycans. Possible reasons for this discrepancy may be related to the high variation in sialic acid concentrations reported (as determined by gas chromatography) or due to the nonspecificity of the thiobarbituric acid method used in the NeuNAc quantitation (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Use of the thiobarbituric acid or “Warren” method can lead to an overestimation of lipoprotein sialic acid levels (35Warren L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1971-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sobenin I.A. Tertov V.V. Orekhov A.N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2293-2299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unlikely that the apo(a) N-glycans were desialylated during processing in the present work as the O-glycan pool (which also contained NeuNAc in the α2–3 linkage to Gal) did not contain a predominant nonsialylated structure. We have also observed that human apoB100 contains a high proportion of its N-glycans as a monosialylated complex biantennary structure, and this was noted when the glycans were removed from apoB100 by either hydrazinolysis or treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F, 2B. Garner, D. J. Harvey, M. Frischmann, F. Nigon, M. J. Chapman, and P. M. Rudd, unpublished data. indicating that under our hydrazinolysis conditions the NeuNAcα2–3Gal glycosidic linkage is stable.When apo(a) was treated with O-glycosidase (which cleaves Gal-GalNAc but not NeuNAc-Gal-GalNAc from Thr/Ser) followed by thermolysin, there was no significant change in the molecular weight of the resulting peptides compared with the peptides resulting from treatment of apo(a) with thermolysin alone. This supports our exoglycosidase sequencing data indicating that the Gal-GalNAc content of the original apo(a) samples was low.Having established the apo(a) oligosaccharide structures, we went on to investigate the potential influence of the O-glycans on apo(a) sensitivity to protease digestion. It is well known that human plasma and urine contains apo(a) fragments (31Doucet C. Mooser V. Gonbert S. Raymond F. Chapman J. Jacobs C. Thillet J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 507-513PubMed Google Scholar, 37Oida K. Takai H. Maeda H. Takahashi S. Shimada A. Suzuki J. Tamai T. Nakai T. Miyabo S. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 2244-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The factors that control the formation of these fragments are, however, poorly understood. It appears that specific domains of apo(a) are more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage than others (12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7385-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, the major cut site for both thermolysin and neutrophil elastase (both serine proteases) is in the kringle IV4 linker (12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7385-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This domain is predicted to be devoid of glycan chains (Fig. 7 B), and we hypothesized that the removal of O-glycans from other linkers may result in increased susceptibility to protease digestion. This was shown to be the case when O-glycans were trimmed by sialidase treatment, and particularly when the entire oligosaccharide structures were removed by treatment with sialidase andO-glycosidase. The role of O-glycans in protecting apo(a) from protease digestion may also explain why the apo(a) peptide generated by cleavage at the elastase cut site in the kringle IV7 linker requires an extended incubation time or increase in enzyme concentration (13Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Other examples of O-glycans conferring protease resistance have also been reported (see Ref. 17Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Drosophila melanogaster “mucin-D” glycoprotein contains a large amount (40% by mass) of Galβ1–3GalNAc that renders it highly resistant to protease action (38Kramerov A.A. Arbatsky N.P. Rozovsky Y.M. Mikhaleva E.A. Polesskaya O.O. Gvozdev V.A. Shibaev V.N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), consistent with our data showing that the same disaccharide alone (generated after treatment of Lp(a) with sialidase) provided resistance to thermolysin digestion.It is likely that apo(a) O- (and N-) glycans play additional functional roles, for example in intracellular processing (39White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang J. White A.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), maintaining the tertiary structure of apo(a), and preventing aggregation (17Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Because apo(a) O-glycans are hydrophilic, they may also play a role in ensuring that the bulk of apo(a) is extended out into the aqueous phase, as has been observed in structural studies of recombinant Lp(a) (41Phillips M.L. Lembertas A.V. Schumaker V.N. Lawn R.M. Shire S.J. Zioncheck T.F.

Since megalin is highly expressed in the brush border of renal proximal tubules and in the coated pits of glomerular epithelial cells (47Kanalas J.J. Makker S.P. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 4152-4157PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kanalas J.J. Makker S.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 792-798PubMed Google Scholar), it provides a plausible control mechanism for the generation of specific urinary apolipoproteins (49Kostner K. Spitzauer S. Rumpold H. Maurer G. Knipping G. Hrzenjak A. Frank S. Kostner G.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2001; 304: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, plasminogen is also a ligand for megalin (50Kanalas J.J. Makker S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10825-10829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet its urinary excretion is extremely low compared with apo(a) (49Kostner K. Spitzauer S. Rumpold H. Maurer G. Knipping G. Hrzenjak A. Frank S. Kostner G.M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2001; 304: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since the kringle type IV and type V structures of apo(a) are homologous to plasminogen (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the higher excretion of apo(a) may be related to the almost 14-fold higher content of carbohydrate associated with the apo(a) kringle linkers. This possibility has not been addressed as far as we are aware.The presence of terminal Gal residues on apo(a) may also confer an ability to bind to the macrophage asialoglycoprotein receptor. An analogous pathway has been proposed for apoB100 (LDL) endocytosis by macrophages (51Bartlett A.L. Stanley K.K. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 138: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 52Bartlett A.L. Grewal T. De Angelis E. Myers S. Stanley K.K. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 153: 219-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Arguing against such a pathway, one study has shown that the removal of sialic acid residues from recombinant apo(a) did not alter its binding to a partially characterized macrophage foam cell surface receptor (53Keesler G.A. Li Y. Skiba P.J. Fless G.M. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Investigation of the full range of functions for apo(a) oligosaccharides will clearly require further study.The generation of apo(a) fragments in vivo has been suggested to be potentially atherogenic due to the possibility of C-terminal peptides interfering with fibrinolysis (15Huby T. Doucet C. Dieplinger H. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3335-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of potential relevance, apo(a) fragments accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions where they may promote thrombogenesis (14Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Smejkal G.B. Yashiro A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67–68: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the microenvironment of the artery wall, it is possible that macrophage-derived glycosidases and proteases act in concert to degrade apo(a). This might have the unfortunate consequence of generating macromolecular complexes between “mini-Lp(a)” and extracellular matrix components that could then be taken up by macrophages to form foam cells and thereby promote the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. Since macrophages can release proteases (54Powers J.C. Gupton B.F. Harley A.D. Nishino N. Whitley R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 485: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 55Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrissey E. Libby P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Acta. 1997; 1356: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), our discovery that apo(a) glycans normally limit the extent of proteolytic fragmentation might explain why, in the macrophage-rich atherosclerotic lesion (57Gerrity R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar), apo(a) fragments are found to accumulate (14Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Smejkal G.B. Yashiro A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67–68: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to assess the degree of glycosylation present on such lesion-derived apo(a) fragments.In conclusion, the present study has directly elucidated the structure of human apo(a) oligosaccharide chains and shown that theO-glycans play an important role in maintaining the stability of apo(a) by conferring resistance to degradation by the serine protease, thermolysin. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))1consists of a low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle covalently linked through a single disulfide bond to apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) (1Brunner C. Kraft H.G. Utermann G. Muller H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Apo(a) contains multikringle domains that are homologous to plasminogen kringles IV and V (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). This homology is thought to underlie the atherogenicity of Lp(a) because apo(a) and its naturally occurring proteolytic fragments compete with plasminogen for fibrin(ogen) binding (3Harpel P.C. Gordon B.R. Parker T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3847-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 4Kronenberg F. Steinmetz A. Kostner G.M. Dieplinger H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 495-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The predicted apo(a)-mediated decrease in fibrinolysis may contribute to the accumulation of fibrin at sites of atherosclerotic lesion development. Apo(a) also exhibits additional proatherogenic properties including binding to fibronectin (5Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and decorin (6Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Zhu L. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23856-23865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), direct inhibition of tissue-type plasminogen activator 1 action (7Etingin O.R. Hajjar D.P. Hajjar K.A. Harpel P.C. Nachman R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2459-2465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and modulation of fibrinolysis after cell-surface binding (8Hajjar K.A. Gavish D. Breslow J.L. Nachman R.L. Nature. 1989; 339: 303-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 9Miles L.A. Fless G.M. Levin E.G. Scanu A.M. Plow E.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The concentration of plasma and urinary apo(a) proteolytic fragments is increased concomitantly with elevated plasma Lp(a) levels (10Mooser V. Marcovina S.M. White A.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2414-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Mooser V. Seabra M.C. Abedin M. Landschulz K.T. Marcovina S. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In some cases, the apo(a) fragments have a higher atherogenic potential than the intact Lp(a). For example, when the apo(a) moiety of Lp(a) is cleaved by protease to generate “mini-Lp(a)” (12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7385-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the resulting particle binds fibrinogen (12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7385-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and fibronectin (13Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) more avidly than undigested Lp(a). Because apo(a) fragments have potentially atherogenic properties and because they are also known to accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions (14Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Smejkal G.B. Yashiro A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 67–68: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the factors that regulate apo(a) proteolysis. Previous studies have focused on the role of serine proteases and metalloproteinase as relevant enzymes (5Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12Huby T. Schroder W. Doucet C. Chapman J. Thillet J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7385-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Huby T. Doucet C. Dieplinger H. Chapman J. Thillet J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10019-10023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); however, the factors related to the proteolytic susceptibility of the various apo(a) domains have not been addressed. The presence of O-glycans is known in some cases to decrease the sensitivity of certain polypeptides to proteolytic cleavage (17Van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 151-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Based on monosaccharide analysis, apo(a) is predicted to contain a high degree of O-glycosylation (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the high content of Ser and Thr residues in the interkringle linker domains suggested that these were the most likely sites for glycan attachment (2McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W.J. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar, 19Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of apo(a) glycopeptides revealed that theO-glycans are clustered in the kringle IV linker domains (20Kratzin H. Armstrong V.W. Niehaus M. Hilschmann N. Seidel D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that apo(a) O-glycans could restrict proteolytic cleavage of the interkringle linkers. In the present work we have used exoglycosidase digestion and mass spectrometry to elucidate the structures of apo(a) glycans, and we investigated the potential importance of the major glycan species in modulating the sensitivity of apo(a) to thermolysin digestion. DISCUSSIONThe present studies utilized exoglycosidase sequencing techniques and mass spectrometry to determine the complete structure (including glycosidic linkage analysis) of human apo(a) oligosaccharides. The predicted monosaccharide composition was in general agreement with data published previously (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Seman L.J. Breckenridge W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the disialylated and non-sialylated O-glycan structures that were predicted previously to occur (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were found to account for only 10–20% of the apo(a) O-glycan pool (Fig. 3). The most abundant oligosaccharide was, in fact, a monosialylated core type 1O-glycan (Fig. 5), a structure that can also be deduced from the previous monosaccharide analysis (18Fless G.M. ZumMallen M.E. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8712-8718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Seman L.J. Breckenridge W.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The slightly lower ratio of NeuNAc:Gal observed in our study is due to the finding that almost half of the biantennary N-glycans (which accounted for ∼17% of total apo(a) glycans) were present in a monosialylated state. In earlier studies (18Fless G.M. ZumM"

We now show that overexpression of specific βγ subunits can recover plasma membrane localization and palmitoylation of the βγ-binding-deficient mutants of αs or αq. Thus, the βγ-binding-defective α is completely dependent on co-expression of exogenous βγ for proper membrane localization. In this report, we examined the ability of β1–5 in combination with γ2 or γ3 to promote proper localization and palmitoylation of mutant αs or αq. Immunofluorescence localization, cellular fractionation, and palmitate labeling revealed distinct subtype-specific differences in βγ interactions with α subunits. These studies demonstrate that 1) α and βγ reciprocally promote the plasma membrane targeting of the other subunit; 2) β5, when co-expressed with γ2 or γ3, fails to localize to the plasma membrane or promote plasma membrane localization of mutant αs or αq; 3) β3 is deficient in promoting plasma membrane localization of mutant αsand αq, whereas β4 is deficient in promoting plasma membrane localization of mutant αq; 4) both palmitoylation and interactions with βγ are required for plasma membrane localization of α.

Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor via agonist binding induces a conformational change in the G protein αβγ heterotrimer, which triggers its dissociation from the receptor in the form of a GTP-bound α subunit and a βγ complex. Each subunit is then capable of regulating the function of various effector proteins. Because proper membrane localization is a prerequisite for the correct functioning of this system, numerous studies have examined the requirements for targeting of the G protein α subunits to the plasma membrane. The two major requirements seem to be covalent lipid modifications (3Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 4Wedegaertner P.B. Biol. Signals Recept. 1998; 7: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and binding to the βγ complex (5Fishburn C.S. Herzmark P. Morales J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18793-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two types of lipid modification of G protein α subunits have been described, both of which occur at the extreme N terminus of the protein. These subunits are either palmitoylated, in the case of αs, αq, α12, and α13, or myristoylated and palmitoylated in the case of αi, αo, and αz. Myristate, a 14-carbon fatty acid, is attached co-translationally and irreversibly, whereas palmitate, a 16-carbon fatty acid, is attached post-translationally and reversibly. These lipid modifications help anchor the G protein α subunit to the PM, but in the case of αs and αq, and presumably α12and α13 as well, palmitoylation and proper localization of the α subunit at the PM requires stable binding between the α and βγ subunits (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The βγ complex is anchored at the PM with the help of its own lipid modification, the post-translational attachment of either a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety to a cysteine at a C-terminal CAAX box on the γ subunit. Although formation of the αβγ heterotrimer is clearly essential for cell signaling, the selectivity of interactions among different subunit subtypes has not been well defined. Given that there are at least 23 different α subunits (including splice variants), 5 β subunits and 12 γ subunits, this allows for more than 1300 different heterotrimers. It has been previously documented that some G protein subunits are expressed in subtype-specific patterns in tissues and cells (7Brunk I. Pahner I. Maier U. Jenner B. Veh R.W. Nurnberg B.

This obviously determines the limits of subtype-specific heterotrimer formation in a particular cell but it does not address what βγ dimers and αβγ heterotrimers are actually formed. However, a number of reports have described subtype-specificity in βγ dimer and αβγ heterotrimer formation and function (12Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Dippel E. Laugwitz K.L. Schultz G. Adv.

Yet, little information is available on differences in the abilities of specific α subtypes to interact with specific βγ dimers. It is not known if observed combinations are indicative of restricted functional associations between the α and βγ subunits, or whether all combinations are possible and selectivity is derived solely through variations in G protein expression and the kinetics of G protein coupling to receptors or effectors. To begin to address questions of selectivity in αβγ heterotrimer formation and the role of such selectivity in proper subcellular localization, we have expressed different combinations of β and γ subunits along with wild-type or βγ-binding-deficient mutants of αs or αq. We recently demonstrated that mutation of amino acids, which are predicted to contact βγ, in the N-terminal region of αs or αq resulted in α subunits that failed to localize at the plasma membrane or undergo palmitoylation when transiently expressed in HEK293 cells (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, it appeared that endogenous βγ was unable to effectively interact with the βγ-binding mutants of αs or αq. However, the mutants still contain a C-terminal region, which is known to contact βγ, and although this region seems to be insufficient for endogenous levels of βγ to functionally interact with the mutant α subunits, it may be possible to recover a functional interaction by overexpression of the βγ complexes. In this report, we test the hypothesis that overexpressed βγ can overcome the defects observed with the βγ-binding-defective mutants of αs and αq. Furthermore, expression of unique βγ combinations would allow us to test different βγ complexes for their ability to recover the localization of the βγ-binding-defective mutants of αs and αq. Thus, rescue of PM localization could provide a model system for assaying subtype-specific differences in βγ interactions with α subunits that may be masked by the high levels of overexpressed protein displaying normal binding affinities. Herein, we present the first test of this system by examining the ability of β1–5 in combination with γ2 or γ3 to promote plasma membrane targeting of the βγ-binding mutants of αs or αq. Importantly, this analysis revealed distinct subtype-specific differences in βγ interactions with α subunits. We also tested the importance of α subunit palmitoylation in this system. We demonstrate that overexpression of βγ recovers palmitoylation of βγ-binding mutants of αs and αq. Significantly, overexpression of βγ with cysteine to serine mutants of αs and αq, which are incapable of being palmitoylated, fails to recover membrane localization of the α subunits.

Bovine γ2 subunit cDNA in pcDNA1 was excised by digestion with BamHI andXhoI and ligated into pcDNA3. The γ3subunit cDNA in pCB+ was obtained from N. Gautam. HEK293 cells were maintained in culture as previously described (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out in either 6-well cell culture plates with 1 μg of total plasmid DNA or 6-cm plates with 3 μg of total plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected overnight, transferred to new plates the next day, and grown for 24–30 h prior to subsequent manipulations. Immunofluorescence localization was performed as previously described (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected overnight in 6-well plates with the indicated amounts of each expression plasmid. The cells were replated on glass coverslips and grown for 24 to 48 h before fixing with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized and then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h at the following dilutions: 12CA5 monoclonal (3 μg/ml), c-Myc monoclonal (1 μg/ml), HA-probe (Y-11) rabbit polyclonal (2 μg/ml), c-Myc (A-14) rabbit polyclonal (2 μg/ml), Gγ 2 (A-16) rabbit polyclonal (2 μg/ml) and Gγ 3 (K-20) rabbit polyclonal (2 μg/ml). The cells were washed and incubated in a 1:100 dilution of the indicated secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit, and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), for 30 min. The coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides with Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera. A minimum of 100 cells was examined for each transfection, and in most cases this number was at least 500. Many transfections were repeated once, and two or three representative pictures were taken of cells displaying a typical expression pattern for each transfection. Only cells displaying low to intermediate levels of expression were utilized. Similar or identical f-stops were used for imaging the fluorescence from the α or β subunits in each experiment to verify that imaged cells were expressing approximately equal amounts of each subunit. Images were processed with Adobe Photoshop. Soluble and particulate fractions were isolated as previously described (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of each expression plasmid in 6-cm plates overnight, transferred to 10-cm plates, and grown for 48 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer by passage through a syringe. Nuclei and intact cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g to obtain the soluble and particulate fractions. Fractions were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF-Plus (Micron Separations Inc.) and probed with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. The bands were visualized by chemiluminescence and quantitated using a Kodak DC40 imaging system. Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation of αs and αq were performed as previously described (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids, grown for 48 h, and incubated with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (1 mCi/ml for αs or 0.5 mCi/ml for αq) for 2 h in a 6-cm dish. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Cell extracts were tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C, and nuclei and insoluble material were removed by microcentrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. Samples containing HA-tagged αq or its mutants were adjusted to 0.1% SDS. 1 μg of 12CA5 antibody was added, and the samples were tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C. Next, 20 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added, and the sample was tumbled overnight at 4 °C. The sample was centrifuged for 30 s at 200 × g to pellet the beads. The supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the washed beads, and the samples were heated at 65 °C for 1 min. An aliquot was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were incubated for 20 min in an aqueous solution of 50% methanol/10% acetic acid, followed by 10% methanol/10% acetic acid for 20 min, and, finally, Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 20 min. Gels were dried and subjected to fluorography at −80 °C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To examine the intracellular targeting and localization of the G protein α and βγ subunits, these subunits were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells independently or with complementary subunits. As previously shown by us, αsexpressed in the presence of only endogenous βγ is found predominately at the plasma membrane but some remains in the cytoplasm (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Because βγ binding was determined to be essential for membrane localization of αs, it is reasonable to expect that overexpression of βγ complexes with the αs subunit would be able to target more αs to the PM than endogenous βγ alone. Co-expression of β1γ2 with αs in HEK293 cells resulted in prominent PM localization of αs (Fig.1 A1). Comparison of these results with those of αs when expressed alone showed more pronounced PM localization in a larger number of cells. The β2–4γ2 subunits were also effective at promoting more pronounced PM localization of αs (TableI). Co-expression with β5γ2, a βγ complex that does not interact with αs (31Fletcher J.E. Lindorfer M.A. DeFilippo J.M. Yasuda H. Guilmard M. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 636-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), resulted in a mixed PM/cytoplasmic localization of αs that was similar to αsexpressed alone (Fig. 1 B1). The presence of γ3rather than γ2 in the βγ complex did not change the effectiveness of PM targeting for either β1 or β5 (Fig. 1, C1 and D1). Examination of the localization of the βγ complex in each case showed that it co-localized with the α subunit when the α subunit was exclusively at the PM (Fig. 1, A2 and C2) but failed to do so otherwise (Fig. 1, B2 and D2). In contrast to αs, αq displayed strong PM localization when expressed alone (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As expected, αq retained a predominant PM localization when co-expressed with each of the βγ complexes, and the localization of the βγ complexes did not vary from the results with αs (Table I).Table ISummary of immunofluorescent subcellular localization of α and βγβ onlyαsαqαsIEK+αqIEαβαβαβαβα only+++−−β1γ2+++++++++++++++++β2γ2+++++++++++++++++β3γ2+/−++++++++−+++β4γ2++++++++++++++++β5γ2−1-aPerinuclear.+−1-aPerinuclear.++−1-aPerinuclear.−−1-aPerinuclear.−−1-aPerinuclear.β1γ3+/−+++++++++++++++β2γ3−1-bCytoplasmic and bright intracellular aggregates.+++++++++−+/−+β3γ3−1-bCytoplasmic and bright intracellular aggregates.++++++++−−β4γ3−1-bCytoplasmic and bright intracellular aggregates.+++++++++/−+/−−−β5γ3ND1-cND, not determined.+−++−−−−−1-bCytoplasmic and bright intracellular aggregates.The indicated combinations of subunits were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the subcellular localization of the expressed α or β was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using antibodies directed against an HA epitope (α) or myc epitope (β). ++, prominent PM localization of the α or β subunit with little or no observable staining of cytoplasm or intracellular structures; +, both PM and cytoplasmic localization in individual cells with the relative amounts of PM and cytoplasm staining varying among cells; +/−, barely detectable PM localization; −, homogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm, except where indicated by footnotes, with no PM localization.1-a Perinuclear.1-b Cytoplasmic and bright intracellular aggregates.1-c ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The indicated combinations of subunits were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the subcellular localization of the expressed α or β was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using antibodies directed against an HA epitope (α) or myc epitope (β). ++, prominent PM localization of the α or β subunit with little or no observable staining of cytoplasm or intracellular structures; +, both PM and cytoplasmic localization in individual cells with the relative amounts of PM and cytoplasm staining varying among cells; +/−, barely detectable PM localization; −, homogeneously distributed throughout the cytoplasm, except where indicated by footnotes, with no PM localization. We have demonstrated that the βγ complex is critical for PM localization of αs and αq, but it is not clear how important the α subunit is for βγ complex localization. To help determine this, myc-tagged β subunits were expressed alone, co-expressed with γ subunits, or co-expressed with both α and γ, and visualized by immunofluorescence. The β1 subunit displayed some plasma membrane staining but seemed to be most prominent in the cytoplasm or intracellular membranes (Fig.2). Similar results were obtained with the β4 subunit (data not shown). β2, β3, and β5 displayed only intracellular staining, although β2 and β3 displayed some exclusion from the nucleus and β5 did not (data not shown). Co-expression with γ2 subunits resulted in little to no increase in PM localization for all β subunits despite the fact that the γ2 subunit should be prenylated and able to anchor to the PM (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Upon co-expression with αs and γ2, essentially all of the β1 subunits were targeted to the PM where they co-localized with αs (Figs. 1 A2 and 2), as were β2–4 (Table I). Overlaying of the two pictures (Fig. 1, A1 and A2) showed conclusively that β1 co-localizes with αs at the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by the bright yellow plasma membrane coloring (Fig. 1 A3). Similar to αs, expression of αq induced increased PM localization of β1–4γ2 (Table I). Although co-expression of the γ subunit with the β subunit did not seem to affect the localization of the β subunit, β subunit expression did affect the expression and localization of γ in our system. Because the γ2 antibody did not work reliably in our hands, we used the γ3 subunit for these experiments. Previous localization of endogenous γ3 in cardiac fibroblasts showed diffuse staining throughout the cell (32Hansen C.A. Schroering A.G. Carey D.J. Robishaw J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of the γ3 subunit alone resulted in almost no detectable expression. The few cells that did express the protein displayed a small level of intracellular expression only (Fig. 2). Co-expression with the β1 subunit resulted in expression in more cells with protein present both intracellularly and at the PM (Fig. 2). However, it was not until the αs subunit was also transfected that predominately PM localization was seen for the γ3 subunit and there was expression in a large number of cells (Fig. 2). Thus, it appears that expression and localization of each subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein is dependent in some way on the others and no single subunit determines the expression and localization of the others. Unlike all the other β subunits, the β5 subunit never displayed any PM localization. When β5 was expressed alone or with the γ3 subunit, its expression was evenly distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 1 D2). However, when it was co-expressed with the γ2 subunit, β5expression was restricted to perinuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. Additional expression of αs (Fig. 1 B2) or αq (Table I) did not change the localization of β5. This unique localization of the β5subunit was found to be caused by co-expression of the γ2subunit, which, when expressed alone, shows this same localization in perinuclear and cytoplasmic membranes (Ref. 33Fishburn C.S. Pollitt S.K. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and data not shown). These results suggest that β5 is able to co-localize and associate with γ2 but not γ3. This is supported by studies that have demonstrated signal transduction pathways utilizing overexpressed β5γ2subunits but not β5γ3 subunits (24Zhou J.Y. Siderovski D.P. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results above demonstrated the ability of the βγ complex to help promote PM binding of wild-type αs. Because our previous results demonstrated that mutation of the N-terminal βγ contact region of αs resulted in its inability to localize at the plasma membrane, we wanted to test whether co-expression of βγ with a βγ-binding-deficient mutant of αs could overcome the effects of decreased βγ binding ability. The previously characterized βγ-binding mutant, αsIEK+, was co-transfected with β1–5 and γ2. The β subunits and αsIEK+ were then visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown previously, αsIEK+ was totally cytoplasmic with no visible membrane staining (6Evanko D.S. Thiyagarajan M.M. Wedegaertner P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Co-expression with β1γ2, β2γ2, and β4γ2resulted in αsIEK+ localizing at the plasma membrane as was the case with the wild-type αs (Fig.3, A1, B1,D1). Visualization of β1, β2, and β4 demonstrated that all three β subunits co-localized with αsIEK+ at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3,A2, B2, D2). However, co-expression of β3γ2 was unable to target αsIEK+ to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C1). Visualization of the β3 subunit showed that at least some of it was in fact localized at the plasma membrane, and the merged photo clearly shows the red membrane staining of the β3 subunit and green cytoplasmic staining of the αsIEK+ (Fig. 3, C2 and C3). As would be expected from the results with the wild-type αssubunit (Fig. 1 B), β5γ2 was unable to target the αsIEK+ mutant to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 E1). Not only was β5γ2unable to target αsIEK+ to the plasma membrane, but the two subunits failed to co-localize within the cytoplasm. αsIEK+ displayed an even cytoplasmic distribution with no concentration in the perinuclear or Golgi regions where the β5 subunit was localized (Fig. 3 E3). As a complementary approach, we utilized cellular fractionation to determine the localization of the αs subunits in the entire population of expressing cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the various combinations of subunits and grown for 3 days. The cells were lysed, the soluble and particulate fractions representing the cytoplasmic and membrane cellular fractions were isolated, and the level of αs subunit in each fraction was determined. The results clearly show that co-expression of nearly every βγ complex combination tested was able to recover the membrane binding ability"

M., Mann, S., and MacKinnon, R. (1999) Cell. 90, 943–952). The crystal structure of the Kvβ2 subunit shows that Kvβ subunits are oxidoreductase enzymes containing an active site composed of conserved catalytic residues, a nicotinamide (NADPH)-cofactor, and a substrate binding site. Also, Kvβ subunits with an N-terminal inactivating domain like Kvβ1.1 (Rettig, J., Heinemann, S. H., Wunder, F., Lorra, C., Parcej, D. N., Dolly, O., and Pongs, O.

Here we show by a combination of structural modeling and electrophysiological characterization of structure-based mutations that changes in Kvβ oxidoreductase activity may markedly influence the gating mode of Kv channels. Amino acid substitutions of the putative catalytic residues in the Kvβ1.1 oxidoreductase active site attenuate the inactivating activity of Kvβ1.1 in Xenopus oocytes. Conversely, mutating the substrate binding domain and/or the cofactor binding domain rescues the failure of Kvβ3.1 to confer rapid inactivation to Kv1.5 channels inXenopus oocytes.

The membrane topology of Kvα subunits shows six membrane-spanning segments, S1–S6, a pore-forming loop structure between S5 and S6, and cytoplasmic N and C termini. A tetramerization domain resides in the N terminus and directs assembly of Kvα subunits (7Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 8Shen N.V.

Crystallographic analysis of Kvβ2 tetramers showed that each subunit contains an interface for association with Kvα subunits (11Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R.

Three Kvβ genes have been identified: Kvβ1,Kvβ2, and Kvβ3 (12Leicher T. Bähring R. Isbrandt D. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35095-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ3.1 subunits possess an N-terminal inactivating domain that confers rapid N-type inactivation to Kv channels (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly O. Pongs O.

( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, the association of Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ3.1 subunits with certain Kv1α subunits leads to the expression of rapidly inactivating A-type channels (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 3Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J. Physiol.

By contrast, Kv1.5/Kvβ1.1 channels mediate rapidly inactivating currents both in mammalian cells (14Leicher T. Roeper J. Weber K. Wang X. Pongs O.

We constructed chimeras between Kvβ3.1 and Kvβ1.1 to identify possible domains correlated with the apparent lack of function of Kvβ3.1 in particular with reference to the N-terminal inactivating domain (2Rettig J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1, Band C). The results of our structure-function analysis demonstrate that the failure of Kvβ3.1 to confer rapid inactivation to Kv1.5 channels in the Xenopus oocyte expression system is associated with two C-terminal domains of Kvβ3.1, which contain structural elements of the oxidoreductase active site. According to the crystal structure of Kvβ2, the two Kvβ3.1 domains occur in Kvβ protein regions, which are part of the NADPH cofactor binding pocket and the substrate binding site, respectively. Chimeric replacement of Kvβ3.1 residues by Kvβ1.1 residues within these domains rescued the Kvβ3.1 inactivating activity, and point mutations of Kvβ1.1 active site residues attenuated the Kvβ1.1 inactivating activity. We propose that Kvβ oxidoreductase enzymatic activity and the biophysics of Kvβ inactivating activity are coupled. Kvβ1.1pAKS (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N. Dolly O.

For the construction of the different chimeras the following DNA fragments were joined together (note that numbers in parentheses refer to Kvβ-cDNA nucleotides): KvβchiA, Kvβ3.1-(1–1080) and Kvβ1.1-(1000–1546); KvβchiArev Kvβ1.1-(1–997) and Kvβ3.1-(1075–1599); KvβchiB, Kvβ3.1-(390–1260) and Kvβ1.1-(1180–1534); KvβchiC, Kvβ3.1-(390–1260) and Kvβ1.1-(1180–1534); KvβchiD Kvβ3.1-(390–1380) and 32 Kvβ1.1-(1300–1534); KvβchiE, Kvβ3.1-(390–1534) and Kvβ1.1-(1453–1534); KvβchiF, Kvβ3.1-(390–1450), Kvβ1.1-(1370–1453), and Kvβ3.1-(1535–1606); KvβchiG, Kvβ3.1-(390–1376), Kvβ1.1-(1304–1385), and Kvβ3.1-(1457–1606); KvβchiH, Kvβ3.1-(390–1222), Kvβ1.1-(1142–1237), Kvβ3.1-(1318–1440), Kvβ1.1-(1370–1453), Kvβ3.1-(1535–1606); KvβchiI, Kvβ3.1-(390–1222), Kvβ1.1-(1142–1270), Kvβ3.1-(1285–1440), Kvβ1.1-(1370–1453), Kvβ3.1-(1535–1606). DNA sequences amplified by the polymerase chain reaction were verified by sequencing using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI 377 automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Point mutations in rat Kvβ1.1 were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate mutation primers (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.D. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into Kvβ1.1pGEM using aDraIII and a NcoI restriction site. DNA constructs were sequenced prior to use. RNA synthesis was done using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen Inc.). Xenopusoocytes were prepared and injected with cRNA, and electrophysiological recordings were made as previously described (18Wilson G.G. O'Neill C.A. Sivaprasadarao A. Findlay J.B.C. Wray D. Pflug. Arch. 1994; 428: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of a solution containing equal amounts (25 ng) of cRNA for rKv1.5α and rKvβ subunits (wild-type or Kvβchi). Deviations from these cRNA concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. Oocytes were then incubated at 20 °C for 24–48 h in multiwell tissue culture plates (one oocyte/well) containing modified Barth's solution (88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10,000 units/l penicillin, 100 mg/l streptomycin). To record expressed membrane currents, the oocytes were held in a recording chamber (50 μl volume) and continually perfused (2 ml/min) with Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with NaOH). Membrane currents were recorded with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique (microelectrodes filled with 3 mKCl) using a Geneclamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments), and signals were filtered at 2 kHz. Twenty 10 mV hyperpolarizing steps (1 s duration, 0.5 Hz) were applied and used to remove leak and capacitance currents. To construct current-voltage (I-V) relationships, the cell was held at −80 mV, 1-s duration test depolarizations at 0.1 Hz were applied in 10 mV increments from −70 to +120 mV, and peak and end current amplitudes were measured. I-V curves were fitted with Boltzmann functions of the form I = (V −Vr) × Gmax/(1 + exp((V0.5 − V)/k) whereVr equals −98 mV. The inactivation time course was fit by a sum of two exponentials by the least squares technique. Student's t test was used to test for statistical significance. In some experiments cDNA (vector pcDNA3) for Kv1.5 (25 ng/μl) together with Kvβchi cDNA (500 ng/μl) were microinjected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Whole-cell currents were measured with the patch clamp technique on the following day using an EPC9 amplifier and PULSE software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). The extracellular solution contained (in mm) NaCl 135, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl22, HEPES 5, sucrose 10 (pH 7.4, NaOH), and recording pipettes (2–5 MΩ) were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mm) KCl 125, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, EGTA 11, HEPES 10, glutathione 2, K2ATP 2 (pH 7.2, KOH). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (20–22 °C). Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ3.1 subunits have functional inactivating domains, but Kvβ3.1 confers rapid inactivation to Kv1.5 channels only when coexpressed in mammalian cells (12Leicher T. Bähring R. Isbrandt D. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35095-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results (13Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O. FEBS Letters. 1995; 377: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), wild-type Kvβ3.1 subunits did not cause rapid inactivation when we coexpressed it with Kv1.5 channels in Xenopus oocytes (Fig.1 A; TableI). Upon depolarization of the oocyte membrane, slowly inactivating outward currents were recorded, and 84% of the initial peak amplitude remained at the end of a 1-s test pulse to +80 mV (Fig. 1, A and D; Table I). By contrast, Kv1.5/Kvβ1.1 channels mediate rapidly inactivating currents both in mammalian cells (14Leicher T. Roeper J. Weber K. Wang X. Pongs O. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Roeper J. Sewing S. Zhang Y. Sommer T. Wanner S. Pongs O.

Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In our experiments they decayed to ∼13% of the initial maximum current amplitude at the end of a 1 s test pulse to +80 mV (Fig.1, A and D; Table I). The inactivation time course (Fig. 1 A) was fitted with two time constants, τ1 (13.0 ± 0.9 ms) and τ2 (75.0 ± 0.5 ms; n = 14; Table I). The fast time constant τ1 accounted for 90 ± 10% of the total current decay. We examined the structural motifs in Kvβ3.1 responsible for its inactivation failure in Xenopus oocytes by constructing chimeras between Kvβ3.1 and Kvβ1.1. Possible structural determinants correlated with the apparent lack of function of Kvβ3.1 may be located in the N-terminal inactivating domain (2Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.N.

In all cases 25 ng of Kv1.5 and Kvβ cRNA was injected per oocyte. We connected in the first chimera the Kvβ3.1 N terminus (residues 1–229), which contains the N-terminal inactivating domain and the conserved catalytic residues (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) of the Kvβ3 oxidoreductase (Fig. 1 B), with the Kvβ1 C terminus corresponding to Kvβ1.1 residues 223–401 (KvβchiA; Fig. 1 C). The N-terminal Kvβ3.1 inactivating domain became fully functional when connected to the Kvβ1 C terminus (Fig. 1, A andD), in agreement with the previous observation that the Kvβ3.1 inactivating domain becomes functional when connected to Kvβ2.1 (3Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 493: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The results obtained with KvβchiA indicated that C-terminal Kvβ3.1 domain(s) must be responsible for the lack of functional interaction with Kv1.5 channels. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a reverse chimera (KvβchiArev), in which the Kvβ1 N-terminal half was linked to the Kvβ3 C-terminal half (Kvβ1 residues 1–222 and Kvβ3 residues 230–404; Fig.1 B). The Kv1.5/KvβchiArev-mediated currents exhibited inactivation kinetics similar to the ones observed for Kv1.5 with wild-type Kvβ3.1, with 80 ± 1% of the maximal current amplitude remaining at the end of a 1-s depolarizing pulse (Fig. 1 A; Table I). These results confirmed the idea that the ability of KvβchiA to inactivate Kv1.5 channels was due to the presence of the Kvβ1.1 C terminus. To identify the C-terminal domains responsible for the failure of Kvβ3.1 in N-type inactivation we constructed further Kvβ chimeras. For this purpose we expanded the Kvβ3 portion in KvβchiA in a stepwise fashion. Additional replacement of Kvβ1.1 residues 223–282 by those of Kvβ3.1 (KvβchiB) included the Kvβ1 interface domain for assembly with Kvα subunits (Ref. 11Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar; Fig.1, B and C). The respective Kv1.5/KvβchiB channels mediated outward currents with a relatively small reduction in the extent of inactivation (Fig. 1,A and D; Table I). The small reduction would be compatible with a subtle difference in the affinities of Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ3.1 subunits for the Kv1.5α subunits (11Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results demonstrated that the Kvβ3.1 domains for N-type inactivation and the subunit interface for complex formation with Kv1.5α subunits were not responsible for the observed inactivation failure of Kvβ3.1. The exchange of Kvβ1.1 residues by those of Kvβ3.1 was extended to residues 283–346 (KvβchiC, -D), which may cover the entire substrate binding site of the Kvβ oxidoreductase (Ref. 1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar; Fig.1, B and C). The respective Kv1.5/KvβchiC and Kv1.5/KvβchiD currents showed a significant reduction in the extent of inactivation (Fig. 1,A and D) because of an increase in τ2 as well as an alteration in the relative weights of the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) components (Table I). We extended the exchange of Kvβ1.1 by Kvβ3.1 residues further to residues 347–374 (KvβchiE), which encompassed a part of the Kvβ oxidoreductase active site that is essential for binding the cofactor NADPH (Ref. 1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar; Fig. 1, B andC). The resulting Kv1.5/KvβchiE currents showed an ineffective and slow inactivation (Fig. 1, A andD) due to an increase in both τ1 and τ2 (Table I). The results suggested that C-terminal Kvβ3.1 domains encompassing substrate and cofactor binding sites were responsible for the failure of Kvβ3.1 to inactivate Kv1.5 channels. With chimeras KvβchiF - I, we tried to rescue the inactivation failure of Kvβ3.1 by exchanging Kvβ3.1 domains with appropriate Kvβ1.1 domains (Fig. 1, B andC). Exchanging Kvβ3.1 residues 354–381 for those of Kvβ1.1 produced KvβchiF, which conferred to the slowly inactivating Kv1.5 currents a rapid inactivation (Fig. 1, A andD; Table I). By contrast, replacement of Kvβ3.1 residues 328–353 by those of Kvβ1.1 (KvβchiG) had no significant effect on inactivation (Fig. 1, A and D; TableI). Supplementation of KvβchiF with an additional Kvβ1.1 sequence replacing Kvβ3.1 residues 278–309 (KvβchiH) did not markedly alter the activity of KvβchiF toward Kv1.5 channels. However, extending the replacement in KvβchiH by an additional 21 amino acids (KvβchiI) generated Kv1.5/KvβchiI currents with rapid and nearly complete inactivation (Fig. 1, A andD; Table I). At the end of the 1-s test pulse to +80 mV the current was reduced to ∼6% of the initial maximum current amplitude similar to Kv1.5/Kvβ1.1 currents (Fig. 1 D). The data demonstrated that the exchange of two C-terminal Kvβ3.1 domains (domains I and II in Fig. 1 C) by those of Kvβ1.1 sufficed to rescue the inactivation failure of Kvβ3.1 in Xenopusoocytes. Kvβ domains I and II provide amino acid residues to the Kvβ oxidoreductase active site. Domain I contributes to the Kvβ NADPH cofactor binding site (Ser-325, Gln-329, Glu-332, and Asn-333 in Kvβ2.1; Ref. 1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Residues in domain II (Kvβ1.1 amino acids 303–323; Fig. 1 B and C; see also Fig.4 A) have been proposed to participate in substrate binding in Kvβ2 (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The voltage-gating properties of Kv1.5 channels were affected by the presence of different Kvβ1.1/Kvβ3.1 chimeras (TableI). This is typically observed upon assembly of Kvα with Kvβ subunits (3Heinemann S.H. Rettig J. Graack H.R. Pongs O. J. Physiol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20123-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Voltages of half-maximal current activation (V0.5 = +17 to +22 mV) and slope factors (k = 19–27 mV) of the conductance-voltage relationships were similar for Kv1.5/Kvβ1.1, Kv1.5/Kvβ3.1, and Kv1.5/Kvβchi currents except for Kv1.5/KvβchiB (V0.5 = +36 mV), Kv1.5/KvβchiC (V0.5 = +38 mV), and Kv1.5/KvβchiF currents (V0.5 = +27 mV) (Table I). Obviously, the distinct inactivation time courses of the various Kv1.5/Kvβchi currents at +80 mV, especially the rapid decay of Kv1.5/KvβchiI currents, are not due to an altered voltage-dependent steady-state activation. We considered the possibility that the structural differences at specific sites between Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ3.1 lead to improper protein folding and thereby to the observed functional inactivity of the Kvβ chimeras. Because the wild-type Kvβ3.1 is functionally active in CHO cells (12Leicher T. Bähring R. Isbrandt D. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35095-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we tested the activity of certain Kvβ chimeras in the same expression system. We chose KvβchiE, KvβchiF, and KvβchiG for these experiments because this series exhibited both gain of functional activity (from KvβchiE to KvβchiF) and loss of functional activity (from KvβchiF to KvβchiG) in Xenopus oocytes. When we coexpressed Kv1.5 channels with these chimeras in CHO cells, all the combinations gave rise to rapidly inactivating currents (Fig.2 A). We used a high excess of Kvβchi cDNA (20-fold; see “Experimental Procedures”) to ensure a high expression level of β subunits expected to yield a maximal fraction of Kvα/β complexes (22Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also performed control experiments in Xenopusoocytes with a similar excess of Kvβ3.1 cRNA over Kv1.5 channel cRNA. The results are shown in Fig. 2, B and C. They were not significantly different from what we obtained in the experiments with equal amounts of α and β subunit cRNA (see Fig.1). The results suggested that improper folding or insufficient protein expression represented the most unlikely explanations for the functional inactivity of Kvβ chimeras in Xenopusoocytes. Because the differing inactivating activities of Kvβ1.1 and Kvβ3.1 were correlated to sequence differences in their oxidoreductase active sites, we mutated the putative catalytic residues in Kvβ1.1 (Asp-119, Tyr-124, and Lys-152), which are highly conserved in the superfamily of oxidoreductase enzymes (1Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of the mutations on Kvβ1.1-mediated N-type inactivation. Coexpression of the mutants Kvβ1.1D119A, Kvβ1.1Y124F, and Kvβ1.1K152A with Kv1.5 at cRNA ratios of 1:1 (Fig. 3 A) and 1:5 (Fig. 3 C) showed that the respective outward currents did not decay as rapidly as Kv1.5/Kvβ1.1 currents (TableII). Each mutation affected rapid inactivation behavior to a different degree. The most marked effect was observed with Kvβ1.1D119A, which did not confer rapid inactivation to Kv1.5 channels. However, 15-s test pulses revealed that Kvβ1.1D119A did accelerate the slow inactivation o"

Although structurally different, these two proteins are derived from homologous genes in chicken and man by alternative splicing and contain 7 or 8 LDL receptor ligand-binding repeats. Here we present the cDNA for ApoER2 cloned from mouse brain and describe splice variants in the ligand binding domain of this protein, which are distinct from those present in man and chicken. The cloned cDNA is coding for a receptor with only five LDL receptor ligand-binding repeats,i.e. comprising repeats 1–3, 7, and 8. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from murine brain revealed the existence of two additional transcripts. One is lacking repeat 8, and in the other repeat 8 is substituted for by a 13-amino acid insertion with a consensus site for furin cleavage arising from an additional small exon present in the murine gene. None of the transcripts in the mouse, however, contain repeats 4–6. In murine placenta only the form containing repeats 1–3 and 7 and the furin cleavage site is detectable. Analysis of the corresponding region of the murine gene showed the existence of 6 exons coding for a total of 8 ligand binding repeats, with one exon encoding repeats 4–6. Exon trapping experiments demonstrated that this exon is constitutively spliced out in all murine transcripts. Thus, the murineApoER2 gene codes for receptor variants harboring either 4 or 5 binding repeats only. Recombinant expression of the 5-repeat and 4-repeat variants showed that repeats 1–3, 7, and 8 are sufficient for binding of β-very low density lipoprotein and reelin, but not for recognition of α2-macroglobulin, which binds to the avian homologue of ApoER2 harboring 8 ligand binding repeats.

None of the transcripts in the mouse, however, contain repeats 4–6. In murine placenta only the form containing repeats 1–3 and 7 and the furin cleavage site is detectable. Analysis of the corresponding region of the murine gene showed the existence of 6 exons coding for a total of 8 ligand binding repeats, with one exon encoding repeats 4–6. Exon trapping experiments demonstrated that this exon is constitutively spliced out in all murine transcripts. Thus, the murineApoER2 gene codes for receptor variants harboring either 4 or 5 binding repeats only. Recombinant expression of the 5-repeat and 4-repeat variants showed that repeats 1–3, 7, and 8 are sufficient for binding of β-very low density lipoprotein and reelin, but not for recognition of α2-macroglobulin, which binds to the avian homologue of ApoER2 harboring 8 ligand binding repeats. low density lipoprotein receptor very LDLR apolipoprotein LDLR relative with 7 or 8 LA repeats apoE receptor 2 receptor-associated protein α2-macroglobulin polymerase chain reaction type A binding repeats type B repeats reverse transcriptase base pair rapid amplification of cDNA ends horseradish peroxidase glutathioneS-transferase The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)1 family consists of a growing number of structurally related composite cell surface receptors with partially overlapping ligand specificity (1Schneider W.J.

For example, the LDLR harbors structurally and functionally defined modules, corresponding to distinct exons in the gene (3Schneider W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These modules are as follows: (i) the “type A-binding repeats” (LA repeats) of ∼40 residues each, displaying a triple disulfide bond-stabilized and negatively charged surface mediating receptor/ligand interactions; (ii) “type B repeats” (EG repeats), also containing six cysteines each; EG repeats are homologous to regions in the epidermal growth factor precursor; (iii) modules of ∼50 residues with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD); (iv) a so-called “O-linked sugar domain”; (v) a short transmembrane domain of ∼20 amino acids; and (vi) the cytoplasmic region with a signal for receptor internalization via coated pits.

The occurrence of distinct splice variants adds yet another level of complexity to this family of proteins. LR7/8B expression in chicken is highly restricted to the brain, where the protein resides in large neurons and Purkinje cells, and in cells constituting brain barrier systems such as the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the arachnoidea and the endothelium of blood vessels (8Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Hüttinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32213-32221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The finding that chicken LR8B acts as receptor for α2-macroglobulin (8Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Hüttinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol.

Ligand binding studies with two splice variants of human ApoER2 demonstrated high affinity of the receptor to β-VLDL, indicating that in mammals the receptor might be involved in apoE-mediated transport processes in the brain as well (7Kim D.-H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C. Kim H.-J. Suzuki H. Fujita T. Endo Y. Saeki S. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8498-8504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is an interesting aspect because a genetic link between certain alleles of the ApoE gene and the development of late onset Alzheimer's disease has been established (9Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). However, no differences in the splice variant patterns of ApoER2 between control and Alzheimer's patients exist (10Clatworthy A.E. Stockinger W. Christie R.H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the apoER2 gene alone or in combination with that for the VLDL receptor gene revealed a key function of both receptors during embryonic brain development (11Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Absence of functional ApoER2 and VLDL receptor leads to an inversion of cortical layers and absence of cerebellar foliation. This phenotype is indistinguishable from that seen in animals carrying either a mutation in the reeler gene or in the disabled gene (for review see Refs. 12Cooper J.A. Howell B.W.

Both ApoER2 and VLDL receptor bind reelin, which is secreted by Cajal-Retzius cells (15D'Arcangelo G. Homayoundi R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T.

Upon reelin stimulation the intracellular adapter protein disabled-1 (Dab1), which interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of apoER2 and VLDLR (19Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B.

These data suggest that ApoER2 and VLDL receptor directly relate the extracellular reelin signal into a cellular response via Dab1, leading to the ultimate cell responses required for the correct positioning of newly generated neurons during brain development. In addition, interaction screens with apoER2 and other members of the receptor family have resulted in the identification of many other candidate proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of the respective receptors, suggesting that they may be part of an intricate network of signaling pathways (23Gotthardt M.

Here we present the full-length cDNA and the partial characterization of the mouse apoER2 gene and show that differential splicing events in the ligand binding domain produce functional receptor variants that are distinct from those expressed in chicken and man. Splicing is tissue-specific and is regulated during brain development. The 5′-end of the mouse cDNA for apoER2 was cloned by 5′-RACE using the MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First and second strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and the poly(A) synthesis primer provided by the kit. 5′-RACE was done in two successive rounds of PCR amplification, with the sense primer located in an adapter ligated to the cDNA. The antisense primer was located in the known sequence from a partial cDNA clone (4Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The first round, which resulted in 334 bp of new sequence, was done using primer ASR1 (5′-CCGCTCCTGGTTGCACCGTTTGATG). The second round was performed with primer ASR2 (5′-GTCCTCGTCGCTGTTGTCCG) and resulted in additional 174 bp of new sequence exceeding the start codon. Total RNA was produced from 200 mg of frozen tissue (total brain and placenta from mature female Balb/c mice, and total chicken brain from female Brown Derco) using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from 500 μg of total RNA using the Micro-Fast Track mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and random hexamer primers using SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). One-tenth of the cDNA was used for subsequent PCR in the presence of 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmdNTPs, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1 μm of the appropriate primers on a GeneAmp 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR conditions are as follows: 5 min initial denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min denaturation at 94 °C; 1 min annealing (for specific annealing temperatures, see primers), and 1 min extension at 72 °C for 40 cycles. The following primers have been used (numbers of the primers refer to the respective primers shown in Fig. 2: mouse 1, 5′-CGAGAATGAGTTCCAGTGTGG; mouse 2, 5′-CGTGAAGATCAGAGATGGGC, 1/2 annealing at 60 °C; mouse 3, 5′-CTGCCGAGAAGTTAAGCTGC; mouse 4, 5′-CCGCTCCTGGTTGCACCGTTTGATG, 3/4 annealing at 58 °C; mouse 5, 5′-GAGTTCCAGTGCAGCAACCG; mouse 6, 5′-CCGCTGCGGCAGGTGAACTGG, 5/6 annealing at 60 °C; chicken 7, 5′-CCAAGCAAGTATGCCCAGC; chicken 8, 5′-TTGGACACAGCCTGCCTCG, 7/8 annealing at 57 °C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands were isolated from the gel using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Several clones from each fragment were isolated, and positive clones were identified by PCR analysis and sequenced. A mouse ES P1 library (Genome Systems, Inc.) was screened by PCR using the following primer pair: A, 5′-TGTCTGCACAATAACGGCGGCTGTTC, and B, 5′-ACAGGTCTTCTGGTCCAAGAGCTGGAAG. PCR conditions are as follows: 2 min initial denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min annealing at 56 °C, 1 min extension at 72 °C for 35 cycles. Using 1 μg of genomic DNA, a 105-bp amplicon derived from exon 9 (EG repeat A) was produced under these conditions. P1 plasmid DNA from positive clones was prepared from 150-ml cultures (Escherichia colistrain NS 3529, Genome Systems, Inc.) using the plasmid MidiKit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions including an additional phenol extraction step before loading on the column. P1 DNA was digested with BglII and shotgun-subcloned into theBamHI site of pBluescriptII (sK+). Clones were screened by PCR using two independent primer combinations (pair 1, 5′-GCGCGGACGGCGACTTCACC, 5′-GCCTTCGATTCGTCAGAGCC; pair 2, 5′-CCGCCGTCCACGCACTCGCC, 5′-CGAGAATGAGTTCCAGTGTGG) located within the 5′-part and the 3′-part of the ligand binding domain, respectively. The resulting clones were G14AS13 and 8AS-3.5 (see Fig. 3 A). The rest of the gene covering the ligand binding domain of the receptor was covered by PCR clones derived from the undigested P1 clone with the following primer combinations (see Fig. 3 A): 1, 5′-TGCAGCTTCAGCATCTCTCC and 5′-GTCCTCGTCGCTGTTGTCCG; 2, 5′-CCTTGGTGTGGAGATGCGATGAGG and 5′-AGGTGAGCATGGCGGCCTGCC; 3, 5′-GCGCGGACGGCGACTTCACC and 5′-GCAGCTTAACTTCTCGGCAGG; 4, 5′-GACGGAGAGAAGGACTGTGAGG and 5′-TGGTCCACTCAGTCAACCTGTCC; 5, 5′-AGTTCTATGAGAACTCATCCACC and 5′-GTGCTCATGACTTAGTGATGTGG; 6, 5′-AGTGGCGAGTGCGTGGACGGC and 5′-TGAGGTCAGTGCAGATGTGG. PCR products were isolated from the gel using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced. For the exon trap experiment two constructs were made. One contained the exon coding for repeats 4–6 including 89 bp of the upstream and 563 bp of the downstream intron, respectively (corresponding to genomic clone 5, Fig. 3). For this, entire clone 5 was cloned into filled in SalI sites of the exon trap vector pet01 (MoBiTec GmbH, Göttingen) resulting in pEx4-6. The second construct contained genomic clone 5 plus clone G14A13B3 (see Fig. 3), thus harboring two exons, one for repeat 2 and the other for repeats 4–6. This construct (pEx2, 4–6) was made by cloning the entire genomic clone G14A13B3 into pEx4-6 upstream of clone 5 using XbaI and NotI sites in the polylinker of pet01. 3 μg of DNA was transfected into 293 cells using Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells were grown on a 90-mm plate. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and mRNA was prepared using the Micro-fast track from Invitrogen. 1 μg of mRNA was taken and reverse-transcribed using 1 μl of Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the cDNA primer provided by the exon trap kit. RT-PCR was performed using 1/10th of the cDNA reaction using two primers from the exon trap kit (5′-primer 2 and 3′-primer 3) located 5′ and 3′ of the insert of pet01, respectively. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel and sequenced. Chicken LR8B and mouse apoER2Δ4-6 and apoER2Δ4-6,8 were expressed in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293. The full-length cDNA of mouse apoER2Δ4-6 and apoER2Δ4-6,8 were assembled by joining a partial cDNA for the mouse protein (4Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) with the appropriate PCR products derived from mouse brain cDNA with primers 5RS1 (5′-GGAGCCCCGGGCCCGCTATGG) and 5RAS6 (5′-GCTCATCAATGAGGACCACC) via an internal BglII site. The products of the PCR reaction with 5RS1, 5RAS6 containing repeats 1–3, 7, and 8 and repeats 1–3 and 7 were purified on a 1% agarose gel, cloned into pCR2.1, and sequenced. The partial cDNA (see above) was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCI-Neo. In order to produce the full-length cDNAs, fragments containing 4 repeats and 5 repeats were cut out from the pCR2.1 constructs via an internalBglII and the XhoI site (present in the polylinker of pCR2.1) and cloned into the pCI-Neo construct containing the rest of the cDNA. The construct used for expression of chicken LR8B in 293 cells has been described (8Stockinger W. Hengstschläger-Ottnad E. Novak S. Matus A. Hüttinger M. Bauer J. Lassmann H. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32213-32221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transfection of the cells was performed using Lipofectin Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transformants were selected by the addition of 500 mg/liter G418 to the medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum, 584 mg/liter glutamine). Total cell extracts from 293 cells expressing LR8B, ApoER2Δ4-6, or ApoER2Δ4-6,8 were prepared as described for chicken embryo fibroblasts (25Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis, transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (26Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H. Meilinger M.

Rabbit βVLDL was prepared from the plasma of animals fed a 2% cholesterol, 10% corn oil diet for 3 weeks (27Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Basu S.K. Bilheimer D.W. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and was radiolabeled with 125I by the iodine monochloride method as described earlier (25Hayashi K. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoprotein concentration is expressed in terms of protein content that was measured by a modified Lowry procedure as described previously (28Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11442-11447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2M was isolated from chicken plasma as described (29Jacobsen L. Hermann M. Vieira P.M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6468-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Native α2M was radiolabeled using Iodo-Gen pre-coated iodination tubes according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Pierce, catalog number 28601) to specific activities of 300–400 cpm/ng. Labeled α2M-trypsin complexes (α2M*) were generated as described (29Jacobsen L. Hermann M. Vieira P.M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6468-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Complete activation of labeled α2M by trypsin was monitored by native gel electrophoresis using the Tris borate system described by van Leuven (30Leuven F.V. Cassiman J.J. Berge H.V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9016-9022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human RAP was produced as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein using a pGEX 2T-derived (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression plasmid in DH5α bacteria (31Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalization of 125I-βVLDL and125I-α2M* by LR8B-, ApoER2Δ4-6-, and ApoER2Δ4-6,8-expressing 293 cells was measured according to the standard protocol for uptake of LDL (32Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In brief, 293 cells were cultured in poly-l-lysine-treated 3-cm dishes and grown to a 70% confluency. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 584 mg/liter glutamine, and125I-labeled ligand at the indicated concentrations for 3 h at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were lysed by addition of 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH and incubation at 23 °C for 10 min. The radioactivity in the lysate was determined with a γ-counter (COBRA II, Packard Instrument Co.), and the protein concentration was determined. Kd values were determined by Scatchard analysis and expressed in nm using aMr = 350.000 for βVLDL. 293 cells expressing ApoER2Δ4-6 and ApoER2Δ4-6,8 and mock-transfected cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate buffer and incubated with conditioned media from reelin-expressing 293T cells as described (15D'Arcangelo G. Homayoundi R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In brief, 293T cells (60–80% confluent) were transfected with 7 μg of the reelin construct pCRL. The following day, the culture medium was replaced with a serum-reduced medium (Opti-MEM). After 2 more days the conditioned medium was collected and used for incubation of ApoER2-expressing cells. For ApoER2 expression, 293 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of ApoER2Δ4-6 and ApoER2Δ4-6,8 constructs. After 48 h the cells were harvested, washed once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 1 ml of the reelin supernatant at 4 °C for 4 h in the absence or presence of GST-RAP (30 μg/ml), EDTA (20 mm), or β-VLDL (50 μg/ml). CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The cells were washed 2× with 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 50 μl buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and proteinase inhibitors. After 30 min lysis on ice, the cell extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. 6–10 μl of the supernatant was loaded on a 7.5% gel. Transfer to nitrocellulose was done as described previously (16Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The blot was incubated for 3 h with G10 antibody (provided by Dr. Andre Goffinet, Namur Med. School, Namur, Belgium) at a concentration of 1:1000. Goat anti-mouse HRP was used as a secondary antibody at a concentration of 1:10,000. The blots were developed using an ECL kit. Alternatively, reelin binding to both splice variants of the receptor was tested by a cell-independent assay described by Hiesberger et al. (16Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). For this assay, cDNAs coding for the ligand binding domains of ApoER2Δ4-6 and ApoER2Δ4-6,8, respectively, were amplified by PCR using the respective full-length cDNAs as templates and fused to the constant human IgG domain as described (16Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) resulting in ApoER2Δ4-6-Fc and ApoER2Δ4-6,8-Fc. Recombinant fusion proteins were expressed in 293 cells, and the secreted proteins (1 ml of cell supernatant) were bound to protein-A Sepharose (30 μl slurry) as described. The protein-A Sepharose was then incubated with 500 μl of conditioned media from reelin-expressing 293T cells in the presence of 30 μg/ml RAP-GST or 20 mm EDTA or medium for 4 h at 4 °C. Detection of bound reelin was performed as described (16Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) using G10 as primary antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP as second antibody. The amounts of receptor-Fc fusion proteins present on the blot were analyzed by Western blotting using an HRP-coupled anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). When we reported the cDNA cloning of chicken LR8B, we also presented the amino acid sequence derived from a partial cDNA for the corresponding murine homologue (4Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of that cDNA defined the carboxyl-terminal part of the last LA-binding repeat of the mouse receptor. By using this sequence information for RT-PCR experiments, we were able to assign this sequence to repeat number 7 of a mouse variant of LR7/8B that lacks repeat 8 due to differential splicing (5Brandes C. Novak S. Stockinger W. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Genomics. 1997; 42: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By using two rounds of 5′-RACE, we now have obtained the full-length cDNA for mouse ApoER2 (Fig.1). As outlined below, the murine receptor appears to be a highly heterogeneous family of proteins due to multiple alternative splicing events. Therefore we refer to the murine protein as apoER2 as originally suggested for the human protein by Yamamoto and colleagues (6Kim D.-H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.-J. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8373-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). According to the rule of Van Heijne (33Heijne G.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar), we assigned the cleavage site for the signal peptide to amino acids 28/29, producing a mature receptor in which the first LA repeat is 7 amino acids longer than that of human apoER2 and 8 amino acids longer than that of chicken LR7/8B. Surprisingly, the murine cDNA codes for a receptor harboring only 5 LA repeats. Upon computer-assisted sequence alignment (Geneworks) with human apoER2 and chicken LR8B, it became evident that repeats 4–6 are missing from this transcript. As reported recently, such a variant does exist for human ApoER2 (7Kim D.-H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C. Kim H.-J. Suzuki H. Fujita T. Endo Y. Saeki S. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8498-8504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cloned murine transcript contains the eighth repeat but not a 13-amino acid insertion that harbors a furin consensus cleavage site at its carboxyl-terminal end. Alternative transcripts containing such an insertion exist in man and mice but not in chicken (5Brandes C. Novak S. Stockinger W. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J.

https://openalex.org/W2134564787,"We recently identified conformational changes that occur upon phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) that preclude efficient cross-linking of actin filaments (Bubb, M. R., Lenox, R. H., and Edison, A. S. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36472–36478). These results implied that the phosphorylation site domain of MARCKS has two actin-binding sites. We now present evidence for the existence of two actin-binding sites that not only mutually compete but also specifically compete with the actin-binding proteins thymosin β4 and actobindin to bind to actin. The effects of substitution of alanine for phenylalanine within a repeated hexapeptide segment suggest that the noncharged region of the domain contributes to binding affinity, but the binding affinity of peptides corresponding to each binding site has a steep dependence on salt concentration, consistent with presumed electrostatic interactions between these polycationic peptides and the polyanionic N terminus of actin. Phosphorylation decreases the site-specific affinity by no more than 0.7 kcal/mol, which is less than the effect of alanine substitution. However, phosphorylation has a much greater effect than alanine substitution on the loss of actin filament cross-linking activity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the compact structure resulting from conformational changes due to phosphorylation, in addition to modest decreases in site-specific affinity, explains the loss of cross-linking activity in phosphorylated MARCKS.

Dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is a requisite for the morphological changes that occur at synaptic junctions as a result of learning and development (1Krucker T. Siggins G.R. Halpain S.

While several actin-binding proteins have been identified that may contribute to the alteration of cytoskeletal dynamics that occurs during synapse maturation, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)1 has demonstrablein vitro and in vivo properties that correlate with known signaling events and observed alterations in structural plasticity (5Laux T.

In the nonphosphorylated state, MARCKS cross-links actin filaments and localizes to the plasma membrane of neuronal dendrites in culture, features that would be expected to contribute to membrane stability in the quiescent neuron (7Lu D. Yang H. Lenox R.H. Raizada M.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A.

Repetitive stimulation activates protein kinase C and phosphorylates MARCKS, coincident with membrane reorganization into dynamic pre- and postsynaptic filopodial structures (10Scholz W.K. Palfrey H.C. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2422-2432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Angenstein F. Buchner K. Staak S. Hippocampus. 1999; 9: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Corresponding to this change in cytoskeletal function, phosphorylated MARCKS neither efficiently cross-links actin nor localizes to plasma membrane (6Ohmori S. Sakai N. Shirai Y. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Shimizu N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26449-26457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Lu D. Yang H. Lenox R.H. Raizada M.K. J.

Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the actin filament cross-linking activity of MARCKS, we have identified and biophysically characterized two actin-binding sites within the 25-amino acid basic phosphorylation site domain (PSD). This domain not only interacts with actin but also can bind to plasma membrane or to calmodulin. Our previous studies (12Bubb M.R. Lenox R.H. Edison A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36472-36478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that nonphosphorylated MARCKS PSD is a monomeric, extended rod, with no significant helical structure. Phosphorylated MARCKS PSD, in contrast, has a more compact conformation. These differences result from the partial neutralization of polycationic charges at each end of the PSD by phosphate. Since phosphorylated MARCKS PSD did not cross-link actin filaments as well as nonphosphorylated MARCKS PSD, we speculated that either steric and ionic effects of phosphorylation resulted in a loss of site-specific affinity at either of two postulated actin-binding sites or that the conformation changes in the PSD resulted in a dynamic structure that had an inaccessible actin-binding site. In the current work, we recognize that this dichotomy could be incomplete and, indeed, present evidence that this is the case. Moreover, the constraints imposed by conformation could be less restrictive than previously speculated. For example, perhaps a change in orientation of the two binding sites due to phosphorylation could disrupt cooperative or localizing interactions between MARCKS and F-actin, without an actual change in the stoichiometry of interaction. Conformational regulation of the cytoskeletal dynamics by nonglobular proteins such as MARCKS has ample precedent. Various microtubule-associated proteins bind to and cross-link actin, and like MARCKS PSD, this activity is inhibited by phosphorylation (13Selden S.C. Pollard T.D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 466: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These microtubule-associated proteins, like MARCKS, appear to be loosely folded proteins in solution that may change conformation on binding to tubulin or actin (14Woody R.W. Clark D.C. Roberts G.C.K. Martin S.R. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Synapsins are a family of synaptic vesicle phosphoproteins that cross-link and bundle F-actin. Phosphorylation of synapsin I induces major conformational changes in the molecule and simultaneously abolishes actin bundling activity (15Valtorta F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7195-7198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synapsin I, like the actin-binding proteins thymosin β4 and actobindin, has little or no secondary structure by circular dichroism in aqueous buffers (but does fold into more extensive α-helix in trifluoroethanol) (16Ho M.F. Bahler M. Czernik A.J. Schielbler W. Kezdy F.J. Kaiser E.T. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5600-5607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Safer D. Sosnick T.R. Elzinga M.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12801-12805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the conformational changes we have observed in MARCKS PSD are probably representative of an important mechanism to regulate actin dynamics and neuroplasticity. This idea is consistent with the paradigm proposed by Wright and Dyson (19Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2348) Google Scholar) that unfolded, nonglobular proteins control key regulatory checkpoints. Several polycationic ligands have been previously shown to bind to actin (20Griffith L.M. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9135-9142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polycationic segments of the MARCKS PSD have been assumed to contribute to the affinity of this ligand for actin, and like other polycationic actin-binding domains such as that of myosin (21Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), this region may interact with the highly charged N terminus of actin (22Tang J.X. Janmey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8556-8563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Specificity of binding is probably the result of additional interactions between spatially distinct regions, and in the case of MARCKS, we have identified a hexapeptide that is repeated in both the N- and C-terminal halves of the PSD. In the current work, we show that nonionic characteristics of this hexapeptide contribute to actin binding activity. The specificity of MARCKS-actin interactions is further supported by the finding that certain, but not all, actin-binding proteins compete with MARCKS peptides for actin. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from frozen muscle (Pel-Freez, Rogers AR) in buffer G (5.0 mmTris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.8) (24Kang F.

Peptides were covalently modified with fluorophores while still bound to resin, and in the case of N-terminal fluorophores, these are exclusively α-amino modifications. The peptides were purified by HPLC and then shown to be greater than 96% labeled by analytical HPLC and mass spectroscopy. Concentrations of proteins and peptides were confirmed by amino acid analysis. Latrunculin A (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were stored as concentrated stock solutions in Me2SO at −80 °C.

Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using absorption optics with data collected at 535 nm (the absorption maximum for rhodamine-labeled MARCKS peptides) in a Beckman XLA centrifuge. All samples contained 3.5 μm labeled MARCKS peptide and variable amounts of unlabeled Ca2+-actin (4.0 or 20 μm). Samples of 110 μl in buffer G (except 40 mm KCl and 10 μm ATP) reached equilibrium in 48 h at 14,400 r.p.m. (after initially overspeeding to 15,000) at 4 °C. Buffer density was determined by pycnometry, and partial specific volumes were as previously reported for actin or calculated from the amino acid sequence for MARCKS (27Kirschner M.W. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1900-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). With no actin present, the data (expressed as concentration as a function of radius) were compared with that predicted by the Svedberg equation assuming a mass calculated from the sequence of the MARCKS peptide. For experiments employing full-length PSD peptide, the actin concentration was 20 μm, and the data were fit so as to test the assumption that peptide was saturated by actin. In this case, the apparent molecular weight of the peptide is that of peptide plus any bound actin, and specific hypotheses tested included saturation of peptide with either one or two actin subunits. With saturating actin at 20 μm, the samples also contained 24 μm latrunculin A to ensure that the actin did not polymerize. Anisotropy experiments mentioned below provided evidence that latrunculin A does not affect actin-MARCKS interactions. When the actin concentration was not saturating (4.0 μm), then the gradient was analyzed assuming that equilibrium binding conditions were satisfied at all radii (as is appropriate for a sector-shaped cell) according to a previously described method of implicit constraints (28Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments were the source of the equilibrium dissociation constants listed in Table II. In brief, at 535 nm only labeled MARCKS has a measurable extinction coefficient. The other sample components are invisible. Therefore, at this wavelength, the optical density at any radius is directly proportional to the sum of the concentration of all allowable MARCKS species (assuming, for example, 1:1 stoichiometry, these would include MARCKS and MARCKS plus one actin subunit). Curve fitting is constrained by the initial concentration of all components, and the fitting parameters include only Kd, the dissociation constant for MARCKS peptide and actin, and the concentration of each component at an arbitrary radius, rb (28Bubb M.R. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3820-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Error estimates were based on an analysis of the sum of squares of deviations as a function of Kd (29Lewis M.S. Shrager R. Kim S. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation.

Open table in a new tab The use of a buffer with low ATP concentration is necessitated by the tendency of the full-length PSD peptide to aggregate at higher concentrations of ATP (e.g. 0.1 mm). Aggregation is slow, requiring more than 2 h at room temperature to produce significant deviation from monomers. Both unlabeled and labeled peptides are soluble to more than 5 mm in the absence of ATP, and although the unanticipated aggregation was discovered only because of the formation of a colored precipitate for labeled PSD, both labeled and unlabeled peptides show similar extents of aggregation by sedimentation equilibrium (data not shown). Aggregation was not observed when actin is added to MARCKS simultaneously with the addition of ATP. Data were collected on a Photon Technology International (South Brunswick, NJ) spectrofluorimeter. Tetramethylrhodamine-labeled peptides were excited with vertically polarized light at 552 nm. The horizontal, (Ih) and vertical (Iv) components of the emitted light were measured at 577 nm for ∼20 s for each component. The fluorescence anisotropy, f, is calculated as follows: f = (Iv −GIh)/ (Iv + 2GIh). The G factor was determined for the peptide in solution excited with horizontally polarized light and averaged over ∼100 measurements. The total intensity of the labeled peptide fluorescence, Iv + 2GIhdid not change significantly upon actin binding, and the observed anisotropy was therefore assumed to be a linear function of the fraction of peptide bound to actin. The experiments were performed in 0.3-ml samples in glass cuvettes with 0 or 40 mm KCl in Mg2+-G (buffer G in which Ca2+-actin has been converted to Mg2+-actin by the addition of 125 μm EGTA and 50 μm MgCl2 10 min prior to the experiment) to measure binding to G-actin or in Mg2+-F-buffer (buffer G in which the actin was first converted to Mg2+-actin and then 10 min later polymerized by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2.0 mm) to measure binding to F-actin. For direct binding assays at a peptide concentration of 0.35 or 2.0 μm, anisotropy was measured as a function of actin subunit concentration. For competition assays, the direct binding assay is used to determine a nonsaturating amount of actin that will bind about two-thirds of the labeled peptide, and the anisotropy is measured as a function of concentration of competing substance. Because polycations have been previously reported to stimulate actin polymerization, assays involving full-length PSD and G-actin were repeated in the presence of saturating amounts of latrunculin A, after first determining that latrunculin A had no effect on the assay, i.e. did not compete with or augment actin-MARCKS interactions as determined by anisotropy. Fitting parameters for assays of direct binding of labeled MARCKS peptide to actin included the equilibrium dissociation constant for labeled peptide and actin and the terms rf, the anisotropy of free peptide and rb, the anisotropy of the complex of labeled peptide with G- or F-actin. Data from competitive binding assays were evaluated with fixedrf, rb, and Kdas determined from a direct binding assay and fit only for the equilibrium dissociation constant for competing substance and actin. The data were analyzed as previously described (25Yarmola E.G. Thayumanasamy S. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), assuming only that the concentration of free labeled peptide, [L], and unlabeled peptide [P] satisfy the relation, [L]/KdL ≪ (1 + [P]/KdP), where KdLand KdP are the respective equilibrium dissociation constants for labeled and unlabeled peptide-actin complex. In some cases, additional iterations were added to the fitting algorithm to ensure accuracy. To make the fit more robust, in some competition experiments data were collected at more than one concentration of actin, and all data were fit simultaneously. Representative experiments were performed in triplicate, and these results were used to generate error estimates. For experiments involving full-length MARCKS PSD, the data were fit assuming the presence of two binding sites with site-specific affinity determined as above. Bound fluorescently labeled peptide was assumed to have the same anisotropy, rb, independent of which and how many sites were occupied. In this case, these binding constants were fixed, and the data were fit to an additional parameter, φ, the ratio of equilibrium dissociation constants for binding at one site relative to that for the same site when the other site is occupied. This additional parameter describes either cooperative interactions between the two sites, in which case positive cooperativity is indicated by φ greater than 1, or instances in which φ is greater than 1 because of localization of binding sites (i.e. where binding results in a higher local concentration of ligand than that found in a dispersed solution) (30Minton A.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 19: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a bivalent PSD might bind to two contiguous subunits on an actin filament with no alteration in site-specific Kd, in which case localization of the second binding site by occupancy of the first would result in φ greater than 1. Similarly, cross-linking of actin filaments by one MARCKS peptide could increase the local concentration of available binding sites for the second binding site ofother MARCKS peptides bound to the cross-linked filaments. A 20 μm stock of actin was converted to Mg2+-actin as before and was polymerized by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2.0 mm. In some cases, jasplakinolide was added at a ratio of 1:3 with actin, a sufficient amount to lower the critical concentration to very close to zero. Peptide affinity for actin was measured using centrifugation conditions that pellet F-actin plus bound peptide but not free peptide. Labeled peptides (6 μm) were pelleted with various concentrations of F-actin in Mg2+-F-buffer with 20 mm KCl and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 150,000 × g. The supernatants were compared for relative fluorescence intensity (345-nm excitation, 388-nm emission for pyrene-labeled peptide; 553-nm excitation, 574-nm emission for rhodamine-labeled peptide). The fraction of specifically bound peptide was calculated by comparison with an unspun control. Data were fit assuming a single binding site. For curve fitting purposes, it is convenient to switch the dependent and independent variable and fit the function, At =Pt × Fb + Kd× Fb/(1 − Fb), wherePt is the total peptide, At is the total actin, and Fb is the fraction of peptide bound.

NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). In our previous work (12Bubb M.R. Lenox R.H. Edison A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36472-36478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we showed that when MARCKS and actin are mixed at a ratio of 1:2, the gradient obtained by sedimentation equilibrium deviates from that of monomeric actin, implying that MARCKS PSD induces an aggregated state of actin. The data were consistent with the formation of a small amount of dimer, but other states of oligomerization could not be excluded. Now we have used rhodamine-labeled MARCKS PSD to make a highly sensitive technique for detection of specific actin oligomers. When fluorescently labeled MARCKS PSD is mixed with unlabeled actin, the optical absorbance of the label as measured by sedimentation equilibrium reflects only the apparent molecular weight of the PSD. Thus, by adding saturating amounts of actin (invisible at 540 nm), the stoichiometry of interaction is shown to be two actin per PSD (Fig.1). The labeled PSD, by itself, is shown to be monomeric. Given the presence of two binding sites on the PSD, two observations enabled us to select likely portions of the PSD that would bind actin. First, since polycations are known ligands of actin (20Griffith L.M. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9135-9142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both polycationic termini of the PSD were probably contributing to the interaction. Second, we observed that the mouse PSD sequence contained an identically repeated hexapeptide, FSFKKS, at residues 151–156 and 162–167, and this hexapeptide resembles the VTVKKV segment that contributes to the actin-binding activity of Acanthamoeba actobindin (35Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Bubb M.R. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15427-15431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides synthesized to facilitate identification of the actin-binding sites on MARCKS are shown and named in Table I. The N-terminal and C-terminal PSD peptides each contain both the hexapeptide motif and a polycationic region. Representative equilibrium binding data from sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 1), fluorescence anisotropy (Fig. 2), and F-actin pelleting (Fig. 3) assays are shown. The results of these quantitative assays are summarized in TableII. Competitive binding anisotropy assays employing unlabeled peptides yield systematically lower affinity than direct binding assays of labeled peptides (Fig. 2), suggesting that the label is not completely inert but may contribute to binding. Perhaps these bulky hydrophobic labels serve to replace the loss of phenylalanine in the intact PSD. The competitive binding assays allow for direct comparison of un"

The enzyme is a glycosylated membrane-bound protein that has proved difficult to purify in an active state. Extracted enzyme typically loses the reductase properties seen in intact cells and shows principally dehydrogenase activity. The C-terminal catalytic domain is known to contain a disulfide bond and is located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, anchored to the membrane by a single N-terminal transmembrane domain. We report here the functional expression of the catalytic domain of the human enzyme, without the transmembrane domain and the extreme N terminus, inEscherichia coli. Moderate levels of soluble active protein were obtained using an N-terminal fusion with thioredoxin and a 6xHis tag. In contrast, the inclusion of a 6xHis tag at the C terminus adversely affected protein solubility and activity. However, the highest levels of active protein were obtained using a construct expressing the untagged catalytic domain. Nonreducing electrophoresis revealed the presence of both monomeric and dimeric disulfide bonded forms; however, mutation of a nonconserved cysteine residue resulted in a recombinant protein with no intermolecular disulfide bonds but full enzymatic activity. Using the optimal combination of plasmid construct and E. coli host strain, the recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by single step affinity chromatography. The purified protein possessed both dehydrogenase and reductase activities with a K m of 1.4 μm for cortisol and 9.5 μm for cortisone. This study indicates that glycosylation, the N-terminal region including the transmembrane helix, and intermolecular disulfide bonds are not essential for enzyme activity and that expression in bacteria can provide active recombinant protein for future structural and functional studies. 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 catalyzes the conversion of cortisone to hormonally active cortisol and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of disorders including insulin resistance and obesity.

The 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 isozymes share only 14‥ identity and are separate gene products with different physiological roles, regulation, and tissue distribution (1Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). 11β-HSD2 is a high affinity NAD-dependent dehydrogenase that protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from glucocorticoid excess; mutations in the HSD11B2 gene explain an inherited form of hypertension, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess in which cortisol acts as a potent mineralocorticoid (2Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Gupta A. Milford D.V. Howie A.J. Sheppard M.C. Whorwood C.B. Lancet. 1996; 347: 88-91Abstract PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). By contrast, 11β-HSD1 is a relatively low affinity NADP-dependent enzyme that acts predominantly as a reductase in vivo, although extracted enzyme typically shows predominant dehydrogenase activity (3Tannin G.M. Agarwal A.K. Monder C. New M.I. White P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16653-16658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By converting cortisone to cortisol, 11β-HSD1 facilitates glucocorticoid hormone action in key target tissues such as liver and adipose tissue, and as such has been implicated in a number of disorders including insulin resistance and central obesity (4Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lancet. 1997; 349: 1210-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar).11β-HSD1 is a member of the short chain alcohol dehydrogenase family, also known as the short chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs). SDRs typically exhibit residue identities only at the 15–30‥ level, indicative of early duplicatory origins and extensive divergence (6Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzales-Duarte J.J. Gosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 7Krozowski Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

However, in contrast to other SDR members, 11β-HSD1 is unusual in possessing a single transmembrane helix at the N terminus. This is intrinsic to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, with a short 5-amino acid N-terminal region on the cytosolic side and the main catalytic domain of the protein facing the lumen of the ER (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The importance of the transmembrane domain on 11β-HSD1 activity has been studied but with inconclusive results. An N-terminally truncated variant of rat 11β-HSD1 was expressed in COS cells and reported to be inactive (11Obeid J. Curnow K.M. Aisenberg J. White P.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Mercer W. Obeyesekere V. Smith R. Krozowski Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 92: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this construct encoded a protein that had lost more than just the transmembrane helix and therefore may have lost vital parts of the enzymatic domain. In addition, because the expression studies were performed in COS and Chinese hamster ovary cells, the truncated protein would have been targeted (because of the lack of signal sequence) to the cytosol and not the ER. The lumen of the ER promotes the formation of disulfide bonds, and studies have indicated that there are important intrachain disulfide bonds within the 11β-HSD1 protein (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The catalytic domain is glycosylated (13Blum A. Martin H.-J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Agarwal A.K. Tusie-Luna M.T. Monder C. White P.C. Mol.

Acta. 1995; 1248: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with a lumenal orientation. Experiments to resolve the importance of glycosylation have also yielded varying results. Enzymatic deglycosylation of rabbit (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and human (13Blum A. Martin H.-J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) 11β-HSD1 has indicated that glycosylation is not important for enzyme activity. However, partial inhibition of glycosylation of the rat enzyme by tunicamycin decreased dehydrogenase activity but not reductase activity (14Agarwal A.K. Tusie-Luna M.T. Monder C. White P.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1827-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and mutation of the rat (15Agarwal A.K. Mune T. Monder C. White P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and human (13Blum A. Martin H.-J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) sequences at putativeN-glycosylation sites resulted in reduced or abolished activity.Expression of human (and squirrel monkey) clones of 11β-HSD1 has been achieved in COS cells (11Obeid J. Curnow K.M. Aisenberg J. White P.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Mercer W. Obeyesekere V. Smith R. Krozowski Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 92: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), HEK cells (16Bujalska I. Shimojo M. Howie A. Stewart P.M. Steroids. 1997; 77: 77-82Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the yeastPichia pastoris (13Blum A. Martin H.-J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Blum A. Martin H. Maser E. Toxicology. 2000; 144: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using a variety of vectors. This has led to ambiguous kinetic results with over 10-fold variation inK m values and often significant differences in activity between whole cells and lysates. These systems have not yielded large amounts of pure recombinant protein, and no structural information has come from them. Overexpression of 11β-HSD1 in bacterial cells has been reported (17Blum A. Martin H. Maser E. Toxicology. 2000; 144: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the resulting protein was inactive. Failure to obtain activity was attributed to either insolubility of the protein, and subsequent refolding problems, or a lack of glycosylation. In this study we sought to maximize the production of soluble recombinant human 11β-HSD1 withinEscherichia coli by varying the expression construct, the host strain, and the incubation conditions. In particular, because 11β-HSD1 is thought to contain disulfide bonds, we have assessed the value of E. coli strains that promote disulfide bond formation within the cytoplasm of the bacterium through mutations in the genes encoding thioredoxin reductase and/or glutathione reductase. We also tested the effect of thioredoxin fusions, histidine tags, glycosylation status, the presence of the transmembrane domain, and mutation of a nonconserved cysteine residue on the activity of human 11β-HSD1. Through these measures, we arrived at an optimal construct and E. coli host combination for producing sufficient protein for purification.DISCUSSION11-β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity was first documented in the rat liver in the 1950s, but it was the studies of Tanninet al. (3Tannin G.M. Agarwal A.K. Monder C. New M.I. White P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16653-16658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that resulted in the enzymatic characterization, purification, and cloning of the liver-type 11β-HSD isozyme. With the cloning of a second “kidney-type” 11β-HSD isozyme, the liver-type isozyme is now termed 11β-HSD1.The importance of these isozymes in the metabolism and clearance of glucocorticoids is well established; in addition, these enzymes are intricately involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases. For example, 11β-HSD2 is implicated in hypertension and fetal growth retardation (1Stewart P.M. Krozowski Z.S. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 57: 249-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Specifically, for 11β-HSD1, emerging data have highlighted the role of this enzyme in modulating insulin sensitivity and visceral adiposity. Thus mice lacking the HSD11B1gene are resistant to hyperglycemia of stress/feeding because of a failure to activate glucocorticoid within the liver and stimulate gluconeogenesis (4Kotelevtsev Y. Holmes M.C. Burchell A. Houston P.M. Schmoll D. Jamieson P. Best R. Brown R. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. Mullins J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 23: 14924-14929Crossref Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Improvements in insulin sensitivity in normal volunteers given the 11β-HSD1 inhibitor carbenoxolone support such a concept (27Walker B.R. Connacher A.A. Lindsay R.M. Webb D.J. Edwards C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3155-3159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly in visceral adipose tissue, 11β-HSD1 acts locally to generate active glucocorticoid concentrations, thereby stimulating adipogenesis (5Bujalska I.J. Kumar S. Stewart P.M. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1210-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 28Bujalska I.J. Kumar S. Hewison M. Stewart P.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3188-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defect in the activity of 11β-HSD1 is also thought to underpin an inherited form of polycystic ovary syndrome, the syndrome of apparent cortisone reductase deficiency (29Phillipov G. Palermo M. Shackleton C.H.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3855-3860Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, further studies are investigating the role of the enzyme in central nervous system tissues and its relationship to neurodegenerative diseases (30Rajan V. Edwards C.R. Seckl J.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 65-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In each case though, the exciting concept has emerged that modulation of 11β-HSD1 expression may represent a novel mechanism to modulate glucocorticoid action at the tissue level without changing circulating concentrations, thereby precipitating states of glucocorticoid excess or deficiency. Thus there is a clear clinical need to undertake a detailed characterization of the human 11β-HSD1 isozyme with a view to its purification.11β-HSD1 belongs to the SDR superfamily, as defined on the basis of an N-terminal nucleotide binding motif, a central active site, and consensus sequence data. Sophisticated analytical approaches suggest that there are over 1000 members of this superfamily (6Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzales-Duarte J.J. Gosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 7Krozowski Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Jornvall H. Hoog J.O. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), with only one residue (Tyr) being strictly conserved. A lysine 4 residues downstream and a serine 14 residues upstream are also largely conserved; all these residues are present in 11β-HSD1. A model for catalysis of SDRs has been proposed on the basis of these residues (31Tanabe T. Tanaka N. Uchikawa K. Kabashima T. Ito K. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Tsuru M. Yoshimoto T.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 124: 634-641Google Scholar). Binding of the coenzyme, NAD(H) or NADP(H), is in the N-terminal part of the molecule involving a common protein folding arrangement of α- and β-strands (“Rossmann” fold) associated with a common Gly(Xaa)3GlyXaaGly motif (also found in 11β-HSD1). The critically important tyrosine seems to maintain a fixed position relative to the scaffolding of the Rossmann fold and the cofactor position, whereas the substrate-binding pocket alters in such a way that the dehydrogenation/reduction reaction site is brought into bonding distance of the tyrosine hydroxyl group. The tyrosine therefore acts as a basic catalyst, the lysine binds to NAD/P(H) and lowers the pK a value of the tyrosine, and the serine plays a subsidiary role of stabilizing substrate binding (31Tanabe T. Tanaka N. Uchikawa K. Kabashima T. Ito K. Nonaka T. Mitsui Y. Tsuru M. Yoshimoto T.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 124: 634-641Google Scholar, 32Tanaka N. Nonaka T. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Tsuru D. Mitsui Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 18: 7715-7730Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Several groups have evaluated the importance of the N-terminal domain of 11β-HSD1. Recently it has been shown that the orientation of the enzyme within the ER is determined by sequences close to the N terminus (10Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins where the N-terminal regions, including the membrane anchors, of the 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 enzymes were exchanged adopted inverted orientations in the ER membrane (10Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Neither protein was catalytically active. However, mutation of a single lysine residue close to the N terminus of type 1 resulted in an inverted orientation without loss of activity. These results suggest that the N-terminal anchor is required for both activity and correct orientation, although it should be noted that the sequences exchanged in the chimeras included much more than just the transmembrane helix. Mercer et al. (12Mercer W. Obeyesekere V. Smith R. Krozowski Z. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 92: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that expression of an N-terminally truncated 11β-HSD1 did not produce a soluble protein. However, these studies and others have employed mammalian expression systems where such constructs would not be appropriately targeted to the ER, and hence correct folding and disulfide bond formation may not have been facilitated.In this study, using a series of bacterial expression constructs, we have shown that the activity of human 11β-HSD1 does not depend on the N-terminal domain. Constructs where the N-terminal region had been removed (pET32CD and pET21CD) exhibited higher levels of expression and activity than constructs containing the entire 11β-HSD1 sequence. Moreover, inclusion of the transmembrane domain, either with or without the thioredoxin fusion partner, failed to produce soluble active protein. This is in agreement with a study carried out by Blum et al. (13Blum A. Martin H.-J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in which the complete human 11β-HSD1 sequence was expressed in E. coli and resulted in a protein that was virtually insoluble, difficult to purify, and completely inactive.We also investigated expression systems in which thioredoxin, the product of the E. coli TrxA gene (25LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M.A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), was a fusion partner. In many cases heterologous proteins produced as thioredoxin fusion proteins are correctly folded and display full biological activity (25LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M.A. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar,33Morris J.C. Neben S. Bennett F. Finnerty H. Long A. Beier D.R. Kovacic S. McCoy J.M.

Appl. Biochem. 2000; 31: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This has been thought to be caused by the small, highly soluble nature of thioredoxin, which also has robust folding characteristics (36Homlgrem A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our study proteins produced as a fusion with thioredoxin at the N terminus (pET32CD and pET32FL) showed no overall increase in the levels of soluble protein when compared with nonfusion constructs (pET21CD and pET21CDH), indicating that such fusions are not always profitable. Similarly, fusion of a 6xHis tag at the C terminus, as a means to simplify purification, was also detrimental to the solubility, and particularly the activity, of the enzyme. Residues close to the C terminus of SDRs may frequently be important in substrate binding (37Duax W.L. Ghosh D. Pletnev V. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 121-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modifications in this region may thus affect protein structure to the detriment of enzyme activity.This study also clearly resolves the issue of whether glycosylation is required for the activity of the human enzyme. Studies on the rat 11β-HSD1 enzyme indicated that partial inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin inhibited dehydrogenase activity by 50‥ but had no effect on reductase activity (14Agarwal A.K. Tusie-Luna M.T. Monder C. White P.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1827-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the first of two potential N-glycosylation sites reduced dehydrogenase and reductase activities by 75 and 50‥, respectively, whereas mutagenesis of the second site completely abolished activity (15Agarwal A.K. Mune T. Monder C. White P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Conversely, studies carried out on the rabbit enzyme, which like the human homologue contains three potential glycosylation sites, suggest that glycosylation is not important for enzyme activity. No alteration in activity could be observed after complete deglycosylation of rabbit 11β-HSD1 (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conflicting studies on the human enzyme have also been reported. Recently, human 11β-HSD1 has been expressed in E. coli, where the biosynthesis of N-linked glycoproteins does not occur. This resulted in a recombinant protein that was completely devoid of enzyme activity (17Blum A. Martin H. Maser E. Toxicology. 2000; 144: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The same group also investigated the effects of deglycosylation on human 11β-HSD1 purified from liver and recombinant protein produced by the yeastP. pastoris (13Blum A. Martin H.-J. Maser E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the three potential glycosylation sites yielded an inactive protein from yeast cells as assessed using metyrapone and metyrapol as the substrates. However, the enzyme purified from human liver, upon complete deglycosylation, remained fully active. The results here agree with the latter experiment and clearly show that nonglycosylated enzymatically active 11β-HSD1 can be generated within E. coli, with the recombinant enzyme possessing both reductase and dehydrogenase activities with similar kinetic properties to those reported previously from mammalian expression systems. Glycosylation is therefore not required for activity or protein folding, although it could still be important for protein stability within the endoplasmic reticulum.All the constructs used in this study gave only moderate levels of soluble protein but a high proportion of protein in an insoluble form. The lack of protein solubility in E. coli is a complex event with many contributing factors. Although fusion with heterologous proteins may sometimes help to redress many solubility problems, another factor that may be important is the inability of the recombinant protein to form key disulfide bonds in the reducing environment of the bacterial cytoplasm (38Derman A.I. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7719-7722Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rabbit 11β-HSD1 is known to contain an intrachain disulfide bond (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and therefore we investigated the expression levels and activity of our recombinant proteins in a variety of host E. coli strains, some of which have been developed to promote disulfide bond formation. WithinE. coli at least two systems are responsible for reducing disulfide bonds that form in the cytoplasm; the thioredoxin system that consists of thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin and the glutaredoxin system that includes glutathione reductase, glutathione, and glutaredoxins. We evaluated this using three separate E. coli strains. It was anticipated that disulfide bonds, and therefore solubility and activity of the soluble protein, would be enhanced by the use of AD494(DE3) and particularly the Origami(DE3) strain. In effect, the reverse was observed with the highest levels of soluble protein and enzyme activity being observed using BL21(DE3) as the host strain. This result could imply that the intramolecular disulfide bond observed in the rabbit 11β-HSD1 protein (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) is not present in the human enzyme, although this awaits experimental confirmation.We also tested for the presence of interchain disulfide bonds by probing Western blots of SDS-PAGE gels of bacterial lysates run under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. Both dimer and monomer bands were identified in the nonreducing lanes, suggesting that some of the recombinant protein exists in an interchain disulfide-bonded form. Examination of human liver extracts indicated that the native 11β-HSD1 enzyme existed in a similar combination of monomeric and dimeric forms, proving that the heterogeneity was not a consequence of expression in the bacterial system. However, this heterogeneity not only complicates the purification of 11β-HSD1, as has been noted previously for native enzyme (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but could also hinder crystallographic analysis because crystal growth requires pure protein in a homogeneous form. Tests on extracts of mouse liver, however, detected no intermolecular disulfide bridges. Because previous reports also suggested that rabbit 11β-HSD1 contains no intermolecular disulfide bonds (9Ozols J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2305-2312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of mutating the additional cysteine (Cys-272), found only in the human sequence, to the corresponding residue from the most closely related 11β-HSD1 sequence (squirrel monkey). Expression of the resulting mutant (pET21CD-C272S) in the optimized bacterial expression system resulted in a protein with kinetic properties indistinguishable from the wild-type recombinant protein. However, nonreducing gels showed that the ability to form the interchain disulfide bonds had been abolished. Previous structural studies on other SDRs suggest that they exist naturally as nondisulfide-bonded dimers or tetramers (reviewed in Ref. 37Duax W.L. Ghosh D. Pletnev V. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 121-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results here suggest that Cys-272 of human 11β-HSD1 may be involved in disulfide bonds between adjacent polypeptide chains of the enzyme, possibly stabilizing the dimeric form. However, this property does not seem to be vital to the activity of the enzyme.Using a modified expression construct that included an N-terminal 6xHis tag, we developed a simple purification protocol that allowed 157-fold purification of recombinant human 11β-HSD1 in one step from crude cell lysates. The purified protein demonstrated activity in both dehydrogenase and reductase directions with K m values of 1.4 μm for cortisol and 9.5 μmfor cortisone.In conclusion this study has shown that, despite reports to the contrary, bacterial expression systems have the potential to produce active soluble 11β-HSD1 protein. The results also demonstrate conclusively that the N-terminal region, containing the transmembrane domain, glycosylation, and interchain disulfide bonds are not essential for the activity of this enzyme. For the first time, active soluble 11β-HSD1 has been produced in vitro and purified to apparent homogeneity. This will now allow detailed functional analysis of the enzyme using E. coli-produced protein and facilitate future structure/crystallographic studies. In mammalian tissues, two isozymes of 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD)1catalyze the interconversi"

DNA degradation is thought to be important for multicellular organisms to prevent oncogenic transformation or as a mechanism of viral defense. It has been reported that certain cells, including some neuroblastoma cell lines such as IMR-5, enter apoptosis without digesting DNA in such a way. We have analyzed the causes for the absence of DNA laddering in staurosporine-treated IMR-5 cells, and we have found that most of the molecular mechanisms controlling apoptosis are well preserved in this cell line. These include degradation of substrates for caspases, blockade of cell death by antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, or normal levels and adequate activation of caspase-3. Moreover, these cells display normal levels of caspase-activated DNase and its inhibitory protein, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, and their cDNA sequences are identical to those reported previously. Nevertheless, IMR-5 cells lose caspase-activated DNase during apoptosis and recover their ability to degrade DNA when human recombinant caspase-activated DNase is overexpressed. Our results lead to the conclusion that caspase-activated DNase is processed during apoptosis of IMR-5 cells, making these cells a good model to study the relevance of this endonuclease in physiological or pathological conditions.

Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholarand 2Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Apoptosis has also been involved as an important phenomenon in many different human diseases (reviewed in Ref. 3Fadeel B. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 699-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Shrinkage and fragmentation of the nucleus as well as the cell body and extensive degradation of chromosomal DNA are some of the most characteristic features of apoptosis (4Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6725) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation is a two-step process in which the DNA is first cleaved into 50–300-kilobase pair fragments (high molecular weight DNA degradation), that are subsequently degraded into smaller fragments of oligonucleosomal size (DNA ladder) (reviewed in Ref. 5Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is considered that only the high molecular weight DNA degradation is essential for cell death, because there are several cell types that never produce DNA ladders with treatments that induce the typical nuclear and cytoplasmatic changes of apoptosis. These cell types include the breast carcinoma-derived cell line MCF-7 (6Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar), the human androgen-independent prostatic cancer cell DU-145 (7Oberhammer F. Wilson J.W. Dive C.

Carson C. Ribecco M. Sikorska M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 48-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and some human neuroblastomas such as IMR-5 and IMR-32 (9Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, an endonuclease that is activated specifically by caspase-3 during apoptosis has been described in human and mouse. The human gene for this protein has been named caspase-activated nuclease (10Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or DFF40 (DNA fragmentationfactor, 40 kDa subunit) (11Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse homologue has been named caspase-activated DNase (CAD)1 (12Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). CAD is maintained inactive in the cytoplasm of normal cells because of its association with a protein that acts as a chaperone and inhibitor. This protein has been named the inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) in the mouse (13Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar) or DFF45 (DNA fragmentationfactor, 45 kDa subunit) in humans (14Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Here we will refer to it as ICAD. It has been demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of CAD is induced when caspase-3 cleaves ICAD at two specific aspartic residues (Asp117 and Asp224), thus releasing CAD (12Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar, 15McIlroy D. Sakahira H. Talanian R.V. Nagata S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4401-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Activated CAD degrades the DNA at the internucleosomal regions, and analysis of this DNA in agarose gels shows a characteristic ladder pattern (14Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). Although, caspase-3 seem necessary for the laddering degradation of DNA, it is considered that apoptotic cell death can proceed without caspase-3 in some cell types. For example, cells derived from caspase-3 −/− mice or cells defective in this caspase (MCF-7) die without displaying oligonucleosomal DNA degradation when treated with pro-apoptotic stimuli (6Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 16Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Moreover, several types of cells derived from the ICAD-deficient mice lack internucleosomal DNA degradation, although these mice do not show major defects in development (17Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Very little information exists about the cell death process without DNA fragmentation, but it is assumed that the oligonucleosomal DNA degradation confers some advantages to the organism. Thus, for example, it has been proposed that DNA degradation may minimize the risk of transferring oncogenes from a doomed cell to an adjacent healthy cell or to a phagocyte (18de la Taille A. Chen M.W. Burchardt M. Chopin D.K. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5461-5463PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has also been proposed that the failure to digest chromatin could be the basis for the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases in which antibodies against the heterochromatin are generated (19Herrmann M. Voll R.E. Zoller O.M. Hagenhofer M. Ponner B.B. Kalden J.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that human neuroblastoma IMR-5 does not show oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation nor condensation of nuclear chromatin into the rounded masses typical of apoptosis when cells were treated with staurosporine (STP) (9Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present report we have analyzed several regulatory mechanisms that control apoptosis in the IMR-5 cell line. We have not found major defects in caspase-3 protein levels or its protease activity, and caspase inhibitors or antiapoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL also block cell death. Moreover, ICAD or CAD protein levels are comparable with other cell lines that display oligonucleosomal degradation after induction of apoptosis, and the primary sequences of these two proteins are the same as that reported previously (GenBankTM accession numbers NM 004402 for CAD and NM 004401 for ICAD) (10Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, IMR-5 cells rapidly lose CAD during STP-induced apoptosis. We also observed that IMR-5 cells recover their ability to degrade DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments when engineered to overexpress mouse or human CAD, pointing out the importance of the relative levels of this nuclease. In conclusion, we demonstrate that processing of CAD could be a new regulatory step in the control of apoptosis and specifically during oligonucleosomal DNA degradation. Moreover, because the transgenic mouse with the deletion of the CAD gene is not currently available, IMR-5 cells could serve as an alternative model to test the relevance of oligonucleosomal degradation of DNA in normal cells or in pathological process such as viral infection. Human SH-SY5Y and IMR-5 cell lines employed in the present study were kindly provided by Dr. Dionisio Martı́n-Zanca (Salamanca, Spain). The cells were routinely grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks (Sarstedt, Newton, NC) containing 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). IMR-5 cells were grown in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, whereas SH-SY5Y cells were grown in 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Medium was routinely changed every 3 days. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturating humidity atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. For the different experiments, cells were grown at the adequate cell densities in culture dishes or multiwell plates (Corning, NY) using the same culture conditions as described above. MTT is a water-soluble tetrazolium salt that is reduced by metabolically viable cells to a colored, water-insoluble formazan salt. The procedure employed for this assay was the same as that described by Boix et al. (9Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For trypan blue staining, cells were seeded in 24-multiwell plates at 5 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h of seeding, cells were treated with STP at the adequate doses and times. Then cells were gently dissociated with a blue tip in their own culture medium, and a sample (100 μl) was taken and mixed with 20 μl of trypan blue solution (0.4%) (Sigma). Ten μl of the resulting cell suspension were counted with an hemocytometer. The results were expressed as percentages of trypan blue-stained cells over the total number of cells. Nuclear morphology was assessed by staining cells with the Hoechst 33258, which is also known as bisbenzimide ([2′-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole trihydrochloride]) as established in our laboratory (9Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The normal or apoptotic cell nuclei were visualized with an Olympus microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics under UV illumination. Control or STP-treated cells growing in 35-mm culture dishes (1 × 106 cells) were gently pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2). Fixation was performed with 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were rinsed twice with cold PBS, postfixed in buffered OsO4, dehydrated in graded acetone, and embedded in Durcupan ACM resin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections were obtained, mounted in copper grids, and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The specimens were observed with a Zeiss EM910 electron microscope. Cells grown in 35-mm culture dishes (1 × 106 cells) were collected in their culture medium, pelleted at 400 × g for 5 min, and rinsed twice with PBS. The pellet was homogenized in 600 μl of lysis buffer (0.5 m EDTA, 1% lauryl sarcosine, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.5) by pipetting through a blue cone. Homogenates were clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatants were collected to a new tube in which they were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) (Iberlabo, Madrid, Spain). DNA was precipitated with two volumes of cold ethanol and 0.5 volumes of 7.5 m ammonium acetate. Precipitated DNA was washed once in 70% ethanol and resuspended in 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing DNase-free RNase at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. DNA was analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel in 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6. Approximately 2 × 106 cells/condition were detached from the 60-mm culture dish, pelleted at 400 × g for 5 min, and washed twice with PBS. Then cells were lysed with 100 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF) for nuclear protein extracts or with Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmPMSF, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) for cytosolic protein extracts. The pellets were clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein in the supernatants was quantitated using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay, and 25–50 μg of protein were loaded in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were electrophoresed and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a semidry apparatus following the instructions of the supplier (Hoefer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then filters were reacted with the appropriate specific primary antibodies and incubated with the adequate secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma). Finally, immunoblots were developed with the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) for the detection of caspase-3 fragments and CAD and with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the rest. We developed a new method to quantify DEVD-directed caspase activity. The cells were grown onto 96-well multiplates at 4 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were treated with STP and then lysed by adding 1 volume of Ac-DEVD-afc lysis buffer 2-fold concentrated containing the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-afc (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA). Ac-DEVD-afc 2 × lysis buffer buffer is 40 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.2, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% CHAPS, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20% sucrose plus 50 μm of Ac-DEVD-afc. The plates were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C and then read in a Bio-Tek FL 600 fluorimeter (Izasa, Spain) at 360 nm (40 nm bandwidth) of excitation and 530 nm (25 nm bandwidth) of emission. For quantitative DEVD-like activity in cell lysates, cells were seeded onto 35-mm culture plates and, after treatment, were detached, washed twice with PBS, and lysed with Ac-DEVD-afc lysis buffer without the Ac-DEVD-afc. The supernatant was clarified by centrifuging at 13,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the protein was quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay Bradford-based method. Twenty-five μg of protein were added to 100 μl of the same lysis buffer containing 20 μm of Ac-DEVD-afc. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h and read with the fluorimeter. Nuclei were obtained as described previously (22Lazebnik Y.A. Cole S. Cooke C.A. Nelson W.G. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 7-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 23Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks, and 1 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 200 ×g for 5 min. After three washes with PBS and one with nuclei isolation buffer (NIB; 10 mm Pipes, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm cytochalasin B, 1 mm PMSF), cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of NIB and transferred to a Dounce-type homogenizer. Cells were swelled for 30 min at 4 °C and gently lysed with 25 strokes of the pestle. Then nuclei were layered over a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion in NIB and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed three times in NIB. Finally, nuclei were resuspended in nuclear storage buffer (10 mmPipes, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.2 mmspermine, 1 mm PMSF, 50% (v/v) glycerol) at 1 × 108 nuclei/ml and kept at −80 °C until used. Cytosolic extracts were obtained from cells treated with 100 nm of STP for 24 h or from control untreated cells. Cells were collected and centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and swelled at 4 °C for 15 min. The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatants were quantitated with Bio-Rad protein assay Bradford-based method. To reconstitute the system, cytosolic extracts and purified nuclei from the different conditions were adequately combined. Thus, 150 μg of protein from cytosolic extracts and 5 × 105 of nuclei were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a buffer containing an ATP-regenerating system (2 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase) and 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 mm of EDTA, and the DNA was extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and ethanol precipitation. DNA laddering was analyzed in a 1.8% agarose gel. One microgram of RNA from either IMR-5 or SH-SY5Y was treated with 2 units of DNase RNase-free (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was reverse transcribed using 10 pmol of the specific downstream primer (ICAD-R or CAD-R; see below) for 1 h at 42 °C. Approximately 10 ng of cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction in a PerkinElmer thermal cycler 2400 with 200 nm each primer. The polymerase chain reaction conditions were 94 °C for 20 s, 65 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 unit of DyNAzime-EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes). Primers used were CAD-F (TGCAATGCTCCAGAAGCCCAAGAGC) and CAD-R (TCACTGGCGTTTCCGCACAGGCTG), which amplify a band of 1120 base pairs corresponding to the whole open reading frame of CAD (GenBankTM accession number NM 004402); and ICAD-F (CGCTCCGGCCTCCCGCGACTTCTCG) and ICAD-R (GGCGTGAGCCACTGCGCCTGGCCAA), which cover a 1353-base pair region containing the ICAD open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number NM 004401). The polymerase chain reaction products were automatically sequenced in both direction in an ABI PRISM 310 automatic sequence analyzer (PerkinElmer). MTbcl-2TKNeo (24Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and pSFFVNeobcl-XL (25Benito A. Silva M. Grillot D. Nuñez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 3837-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmids have been described previously. DNA inserts were subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector. (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands). We also cloned ICAD and CAD full-length open reading frame sequence into the pcDNA3 vector. The constructs were named pcDNA3/bcl-2, pcDNA3/bcl-XL, pcDNA3/hCAD, and pcDNA3/hICADL. IMR-5 cells were transfected with different constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G-418 (geneticin) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were used as a pool. STP is an unspecific protein kinase inhibitor that has been widely used as a classic and potent inductor of apoptosis in many different cell types (26Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W.

In a previous report, we characterized STP-induced cell death in several human neuroblastoma cell lines (9Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and found two of them, IMR-5 and IMR-32, that underwent atypical apoptotic cell death. Here we further characterize this cell death to determine precisely which can be the alteration responsible of this phenotype. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma-derived cell line was used as a control. STP induces cell death with a similar dose-dependent profile in both cell lines as measured by MTT assay or trypan blue staining (Fig.1, A and B, respectively). Furthermore, for a given dose of STP (125 nm), the time course of cell death was comparable in both SH-SY5Y and IMR-5 cells, and about half the cells initially plated died after 12–18 h (Fig. 1 C). However, nuclear morphology and DNA laddering were two distinguishable features between these two cell lines upon STP treatment (9Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A ladder pattern of DNA fragmentation was clearly visible in STP-treated SH-SY5Y cells, whereas it never appeared in IMR-5 cells at any of the concentrations or times tested (Fig.1 D). When the nuclear chromatin was stained with Hoechst 33258, SH-SY5Y nuclei exhibited the typical apoptotic morphology, whereas IMR-5 chromatin was found to be condensed in the marginal zones of the nucleus (Fig. 2 A). The ultrastructural analysis of IMR-5 cells treated with STP revealed important nuclear modifications; chromatin was condensed and formed marginal and irregular masses of heterochromatin in a coarse pattern (Fig. 2 B) that has been previously defined as stage I nuclear condensation (30Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). However, the characteristic high nuclear chromatin condensation typical of apoptosis (defined previously as stage II (30Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar)) was never found in STP-treated IMR-5 cells, although it was clearly apparent in SH-SY5Y (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Absence of high nuclear chromatin condensation in IMR-5 cells treated with STP. SH-SY5Y cells (left column) and IMR-5 cells (right column) were treated with 100 nm STP for 24 h (all panels in A and bottom panels inB) or left untreated (top panels inB). Then cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 (A) or included in Durcupan and processed for electron microscopy (B). Note that treatment of IMR-5 cells with STP induces an incomplete condensation of the nuclear chromatin. Thelower panels in A are high magnifications of the cells framed in upper panels. The bars indicate 20 μm in the top panels in A and 2 μm forall panels in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To rule out the possibility that the lack of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation could be a specific feature of STP treatment, we tested a set of apoptotic inducers at different doses and times. These included DNA-damaging agents (camptothecin (100 μm), etoposide (100 μm), N-nitroso-N-methylurea (5 mm), and cisplatin (50 μm)), protein kinase inhibitors (H-7 (100 μm) and roscovitine (50 μm)), cytoskeleton-disrupting agents (vinblastine (100 μm), nocodazole (50 μm), and colchicine (10 μg/ml)), and macromolecular synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide (2 μg/ml) and actinomicin D (5 μg/ml)). (The highest doses tested are indicated in parentheses.) None of these compounds was able to induce ladder formation in IMR-5 cells at the doses and times that efficiently promoted laddering in SH-SY5Y (data not shown). Moreover, all of these drugs were capable of inducing cell death in both SH-SY5Y and IMR-5 cells as measured by trypan blue and MTT assays (data not shown). Thus, the inability of STP to induce an apoptotic phenotype in IMR-5 cells seemed to be due to an intrinsic defect of these cells rather than to an incapacity of STP to lead the nuclear apoptotic changes. Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family have been shown to protect several cell models from STP-induced apoptosis (31Boix J. Fibla J. Yuste V.J. Piulats J.M. Llecha N. Comella J.X. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). To gain further information on the cell death induced by STP in our experimental system, we analyzed the ability of Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 to prevent STP-induced IMR-5 cell death. For this purpose, we obtained stable pools of transfected cells with any of these two genes, and STP-induced cell death was measured using the MTT assay (Fig. 3 A). Both Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL overexpression afforded a significant protection against cell death at all the concentrations of STP tested. At the highest doses, Bcl-2 was slightly more efficient than Bcl-XL. However, neither of the two proteins was able to prevent cell death when the STP concentrations were higher than 5 μm. Western blot analysis of the transfected cells showed increased levels of the corresponding protein (Fig. 3 B). It has been demonstrated that caspase-3-deficient mice or MCF-7 cells enter apoptosis with an atypical morphology (similar to the one described above for IMR-5 cells) and are unable to degrade DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (6Janicke R.U.

However, alMGS and spMGS varied in dependence on anionic phospholipid activators phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, suggesting certain regulatory differences. Fold predictions strongly indicated a similarity for alMGS (and spMGS) with the two-domain structure of the E. coli MurG cell envelope glycosyltransferase and several amphipathic membrane-binding segments in various proteins.

The large diversity of lipids and the differences in composition and properties between membranes have made it difficult to find out common features of bilayer organization and how lipids and proteins are cooperating in local processes. Lipid-synthesizing pathways have been mapped for the most common types of lipids, and several of the corresponding enzymes catalyzing these reactions have been characterized. However, when it comes to the connection between regulation of bilayer properties and enzyme structure, very little is known (1Hjelmstad R. Bell R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). So far, only a few lipid-synthesizing enzymes have been crystallized. Which structural properties are involved in the catalytic mechanism of these lipid enzymes, and how are the membrane properties sensed (1Hjelmstad R. Bell R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1731-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)? In the well characterized plasma membrane of Acholeplasma laidlawii, the lipid composition is regulated in a manner to maintain (i) lipid phase equilibria, close to a potential bilayer to nonbilayer transition, (ii) a nearly constant radius of spontaneous curvature, and (iii) a certain anionic surface charge density of the lipid bilayer. The synthesis of the major nonbilayer-prone lipid in this membrane, monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (MGlcDAG)1 (Scheme FS1, step I), plays an important role to fulfill the two first points above but also the third, since it is strongly regulated by negatively charged lipids (e.g. the major in vivo lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG)) (2Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MGlcDAG is consecutively processed into diglucosyl diacylglycerol (DGlcDAG) (Scheme FS1, step II). Consequently, the formation of this glucolipid, a transfer of Glc from the donor UDP-Glc to the acceptor lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) catalyzed by a glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.157) (3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), plays a central part in understanding the total regulation of lipid syntheses in A. laidlawii membranes. Furthermore, glycolipids including nonbilayer-prone ones are major constituents in many cell surface membranes, certain bacterial groups, and most photosynthetic organelles. Fairly little is known about the synthesis and regulation of these. Usually, they are made in a separate pathway (as in A. laidlawii), branching from the conserved one to anionic phospholipids. In this work, we have cloned the gene for the α-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from A. laidlawiimembranes and a sequence analog from the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae and propose these genes, on the basis of sequence similarities, to belong to a new large group of lipid glycosyltransferases that are widely spread in nature. We also present a functional comparison between the two cloned glucosyltransferases and discuss structural properties based on two- and three-dimensional fold predictions from the primary structure. A striking similarity to two new, related structures for an Escherichia coliglycosyltransferase and epimerase, respectively, is indicated. Strain A-EF22 of A. laidlawii was cultivated as described by Karlsson et al. (3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and genomic DNA was prepared using the kit GenomicPrepTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The growth ofS. pneumoniae strain 19F CCUG 3030 was performed in Todd-Hewitt medium. For DNA extraction, an overnight culture was harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in H2O and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. The supernatant from the following centrifugation contained the DNA. The N-terminal sequence of the purified MGlcDAG synthase from A. laidlawii (alMGS) (3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was analyzed through Edman degradation, revealing a 20-residue sequence (4Karlsson O.P. Maintenance of Lipid bilayer properties: Key role of two glucolipid synthases in the membranes of Acholeplasma kidlawii . Ph.D. thesis. Department of Biochemistry , Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden1997Google Scholar). An internal amino acid sequence of 10 residues was determined as above after proteolytic cleavage of the protein and separation of peptides by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Degenerated oligonucleotides with the primary sequence 5′-ATT GGT ATI TT(T/C) TCI GAA GC-3′ and 5′-TTT ATC TGG ICC (A/G)TC (G/T)CC-3′ (DNA Technology, Denmark) were synthesized and used in a PCR amplification with genomic A. laidlawii DNA as the template. Amplification conditions using AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase were 30 cycles at 96 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Purified PCR product was ligated into a pCR-ScriptTM Amp SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene) and cloned in TOP10F′ cells (Invitrogen). Screening for positive colonies was performed by blue-white color selection, combined with PCR or colony DNA hybridization. Sequence analysis of positive clones was performed using either vector or gene-specific primers and ABI PRISM® BigDyeTM Sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). Restriction endonucleaseHindIII was used for a complete digestion of A. laidlawii genomic DNA. The DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane in a Southern blot procedure (5Ausubel F. M Brent R Kingston R. Moore R.E Seidman D.D Smith J.G J.G Struhl K Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons,Inc, New York1992: 2:24-2:26Google Scholar). Probes amplified by PCR with gene-specific primers from the cloned fragment of the Almgs gene were [35S]dATP-labeled by nick translation and used in DNA hybridization for 18 h at 50 °C. DNA fragments with the molecular mass corresponding to the hybridization bands were purified and used in a ligation reaction with the pCR-ScriptTM Amp SK(+) vector linearized by HindIII. Hybond-N membrane, [α-35S]dATP and the nick translation kit N5500 were all purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The hybridization was visualized by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant ImagerTM). Oligonucleotides were designed for the start and stop codon region for the MGS gene from S. pneumoniae (SPmgs), with the forward primer structure 5′-AAA GTG AGG TAA TCT ATG CGA ATT G-3′ and reversed primer sequence 5′-GCT GTT CCT CTT TCT ATT CTT CAT-3′. The corresponding oligonucleotides for the MGS gene from A. laidlawii(ALmgs) were designed with the sequence 5′-AAA GTG AGG TAA TCT ATG AGA ATT GGT ATT TTT TCG G-3′ and 5′-CTA CTT TTT ATT CAA TTT TTT GTT ATT TTT ATC-3′. Genomic DNA was used for PCR amplification, and the products were ligated into the pCR-Script vector and cloned as described above. The alMGS was also constructed with an N-terminal His6tag, 2L. Li, O. P. Karlsson, S. Berg, and A. Wieslander, submitted for publication. using the E. coli strain BL21 (Novagen) for cloning of the pET15b recombinant. Both TOP10F′ and BL21 were grown on agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Protein expression of all recombinant strains was performed in 1× LB medium supplemented with 50 μg of carbenicillin/ml. The strains were grown at 37 °C, and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at A600 = 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 5 h of incubation. Syntheticrac-1,2-dioleoyldiacylglycerol was purchased from Sigma. Synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine), and beef heart cardiolipin (CL) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The MGlcDAG was prepared as described by Karlssonet al. (3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled MGlcDAG, synthesized in a standard assay procedure with the cloned MGlcDAG synthase, was extracted from the TLC plate (Silica 60) with chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v). Dodecylphosphate-rac-glycerol (PGD) was from Alexis Corp., and CHAPS detergent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. E. coli cells were solubilized in assay buffer (110 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 22 mm MgCl2, and 22 mm CHAPS), by extensive vortexing three times during incubation on ice for 3 h. The protein concentrations in solubilized cell extracts were between 4–5 mg/ml and determined by a micro-BCA kit (Pierce). Mixed micellar dispersions were prepared as described by Karlsson et al. (3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with an exception for the assay buffer (cf. above). In the standard assay for MGlcDAG synthesis, 25 μl of protein solution (see above) was added to 20 μl of lipid micellar solution and incubated on ice for 30 min. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 μl of UDP-[14C]glucose to give a final concentration of 1 mm (30 GBq/mol). Standard lipid concentration was 10 mm (1 mm DAG substrate in addition to the activator 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol). After 30 min of incubation at 28 °C, the reaction was stopped with 375 μl of methanol/chloroform, 2:1 (v/v), and the lipids were extracted and separated by TLC (2Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled enzymatic product from MGlcDAG synthesis in vivo was utilized in a DGlcDAG synthesis assay (7Vikstroem S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), using a nearly homogenous fraction of the DGlcDAG synthase from A. laidlawii. The lipid products on the TLC plates were visualized and quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard Instant ImagerTM). All assays were done in duplicate. The glucolipid products were also identified with a spray reagent. Lipid extracts were first separated by TLC as above, sprayed with a sulfuric acid/methanol mixture 1:1 (v/v), and exposed to 170 °C. Lipids containing sugar moieties were colored purple after ∼2 min (8Gurr M.I. James A.T. Lipid Biochemistry: An Introduction. Chapman and Hall, London1971: 162-164Google Scholar). Overnight cultures were grown in 1× LB medium (50 μg of carbenicillin/ml) and used for inoculation (2%) to the same medium containing 14.8 kBq of [14C]acetate/ml. The strains were grown at 37 °C, and 2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at A600 = 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4 h of incubation. Lipids were extracted from the cell pellet twice by chloroform/methanol (2:1 and 0:1, v/v) and separated by TLC (0.2-mm Silica Gel 60) developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v). Plates were visualized by autoradiography (cf. above). The radioactivity is incorporated into the lipid acyl chains and was assumed to be approximately equal except for cardiolipin (4 chains), which was predicted to be labeled twice. A similar in vivolabeling was also performed with addition of [14C]UDP-Glc instead of acetate. The amino acid sequence of the alMGS was used in searches for homologous/analogous sequences with PSI-BLAST (9Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

A PCR amplification from chromosomal DNA with the corresponding degenerated DNA oligonucleotide primers yielded a 762-base-long nucleotide fragment. This was used as a base for probes in a Southern blot procedure and identified a 4.2-kilobase-long nucleotide sequence described in Table I. An open reading frame of 1197 bases, a putative transcription start at base −11, and a potential ribosome-binding site were identified on the basis of a matching of the translated sequence with the two amino acid sequences above. The G + C content of the DNA was typical for acholeplasmas (30.8%). This open reading frame was coding for a protein with 398 amino acids, lacking a signal peptide (according to SignalP) and given the gene name ALmgs. The amino acid sequence is not related to the ones in the UGT Nomenclature Committee (12Mackenzie P. Owens I. Burchell B. Bock K. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D. Iyanagi T.

J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and share the typical residues for α-GTs in this class and belong to family D in the classification by Breton et al. (15Breton I. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the best scores were revealed in a data base for finished and unfinished microbial genomes. Here, the best hit was a sequence coding for a protein in Treponema denticola with 36% amino acid identity to the MGlcDAG synthase (the six best hits all had identities above 30%). The translated sequences from Enterococcus faecalis,Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, andT. denticola (second row) were aligned with the alMGS sequence (top) (Fig.1). The conserved residues in all five sequences were mainly focused to three domains: the first 40 residues, residues 90–130, and above all amino acids 280–310, which contains the characteristic motif EX7E of family 4 GTs (cf. above). A search in the protein domain data base (at NCBI) showed that alMGS and the potential homologs belonged to pfam00534, which is the glycosyltransferase group 1. These proteins transfer NDP-linked sugars, like glucose, galactose, mannose, and X-glucose, to a variety of acceptor substrates such as glycogen and lipopolysaccharides. Part of the S. pneumoniae gene (Fig. 1) has been annotated before but with unknown function (16Grebe T. Paik J. Hakenbeck R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3342-3349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the full sequence was retrieved from a contig (gnl∣TIGR∣S.pneumoniae_3836) in the finished and unfinished microbial genome data base and was given the name SPmgs. In order to establish the potential functions of the proteins in Fig. 1,SPmgs, ranked fifth in the figure, was PCR-cloned fromS. pneumoniae chromosomal DNA. The genes ALmgs andSPmgs were placed under control of the lacpromoter but out of frame with the β-galactosidase gene in the pCR-Script vector in an E. coli TOP10F′. A putative ribosome-binding site found at −10 upstream from the start codon inSPmgs was used for both constructs. The ALmgsgene was also ligated into a pET15b vector and overexpressed inE. coli BL21 as a recombinant protein variant with a His6 tag fused to the N terminus.2 Harvested cells from induced recombinant and control strains were solubilized by CHAPS detergent, and standard in vitro assays for MGlcDAG synthesis were performed, using substrates and activator lipid according to experimental procedures (cf. Ref. 3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The results (Table III) revealed that the encoded proteins were able to catalyze the assumed or predicted glucosylation reaction. The same radiolabeled product was synthesized independent of which of the two substrates, [14C]UDP-Glc or [14C]DAG, was labeled. In order to verify that the lipid product synthesized in vivo (Fig.2, lane 5) was MGlcDAG, it was extracted from the TLC plate and used in an in vitro assay for DGlcDAG synthesis with purified DGlcDAG synthase from A. laidlawii membranes (7Vikstroem S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander Å. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This enzyme can only use α-MGlcDAG as the lipid substrate and not β- MGlcDAG or Gal variants. The extracted, radiolabeled lipid (Fig. 2, lane 1), could indeed be used as substrate in the DGlcDAG synthesis (Fig. 2). The intensity of the radiolabeled product was increased when 14C-labeled UDP-glucose was used (lane 3). The MGlcDAG TLC spot was also identified as a glycolipid by charing with sulfuric acid/methanol (1:1, v/v) (see “Experimental Procedures”). A typical purple color characteristic for glycolipids was observed (data not shown).Table IIIMajor lipids synthesized in recombinant E. coli strains in vitro and in vivoStrainVectorIn vitroMGlcDAGIn vivo lipid percentageMGlcDAGPEPGCL%%%%BL21His-ALmgs+568225Control−TOP10F′ALmgs+10631314SPmgs+1701415Control−<1731116 Open table in a new tab Hence, the two genes ALmgs and SPmgs, with the translated amino acid sequences indicated in Fig. 1, encode analogous enzymes, which both perform the synthesis of the membrane lipid MGlcDAG. The lipid composition in the recombinant E. coli strains was analyzed by incorporation of [14C]acetate into the lipids during growth. Four major lipids were recognized on the TLC plates: the glucolipid MGlcDAG, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and the negatively charged lipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and CL (Fig. 2). The control TOP10F′ strain, containing a pCR-Script vector, had a lipid composition normal for E. coli wild type, with about 72% PE and 28% negatively charged lipids (Table III). The recombinant strain with expressed alMGS contained a significant fraction of MGlcDAG, about 10%. The fraction of anionic lipids was kept constant, while the nonbilayer lipid PE had decreased to about 63%. However, the homologous glucosyltransferase from S. pneumoniae, although active in vitro, did not affect the lipid compositionin vivo, and only traces of MGlcDAG were found (Table III, Fig. 2). The BL21 strain, overexpressing the His-tagged alMGS, showed a slightly lower synthesis of the glucolipid compared with TOP10F′, indicating that the N-terminal His extension did not seriously effect enzyme activity. The overexpressed GTs decreased the growth rates compared with controls, and the latter reached the stationary phase faster, which may influence the fractions of CL and PG. The native A. laidlawii MGlcDAG synthase is activated in an essential manner by substantial amounts of negatively charged lipids, especially PG (2Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29602-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). E. coli cells overexpressing the GTs were solubilized and diluted with CHAPS/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine micellar dispersions supplemented with various fractions of negative lipids: DOPG and cardiolipin, due to their occurrence in A. laidlawii and S. pneumoniae membranes (18Steinick L. Wieslander A. Johansson K. Liss A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1200-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Brundish D.E. Shaw N. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylserine (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine)) and PGD because of their PG-like properties. The results in Fig. 3 show that all four lipids were potent activators for the two GTs, but to different extents. An increased fraction of PG and CL gave sigmoidal-like activation curves for alMGS, while spMGS responded only to PG. Cardiolipin was able to activate the spMGS but to a very low extent. The lipid-like detergent, PGD, showed only slightly activating effects on spMGS. This was also true for the alMGS at lower concentrations, but the activity increased significantly at concentrations above 25%. Without supplemented DAG substrate, traces of MGlcDAG product could still be detected. This was most probably due to a minor fraction of endogenous DAG present in the added E. coli cell suspension. The total content of E. coli lipids present in an assay was estimated to be less than 50 nmol (cf. the supplemented amounts of 500 nmol). All observed effects on the cloned alMGS (Fig. 3) were in agreement with earlier studies of the native enzyme (2Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Wieslander Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23484-23490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29602-29606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). alMGS is firmly anchored in the membrane, and detergents are needed for solubilization (3Karlsson O.P. Dahlqvist A. Vikstroem S. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 929-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Potential hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments in the sequences were investigated with a number of prediction methods at the ExPASy Molecular Biology server. One TM (residues 3–22) was proposed according to HMMTOP (20Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), TMpred (residues 3–24) (21Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar), and TopPred2 (residues 4–24) (22von Heijne G. J. Mol.

The orientation of the putative TM was uncertain. This segment also had a substantial amphipathic character according to a hydrophobic moment analysis (24Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). According to the majority of methods used, spMGS was a soluble protein lacking TM segments, except by HMMTOP (20Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar), predicting one at residues 3–21. The alMGS sequence s"

It is not known whether the properties that induce susceptibility to sPLA2 in artificial membranes also contribute to the vulnerability of biological membranes to attack by the enzyme. In order to address this issue, we manipulated various properties of erythrocyte membranes by preparing different types of ghosts as explained in the accompanying particle (17Harris F.M. Smith S.K. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22722-22731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found that the factors that determined the degree of susceptibility were increased exposure of phosphatidylserine, an anionic phospholipid, and increased membrane order. These interpretations agreed with those from studies of susceptibility using artificial membranes (5–16). The next question, then, is whether these same factors are important in the hydrolysis of intact cells by sPLA2 under conditions at which they have become susceptible such as in the presence of specific hormones, after treatment with certain toxins, during apoptosis, or following cellular trauma (2Kudo I.

One feature common among many of the conditions that render cells susceptible to sPLA2 is the elevation of intracellular calcium (1Fourcade O. Simon M.-F. Viode C. Rugani N. Leballe F. Ragab A.

We have used human erythrocytes as an experimental model to determine whether phosphatidylserine exposure and/or an increase in the order of membrane phospholipids are relevant factors in the induction of catalysis by sPLA2 when intracellular calcium is increased. In addition, we examined other hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the ability of certain agents to render cell membranes susceptible to sPLA2: 1) prior activation of intracellular phospholipase(s) A2 (19Balsinde J.

Peterson H. Gopalakrishna R. Sevanian A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes were obtained from healthy individuals undergoing routine physicals at Brigham Young University McDonald Health Center. The samples were stored overnight at 4 °C in EDTA vacutainers from which patient identification was removed. Control experiments comparing fresh blood with samples stored overnight demonstrated that the storage conditions did not influence the results. Erythrocytes were isolated by centrifugation, and resuspended to the original hematocrit in MBSS (NaCl = 134 mm, KCl = 6.2 mm, CaCl2 = 1.6 mm, MgCl2 = 1.2 mm, Hepes = 18.0 mm, and glucose = 13.6 mm, pH 7.4, 37 °C). Snake venom sPLA2 (monomeric aspartate 49 (AppD49) from the venom of Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus) was isolated according to published procedures and was used in all experiments except those shown in Fig. 13 (22). Human group V and IIa sPLA2 were provided generously by Wonhwa Cho (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL) and Michael Gelb (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The final concentrations of sPLA2 used in experiments were 1 μg/ml for AppD49 and human group V and 2 μg/ml for human group IIa. ADIFAB, laurdan, merocyanine 540, and cis-parinaric acid were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ionomycin and E-64d were procured from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and phenylhydrazine, diamide, and quinine were obtained from Sigma. The scramblase inhibitor, R5421, was a kind gift from Jeffrey T. Billheimer at Dupont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. (Wilmington, DE). DAPA, factor Va, factor Xa, prothrombin, and thrombin were acquired from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Pharmacological agents were dissolved in the appropriate solvents (Me2SO or ethanol). Control experiments demonstrated that these solvents did not have effects on the experimental data at the concentrations used. Washed erythrocytes (30 μl) were suspended in MBSS to a final volume of 1 ml (about 1.5 × 108cells/ml) and incubated in the presence or absence of 0.3 μm ionomycin with or without AppD49 sPLA2 for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then separated by centrifugation (6500 rpm for 60 s) in a microcentrifuge (about 3000 ×g) and pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen to quench the reaction. Samples were quickly thawed, and lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol by the method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μl of chilled MBSS was added to suspend the pellet followed by 125 μl of chloroform and 250 μl of methanol. After vortexing the tubes for 10 s, 125 μl of water were added. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged for 30 s at 3000 ×g. After removing half of the water layer, the protein layer was carefully removed with a pipette tip. The remainder of the water layer was then discarded and the residual organic layer was dried under a nitrogen stream to ∼10% of the original volume. The sample was then spotted onto a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate. Phospholipids and lysophospholipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography in 6.5:2.5:1 (v/v) chloroform:methanol:acetic acid. Lipids were stained by iodine vapor. Spots were identified by comparison to standards. The resulting phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine spots on the silica gel were analyzed by both phosphate assay according to the method of Bartlett (24Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 273: 6830-6836Google Scholar) and by densitometry. For densitometric measurements, samples were photographed with a digital camera using a Coomassie Blue filter under direct light and the digital image was quantified using standard digitizing computer software. Washed erythrocytes were suspended in 2 ml of MBSS in a fluorometer sample cell to a final density of about 3–4 × 106 cells/ml. Measurements with fluorescent probes were obtained at 37 °C using a Fluoromax (Spex Industries) photon-counting spectrofluorometer. Sample homogeneity was maintained by continuous gentle stirring with a magnetic stir bar. Simultaneous assessment of fluorescence intensity at multiple excitation and emission wavelengths was obtained by rapid sluing of monochromator mirrors using control software provided with the instrument. Band pass was set at 4.25 nm for all experiments. Release of fatty acids from cells was assayed with an acrylodan-labeled fatty acid-binding protein (ADIFAB) (65 nm final, excitation = 390 nm, emission = 432 and 505 nm; Refs. 3Wilson H.A. Huang W.

Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The values of GP as a function of time were fit to a double exponential equation by nonlinear regression. The amount of hydrolysis at 100 s following sPLA2 addition was then calculated using parameter values from the nonlinear regression results. Exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the bilayer was detected by an increase in the fluorescence intensity of dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA) (3 μm final, excitation = 335 nm, emission = 545 nm; Ref. 27Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To detect phospholipid translocation, DAPA, factor Va (6 nm), factor Xa (3 nm), and prothrombin (3.5–4 μm) were incubated for 300 s in MBSS in the sample chamber of the spectrofluorometer. Cells were then added and the mixture incubated an additional 600 s prior to addition of ionomycin (0.3 μm) or control solvent (Me2SO). A positive control was obtained with the addition of thrombin (2.7 μm). The release of vesicles from the plasma membrane was monitored simultaneously with other fluorescence observations by recording the intensity of scattered light (excitation = 500 nm, emission = 510 nm; Ref. 4Wilson H.A. Waldrip J.B. Nielson K.H. Judd A.M. Han S.K. Cho W. Sims P.J. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11494-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For simultaneous measurements with the prothrombinase assay (see above), excitation and emission wavelengths were 600 and 610 nm, respectively. Oxidation of membrane phospholipids was monitored by use of the fluorescent probe, cis-parinaric acid (1.12 μm final, excitation = 303 nm, emission = 416 nm; Ref. 28Kuypers F.A. van den Berg J.J. Roelofsen B. Op den Kamp J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Measurements of light scattering for microvesicle release and ADIFAB fluorescence were made simultaneously. The data were corrected for time-dependent light scattering artifacts caused by microvesicle release. Erythrocytes were prepared by a modification of Schneider's method (29Schneider G.B. Am. J. Anat. 1976; 146: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, the preparations were washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. 9.5 ml of 1×108 cells/ml were incubated in a jar having a 5.5-cm diameter, in the presence or absence of 0.3 μm ionomycin, and allowed to settle onto cover glasses, previously coated with poly-l-lysine, at 4 °C overnight. Samples were then fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 2.5 h. Following fixation, the cells were washed six times in sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3), fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 23 °C, and washed six times in sodium cacodylate buffer. Samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol solutions (10, 30, 50, 70, 95, and 100%) for 10 min each then washed three times in acetone. The slides were then subjected to critical point drying, using carbon dioxide. Finally, samples were sputter coated with gold for 2 min. Images were obtained on a JEOL JSM 840A scanning electron microscope. Membrane order was assessed using laurdan GP (26Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Laurdan (2.5 μm final) was added to samples of erythrocytes prepared as described above for fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence emission was then monitored as a function of time at dual wavelengths (excitation = 350 nm, emission = 435 and 500 nm) for at least 5 min to establish the baseline. Various agents followed by ionomycin or control solvent were added as described in Fig. 9. Changes in laurdan GP were then assessed by calculating the difference in the slope of laurdan GP before and after addition of ionomycin or control solvent under each experimental condition. The two-photon excitation images were collected on an Axiovert 35 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), with a Zeiss 20X LD-Achroplan (0.4 N.A., air) using a titanium-sapphire laser excitation source (Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) tuned to 770 nm and pumped by a frequency-doubled Nd:vanadate laser (Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (30Yu W. So P.T. French T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 626-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The laser was guided by a galvanometer-driven x-y scanner (Cambridge Technology, Watertown, MA) to achieve beam scanning in bothx and y directions. A frequency synthesizer (Hewlett-Packard, Santa Clara, CA) controlled the scanning rate of 9 s to acquire a 256 × 256-pixel frame that covered approximately a 60 × 60-μm region. Dual images were collected simultaneously using a beam-splitter, two emission short-pass filters (centered at about 450 and 500 nm), and two detectors for calculation of GP (26Parasassi T. De Stasio G. Ravagnan G. Rusch R.M. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 179-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with or without the agents indicated in Fig. 11as described above for hydrolysis experiments. Laurdan (250 nm) was added to the samples 250 s after the addition of the last agent in the experiment. Samples were incubated with stirring for an additional 50 s, and a 0.5-ml aliquot was then transferred to 1 ml of fresh MBSS in a heated microscopy sample dish (36 °C). Cells were allowed an additional 5 min to settle, and images were then obtained. In some cases (e.g. Fig. 10), cells were incubated prior to the onset of the experiment with 5 μm laurdan for 1 h at 36 °C, and excess laurdan was removed by centrifugation. Cells were suspended in 2 ml of fresh MBSS and transferred to the microscopy dish. After allowing the cells to settle, baseline images were obtained. Ionomycin was then added directly to the sample, and additional images were acquired. Finally, sPLA2 was added, and the time course of changes in laurdan fluorescence was monitored by repeated acquisition of images of the same field. In all figures that contain summaries from multiple replicates, the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Each replicate sample included in the data represents data from a separate blood donor. Large comparisons of hydrolysis or light scattering data among many groups sharing some of the same blood samples (e.g. Figs. 2, 7, 9, and 12) were accomplished by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post-test for multiple comparisons. Since the number of samples per group was unbalanced, it was not possible to consider sample pairing in the analyses of variance. This increased the possibility of missing real differences that would only be identified by paired comparisons of samples matched by blood donor. Accordingly, the various treatment groups were also compared with the group treated with ionomycin alone using Student's paired t test (two-tailed) for those samples that were matched by blood donor. Although the results of this secondary analysis agreed with those of the analysis of variance and post-test in most instances, there was one example in which the results were significant only when the analysis was confined to paired samples. In this case, the level of significance was very high (p = 0.004), and the data were therefore interpreted as being statistically significant (see legend to Fig. 7).Figure 7Effects of various agents on the ability of ionomycin to induce microvesicle release. The experiments of Fig.6 were repeated in the presence or absence of the agents listed. Theordinate indicates the change in average intensity of scattered light from that measured immediately prior to ionomycin (or phenylhydrazine or control diluent) addition to that observed 10 min later. Asterisks represent values that differed significantly from ionomycin alone (*, p < 0.05; **,p < 0.01, by analysis of variance; ***,p = 0.004 by paired t test; the details of both analyses are explained under “Experimental Procedures”). High KCl and quinine alone were indistinguishable from control. The numbers of replicates were: Control, 37; Ionomycin, 52;High KCl + ionomycin, 12; Quinine + ionomycin, 6;E-64d + ionomycin, 3; Phenylhydrazine, 4;Phenylhydrazine + ionomycin, 16. See Fig. 2 for the details of the concentrations and incubation times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 12Effect of merocyanine 540 on susceptibility to sPLA2. Hydrolysis of erythrocyte phospholipids by sPLA2 was assessed in the presence of 10 μmmerocyanine 540 (MC540) (10 min incubation prior to sPLA2addition) as described in Fig. 2. The “control” and “ionomycin” data of Fig. 2 are included for comparison. The amount of hydrolysis observed with merocyanine 540 was significantly different from the control (no merocyanine) by analysis of variance (*, p< 0.05, n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When data sets were fully matched by blood sample for all treatment groups (i.e. Figs. 3, 4, and 13), they were analyzed in two steps. First, results within each treatment group were normalized to the value of an appropriate internal standard matched by blood sample (see figure legends for details). Second, the normalized values were tested for treatment effects using Student's t test (two-tailed) with the value of 1.0 as the null hypothesis. Since multiple (two to three) treatment groups were compared with the same standard in these cases, a correction was made to the critical value ofp accepted as indicating statistical significance (traditionally 0.05) according to the formula p = 1–0.951/n, where n = the number of comparisons. For n = 2, the critical value ofp = 0.025; for n = 3, the critical value of p = 0.017.Figure 4Inhibition of intracellular phospholipase A2 does not alter the ability of ionomycin to induce susceptibility. Erythrocytes were incubated for 10 min in the presence or absence of 20 μm MAFP under the conditions described for the thin-layer chromatography experiments (i.e. Fig. 3). Ionomycin (0.3 μm) was then added and the incubation continued for 45 min. A 50-μl aliquot of each sample was then transferred to a spectrofluorometer sample cell (2 ml final volume), and susceptibility was then assessed using ADIFAB as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Significance was assessed by normalizing the data for each group to that obtained with ionomycin alone and evaluated by Student's t test as described under “Experimental Procedures” (***, p< 0.0001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig.1, the extent of fatty acid release from erythrocyte membranes in the presence of sPLA2 was greatly enhanced by a 10-min prior incubation of the cells with ionomycin. The average response among multiple samples is displayed in Fig.2. Control experiments in which Ca2+ was replaced by EGTA in the extracellular medium revealed that this and the other results described below for ionomycin were due to Ca2+ entry into the cell rather than direct effects of the ionophore. Experiments in which the time of incubation with ionomycin was varied revealed that the effect developed after a latency of about 100 s and reached a maximum within about 300 s (not shown). In contrast to results obtained with lymphocytes (4Wilson H.A. Waldrip J.B. Nielson K.H. Judd A.M. Han S.K. Cho W. Sims P.J. Bell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11494-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the hydrolysis was not sufficient to consume the cells, and little or no hemolysis was observed at the end of the reaction. In order to assess the relative amount of hydrolysis of the two major glycerophospholipid species, experiments were conducted at much higher cell densities (about 40-fold higher) than in the experiment of Fig. 1. Under such conditions, the time course of onset of the effect of ionomycin was much slower such that the lag time for achieving maximum hydrolysis rates was about 20 min. The release of microvesicles in the presence of ionomycin described below was also proportionally slower. Thin-layer chromatography experiments investigating hydrolysis of erythrocytes in the presence of sPLA2 or ionomycin alone revealed no significant hydrolysis of either phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine after a 20-min incubation. In contrast, both substrates were hydrolyzed significantly when erythrocytes were incubated with sPLA2and ionomycin together (Fig. 3). Erythrocytes were incubated with ionomycin in the presence or absence of MAFP (19Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract"

First described in the erythrocyte (1Marchesi V.T. Steers Jr., E. Science. 1968; 159: 203-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), spectrins are found in all or almost all cells (2Glenney Jr., J.R. Glenney P.

In erythrocytes, an intact spectrin-based membrane skeleton is critical for the structural integrity of the plasma membrane. Defects in its components are associated with red cell fragility and premature destruction in the human diseases hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis and their animal models (5Tse W.T. Lux S.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 104: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The function of a spectrin-based plasma membrane skeleton in non-erythroid tissues is less well defined, but it is hypothesized to be important in establishing and maintaining the asymmetric distribution of proteins in specialized plasma membrane domains, particularly in polarized cells (6Rodriguez-Boulan E. Nelson W.J. Science. 1989; 245: 718-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Recently, components of a spectrin-based membrane skeleton have also been found in several intracellular organelles. Isoforms of spectrin and ankyrin exist in Golgi membranes (7Beck K.A.

Spectrin also associates with actin-related protein 1 (centractin), a subunit of the dynactin complex, which associates with dynein and transports vesicles along microtubules in the secretory pathway (15Holleran E.A.

The potential role of a spectrin-based membrane skeleton in the nucleus is unclear. There are interesting recent reports indicating that spectrin αII is part of a nuclear protein complex involved in repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (20Brois D.W. McMahon L.W. Ramos N.I.

Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether αII-spectrin binds with a β-spectrin partner in the nucleus to form a membrane skeleton is unknown. We have previously described spectrin βIII (see footnote 1 for nomenclature), 1Nomenclature: β1Σ1-Spectrin is the erythroid isoform (Σ1) of erythroid (β1) spectrin. It is also called spectrinR. The gene name is SPTB (human) orSpnb1 (mouse). β1Σ2-Spectrin is the muscle isoform (Σ2) of erythroid spectrin. It contains a different C-terminal sequence. βII-Spectrin is “non-erythroid” β-spectrin. It has also been called fodrin, brain spectrin, spectrinG, or spectrin beta, non-erythroid type 1. The gene name is SPTB1(human) or Spnb2 (mouse). βIII-Spectrin has the gene namesSPTBN2 (human) or Spnb3 (mouse), respectively. Spectrin βV (gene name BSPECV) is the recently described mammalian equivalent of Drosophila beta heavy spectrin. Spectrin βIV has at least five isoforms, βIVΣ1 through βIVΣ5. Isoforms βIVΣ1 and βIVΣ5 are discussed in this report. The gene names of spectrin βIV are SPTBN3 (human) andSpnb4 (mouse). which associates with the Golgi and intracellular vesicles (9Stankewich M.C. Tse W.T. Peters L.L. Ch'ng Y. John K.M. Stabach P.R. Devarajan P. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14158-14163Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We now identify another intracellular β-spectrin, spectrin βIV, which has a major truncated isoform (βIVΣ5) and a full-length isoform (βIVΣ1). Spectrin βIV resides in the cytoplasm, where it may attach to vesicles, and in the nucleus, where it associates with PML2 bodies and the nuclear matrix. While this manuscript was in revision, Berghs et al. (23Berghs S. Aggujaro D. Dirkx R. Maksimova E. Stabach P. Hermel J.M. Zhang J.P. Philbrick W. Slepnev V. Ort T. Solimena M. J.

Their βIVΣ1 isoform corresponds to our full-length spectrin βIV, also named βIVΣ1. The 77-kDa isoform (βIVΣ5) described here is the major isoform of spectrin βIV. It was not reported by Berghs et al. and could not have been detected with the antibodies they employed (23Berghs S. Aggujaro D. Dirkx R. Maksimova E. Stabach P. Hermel J.M. Zhang J.P. Philbrick W.

Search of the GenBank™ data bases was performed using the NCBI BLAST similarity search programs. Nucleotide sequence analysis was done using the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis programs. Screening and isolation of cDNA clones were done either by standard methods or by the GeneTrapper cDNA positive-selection method according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). A hybridization oligonucleotide (5′-CCA ACG CCA CTG CCG CTT-3′) and human brain plasmid cDNA library (Life Technologies) were used in the GeneTrapper method. Automated nucleotide sequencing was performed in the Children's Hospital Mental Retardation Research Center DNA Sequencing Core Facility using the dideoxynucleotide termination method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and anchored PCR amplifications were done using the Advantage 2 polymerase kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). PCR templates used were Marathon-ready cDNAs prepared from retina or brain (CLONTECH). The cloning strategy and sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in the isolation of overlapping clones that constitute the full-length spectrin βIV cDNA are available upon request. Chromosome localization of the human spectrin βIV gene utilized the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid panel (24Stewart E.A. McKusick K.B. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Brady S. Chu A. Fang N. Hadley D. Harris M.

Genome Res. 1997; 7: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Hybrid human-hamster clones were assayed for the presence of spectrin βIV gene by PCR. Using the primers 5′-CGG CTG GCA GCT GTG AAC CAG ATG GTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAC TGG CAC TGG GTC TCG GCT CAG GC-3′ (reverse), a 268-bp product was generated in clones that carried the spectrin βIV gene. The data were analyzed by the Stanford Human Genome Center RH Server on the Web. Chromosome localization of the mouse gene was done using the Jackson Laboratory BSS Interspecific ((C57BL/6JEi × SPRET/Ei)F1 × SPRET/Ei males) backcross panel (25Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R.

A 453-bpPstI fragment of human EST clone AA054636 detected aPstI restriction fragment length polymorphism in the mouse genome corresponding to a 3.7-kb hybridization band in C57BL/6JEi and 4.1-kb band in SPRET/Ei. The segregation pattern of the polymorphism in progeny of the cross was used to determine the map location of the gene. The typing data have been placed in the Mouse Genome Data base (accession number J:63322) and can be accessed on the Web. For Northern analysis, a 1.96-kb fragment of clone N164/N155 corresponding to bp 114–2071 was generated by PCR, subcloned, labeled, and used as a probe in hybridization with mRNA from various mouse tissues blotted on a charged nylon membrane (Multiple Tissue Northern blot, CLONTECH). High stringency hybridization and washes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (ExpressHyb,CLONTECH). The membranes were then exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film for 4 days to visualize the positive signals. For PCR analysis, complementary DNAs (1 ng) from various mouse tissues (Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA Panel, CLONTECH; and Multiple Choice cDNAs, OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) were analyzed by PCR (94 °C, 40 s; 60 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 3 min; 38 cycles) using the primers: 5′-CAA GCC CAG GTG CCC CTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTT GTC ATT CCA TTG AGA AG-3′ (reverse). The 107-bp product, representing the unique C-terminal sequence of spectrin βIVΣ5, was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Whole mount in situ hybridization was done according to published protocols (26Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Development. 1992; 116: 357-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, day 9.5 mouse embryos were isolated, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and bleached in methanol and hydrogen peroxide. They were then treated with proteinase K in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, refixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes at 63 °C overnight. After high stringency washes, the embryos were incubated sequentially with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibodies and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-phosphate chromogenic substrate for visualization of hybridization signals. The digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes were generated by in vitrotranscription with T7 polymerase using as the template a 1.96-kb fragment of clone N164/N155 (nucleotides 114–2071) generated by PCR and subcloned into a pBluescript SK vector. RNA transcripts in the sense direction were generated with T3 polymerase and used as negative controls. An anti-peptide antiserum to βIV-spectrin, termed SpB4-R15, was produced by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The peptide sequence was RLTTPPEPRPSASS, corresponding to codons 535–548 of clone N164/N155, a region that contains little homology to spectrins βI, βII, βIII, or βV. The antibodies were affinity-purified by passing through an AminoLink Plus column (Pierce, Rockford, IL) containing a recombinant peptide of βIV-spectrin repeat 15 fused to a GST protein, and eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5). A cDNA encoding βIV-spectrin repeat 15 was generated by PCR (forward primer 5′-GCG GGA TCC TCT CGG GAG CTT CAT AAG TTC-3′; reverse primer 5′-GCG GAA TTC GGA GCT GAC ATG CAG GCG GGC-3′) and cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of a pGEX-6P-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The recombinant GST-βIV-spectrin peptide was produced in theEscherichia coli BL21 strain and purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western analysis, mouse tissues were excised and homogenized on ice with a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY) in 0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm N-ethylmalemide, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml each of protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and 0.4 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein samples (35 μg) were run on a 3.5–17% non-linear gradient Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filter. The filter was incubated with 500 ng/ml affinity-purified SpB4-R15 antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with Lumi-Light Western blotting Substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Molecular sizes of the positive bands were determined by comparison with the molecular weight of red cell membrane proteins (27Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar) run in parallel. Experiments using affinity-purified antisera from two rabbits immunized with the βIV-spectrin peptide independently give similar results. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal SpB4-R15 antibody was used in immunofluorescence microscopy studies. Canine kidney cells (MDCK), human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH), and green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA. Human embryonic kidney 293T and hepatoma Hep3B cells were kind gifts from Drs. Len Zon (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA) and David Livingston (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA), respectively. Human mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, characterized, and cultured as described (28Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (18235) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence studies, cells were grown in slide chambers to subconfluency. They were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at room temperature (RT) for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 10 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100% methanol at −20 ° for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with affinity-purified SpB4-R15 antibody at 1:10 to 1:100 dilutions at RT for 30 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at RT. All second stage antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA. The cells were then rinsed and mounted in ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Double immunofluorescence studies were performed by adding a second mouse antibody in the first incubation step and an fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in the second step. The primary antibodies used in double label experiments with the SpB4-R15 antibody included anti-PML (mouse monoclonal PG-M3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-SUMO-1 (mouse monoclonal 21C7; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Additional primary antibodies used to stain SpβIVΣ5-transfected cells included anti-nucleoporin p62 (mouse monoclonal 53; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-CBP (rabbit polyclonal A-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-c-myc (mouse monoclonal 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary stage antibodies were Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG. Antibody dilutions used were empirically determined and ranged between 1:100 and 1:1000. Fluorescence microscopy was done using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Microscopic images were taken with Kodak Elite ASA 400 film, digitized with a Nikon CoolScan 2000 slide scanner, and processed with the Adobe Photoshop 5.5 program on a Power Macintosh G3 computer. Confocal microscopy was performed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital Confocal Microscopy Core Facility, using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024/2P confocal microscope interfaced with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. To make the SpβIVΣ5-green fluorescence protein (SpβIVΣ5-GFP) construct, a fragment of clone N164/N155 was generated by PCR and subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA4/HisMaxA (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) into which a cDNA for the enhanced GFP (CLONTECH) had first been inserted. The primers used in the PCR were DEL1 (forward: 5′-CTG ATG GCG CGG GAT AGC ACG CGG-3′) and DEL3 (reverse: 5′-TTC CAT TGA GAA GGG GGC TGT-3′), and the PCR product corresponded to codons 2–678 of clone N164/N155. The resulting construct encoded a fusion protein consisting of six histidines and an Xpress epitope tag, followed by the SpβIVΣ5 peptide fused in-frame to GFP. The myc-tagged human CREB-binding protein construct was a kind gift of Dr. David Housman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston, MA). These constructs were transfected into 293T, COS-7, and Hep3B cell lines using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reagents. Expression of the heterologous protein was analyzed after 24–48 h. Deletion constructs of SpβIVΣ5-GFP were generated in a similar fashion, using PCR primer pairs as followed: SpβIVΣ5ΔNR-GFP (DEL1 (forward) and DEL4 (reverse: 5′-CCT GGG CTT GTC GGC TGC CCC-3′)), SpβIVΣ5ΔR16-GFP (DEL1 (forward) and DEL5 (reverse: 5′-GGA GCT GAC ATG CAG GCG GGC-3′)), SpβIVΣ5ΔR10-GFP (DEL2 (forward: 5′-AGG CCA GCA AAG CAG ACC AGC TG-3′) and DEL3 (reverse)) and SpβIVΣ5ΔR15-GFP (DEL1 (forward), DEL6 (forward: 5′-CGG GCC CAG CTG CTG GCC GCC ACA GCC GAC GCC CTG CGC TTC-3′), DEL7 (reverse: 5′-GAA GCG CAG GGC GTC GGC TGT GGC GGC CAG CAG CTG GGC CCG-3′) and DEL3 (reverse)). The deleted domains are: SpβIVΣ5ΔNR-GFP, codons 649–678; SpβIVΣ5ΔR16-GFP, codons 617–678; SpβIVΣ5ΔR10-GFP, codons 2–84; SpβIVΣ5ΔR15-GFP, codons 509–616. The deletion constructs were transfected into mammalian cell lines, and expression of the truncated peptides was analyzed as for the SpβIVΣ5-GFP construct. Preparation of nuclear matrix was performed as published previously (29He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown on chamber slides were treated sequentially with cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 4 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex, 1 mm Pefabloc) at 4 °C for 3 min, 25 units/ml DNase I in nuclease buffer (cytoskeleton buffer with 50 mm NaCl) at RT for 30 min, 0.25 m ammonium sulfate in nuclease buffer at RT for 10 min three times, high salt buffer (nuclease buffer with 2 m NaCl) at RT for 5 min three times, and then 100 μg/ml RNase A and 40 units/ml RNase T1 in nuclease buffer at RT for 60 min. The extracted cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 10 min and immunofluorescence microscopy was performed. Pefabloc, DNase I, RNase A, and RNase T1 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; vanadyl ribonucleoside complex was from Life Technologies; all other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. Nucleotide sequences of αI-, αII-, βI-, βII-, and βIII-spectrins were used as query sequences to search the GenBank™ EST data base for clones that were similar but not identical to known spectrin chains. One EST clone from a human retinal library was identified that had sequence similarity to repeats 10 and 11 of β-spectrins (GenBank™ accession number AA054636). Screening of bacteriophage cDNA libraries by conventional methods using a 453-bpPstI fragment of this clone as a probe failed to yield positive clones. Subsequently, the GeneTrapper positive selection method was used (Life Technologies). Using sequence information obtained from the clone, an oligonucleotide probe was synthesized, biotinylated, and hybridized with single-stranded DNA from a human brain cDNA library. Six unique clones that contained sequences complementary to the oligonucleotide probe were recovered using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. All of the clones were polyadenylated, but four appeared to be incomplete or partially spliced and are not described here. The complete coding sequence reported here is a composite of the two unique clones, N164 and N155 (Fig.1 A). Clone N164 extends from nucleotide 1–2172 of the composite sequence and is followed by a poly(A) tail. Clone N155 extends from nucleotide 10–2418 and is also polyadenylated. However, neither clone contains a consensus polyadenylation signal close to the polyadenylation site, and both are too short to account for the transcripts observed on Northern blots (described below). We suspect they are minor transcripts and that a significant portion of the 3′-untranslated repeat has not been cloned. Sequence analysis showed that clones N164 and N155 contained an identical 2034-bp open reading frame that potentially encodes a peptide 678 residues in length, with a calculated molecular weight of 77,197 Da (Fig. 1 B). The first methionine in this open reading frame (bp 128–130) was taken as the start codon. The amino acid sequence of this peptide is very similar to repeats 10–16 of other known β-spectrins, with ∼45–65% identity over the repeat domain. Analysis of the secondary structure of this spectrin-like peptide predicts the formation of multiple α-helical coils that fold into triple helical coiled-coil units, a characteristic feature found in all spectrin peptides (30Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The spectrin-like peptide represented by clone N164/N155 is predicted to have five full repetitive motifs (repeats 11–15), flanked on each side by two partial repeats (repeats 10 and 16). Partial repeat 10 consists of two coils of a triple helical coiled-coil unit (helices B and C) and partial repeat 16, a single coil (helix A) (Fig. 1 C). These coils may potentially allow head-to-tail interaction of multiple peptides to form concatemers (Fig.1 D), analogous to the way β- and α-spectrins interact to form heterotetramers. However, in the latter case β-spectrin ends with two helical coils (helices A and B) and α-spectrin starts with a single coil (helix C). The repeat domain of the spectrin-like peptide is followed by a C-terminal, non-repeat domain (NR) of 30 residues, which is rich in proline residues and dissimilar to the C termini of other β-spectrins. No similar sequence is reported in the protein data bases. To show that clones N164 and N155 are transcripts of a new spectrin-like gene and not an alternative transcript of other known β-spectrins, we determined the chromosomal location of the new spectrin-like gene. PCR primers derived from the sequence of clone N164/N155 were used to screen the Stanford G3 human-hamster radiation hybrid genomic DNA panel for the presence or absence of its gene in different cell lines (24Stewart E.A. McKusick K.B. Aggarwal A. Bajorek E. Brady S. Chu A. Fang N. Hadley D. Harris M. Hussain S. Lee R. Maratukulam A. O'Connor K. Perkins S. Piercy M. Qin F. Reif T. Sanders C. She X. Sun W.L. Tabar P. Voyticky S. Cowles S. Fan J.B. Mader C. Quackenbush J. Myers R.M. Cox D.R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Tight linkage (lod score 11.25) of the gene was found to DNA marker SHGC-33106, a part of the biliverdin reductase B gene (also called NADPH-flavin reductase), which maps to chromosome 19q13.13-q13.2 (31Saito F. Yamaguchi T. Komuro A. Tobe T. Ikeuchi T. Tomita M. Nakajima H. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 71: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This chromosomal location differs from other human β-spectrin genes, which are located on chromosomes 2, 11, 14, and 15, indicating that clone N164/N155 is a transcript of a new β-spectrin-like gene. Of note, the chromosome location of this new gene is close to that of α-actinin 4 (32Kaplan J.M. Kim S.H. North K.N. Rennke H. Correia L.A. Tong H.Q. Mathis B.J. Rodriguez-Perez J.C. Allen P.G. Beggs A.H. Pollak M.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that the spectrin βI and βIII genes both localize close to an actinin gene (9Stankewich M.C. Tse W.T. Peters L.L. Ch'ng Y. John K.M. Stabach P.R. Devarajan P. Morrow J.S.

Genet. 1990; 47: 62-71PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that sequential duplications of a chromosome region containing a primordial β-spectrin gene and α-actinin gene may have given rise to the neighboring locations of these genes. We next mapped the location of this spectrin-like gene in the mouse. Analysis of the segregation pattern of a PstI restriction fragment polymorphism in 94 progeny of The Jackson Laboratory BSS interspecific backcross panel (25Rowe L.B. Nadeau J.H. Turner R.

Genome. 1994; 5: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) localized the gene to mouse chromosome 7 near the centromere (7.5 centimorgans), a region of the mouse genome homologous to human chromosome 19q13.1. The location of the gene is also different from other known β-spectrin genes, which map to chromosomes 11, 12, and 19. Mouse spectrin βV has not yet been mapped. This gene location approximates the position of the spontaneous mouse mutation reduced pigmentation (rp) (34Gibb S. Hakansson E.M. Lundin L.G."

Since GDP-Gα subunits rapidly combine with free Gβγ subunits to reform inactive heterotrimeric G-proteins, RGS3 and other RGS proteins may also reduce the amount of Gβγ subunits available for effector interactions. Although RGS6, RGS7, and RGS11 bind Gβ5 in the absence of a Gγ subunit, RGS proteins are not known to directly influence Gβγ signaling. Here we show that RGS3 binds Gβ1γ2 subunits and limits their ability to trigger the production of inositol phosphates and the activation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Co-expression of RGS3 with Gβ1γ2 inhibits Gβ1γ2-induced inositol phosphate production and Akt activation in COS-7 cells and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in HEK 293 cells. The inhibition of Gβ1γ2 signaling does not require an intact RGS domain but depends upon two regions in RGS3 located between acids 313 and 390 and between 391 and 458. Several other RGS proteins do not affect Gβ1γ2 signaling in these assays. Consistent with the in vivo results, RGS3 inhibits Gβγ-mediated activation of phospholipase Cβ in vitro. Thus, RGS3 may limit Gβγ signaling not only by virtue of its GTPase-activating protein activity for Gα subunits, but also by directly interfering with the activation of effectors.

Receptor activation triggers the exchange of GTP for GDP by the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, causing a conformational change in the Gα subunit, which facilitates its dissociation from the receptor and Gβγ subunits. GTP-bound Gα and free Gβγ subunits then bind and activate downstream effectors. However, Gα subunits possess an intrinsic GTPase activity, which returns Gα to its GDP bound state and thereby limits the duration of Gα signaling. Because GDP-Gα possesses a high affinity for Gβγ subunits, the heterotrimeric G-protein rapidly reforms, effectively ending Gβγ-mediated signaling as well (reviewed in Refs. 1Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar and 2Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Cells possess another important mechanism that curtails the duration in which a Gα subunit remains GTP bound. Members of a family of proteins termed regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS)1 dramatically accelerate the intrinsic rate that certain Gα subunits hydrolyze GTP, a property that identifies them as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The mammalian RGS proteins have a 120-amino acid region, RGS domain, or RGS box, which binds Gαi and Gαq subfamily members in a transition state of the GTP hydrolysis reaction, thereby lowering the free energy of the reaction (reviewed in Refs. 3Kehrl J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 4Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors have a divergent RGS domain, which accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα12 and Gα13 (5Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M.

A. 1998; 95: 12973-12976Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RGS proteins with GAP activity for members of the Gαs subfamily remain enigmatic. The mammalian RGS proteins can be broadly divided into two groups (7Cho H. Kehrl J.H. Curr. Top Biochem. Res. 2000; 2: 161-170Google Scholar): those composed predominantly of an RGS domain such as RGS1, RGS2, RGS4, and RGS5 and those that contain an RGS domain but also other domains. The second group includes RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, RGS11, RGS12, and RGS14. The smaller RGS proteins likely function solely as Gα GAPs, whereas some of the larger RGS proteins are undoubtedly Gα effectors such as p115 Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors. RGS3 exists as two isoforms, thus falling into both groups (8Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 9Reif K. Cyster J.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4720-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar): a shorter version that encodes largely an RGS domain (RGS3CT) and a larger isoform that has a strongly acidic region and an unusual region that contains a hexapeptide repeat enriched for proline, glutamine, and acidic residues (8Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 9Reif K. Cyster J.G. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4720-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Both versions possess GAP activity for Gαi and Gαq and can impair signaling through Gαiand certain Gαq-linked signaling pathways (10Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarajah S. Chidiac P. Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The function of the N-terminal domain of RGS3 is unknown, although the N-terminal fragment shifts to membranes after a calcium signal (11Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient expression of RGS3 potently inhibits the chemotaxis of a pre-B cell line, even better than does RGS1, which has excellent Gαi GAP activity (12Bowman E.P. Campbell J.J. Druey K.M.

Scheschonka A. Murphy P.M. Kozasa T. Kehrl J.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1829-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The known importance of Gβγ signaling in chemokine-directed migration (14Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) led us to test whether RGS3 employs another mechanism besides its Gα GAP activity to impair Gβγ signaling. In three in vivomodels of Gβ1γ2 signaling, inositol phosphate generation through the stimulation of phospholipase Cβ, the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the activation of Akt, we find that RGS3 potently inhibits the activation of these signaling pathways even when it lacks a functional RGS domain. Supporting the in vivo data, purified RGS3 blocks Gβγ-induced inositol phosphate production by phospholipase Cβ2in vitro. To make pET15b His6-RGS3, PCR fragments generated from RcCMV-RGS3 (8Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) were inserted into theNdeI/XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) in frame with the hexahistidine tag. To make FLAG-RGS3, FLAG-RGS3NT (RGS3 1–313), FLAG-RGS3CT (RGS3 314–520), FLAG-RGS3NT1(RGS3 1–390), and FLAG-RGS3NT2 (RGS3 1–458), the appropriate PCR products were subcloned into pFLAGCMV-2. FLAG-RGS3/4 was formed by fusing the coding region of the first 58 amino acids of RGS4 with the coding region of amino acids 390–519 of RGS3 via PCR using PCR primers that generate the appropriate overlapping fragments. The PCR products were denatured, annealed, and extended before subcloning into pFLAGCMV2. FLAG-RGS3 E419A/N420A (EN mutant) was created by site-directed mutagenesis of the FLAG-RGS3 construct (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To make GST-RGS3, GST-RGS3CT, and RGS3NT, PCR products encompassing the coding regions of RGS3, RGS3 (1), and RGS3 (314) were cloned in-frame with the GST-coding region using the GST expression vector pEBG. The veracity of all the DNA constructs was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The RGS2, RGS4, and RGS10 constructs have been previously described (8Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The transfected cells were plated in 6-well plates. For the MAPK assays the cells were re-plated in 0.5% serum, and for the Akt assays they were re-plated in 0.5% serum for 24 h, at which point the media was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. The His-tagged recombinant RGS3 and RGS4 were purified from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) inducted with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 2–12 h. The recombinant proteins were batch-purified under nondenaturing conditions using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Santa Clara, CA) and eluted with an imidazole gradient. The purified protein fractions were dialyzed against the wash buffer and stored at −70 °C. In some instances RGS3 was further purified over a monoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant His-tagged Jun kinase was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). GST-RGS3 fusion proteins were prepared from lysates of HEK 293 cells previously transfected with the appropriate expression vector. The fusion proteins were partially purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluted GST-RGS3 fusion proteins were concentrated and dialyzed using Centricon 30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with the equilibration buffer (20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) containing 0.5 mm aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The resulting concentrate (1.5 ml) was applied using a 2-ml sample loop to a MonoQ HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with the equilibration buffer in the HP1100 high performance liquid chromatography system (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA). All operations were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by successive applications of the equilibration buffer for 5 min and an increasing linear gradient from 0 to 0.6 m NaCl for 60 min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected, and 20 μl of each fraction were separated on 10% gel by SDS-PAGE. The fusion proteins were identified in SDS-PAGE gels by silver staining. All the GST-RGS3 fusion proteins were eluted around 0.4 m NaCl. Peak fractions (three fractions) were pooled, concentrated to ∼0.1 ml by Centricon 30, divided into portions, and stored at −70 °C. The recombinant Gβ1γ2 was prepared from Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus constructs encoding Gβ1, Gγ2, and His-tagged Gαi1 according to the published procedure (19Iniguezlluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared using a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 along with a mixture of protease inhibitors for 20 min on ice. The detergent-insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to pure nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 10% milk in TTBS for 1 h and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of the primary antibody in 5% milk and 0.05% sodium azide in TTBS overnight. The blots were washed twice with TTBS before the addition of a biotinylated goat-anti rabbit immunoglobulin (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1:1500 in TTBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. After a 1-h incubation, the blot was washed twice with TTBS and then incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO). The signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The co-immunoprecipitations were performed using lysates (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, plus protease inhibitors) prepared from COS-7 cells or HEK 293 cells co-expressing Gβ1γ2 and various RGS proteins. Anti-FLAG monclonal antibody or anti-Gβ polyclonal antiserum was added, and the immunoprecipitates were collected with the appropriate secondary antibody-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal Corp., Lake Success, NY). They were washed three times in lysis buffer, twice in lysis buffer with 0.5m NaCl, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody. Inositol phosphate production was measured as previously described (20Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (1:8). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the culture media was replaced with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate for 2 h, after which 2 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and, 15 min later, 10 mmLiCl. The cells were incubated for an additional 14 h before washing with phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of 0.5 ml of 20 mm formic acid. Thirty min later the supernatant was collected, and a second extraction was performed. Each 1-ml extract was neutralized to pH 7.5 with 7.5 mm Hepes and 150 mm KOH. The supernatants were centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 × g, collected, and each loaded onto to a 0.5-ml Dowex AG-X8 column (Bio-Rad) that had been previously washed with 2 ml of 1 m NaOH, 2 ml of 1 m formic acid, and 5 washes of 5 ml of water. After loading the sample, the column was washed with 5 ml of water and 5 ml of 5 mm borax and 60 mm sodium formate. The columns were eluted with 3 ml of 0.9m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid. 0.2 ml of each elution was added to 10 ml of CytoScint and analyzed via scintillation counting. Equal numbers of HEK 293 (MAPK assay) or COS-7 (Akt assay) cells were plated on 10-cm plates at an approximate density of 5 × 105 cells/plate the day before transfection. The HEK 293 or COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pCMVHA-ERK1 or pCMV6Akt-HA and various RGS expression vectors using a standard calcium phosphate method or Superfect (Qiagen). Transfected DNA levels were normalized with control plasmids. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, HA- immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays using myelin basic protein (MAPK assay) or H2-B (Akt assay) as a substrate. The in vitro kinase assays were performed as previously described (21Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M.

Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Before the in vitro kinase assay the HA immunoprecipitates were washed three times with kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3V04, and 10% glycerol) to which a protease inhibitor mixture tablet was added), three times with a LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and three times with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The reactions were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The levels of HA-ERK1, Akt-HA, and RGS protein expression were detected by immunoblotting cell lysates. The autoradiographs were analyzed using NIH Image. Reactions were started by preincubation of GST-RGS3 fusion proteins (0.5–2 μg) and Gβγ subunits (0.5 μg) in a 25-μl volume for 10 min at 30 °C. After incubation, reaction tubes were transferred on ice and prepared for the PLC activity. PLC activity was measured as previously described (18Lee S.B. Shin S.H. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25952-25957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, substrate was prepared as sonicated micelles of 75 μm [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (10,000–12,000 cpm/assay) and 750 μmphosphatidylethanolamine. 10 ng of PLC-β2 was added to each tube, and CaCl2 was added to the assay mixture to give 200 nm free Ca2+. Assays were performed in 60-μl volume for 10 min at 30 °C. Under these conditions, [3H]IP3 formation was linear with respect to time and enzyme concentration. Since RGS3 possesses GAP activity for both Gαi and Gαq analyzing whether RGS3 modulates Gβγ signaling through either Gq- or Gi-coupled receptors is not feasible. However, the intracellular expression of Gβ1γ1, Gβ1γ5, or Gβ5γ5is known to activate PLCβ2, resulting in the production of intracellular inositol phosphates (23Wu D. Katz A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5297-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized Gβγ subunits target to the plasma membrane, where insufficient Gα subunits exist to form inactive heterotrimers. The free Gβγ subunits can activate PLCβ enzymatic activity, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, releasing the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Therefore, by concomitantly introducing a construct that expresses RGS3, we could test whether RGS3 modulates the production of inositol phosphates by free Gβγ subunits. We found that expression of Gβ1γ2 enhanced inositol phosphate production by COS-7 cells, co-expressing PLCβ2 7–9-fold over background levels. The introduction of RGS3 inhibited inositol phosphate production by nearly 70%, whereas two other RGS proteins, RGS4 and RGS10, did not impair inositol phosphate production in similar experiments (Fig. 2). The expression of RGS3 did not alter the levels of Gβ subunits or PLCβ2, although the transfected Gβ1 subunits co-migrate with the endogenous Gβ subunits. Thus, although RGS4 has better GAP activity for Gαi than does RGS3 and equivalent Gαqactivity (10Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarajah S. Chidiac P. Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), RGS4 does not impair Gβγ signaling to phospholipase Cβ like RGS3 does. Gβγ subunits directly activate other effectors beside PLCβ. Distinct sets of contacts along the edge of the β propeller of Gβ subunits are thought to establish the specificity of Gβγ for its effectors (24Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 25Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Through yet unknown effectors Gβγ subunits stimulate MAPK and Akt activation. Expression of Gβ1γ2 subunits in COS-7 cells enhances the activity of the MAPK ERK2 (26Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Therefore, by concomitantly expressing RGS3 we could test whether RGS3 inhibits a second Gβγ-signaling pathway. Rather than COS-7 cells, we used HEK 293 cells, thereby changing both the signaling pathway and the cell environment from the previous experiments. The introduction of Gβ1γ2 into HEK 293 increased ERK activation approximately 7-fold as assessed by the amount of phosphorylated substrate generated in an in vitro kinase assay. The introduction of RGS3 reduced Gβ1γ2-mediated ERK activation to the level observed in the absence of Gβ1γ2. In contrast, neither RGS4 nor RGS10 appreciably altered Gβ1γ2 signaling in these cells (Fig. 3). To test the importance of the N-terminal region of RGS3 and an intact RGS domain, we used three additional RGS3 constructs. The N-terminal portion of RGS3, expressed by the RGS3NT construct, did not block Gβ1γ2-mediated ERK activation but, rather, had a modest activating effect. The RGS3CT construct, which expressed the C-terminal portion of RGS3, amino acids 314–519, suppressed Gβ1γ2 MAPK activation as well as did wild type RGS3. The RGS3EN construct, which expressed an RGS3 with alanine (A) at positions 419 and 420 instead of glutamic acid (E) and asparagine (N), inhibited Gβ1γ2-induced ERK activation similar to that of wild type. A similar EN to AA mutation in RGS4 destroys its Gαi GAP activity and its inhibitory effect on lymphocyte chemotaxis (11Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 12851-12856Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indicating that RGS3 inhibits upstream in the MAPK pathway, it did not perturb the activation of ERK by an activated form of Ras (Fig. 3). Thus, to inhibit Gβ1γ2 activation of the MAPK pathway, RGS3 requires neither its N terminus nor an intact RGS domain. Besides MAPK activation, RGS3 also interfered with activation of Akt. Akt is implicated in pathways leading to cell survival in response to serum and growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 29Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), and several G protein-coupled receptors stimulate Akt activation in part by the release of Gβγ subunits from Gi and Gq(30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Expression of Gβ1γ2 in COS-7 cells has been shown to increase the activity of a co-expressed epitope-tagged version of Akt in an in vitro kinase assay (30Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We performed similar experiments in conjunction with constructs that express wild type or altered RGS proteins. Gβ1γ2 expression increased Akt activity severalfold, and the presence of RGS3, RGS3CT, or RGS3EN reduced it nearly to background levels. RGS3NT2 (amino acids 1–458) also significantly reduced Akt activation, especially since it did not express particularly well. RGS3NT, RGS3NT1 (amino acids 1–390), RGS2, and RGS4 had little effect (Fig. 4). Despite its inhibition of Gβ1γ2-induced Akt activation, RGS3 did not alter Akt activation by an activated form of Ras (Fig. 4). We also mapped the regions of RGS3 necessary for inhibiting Gβ1γ2-mediated phospholipase Cβ activation. We transfected COS-7 cells with constructs that expressed Gβ1γ2 and PLCβ2 in the presence or absence of constructs that expressed RGS3, RGS3CT, RGS3NT, RGS3NT1, RGS3NT2, or RGS4/3 and measured inositol phosphate production. The RGS4/3 construct encoded a fusion protein that included the first 58 amino acids of RGS4 along with amino acids 390–519 of RGS3. Similar to the MAPK experiments, RGS3CT inhibited inositol phosphate production by Gβ1γ2 even better than did RGS3. RGS3NT2, which lacked the C-terminal 61 amino acids of RGS3, behaved like wild RGS3 did. Comparison of RGS3, RGS3NT, RGS3NT1, and RGS3NT2 indicated that amino acids 314–390 and 391–458 both contributed to the inhibitory effect of RGS3 on Gβ1γ2signaling to phospholipase Cβ (Fig. 5). This differed slightly from the findings with Akt activation, where the RGS3NT1 construct did not impair activation. Transferring amino acids 390–519 to the N terminus of RGS4 conferred upon RGS4 the ability to inhibit Gβ1γ2 signaling equivalent to that of wild type RGS3, although not equivalent to RGS3CT. Overall these results show that RGS3 requires the residues between 314–390 and 391–458 to fully inhibit Gβ1γ2signaling. We determined whether RGS3 associated with Gβ1γ2 in vivo by co-transfecting HEK 293T cells with constructs directing the expression of full-length RGS3 and Gβ1γ2 and analyzing immunoprecipitates for the respective proteins. The FLAG antibody readily immunoprecipitated the FLAG-tagged RGS3 and in addition co-immunoprecipitated Gβγ subunits (Fig.6 A). Conversely, a polyclonal antibody directed against Gβ subunits immunoprecipitated both endogenous Gβγ subunits and the expressed Gβ1γ2 subunits and co-immunoprecipitated the FLAG-tagged RGS3 (Fig. 6 A). Control ERK and Myc antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate either FLAG-RGS3 or Gβγ subunits. Next, we examined whether RGS3 directly bound Gβγ subunits by combining recombinant His-tagged RGS3 with purified Gβγ subunits and then examined anti-His immunoprecipitates for RGS3 and Gβγ subunits. Anti-His immunoprecipitates contained both RGS3 and Gβγ subunits (Fig.6 B). In contrast, His-tagged Jun kinase failed to co-immunoprecipitate Gβγ subunits, and neither RGS3 nor Gβγ subunits immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody. These results indicate that RGS3 can directly bind Gβγ subunits. RGS3 expressed in cell lines localizes predominantly in the cytosol and can be shifted to membranes by G-protein signaling (11Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study indicates that endogenous RGS3 localizes predominantly in a membrane fraction rather than the cytosolic fraction of αT3–1 cells (31Neill J.D. Duck L.W. Sellers J.C. Musgrove L.C. Scheschonka A. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The RGS3 antiserum used in these experiments, while raised against recombinant RGS3, reacted only with RGS3 and not with RGS3CT. Here we used an anti-peptide antiserum prepared against a peptide from the N-terminal portion of RGS3. This antiserum recognized recombinant and transfected full-length RGS3 and detected a band that co-migrated with recombinant RGS3 in COS cells (10Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarajah S. Chidiac P. Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fractionation of COS-7 cells into a membrane-enriched and -depleted fractions revealed that the membrane-enriched fraction contained the majority of the RGS3, although some RGS3 also localized in the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). When we examined Gβ immunoprecipitates using the broadly reactive Gβ antiserum, we found that they contained small amounts of RGS3 (Fig. 6 C). Conversely, RGS3 immunoprecipitates also contained small amounts of Gβ subunits. Thus, in COS-7 cells, endogenous RGS3 localizes predominantly at intracellular or plasma membranes,"

In State 2, photosystem II activity was more inhibited by light than in State 1. In State 2, however, the D1 subunit was not degraded, whereas a substantial degradation was observed in State 1. These results suggest that photoinhibition occurs via the generation of an intermediate state in which photosystem II is inactive but the D1 protein is still intact. The accumulation of this state is enhanced in State 2, because in this State only cyclic photosynthetic electron transport is active, whereas there is no electron flow between photosystem II and the cytochromeb6 f complex (Finazzi, G., Furia, A., Barbagallo, R. P., and Forti, G. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1413, 117–129). The activity of photosystem I and of cytochrome b6f as well as the coupling of thylakoid membranes was not affected by illumination under the same conditions. This allows repairing the damages to photosystem II thanks to cell capacity to maintain a high rate of ATP synthesis (via photosystem I-driven cyclic electron flow). This capacity might represent an important physiological tool in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from excess of light as well as from other a-biotic stress conditions.

When light is absorbed in excess of what can actually be utilized by photochemistry, damage to the photosynthetic apparatus may be induced. Impairment of both photosystem I (PSI)1 (1Sonoike K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 37: 239-247Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and photosystem II (PSII) (2Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) has been described, and this loss of activity has been termed photoinhibition (3Powles S.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 15-44Crossref Google Scholar). It has been also shown that the degradation of the PSII reaction center D1 subunit is a major consequence of photoinhibition (2Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Some mechanisms contribute to protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from an excess of light (4Demmig-Adams B. Gilmore A.M. Adams W.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 5Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). The first is the so-called energy-dependent quenching, qE, i.e. the increased thermal dissipation in the PSII antennae that follows the generation of the electrochemical proton gradient across the thylakoid membranes. It is supposed to protect the reaction center from the consequences of a strong illumination by reducing the amount of energy present in the antenna protein complexes (6Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The second one (6Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) is state transitions, a phenomenon that has been discovered in Chlorella pyrenoidosa (7Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and inPorphyridium cruentum (8Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 172: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). It is a mechanism to balance light utilization between the two photosystems that is based on the reversible transfer of a fraction of the light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) from PSII to PSI (reviewed in Refs 9Bennett J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 11Gal A. Zer H. Ohad I. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 869-885Crossref Google Scholar). It is also supposed to protect PSII from photoinhibition inasmuch as it can decrease the size of its antenna. The migration of LHCII to PSI (State 1-State 2 transition) results from the phosphorylation of the former by a membrane-bound protein kinase, which is activated under reducing conditions (reviewed in Refs. 9Bennett J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholarand12). Under oxidizing conditions, the kinase is deactivated, and LHCII is dephosphorylated by a thylakoid-bound phosphatase, which is possibly regulated by the recently discovered immunophilin-like 40-kDa lumenal TLP protein (13Fulgosi H. Vener A.V. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1577-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After dephosphorylation, LHCII rebinds to PSII (State 2-State 1 transition). In higher plants, only a small fraction of the LHCII (15–20%, reviewed in Ref. 10Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) migrates reversibly from PSII to PSI. In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, on the contrary, a much larger fraction of the PSII antenna is transferred during State 1-State 2 transition (14Delosme R. Béal D. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 56-64Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and a much larger decrease of PSII energy capture is accordingly observed (15Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, cytochromeb6 f complexes accumulate in the unstacked lamellae in State 2 (16Vallon O. Bulté L. Dainese P. Olive J. Bassi R. Wollman F.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8262-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is unlikely that state transitions serve the purpose of balancing the absorption of PSII and PSI in Chlamydomonas. Instead, State 2 would represent a structural condition where most of the excitation energy is utilized by PSI photochemistry so that cyclic electron transport around PSI is likely to prevail over linear electron flow that involves both PSI and PSII. In agreement with this idea, Finazzi et al. (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) show that although the cytochrome b6 f turnover was the same in State 1 and State 2, it was completely inhibited by the addition of the PSII inhibitor DCMU in State 1, whereas no effect of this inhibitor was observed in State 2. This result led Finazziet al. (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) to propose that in State 2 the reducing equivalents involved in the reduction of the cytochromeb6 f are not produced at the level of PSII but rather at the level of PSI. Under these conditions PSII is not connected to the intersystem electron carriers but is still photochemically active (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this lack of functional connection between PSII and cytochrome b6 f complex might affect the sensitivity of the former to photoinhibition, we have measured the effects of strong illumination on fluorescence emission, O2 evolution, and cytochrome f reduction in algae under State 1 or State 2 conditions. We have found that PSII is more prone to photoinhibition in State 2. However, in this state the loss of activity is not accompanied by a degradation of the D1 protein. The effect on PSII seems to be rather specific as neither PSI nor cytochrome b6 f activities nor the coupling of thylakoid membranes were affected by the treatment. Thus, we suggest that state transitions in C. reinhardtiirepresent a means to maintain a high ATP synthesis capacity, even when damages to PSII are induced by illumination with extremely intense light. C. reinhardtiiwild type (from strain 137C) was kindly provided by the Laboratoire de Physiologie Membranaire du Chloroplaste at the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique of Paris (France). Cells were grown at 24 °C in acetate-supplemented medium (18Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 83-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under 60 μE m−2 s−1 of continuous white light. They were harvested during exponential growth and resuspended at the required chlorophyll concentration in an high salt minimal medium (19Sueoka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). The use of this medium prevented the spontaneous transition to State 2 otherwise observed in the presence of acetate (see Ref. 20Endo T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 551-555Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 2F.-A. Wollman, personal communication.Chlorophyll concentration was measured as the absorbance at 680 nm of the cell cultures in a spectrophotometer equipped with a scatter attachment on the basis of a calibration curve constructed after extraction of the chlorophyll with 80% acetone. State 1 was obtained through incubation of the cells in the dark under strong agitation, whereas State 2 was obtained through dark incubation in anaerobic conditions obtained by argon bubbling. Photoinhibition was performed by illuminating the sample with white light on a thin layer (∼1 mm) of cells in a Petri dish ([chlorophyll] = 500 μg ml−1) at room temperature. The light was screened with a layer of water and infrared- and UV-absorbing filters. The intensity of the light reaching the sample was 2300 μE m−2 s−1. We ensured that the layer of cells was sufficiently thin to minimize mutual shadowing. When indicated, plastidial protein synthesis was inhibited by adding lincomycin at the final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were collected at the indicated times and used in the different experiments at the required chlorophyll concentration. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured as the O2 exchange with a Clark-type electrode (Radiometer, Denmark) at 24 °C. The actinic light was filtered through a heat filter, and its intensity was 850 μE m−2s−1. Fluorescence was measured in the same chamber used for O2 recordings using a PAM fluorometer (Walz, Germany). Spectroscopic measurements were performed on whole cells at room temperature using a homemade spectrophotometer as described by Joliot et al. (21Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-216Crossref Google Scholar). In continuous light experiments, actinic light was provided by a light-emitting diode array, placed on both sides of the cuvette. Its intensity was 1500 μE m−2s−1. Measurements were performed on algae kept under State 1 conditions obtained through a strong agitation in the dark in air. Estimation of the rates of cytochrome fturnover was done using a procedure previously employed (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, starting from the consideration that the rate of cytochromef oxidation and reduction is the same at steady state, the latter can be expressed as df −/dt = [f−] × kox × [PC+], where [f−] is the fraction of reduced cytochrome f, and kox × [PC+] represents the product of the second order rate constant for cytochrome foxidation times the concentration of oxidized plastocyanin. Both parameters can be easily calculated experimentally from the traces of Fig. 3; [f−] is estimated comparing the plateau absorption level measured in the absence and presence of DBMIB, whereaskox × [PC+] is given by the initial rate of cytochrome f oxidation provided that it is measured when its reduction is inhibited, i.e. in the presence of DBMIB. In single turnover flash experiments, excitation was provided by a xenon lamp (EG&G). Light was filtered through a Schott filter (RG 695) and was of saturating intensity. Measurements were performed on algae kept in State 2 to ensure dark reduction of the plastoquinone pool. Repetitive (usually 10) illuminations were performed at the frequency of 0.15 Hz. The transmembrane potential was estimated from the amplitude of the electrochromic shift at 515 nm, which is known to give a linear response with respect to the electric component of the transmembrane potential (22Junge W. Witt H.T. Z. Naturforsch. 1968; 24: 1038-1041Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed here, the kinetics of the electrochromic signal exhibited two phases previously characterized in Joliot and Delosme (23Joliot P. Delosme R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 357: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar): a fast phase (phase a), associated with PSI and PSII charge separation, and a slow phase, which develops in the millisecond time scale and is associated with the turnover of the cytochrome b6 fcomplex (phase b). The kinetics of phase b was deconvoluted from membrane potential decay assuming that the latter process exhibited first-order kinetics. Phase b was then computed considering that the rate of membrane potential decay between two consecutive acquisitions was linearly related to its mean value in the same interval. Cytochrome f redox changes were evaluated as the difference between the absorption at 554 nm and a base line drawn between 545 and 573 nm. We have checked that this procedure for deconvolution of cytochrome f signals was reliable also in the case of continuous illumination (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For protein analysis, algae were collected at the indicated times, washed in 20 mm HEPES containing protease inhibitors (200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm amino-ε-caproic acid, and 1 mmbenzamidine) and 1 mm lincomycin, and resuspended in 100 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mmNa2CO3. The algae were then solubilized in the presence of 2% SDS and 20% (w/v) sucrose at 100 °C for 1 min. Polypeptides were separated by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 6 m urea. Immunoblotting was performed with monospecific polyclonal antibodies against D1, as described in Barbato et al. (24Barbato R. Shipton C.A. Giacometti G.M. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of state transitions on the sensitivity of C. reinhardtii to photoinhibition, we have performed experiments on cells placed either in State 1 or in State 2. We have measured fluorescence emission, photosynthetic activity (as O2 evolution), and the rate of cytochrome freduction after exposure to strong illumination. The measurements were performed on the same batch of algae, collected either before starting the light treatment or after different irradiation times. Illumination of the algae with high light intensity largely modified their fluorescence emission parameters; a large decrease of the maximal fluorescence emission (Fm) was observed in State 1 cells (Fig.1 A), whereas an increase of the minimal one (Fo) occurred in State 2 (Fig. 1 B). This suggests that the consequences of illumination on the photosynthetic apparatus of Chlamydomonas were not identical in the two conditions. In both cases, however, the effect of illumination was to reduce the Fv/Fm ratio (Fig. 1 C), a parameter related to the photochemical efficiency of PSII (25Butler W.L. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1978; 29: 345-378Crossref Google Scholar). This indicates that PSII was the major target of photoinhibition in both State 1 and State 2. The Fv/Fm decline was reversible in the dark, unless an inhibitor of protein synthesis, lincomycin, was present in the medium (not shown). The addition of this compound during illumination enhanced the photoinhibition, and its effect was larger in State 2 (Fig.1 D). Samples were also collected to measure the effects of illumination on the photosynthetic O2 evolution. To this aim, State 1 was re-established (by oxygenation in the dark) in algae preilluminated in State 2 before O2 evolution was recorded. We have already shown indeed that no oxygen is evolved by the algae in State 2 (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). During the State 2 to State 1 transition, no recovery of inhibition occurred; after the transition to State 1, the Fv/Fm of State 2-treated algae was still largely inhibited if compared with an untreated (State 1) sample (not shown). The oxygen evolution rates (measured before and after the photoinhibitory treatment) are shown in TableI. No decrease of oxygen evolution was observed in both State 1- and State 2-illuminated samples in the absence of lincomycin. In its presence, a loss of activity was observed, which was again larger in State 2- than in State 1-treated cells.Table IEffects of photoinhibition on photosynthetic oxygen evolution in Chlamydomonas cellsTimeState 1State 2ControlLincomycin, 1 mmControlLincomycin, 1 mmmin0105 ± 10104 ± 598 ± 10112 ± 1020110 ± 8106 ± 793 ± 1125 ± 1130109 ± 11100 ± 1097 ± 1113.5 ± 860111 ± 983 ± 8100 ± 99 ± 690108 ± 1054 ± 699 ± 79 ± 9Oxygen evolution and consumption were measured by a Clark-type electrode at a chlorophyll concentration of 20 μg ml−1 in the presence of 5 mm NaHCO3. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate (μmol mg−1 chlorophyll h−1) is expressed as the sum of O2 evolution (in the light) and consumption (in the dark). The latter was not affected by the treatment. Other conditions are as in Fig. 1. Light intensity was 850 μE m−2 s−1. Data represent the result of five different experiments. Open table in a new tab Oxygen evolution and consumption were measured by a Clark-type electrode at a chlorophyll concentration of 20 μg ml−1 in the presence of 5 mm NaHCO3. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate (μmol mg−1 chlorophyll h−1) is expressed as the sum of O2 evolution (in the light) and consumption (in the dark). The latter was not affected by the treatment. Other conditions are as in Fig. 1. Light intensity was 850 μE m−2 s−1. Data represent the result of five different experiments. A more direct way to characterize the effects of irradiation on PSII photochemical activity would be to measure directly the rate of plastoquinone reduction. It is very difficult to measure this parameter in vivo, where the redox changes associated to PQH2 formation (observed around 260 nm) are largely masked by other absorption signals. However, it is possible to obtain this information indirectly by measuring the rate of cytochromef reduction. This rate can be expressed indeed as kred × [f·Fe3+S·bl+ ·bh] × [PQH2], where kred is the second order rate constant for plastoquinol oxidation, [f·Fe3+S·bl+ ·bh] represents the concentration of active cytochromeb6 f complexes, and [PQH2] expresses the concentration of plastoquinol. Although [PQH2] is proportional to the fraction of active PSII, at least in State 1 conditions (Ref. 17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, see also below), the product kred × [f·Fe3+S·bl+ ·bh] depends on the catalytic efficiency of the cytochrome complex. Therefore, it is important first to check that the turnover rate of cytochrome b6 f complex per se is not affected by the photoinhibitory treatment. Only in this case, the product kred × [f·Fe3+S·bl+ ·bh] can be taken as a constant, and the cytochrome f reduction rate can be used to obtain information on PSII activity. The intrinsic cytochrome b6 f activity can be easily measured in State 2 conditions (i.e.anaerobiosis) under a single turnover flash illumination regime of low actinic light frequency. In these conditions indeed the PQ pool is fully rereduced in the dark time between two consecutive illuminations (26Finazzi G. Buschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F.-A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the catalytic properties of the complex can be studied independently of the rate of PQ photoreduction. Thus, the kinetics of cytochrome b6f under single flash illumination was always measured in State 2: State 1 preilluminated cells were dark-adapted to anaerobiosis before their cytochromeb6 f kinetics were measured. Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of the electrochromic shift (panels A and B) and of cytochrome f redox changes (panel C andD) measured before and after a photoinhibitory treatment ofC. reinhardtii. The slow phase of the electrochromic shift (phase b, see “Materials and Methods”) and cytochrome fredox changes are representative of electron injection into the low and high potential electron transfer chains of the cytochromeb6 f complex, respectively (23Joliot P. Delosme R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 357: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 26Finazzi G. Buschlen S. de Vitry C. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Wollman F.-A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2867-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that all the electron transfer steps that follow plastoquinol oxidation were not affected by the photoinhibitory illumination. No differences were observed between cells treated in State 1 and State 2 (not shown). During the measurements, PSII activity was inhibited with DCMU and hydroxylamine (27Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Their addition did not affect cytochromeb6 f kinetics (as expected, since it does not depend on PSII activity in State 2, see above) but reduced the amplitude of the fast phase of the electrochromic signal (phase a) because of the loss of PSII photochemistry. In the presence of DCMU and hydroxylamine, phase a only depends on PSI-driven charge separation. Its constancy before and after the photoinhibitory treatment (Fig. 2, A and B) suggests that PSI was not affected by photoinhibition in our conditions. The treatment did not affect the permeability of the thylakoid membrane either, as indicated by the finding that the addition of a ionophore induced the same acceleration of cytochromeb6 f turnover in both untreated and treated cells. The kinetic effect of ionophores is quantitatively related to the magnitude of the electrochemical proton gradient (reviewed in Ref. 28Bendall D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 119-151Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), i.e. to the permeability of membrane to ions. This conclusion is in agreement with previous results with isolated thylakoid membranes (29Barenyi B. Krause G.H. Planta. 1985; 163: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Forti G. Barbagallo R.P. Inversini B. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 59: 215-222Crossref Google Scholar). Having ascertained that the intrinsic activity of PSI and cytochromeb6 f complex was not affected by photoinhibition, we have estimated the consequences of illumination on PSII by measuring the turnover rate of cytochrome f under steady state illumination conditions, as stated above. Fig. 3 shows the results of such measurements in the case of one representative experiment. Panels A and B refer to measurements performed on dark-adapted algae under both State 1 (A) and State 2 (B). Similar cytochrome f kinetics was observed in both states; switching the light on generated an oxidation signal (absorption decrease) that rapidly attained a plateau level. After the light was switched off, a reduction was observed that brought the signal to its initial level. In State 1 and State 2 conditions, the extent of the oxidation signal was equally sensitive to the addition of DBMIB, an inhibitor of cytochrome f reduction by plastoquinol (31Frank K. Trebst A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3, A and B, compare squares andtriangles). DCMU, which blocks plastoquinone reduction by PSII (27Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), inhibited electron flow only in State 1 cells (circles). This result confirms previous findings from Finazzi et al. (17Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) that the transition from State 1 to State 2 corresponds to a shift from a linear (involving PSII and PSI) to a cyclic (involving only PSI) electron transport system. Therefore, in State 2 it is not possible to measure PSII activity on the basis of cytochrome f turnover. For this reason, the consequences of preillumination on cytochrome f kinetics in the case of continuous illumination regime were measured in State 1, at variance with single flash measurements. In State 2-preilluminated cells, State 1 was re-established by dark oxygenation of the cells. The same treatment did not affect the rate of electron transfer in dark-adapted cells (not shown). Panels C and D of Fig. 3 present the results of such measurements. In the absence of lincomycin, no differences were observed between preilluminated and dark-adapted cells (squares). The steady state redox level of cytochrome f was more oxidized, however, in lincomycin-treated samples (asterisks). This suggests that photoinhibition reduced the rate of plastoquinol generation by PSII in the presence of the antibiotic, in agreement with the finding that O2 evolution was inhibited (Table I). This conclusion is also in agreement with previous results obtained under similar experimental conditions in higher plant leaves (32Chow W.S. Hope A.B. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 25: 775-784Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Again, the consequences were more severe in the case of State 2- than State 1-treated cells (compare C and D, asterisks). In untreated cells, lincomycin did not affect cytochrome f turnover (not shown). The time courses of the decrease in PSII-driven cytochrome f electron flow are shown in TableII.Table IIEffect of photoinhibition on the electron flow through cytochrome b6fTimeState 1State 2ControlLincomycin, 1 mmControlLincomycin, 1 mmmin070 ± 565 ± 768 ± 574 ± 52065 ± 656 ± 767 ± 618 ± 33079 ± 748 ± 362 ± 49 ± 46071 ± 735 ± 465 ± 56 ± 49066 ± 826 ± 570 ± 63 ± 3The rates of cytochrome f reduction were calculated from traces as in Fig. 3 as explained under “Materials and Methods”.

Open table in a new tab The rates of cytochrome f reduction were calculated from traces as in Fig. 3 as explained under “Materials and Methods”. Rates are expressed as mol e− s−1. Data represent the result of five independent experiments. All the measurements performed so far indicate that the activity of PSII is decreased by photoinhibition both in State 1 and State 2 provided that lincomycin is added to the cell suspension. This loss of activity is generally associated to a damage of the D1 subunit of PSII, which is subsequently rapidly degraded (see e.g. Refs. 2Ohad I. Kyle D.J. Arntzen C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 33Kyle D.J. Ohad I. Arntzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4070-4074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To verify if this was the case in our conditions, we have measured the amount of D1 in both State 1- and State 2-treated samples using an immunoblotting essay (Fig. 4). We found remarkable differences between State 1 and State 2 cells; although the amount of D1 was reduced upon photoinhibition in State 1-treated cells, no substantial degradation was observed in State 2 despite a massive loss of PSII activity (Fig. 4 A). It has previously been demonstrated that DCMU protects the D1 protein from degradation (34Trebst A. Depka B. Kraft B. Johanni"

Prominent among the former are associations within the spectrin-actin skeleton (often termed horizontal interactions), and bridges between the membrane skeleton and various membrane-spanning proteins (frequently called vertical interactions) (1Lux S.E.

Other studies aimed at manually disrupting the band 3-ankyrin-spectrin bridge also document a causal relationship between rupture of the bridge and loss of normal cell morphology and stability (6Low P.S. Willardson B.M. Narla M. Rossi M. Shohet S. Blood. 1991; 77: 1581-1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for the importance of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1-spectrin/actin bridge to membrane shape and flexibility also stems from investigations of natural defects in the bridging components. Thus, deficiencies in either protein 4.1 or glycophorin C commonly result in elliptocytic cells with compromised mechanical properties. However, although such observations might initially be construed to suggest that the protein 4.1-mediated bridge to the membrane skeleton is critical to membrane stability, observations by Narla and colleagues (17Alloisio N.

Chem. 1992; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) raise questions regarding the validity of such an hypothesis. Thus, quantitative investigations of the above elliptocytic cells have revealed that a natural deficiency in glycophorin C is invariably accompanied by a decrease in protein 4.1 (17Alloisio N. Dalla Venezia N. Rana A. Andrabi K. Texier P. Gilsanz F. Cartron F.P. Delaunay J. Chishti A.H. Blood. 1993; 82: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Gascard P. Cohen C.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that reconstitution of only the spectrin-actin binding domain of protein 4.1 into protein 4.1-deficient cells fully restores the membrane's mechanical properties (19Takakuwa Y. Tchernia G. Rossi M. Benabadji M. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Because the above reconstitution procedure does not re-establish protein 4.1's attachment to glycophorin C or the lipid bilayer, these data suggest that the protein 4.1-mediated bridge has little impact on membrane stability. In order to examine the contribution of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1-spectrin/actin tether to red cell membrane structure in greater detail, we have undertaken to manually disrupt the bridge without compromising protein 4.1's established role in stabilizing the spectrin-actin junctional complex. For this purpose, we have explored methods to break the protein 4.1-mediated tether in intact cells and have examined the impact of this rupture on membrane mechanical properties. We report here four novel and one previously published protocol for weakening/severing the protein 4.1 linkage to glycophorin C. Although not all of the protocols allow for an unambiguous evaluation of the role of the glycophorin C linkage in establishing membrane mechanical properties, the collective results support the contention that the glycophorin C-protein 4.1-spectrin/actin bridge does not contribute prominently to membrane stability. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), staurosporine, and calyculin A were purchased from Calbiochem. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), anti-actin antibody, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) were purchased from Sigma. Human blood was drawn by venipuncture into acid citrate dextrose anticoagulant following informed consent and used on the same day as withdrawal. RBCs were sedimented at 800 ×g for 5 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and added to an α-cellulose-Sigma Cell column to remove white cells and platelets. Collected RBCs were then washed with HEPES buffer (125 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 16 mmHEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and resuspended in the same buffer prior to subjection to one of the following protocols for severing glycophorin C-protein 4.1 interactions. In the first methodology, washed RBCs were incubated at 40% hematocrit for 1 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate. Phosphoenolpyruvate is rapidly transported into erythrocytes and converted to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (21Inoue H. Moriyasu M. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7635-7638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is reported to inhibit protein 4.1 binding to the red cell membrane in vitro (22Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Workman R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10990-10996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a second protocol, RBCs at 5% hematocrit were loaded with Ca2+ by treatment with 1 μmA23187 and various calcium-EGTA buffers (23Perrin D.D. Dempsey B. Buffers for pH and Metal Ion Control. Chapman and Hall, London1979: 94-108Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C. The influx of Ca2+ would be expected to down-regulate protein 4.1-membrane interactions based on its ability to prevent 4.1 binding to band 3 and glycophorin C in vitro (24Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6360-6367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Third, RBCs at 5% hematocrit were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.1 μm phorbol ester (PMA dissolved in Me2SO) in order to activate protein kinase C (26Cohen C.M. Foley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7701-7709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As controls, the inactive analog of PMA, 4α-PDD, or an equal volume of Me2SO was added to analogous cell suspensions. Whenever protein kinase or phosphatase inhibitors were also employed, they were added to the red cell suspensions 30 min prior to PMA treatment. Fourth, RBCs suspended at 5% hematocrit in deoxygenated HEPES buffer were bubbled with N2 gas for ∼5–30 min (depending on the volume of the suspension) at room temperature to deoxygenate the cells. To evaluate the reversibility of this treatment, reoxygenation was carried out by mixing the deoxygenated RBCs in oxygenated HEPES buffer. Finally, RBCs at 5% hematocrit were equilibrated for 3 h in MES buffers (27Gedde M.M. Huestis W.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1220-1233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) of pHs ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.4. After the desired incubations, packed RBCs were collected and mixed with an equal volume of PBS. Membrane skeletons were then isolated by incubating the suspensions in two volumes of 1% C12E8 (Nikko Chemical Co.) in PBS supplemented with 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA, and 80 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was loaded onto a 35% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 85,500 × g for 90 min to separate the solubilized membrane components from the pelleted membrane skeletons. The pellet was solubilized in SDS buffer, and its protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay. Samples dissolved in SDS sample buffer were separated on 10% Laemmli gels, as described elsewhere (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar). After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) for 1 h in 5% milk-TBST (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5). The nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-glycophorin C antibody (BRIC 10, a kind gift from D. J. Anstee, International Blood Group Reference Library, Bristol, United Kingdom), anti-actin, anti-adducin (a kind gift from V. Bennett, Duke University, Durham, NC), anti-band 3, anti-protein 4.1, or anti-glycophorin A in 1% milk-TBST for 1 h. The resulting nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times with 0.1% milk-TBST, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 1% milk-TBST for 30 min, and washed three times with 0.1% milk-TBST. Finally, the membranes were incubated with ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray film. When reprobing the same nitrocellulose sheet was necessary, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 45 min at 70 °C, washed three times with TBST, and then relabeled with a different antibody and developed, as described above. Quantitation of the glycophorin C content in the membrane skeletons by densitometry was invariably performed by normalizing its staining intensity to that of actin in the same gel lane. Using this method, the glycophorin C content of control membranes at pH 7.4 was arbitrarily set at 100%. RBCs suspended at 50% hematocrit in HEPES buffer were incubated with 0.5 mCi of 32PO4/ml of packed cells for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with HEPES buffer before PMA treatment and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described above. Identification of phosphorylated membrane polypeptides was made by analyzing the resulting polyacrylamide gel on a phosphorimager (Cyclone, Packard Instrument Co.). The concentration of 2,3-BPG in deproteinized extracts of phosphoenolpyruvate-treated erythrocytes was measured using a Sigma diagnostic kit. Briefly, red cells were suspended at 50% hematocrit in PBS, mixed with three volumes of trichloroacetic acid, and pelleted at 8000 ×g. The supernatant was neutralized with NaOH and mixed with a triethanolamine assay mixture containing NADH, ATP, phosphoglycerate mutase, 3-phosphoglycerate phosphokinase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The conversion of NADH to NAD was initiated by addition of phosphoglycolate, and the amount of 2,3-BPG in the extracts was calculated from the amount of NADH consumed, using the absorbance at 340 nm to quantitate NADH consumption. After the desired treatment, packed RBCs were suspended in 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mr 360,000) in PBS and examined by the ektacytometry, a laser diffraction method described elsewhere (29Johnson R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 35-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, suspended cells were subjected either to increasing osmolality (from 50 to 500 mosmol/kg) at constant shear stress or to constant osmolality at increasing shear stress (0–250 dynes/cm2), and the axial ratio of the deformed cells was quantitated by laser diffraction and designated as their deformability index (DI). A measurement of DI as a function of osmolality and shear stress can provide information on both the hydration of the cell and the flexibility of the membrane. For stability measurements, packed RBCs were lysed in 40 volumes of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and pelleted at 20,000 ×g. After centrifugation, the lysed cells were resealed by adding 20 volumes of PBS and incubating for 45 min at 37 °C. The resealed ghosts were washed one time in PBS, resuspended in a 35% dextran-phosphate buffer, and analyzed by ektacytometry at constant high shear stress (785 dynes/cm2), as described above. The decline in deformability with time derives from the mechanical fragmentation of the membranes into nondeformable vesicles. The half-time for this shear-induced fragmentation to reach completion can be used as a measure of the membrane's mechanical stability (30Mohandas N. Clark M.R. Health B.P. Rossi M. Wolfe L.C. Lux S.E. Shohet S.B. Blood. 1982; 59: 768-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the rate of filtration of an RBC suspension through a highly uniform nickel mesh filter was conducted by a gravity-based, vertical tube method (31Arai K. Iino M. Shio H. Uyesaka N. Biorheology. 1990; 27: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that measures the rate of passage of erythrocytes through the filter as a function of hydrostatic pressure (Tsukusa Sokken Co., Tokyo, Japan). The pore diameter of the nickel mesh used in this study was 4.6 μm. From a height (pressure)-time curve obtained during the filtration analysis, a pressure-flow rate relationship can be determined. The filtration was started at a pressure of 150 mm H2O, and the percentage of the flow rate (ml/min) of the RBC suspension (0.1% hematocrit) relative to that of the suspending medium at 100 mm H2O was taken as the index of RBC filterability. A variety of observations in the literature, stemming primarily from studies on purified membrane components, have suggested that the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 bridge to the membrane skeleton might be physiologically regulated (22Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Workman R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10990-10996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Anderson R.A. Marchesi V.T. Nature. 1985; 318: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Chao T.S. Tao M.

However, except for the impact of protein kinase C phosphorylation on this bridging function (35Pinder J.C. Gardner B. Gratzer W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 210: 478-482Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), none of the potential regulatory pathways has been validated in intact erythrocytes. As a tool for investigating the significance of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1- spectrin/actin bridge to membrane mechanical properties, we have undertaken to characterize methods that might sever this bridge in intact erythrocytes. Although not all of the hypothetical mechanisms could be validated in situ, those that were confirmed (or newly discovered) will be briefly characterized below, since they reveal much about the possible regulation of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1-spectrin/actin bridge in vivo. Where such treatments also shed light on the function of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 bridge, they will be further evaluated for their impacts on cell stability and deformability. In a previous study (22Moriyama R. Lombardo C.R. Workman R. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10990-10996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we demonstrated that 2,3-BPG inhibited protein 4.1 binding to stripped inside-out erythrocyte membrane vesicles. More detailed studies with antibodies to band 3 and glycophorin C further established that protein 4.1 binding to both membrane-spanning proteins was specifically prevented by BPG. In an effort to test the impact of elevated 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate on protein 4.1's bridging functionin situ, we incubated RBCs with PEP, a membrane-permeable glycolytic substrate that is rapidly metabolized to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and lactate in situ (21Inoue H. Moriyasu M. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7635-7638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calibration of this method in whole erythrocytes reveals that cytoplasmic BPG levels can be elevated in direct proportion to the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate added (Fig.1 A). By 25 mmexternal PEP, intracellular BPG rises to 9.3 mm, essentially twice its normal value. To evaluate the influence of BPG on the protein 4.1-glycophorin C linkage in situ, PEP loaded RBCs were injected into a 1% solution of the nondenaturating detergent, C12E8, and their membrane skeletons were isolated on a sucrose density gradient. As shown in Fig. 1 B, at low PEP concentrations (0–10 mm), where the total intracellular BPG content was ≤6 mm, little change in glycophorin C retention in the membrane skeletons was observed. However, as PEP concentration was elevated, cytosolic BPG increased and glycophorin C retention in the membrane skeletons was strongly hindered. By 9 mm BPG (25 mm PEP), only 48 ± 8% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) of the original glycophorin C remained in the membrane skeletons. Because the protein 4.1 content of these skeletal preparations was essentially unaltered (data not shown), we conclude that BPG can sever the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 bridge without displacing protein 4.1 from the spectrin skeleton. Unfortunately, PEP loading was also observed to induce hemoglobin oxidation (probably due to depletion of NADH via the lactate dehydrogenase reaction), leading to hemichrome deposition on the membrane (data not shown). Because hemichrome precipitation can independently rigidify the membrane (36McPherson R.A. Sawyer W.H. Tilley L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), evaluation of the treated cell's mechanical properties was not pursued. Nevertheless, the biochemical data do suggest that endogenous changes in BPG, such as those that occur during oxygenation/deoxygenation (37Brewer G.J. Eaton J.W. Science. 1971; 171: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), might have the potential to regulate the protein 4.1-glycophorin C bridge in vivo. Previous studies from our laboratory (24Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and others (38Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24540-24546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have shown that Ca2+ plus calmodulin can block protein 4.1 binding to glycophorin C. In fact, a recent crystallographic structure of the N-terminal 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1 reveals that calmodulin associates at a central site on protein 4.1 and that calmodulin's occupancy of this site should obstruct protein 4.1's interaction with glycophorin C, p55, and band 3 (39Han B.G. Nunomura W. Wu H. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 187-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ca2+ influx might regulate the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 bridge in vivo, fresh erythrocytes were treated with a Ca2+ ionophore (1 μmA23187) and equilibrated with various concentrations of Ca2+ using Ca2+-EGTA buffers. As shown in Fig.2 A, increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration indeed releases glycophorin C from its attachment to the membrane skeleton. Although no change in skeletal composition could be detected up to 0.1 mmextracellular Ca2+, by 0.3 mm Ca2+a 14% (n = 4) decline in glycophorin C content was observed, and by 1 mm Ca2+, glycophorin C retention in the membrane skeletons was reduced by 75% (n = 2). Curiously, adducin binding was affected similarly to glycophorin C, whereas the band 3 and protein 4.1 contents in the membrane skeletons remained essentially unchanged. We conclude from these data that Ca2+ can indeed modulate the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 bridge in situ, as predicted by studies in simplified systems (24Lombardo C.R. Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1196: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24540-24546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but that measurable changes only occur when intracellular Ca2+ concentrations exceed those experienced by healthy cells. Analysis of the mechanical properties of the Ca2+-loaded erythrocytes was complicated by unwanted side effects of Ca2+ on several unrelated red cell systems. Even when internal and external [K+] were balanced to prevent Ca2+-activated K+ efflux and cell shrinkage (40Gardos G. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1983; 258: 5300-5305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (note the protein 4.1 near the top of the gel in Fig. 2 A that was presumably cross-linked through γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine bridges by the RBC transglutaminase), and adducin release (Fig. 2 A) either preceded or coincided with the Ca2+-induced release of glycophorin C. Thus, although the maximum deformability index (DImax) and filterability of the K+ balanced erythrocyte suspensions declined by 15% (Fig. 2 B) and 44% (Fig. 2 C) at 500 μm Ca2+, respectively, in comparison to the DImax and filterability of normal erythrocytes, it was not possible to assign the decline to a rupture of the protein 4.1 bridge. In fact, since no changes in deformability or filterability were observed at 0.3 mmCa2+, where protein 4.1 release from glycophorin C had already begun (Fig. 2 A), the absence of any causal relationship between the two processes would seem more plausible. During our search for physiological modulators of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 bridge, we reasoned that RBCs might be capable of responding to entrapment in the microvasculature by becoming more flexible. Based on this speculation, we examined the impact of RBC deoxygenation on the integrity of the glycophorin C-protein 4.1 linkage. Deoxygenated RBCs were generated by bubbling N2 through the cell suspension, and membrane skeletons were isolated by plunging the deoxygenated cells directly into C12E8 detergent solution before any reoxygenation could occur. As seen in Fig.3 A, less glycophorin C was retained in membrane skeletons from deoxygenated cells than oxygenated cells. Densitometric analysis, in fact, indicates that glycophorin C's content was reduced 30 ± 16% (n = 4) following O2 removal. Restoration of O2 by washing the cells in O2-saturated buffer also restores the glycophorin C content to its normal level (Fig. 3 A), demonstrating that O2-mediated rupture of the 4.1 bridge is fully reversible. To further confirm that RBC oxygenation can regulate protein 4.1's bridging function, RBCs were treated with 10 mm dithionite to chemically consume the erythrocyte's O2, an"
https://openalex.org/W2164543590,"A hallmark of many inflammatory diseases is the destruction of tissue cells by infiltrating hematopoietic cells including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. The regulation of apoptosis of both target tissue cells and the infiltrating cells is one of the key events that defines the initiation and the progression of inflammation. However, the precise picture of the apoptosis regulation of the cells at the inflammatory sites is still unclear. We recently isolated a novel apoptosis inhibitory factor, termed AIM, which is secreted exclusively by tissue macrophages. In this report, we present unique characteristics of AIM associated with liver inflammation (hepatitis), identified by introducing an experimental hepatitis in both AIM-transgenic mice, which overexpress AIM in the body, and normal mice. First, endogenous AIM expression in macrophages is rapidly increased in response to inflammatory stimuli. Second, AIM appears to inhibit the death of macrophages in the inflammatory regions, judging by the remarkably increased number of macrophages observed in the liver from transgenic mice. In addition, we show that AIM also enhances the phagocytosis by macrophages, which emphasizes the multifunctional character of AIM. All these findings strongly provoke an idea that AIM may play an important role in hepatitis pathogenesis in a sequential manner; first AIM expression is up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli, and then in an autocrine fashion, AIM supports the survival of infiltrating macrophages as well as enhances phagocytosis by macrophages, which may result in an efficient clearance of dead cells and infectious or toxic reagents.

In addition to apoptosis of tissue cells, apoptosis regulation of infiltrating cells also seems to influence the progression of inflammation. This indication was recently drawn by the observation of non-obese diabetic mice, a mouse model of human autoimmune diabetes (type I diabetes), under CD95-deficient conditions, which were free from destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells by the infiltrating T-lymphocytes. In these mice, a defect of CD95 appeared to decrease apoptotic death of T-lymphocytes infiltrating into the pancreatic Langerhans islets, resulting in the prevention of tissue damage (28Kim Y.H.

Thus, the regulation of both target tissue cells and infiltrating cells influence the progression of inflammatory diseases.However, we are essentially ignorant of the negative (inhibitory) regulation of apoptosis at the inflammatory sites, although apoptosis must be regulated both positively and negatively, and the balance of these two regulations may critically influence the inflammation progression. This is mainly because the extracellular ligands produced at the inflammatory sites that mediate inhibitory signals for apoptosis have not been well defined so far despite the recent identification of many intracellular apoptosis inhibitory elements (14Reed J.

https://openalex.org/W2083693202,"Artificial membranes may be resistant or susceptible to catalytic attack by secretory phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)) depending on the physical properties of the membrane. Living cells are normally resistant but become susceptible during trauma, apoptosis, and/or a significant elevation of intracellular calcium. Intact erythrocytes and ghosts were studied to determine whether the principles learned from artificial systems apply to biological membranes. Membrane properties such as phospholipid and/or protein composition, morphology, and microscopic characteristics (e.g. fluidity) were manipulated by preparing ghosts under different experimental conditions such as in the presence or absence of divalent cations with or without ATP. The properties of each membrane preparation were assessed by biochemical and physical means (fluorescence spectroscopy and electron and two-photon microscopy using the membrane probes bis-pyrene and laurdan) and compared with sPLA(2) activity. The properties that appeared most relevant were the degree of phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer face of the membrane and changes to the membrane physical state detected by bis-pyrene and laurdan. Specifically, vulnerability to hydrolysis by sPLA(2) was associated with an increase in bilayer order apparently reflective of expansion of membrane regions of diminished fluidity. These results argue that the general principles identified from studies with artificial membranes apply to biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2155939760,"Abstract When opened by depolarization,l-type calcium channels are rapidly inactivated by the elevation of Ca2+ concentration on the cytoplasmic side. Recent studies have shown that the interaction of calmodulin with the proximal part of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the channel plays a prominent role in this modulation. Two motifs interacting with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner have been described: the IQ sequence and more recently the neighboring CB sequence. Here, using synthetic peptides and fusion proteins derived from the Cav1.2 channel combined with biochemical techniques, we show that these two peptides are the only motifs of the cytoplasmic tail susceptible to interact with calmodulin. We determined the K d of the CB interaction with calmodulin to be 12 nm, i.e. below the K d of IQ-calmodulin, thereby precluding a competitive displacement of CB by IQ in the presence of Ca2+. In place, we demonstrated that a ternary complex is formed at high Ca2+ concentration, provided that calmodulin and the peptides are initially allowed to interact at a low Ca2+ concentration. These results provide evidence that CB and IQ motifs interacting together with calmodulin constitute a minimal molecular switch leading to Ca2+-induced inactivation. In addition, we suggest that they could also be the tethering site of calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1964495303,"The process of thyroid hormone synthesis, which occurs in the lumen of the thyroid follicles, results from an oxidative reaction leading, as side effects, to the multimerization of thyroglobulin (TG), the prothyroid hormone. Although hormone synthesis is a continuous process, the amount of Tg multimers is relatively constant. Here, we investigated the role of two molecular chaperones, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), present in the follicular lumen, on the multimerization process due to oxidation using both native Tg and its N-terminal domain (NTD). In vitro, PDI decreased multimerization of Tg and even suppressed the formation of NTD multimers. Under the same conditions, BiP was able to bind to Tg and NTD multimers but did not affect the process of multimerization. Associating BiP with PDI did not enhance the ability of PDI to limit the formation of multimers produced by oxidation. However, when BiP and PDI were reacted together with the multimeric forms and for a longer time (48 h), BiP greatly increased the efficiency of PDI. Accordingly, these two molecular chaperones probably act sequentially on the reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bridges. In the thyroid, a similar process may also be effective and participate in limiting the amount of Tg multimers present in the colloid. These results suggest that extracellular molecular chaperones play a similar role to that occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum and, furthermore, take part in the control of multimerization and aggregation of proteins formed by oxidation.

Thyrocytes are polarized cells that synthesize the prothyroid hormone: the thyroglobulin (Tg).1 This protein, which is the basic component involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, is secreted into the follicular lumen. Like most newly synthesized proteins, Tg follows the usual pathway of chaperone-assisted folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) involving calnexin, calreticulin, Grp78 (BiP), Grp94, PDI, and Grp170 (1Kim P.S.

Among these molecular chaperones, PDI certainly plays a fundamental role due to the presence of ∼110 cysteine residues in the monomer Tg (330 kDa, 12 S) (6Dunn, J. T., Dunn, A. D., Werner and Ingbar's The Thyroid, 8th Ed., Braverman, L. E., Utiger, R. D., 2000, 91, 104, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia.Google Scholar). In normal conditions, properly folded Tg is dimerized (2 × 330 kDa, 19 S) without any interchain disulfide bonds, then mature Tg is secreted into the follicular lumen where Tg19S undergoes the major post-translational modification accompanying the production of thyroid hormones. Hormone synthesis takes place at the apical surface of the thyrocyte via the iodination of some tyrosine residues (among 132 tyrosine residues for Tg19S) and the subsequent coupling of a very limited number of iodotyrosine residues to form triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The iodination and coupling process depend on a H2O2-generating system (NADPH-oxidase) and thyroperoxidase. During this oxidative reaction, besides participating in hormone synthesis, Tg19S is also modified by the formation of interchain covalent cross-links, generating high molecular mass forms of Tg: the soluble forms, known as Tg27S and Tg37S (4 × 330 kDa and 8 × 330 kDa, respectively), and the Tg aggregates, which constitute about 30‥ of the total Tg in the follicular lumen (7Herzog, V., Berndorfer, U., Saber, Y., J. Cell Biol., 118, 1992, 1071, 1083.Google Scholar). Tg aggregates differ from soluble Tg multimers in that they contains about 40‥ more iodine but almost no hormone (8Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

The major difficulty with Tg is its large size, which precludes detailed analysis in terms of the structure-activity relationships. Therefore, to circumvent this problem, we have often used a Tg peptide to study the various process in which the entire molecule is involved. This peptide is obtained from the entire Tg molecule by CNBr treatment. It corresponds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the molecule, which contains the main site of hormone synthesis at the Tyr5(11Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The NTD is a dipeptide Asn1-Met127 that is linked via disulfide bridges to Glu128-Met171. It contains two sites ofN-glycosylation at Asn57 and Asn91. Using this model, we have established by performing in vitroiodination and coupling that N-glycosylation was essential to both hormone formation (12Mallet B. Lejeune P.J. Baudry N. Niccoli P. Carayon P. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29881-29888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and multimerization in which covalent cross-links are involved (13Baudry N. Lejeune P.J. Niccoli P. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a recent study, we reported that in the follicular lumen BiP, Grp94, and PDI are associated with Tg aggregates. Although these molecular chaperones carry a retention signal KDEL in the ER, several studies establish that in secretory cells, some of the molecular chaperones escape to the ER (14Bruneau N.

In the present study, we investigated the role of PDI and BiP in the process of Tg19S and NTD multimerization during in vitroiodination and coupling. PDI was found to limit the multimerization process more efficiently than BiP. The conjugate action of these two molecular chaperones did not modify the rate of Tg and NTD multimers formed by the oxidative iodination and coupling reaction. On the other hand, when the multimeric forms of Tg were incubated with PDI and BiP for 48 h, the refolding of the multimeric forms of Tg occurred. A thyroid gland was obtained from a patient with a colloid goiter who underwent thyroidectomy. After the pathological examination, the gland was frozen in liquid nitrogen and taken to the laboratory where it was immediately lyophilized. An aliquot of the lyophilized gland was fragmented and suspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 15 min at +4 °C. After filtration on gauze, the supernatant of the thyroid homogenate was salted out (1.8 m phosphate buffer). After being centrifuged, the precipitate was dissolved with distilled water, dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and chromatographed on a Bio-Gel A-5m (Bio-Rad) column (100 × 5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Briefly, the typical elution profile showed in the void volume of the column, a milky fraction constituted of Tg aggregates followed by two minor peaks corresponding to Tg37S and Tg27S in that order (fraction “Tg37S+Tg27S”), and a major peak identified as Tg19S (20Feldt-Ramussen U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1978; 21: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Elution fractions corresponding to Tg37S+Tg27S and Tg19S were pooled separately, dialyzed against distilled water, and characterized in terms of their amino acid composition and electrophoretic profile. In vitro iodination and coupling (oxidative system) of Tg19S was carried out as previously described (12Mallet B. Lejeune P.J. Baudry N. Niccoli P. Carayon P. Franc J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29881-29888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to obtain iodinated and coupled Tg19S. Briefly, 1 mg of glucose, 20 nmol of KI, and 5 μg of lactoperoxidase (Sigma) were added to a final volume of 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 nmol of Tg19S. The reaction was initiated by 2.5 μg of glucose oxidase (Sigma), continued for 30 min at 37 °C, and stopped by adding 0.1m hyposulfite. The same reaction was performed with 4 mm reduced glutathione (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione in the presence or absence of PDI (Stress-Gen, Victoria, Canada) and/or 100 μmCa2+ and 1 mm ATP (Aldrich) in the presence or absence of BiP (Stress-Gen). When PDI and/or BiP were added to the sample, the iodide concentration was increased to 20‥, since PDI contains 12 tyrosine residues (21Yamauchi K. Yamamoto T. Hayashi H. Koya S. Takikawa H. Toyoshima K. Horiuchi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and BiP contains 13 tyrosine residues (22Ting J. Lee A.S. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Tg19S was treated with cyanogen bromide. The CNBr peptides were separated by chromatography on a Sephadex G-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1 mpropionic acid, and the NTD was then purified on a Bio-Gel P-100 column in 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate as previously described (11Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Last, it was dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. NTD (1 nmol), dissolved in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, was incubated with 7 nmol of KI, 1 μg of lactoperoxidase, and a H2O2-generating system consisting of glucose (0.2 mg) and glucose oxidase (0.5 μg). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 m sodium hyposulfite. The same reaction was performed with 4 mmreduced glutathione and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione in the presence or absence of PDI and/or 100 μm Ca2+and 1 mm ATP in the presence or absence of BiP. In the presence of PDI and/or BiP, iodination was performed with various amounts of KI taking into account in part the molar ratio molecular chaperone/NTD and in part the number of tyrosine residues present in these two molecular chaperones. Iodination of PDI and BiP (1.5 μg each) was performed separately using for each molecular chaperone 300 pmol of KI, 0.1 μg of lactoperoxidase, and a H2O2-generating system (20 μg of glucose and 0.1 μg of glucose oxidase). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 m sodium hyposulfite. The antibodies anti-PDI or anti-BiP (Stress-Gen) were coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose (HiTrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligand was incubated overnight on the anti-PDI and the anti-BiP affinity columns in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, 100 mm CaCl2, respectively. Columns were washed with 6 bed volumes of respective buffers and eluted with acetic acid solution (pH 3.0). The immunopurified solutions were neutralized and lyophilized. Samples were monitored by performing immunoblotting analysis. The fraction identified by chromatography on a Bio-Gel A-5 m column (see above) as Tg37S+Tg27S (10 μg) was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 4 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 100 μmCa2+, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Renaturation was initiated by adding iodinated PDI (0.8 μg) and iodinated BiP (0.6 μg), and the sample was incubated at 37 °C. At times corresponding to 1, 12, 24, and 48 h, an aliquot (2 μg) was taken and stored at −20 °C for immunoblotting analysis. The experiment was repeated with native PDI and BiP (Stress-Gen). SDS-PAGE was performed under nonreductive conditions using a 5 or 12‥ acrylamide and a 0.1‥ SDS gel system. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Immunoblotting was performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against a specific region of human Tg (monoclonal antibody 2) (23Ruf J. Carayon P. Sarles-Philip N. Kourilsky F. Lissitzky S. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The second reagent was either gold-conjugate goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1/250), detected with a silver enhancing kit (British BioCell International), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1/250,000), detected with Super Signal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). Scanning quantitative analysis was subsequently performed using the NIH Image V1.56 software program. After performing in vitro iodination and coupling of Tg19S or NTD samples for 30 min, we noted upon carrying out SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions that Tg (Fig.1 A) and NTD (Fig.1 B) were multimerized. With NTD, quantification of the various multimerized forms showed that NTD dimer amounted to about 21‥ ± 8‥ (n = 8), and another band around 75 kDa corresponding to NTD trimer was also identified. The percentages of this latter fraction was variable and low (5 ± 3‥). Tg multimer quantification was more difficult to perform, because the degree of multimerization was so variable that the fractions were distributed along the stacking gel, and only some of them reached the running gel. To evaluate the multimeric forms of Tg, it was therefore necessary to perform separation on a Bio-Gel A-5m column, which has a better resolution than SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Under these conditions, Tg37S+Tg27S amounted to around 25 ± 8‥ (n = 5). These values are comparable with those observed in vivo(24Frati L. Bilstad J. Edelhoch H. Rall J.E. Salvatore G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 162: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When the incubation time was extended and when the iodide concentration was increased, similar results were obtained (data not shown). Since it was difficult to assess these values when performing SDS-PAGE, in the forthcoming experiments we designated as Tg multimers and NTD multimers all the multimerized forms generated during iodination and coupling. It is widely recognized that PDI can influence the refolding of denatured and/or reduced proteins in vitro. Because we previously established that PDI is associated with aggregated Tg (8Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we studied the role of PDI in the oxidation reaction induced by in vitro iodination and coupling. The presence of PDI in various PDI/ligand ratios (mol/mol) limited the amount of Tg multimers (Fig.2 A) and NTD multimers (Fig.2 B). These results specifically involved PDI and were not due to the redox system GSH/GSSG, since in the absence of PDI, this system did not affect the proportions of the multimers (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 1). With NTD, no multimeric form was obtained with PDI at a molar ratio ≥1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4 and 5), whereas PDI had a slightly less effect on Tg, since at a PDI/Tg molar ratio = 2, around 20‥ of the Tg multimers were always present (Fig.2 A, lane 5). Although most of the cysteine residues are already involved in intradisulfide bridges, this difference was probably due to the number of cysteine residues present in the Tg19S molecule, which may explain why the efficiency of PDI was lower with Tg than with NTD (110 versus 6 Cys). Accordingly, we concluded that PDI was able to limit (Tg) or suppress (NTD) the multimerization process. However, it was not established whether PDI reacted with the multimeric forms, causing them to refold into monomeric forms, or whether it acted on the monomers, thus limiting or preventing the multimerization process. To determine the forms of Tg and NTD recognized by PDI, we used a PDI/ligand molar ratio equal to 0.5, which did not significantly reduce the formation of multimers with either Tg or NTD (see above). After 30 min of incubation for iodination and coupling, the mixture was chromatographed on an anti-PDI-Sepharose column. After extensively washing the column, the specific fractions were eluted by acidic solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). The acid fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using a Tg monoclonal antibody. Only the multimeric forms of Tg and NTD were identified (Fig.3). Regarding NTD, no band corresponding to the complex formed by PDI and NTD dimer (150 kDa) was detected; only two slight bands corresponding to the molecular mass of the multimeric forms were observed (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). This may have been due to the elution conditions at pH 3.0. In fact, at pH levels lower than 6.0, it has been reported that PDI, acting as a molecular chaperone, is dissociated from its ligand (25McLauhlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the immunopurification was PDI-specific, since the Tg and NTD multimers chromatographed on this column at the same concentrations as those used above were not retained on the anti-PDI-Sepharose column (data not shown). BiP is known to participate in vivo to the correct folding of Tg in the ER. The action of BiP involves multiple cycles of association and dissociation, requires Ca2+ and ATP, and interacts optimally with hydrophobic peptides, which are normally buried in the hydrophobic core of properly folded proteins (26Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 27Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7429-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, BiP is not directly involved in disulfide bridge formation and, therefore, presumably does not participate in the multimerization process. To confirm this assumption, we performed in vitro iodination and coupling on Tg19S and NTD in the presence of BiP. With both Tg and NTD, BiP showed little, if any, ability to limit the multimerization process whatever the BiP/ligand (mol/mol) ratios tested (Fig.4). However, this limited ability did not necessarily mean that BiP did not bind to multimeric forms. We reasoned that multimeric forms generated by oxidation reaction might express specific conformational hydrophobic sites recognized by BiP. To investigate the possibility that BiP might specifically recognize the multimeric forms, we incubated Tg19S or NTD in the presence of BiP (molar ratio BiP/ligand = 2) and in the presence of 100 μmCa2+. After iodination and coupling for 30 min at 37 °C, the mixture was chromatographed on an anti-BiP-Sepharose column. After extensive washing of the column, the specific fractions were eluted with an acidic solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fractions were neutralized, concentrated, and analyzed by immunoblotting using a Tg monoclonal antibody (Fig.5). With Tg and NTD, most of the specifically retained material was identified as consisting of multimeric forms, although a small proportion of monomeric forms was also retained. Depending on the position of the N-linked glycans in the nascent protein in the ER, the folding of the glycoprotein is assisted either by BiP or by the calnexin/calreticulin pathway (29Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). With Tg, based on the presence of the firstN-linked glycan at position Asn57, an interaction with BiP can be expected to occur. Moreover, when this study was in progress, Mayer et al. (30Mayer M. Kies U. Kammermeier R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that PDI and BiP acted synergistically in the in vitro folding of the denatured and reduced Fab fragment. It therefore seemed to be worth associating these two molecular chaperones to determine how they participated in the multimerization process of Tg19S during iodination and coupling. Used together, BiP and PDI (molar ratios: BiP/Tg19S = 2, PDI/Tg19S = 1) did not affect the yield of Tg multimers. The pattern of immunoblotting obtained was the same as that obtained with PDI alone (see Fig. 2 A, lane 4) or BiP alone (see Fig. 4 A, lane 5). At this stage in our study, it seemed likely that BiP did not enhance the effects of PDI. However, since BiP very efficiently recognized the multimeric forms of Tg, we hypothesized that the association PDI+BiP might affect the renaturation process of the oxidized Tg (Tg multimers). On the other hand, it was possible that the very low ability of BiP to limit the multimerization of Tg might also be due to the iodination of certain tyrosine residues of this molecular chaperone. To test these hypotheses, both native PDI and BiP and iodinated PDI and BiP were incubated with the Tg37S+Tg27S fraction isolated from a human Tg preparation. The molecular chaperone/ligand molar ratio worked out at 0.5 (in the case of Tg37S) and 1 (in the case of Tg27S). In any event, these molar ratios were not large enough to inhibit the Tg19S multimerization process (see above). We therefore determined the time course of the refolding of the multimeric forms of Tg. As shown in Fig. 6, PDI or BiP alone did not significantly affect the folding of the multimeric forms of Tg after 48 h (lanes 1 and 2, respectively), whereas the simultaneous presence of PDI and BiP led to the refolding of the majority of the multimeric forms of Tg (lane 3). It is noteworthy that iodination of the molecular chaperones did not significantly affect their activity since after 48-h of incubation (lane 7), the percentage corresponding to the multimeric forms decreased in parallel with the decrease observed in the presence of native molecular chaperones. Under physiological conditions, the native Tg19S secreted into the follicular lumen undergoes the oxidative iodination and coupling reaction leading to hormone formation. This reaction results in a Tg with a high hormonal content but also in the formation of covalent cross-links, which take the form of either dityrosine bridges or disulfide bridges (intermolecular or intramolecular cross-links) (8Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Soluble multimeric forms of Tg constitute the first step toward the insolubility and aggregation of Tg molecules (7Herzog, V., Berndorfer, U., Saber, Y., J. Cell Biol., 118, 1992, 1071, 1083.Google Scholar). Several mechanisms may be involved in limiting these aggregates in the follicular lumen, such as that based on the presence of the lysosomial enzymes, cathepsins B, L (31Brix K. Lemansky P. Herzog V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1963-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and K (32Tepel C. Brömme D. Herzog V. Brix K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4487-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at the surface of the thyrocyte as well as that based on the presence of oxygen free radicals generated by the system H2O2 + peroxidase (8Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results of all the previous studies have suggested that the limitation of the multimeric forms of Tg present into the follicular lumen may be attributable to their degradation. In the present study, it was proposed to test the hypothesis that the molecular chaperones present in the follicular lumen might contribute to both limiting the formation of the multimeric forms of Tg19S produced during the process of hormone synthesis and reducing the proportions of the soluble multimeric forms of Tg after their formation. Numerous studies have described the role of PDI and/or BiP in the folding of proteins in vitro. However, to our knowledge, molecular chaperones were used in these studies to rescue the unfolded proteins generated by reduction-denaturation (33Radford S.E. Dobson C.M. Evans P.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 34Van den Berg B. Chung E.W. Robinson C.V. Mateo P.L. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4794-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or heating (35Primm T.P. Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the role of PDI and/or BiP using an original process to avoid the formation of unfolded protein from a folded protein (Tg19S) and the secondary misfolding, which occurs due to the oxidative process of hormone synthesis. For this purpose, we used the entire Tg molecule (Tg19S) and its NTD. In vitro the iodination and coupling reaction multimerized ∼20‥ of all the Tg and NTD, although in the case of Tg, the rate of multimerization was more difficult to assess exactly. In vitro, PDI either limited (in the case of Tg) or prevented (in that of NTD) the formation of multimeric forms. In addition, when PDI was used at various concentrations relative to Tg or NTD, no anti-chaperone activity was evidenced. This finding differs from those of previous studies where the PDI, present at substoichiometric concentrations relative to denatured lysozyme, exhibited anti-chaperone activity (36Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7764-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference is probably due to the fact that none of the substrates (Tg and NTD) used in the present experiments tends to aggregate spontaneously. It is worth noting that PDI acted specifically on the multimeric forms, since the immunopurification procedure performed using a polyclonal antibody directed against PDI yielded no Tg19S forms. The fact that Tg19S was not bound to PDI during the immunopurification step was not in disagreement with Mezghrani et al. (19Mezghrani A. Courageot J. Mani J.C. Pugniere M. Bastiani P. Miquelis R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1920-1929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), since under the conditions used here (subneutral pH buffer) we ruled out the possibility that Tg19S may have bound to PDI via a “receptor-binding domain” expressed only under acidic conditions. At this stage, it was possible to assume that PDI in the follicular lumen contributes in limiting the formation of the multimeric forms of Tg, which would otherwise be generated by in vitroiodination and coupling. This reaction probably also resulted in the iodination of the PDI present in the incubation medium, and this effect is certainly very similar to what occurs in vivo. In the colloid, the molecular chaperones may also be iodinated as the result of the process of hormone synthesis, like several other colloidal proteins (37Lemansky P. Popp G.M. Tietz J. Herzog V. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, to considerably reduce the formation of the multimeric forms of Tg, we used an amount of PDI corresponding to ∼1/5 of the Tg in weight. This amount of PDI may seem rather low for an in vitro study, but it is very high given the physiological concentrations of PDI that are to be found in the follicular lumen (38Berndorfer U. Wilms H. Herzog V. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 1918-1926PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seemed to be interesting to examine the role of another molecular chaperone, BiP, used both alone and in association with PDI. BiP is known to contribute in the ER to the folding of several proteins (39Gething M-J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This molecular chaperone is relatively abundant in the colloid of human thyroid glands (8Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). BiP possesses a peptide binding groove lined with hydrophobic side chains and interacts with heptapeptides containing a subset of aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids in alternating positions (40Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Such linear motifs are present in Tg but not in NTD (11Marriq C. Lejeune P.J. Venot N. Rolland M. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). With these two ligands, BiP was not effective in changing the amount of multimers, even at a molar ratio equal to 2. However, BiP was efficiently bound to the multimeric forms of Tg and NTD, although in the latter case, the “native” peptide did not possess a specific peptide binding groove for BiP. Therefore, it is possible that the multimerization of NTD may have led to the expression of a three-dimensional heptapeptide-like structure recognized by BiP. In the case of Tg19S, the nascent molecule present in the ER expresses the heptapeptide recognized by BiP, and this site is buried in mature Tg19S. Since BiP binds to the multimeric forms of Tg, we concluded that the Tg multimers underwent conformational changes revealing the heptapeptide. The association of BiP with PDI at various molar ratios did not affect the ability of PDI to modify the multimerization process. These results are not in line with those reported on the oxidative folding of antibodies in vitro (30Mayer M. Kies U. Kammermeier R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29421-29425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This difference was not due to the iodination of the molecular chaperone but partly to the fact that the chaperone/ligand molar ratios were low (never above 2) in our study and partly to the incubation time being restricted to 30 min. When directly applied to the multimeric forms for a longer time (48 h), BiP actually greatly increases the efficiency of PDI, since Tg37S+Tg27S were almost completely transformed in Tg19S. This result confirmed both that BiP was bound to multimeric forms of Tg and that BiP acted synergistically with PDI to restore the initial structure of the Tg19S. The difference in the efficiency of the association PDI/BiP observed between the inhibition of the formation and the refolding of the multimeric forms was probably due to the kinetic competition occurring between the disulfide bridge formation resulting from the oxidation of Tg19S, reduction of the disulfide bridges by PDI, and the speed with which BiP bound to the multimeric forms. Once formed, most of the disulfide bridges become rapidly buried deeply in the core of the multimeric Tg molecules, which explains why PDI alone had little effect, even after 48 h. On the other hand, Tg multimers may expose specific conformational peptides recognized by BiP, as described in the case of NTD, and accordingly, PDI and BiP may act sequentially on the reduction of the intermolecular disulfide bridges, so that the Tg molecules would gradually detach themselves. In conclusion, in these in vitro experiments performed using two molecular chaperones present in the colloid, it was possible both to limit the formation of multimeric forms of Tg and to rescue the prothyroid hormone from its multimers. Moreover, because the colloid contains at least one other molecular chaperone (Grp94) (8Delom F. Lejeune P.J. Vinet L. Carayon P. Mallet B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) known to interact sequentially with BiP (41Melnick J. Dul J.L. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), our results support the idea that a whole network of folding helper proteins exists in the follicular lumen and takes part in the control of multimerization and aggregation of proteins formed by oxidation.

MAL was the first member identified of an extended family of proteins that have significant overall sequence identity. In this study we have used a newly generated monoclonal antibody to investigate an unedited member of this family, named BENE, which was found to be expressed in endothelial-like ECV304 cells and normal human endothelium. Human BENE was characterized as a proteolipid protein predominantly present in GEM rafts in ECV304 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that BENE interacted with caveolin-1. Confocal immunofluorescence and electron microscopic analyses indicated that BENE mainly accumulated into intracellular vesicular/tubular structures that partially colocalize with internal caveolin-1. In response to cell surface cholesterol oxidation, BENE redistributed to the dilated vesicular structures that concentrate most of the caveolin-1 originally on the cell surface. After cessation of cholesterol oxidation, a detectable fraction of the BENE molecules migrated to the plasmalemma accompanying caveolin-1 and then returned progressively to its steady state distribution.

Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7923) Google Scholar). Unlike the bulk of membranes, which are enriched in phospholipids and packed in a disordered state, rafts have a high glycosphingolipid and cholesterol content and appear to be packed in a liquid-ordered structure (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). This difference makes glycolipid- and cholesterol-enriched membrane (GEM)1 rafts resistant to solubilization by nonionic detergents at low temperature (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Recruitment of specific proteins into rafts was initially proposed to explain the segregation and transport of apical proteins during biosynthetic transport in polarized epithelial cells (3Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). More recently, this model has been extended as a general mechanism for protein recruitment in a variety of cellular processes including membrane trafficking and signaling (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7923) Google Scholar). Although their characteristic lipid composition provides the biophysical basis for the specificity of protein recruitment by compatibility with the raft structure, it is believed that rafts require protein machinery to be operative in signaling or transport (1Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7923) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Caveolae are raft-containing vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane involved in a variety of cellular processes including signaling and clathrin-independent endocytosis (4Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is a multifunctional raft-associated protein (5Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) primarily identified as a component of the caveolar architecture (6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is believed to be an element of the protein machinery operating in rafts, because: 1) it is able to direct the organization of rafts in caveolae-like vesicles (7Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 8Li S. Song K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and 2) it forms a scaffold onto which many classes of signaling molecules can assemble to generate preassembled signaling complexes within caveolae (5Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The existence of a family of proteins similar to caveolin-1 with at least two other proteins, termed caveolin-2 and caveolin-3, which are resident in GEMs, suggests that members of the caveolin family are elements of the machinery involved in raft organization (5Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The flotillin/cavatellin family, which so far groups the raft-associated flotillin-1 and flotillin-2/ESA proteins (9Volonté D. Galbiati F. Li S. Nishiyama K. Okamoto Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 12702-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whose function is still unknown, might constitute a second family of elements of the raft machinery (5Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Proteolipids are operationally defined as proteins with unusually high solubility in organic solvents commonly used to extract cell lipids (10Schlesinger M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). MAL is an integral membrane proteolipid protein of 17 kDa expressed in a restricted range of cell types including polarized epithelial cells (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Martı́n-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), oligodendrocytes (13Kim T. Fiedler K. Madison D.L. Krueger W.H. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and T lymphocytes (14Millán J. Alonso M.A. Eur. J.

MAL selectively resides in lipid rafts in all the cell types in which it is expressed (11Zacchetti D. Peranen J. Murata M. Fiedler K. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Martı́n-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M.

An essential role for MAL in apical sorting has recently been demonstrated by the observation that depletion of endogenous MAL severely reduces the overall transport of membrane proteins to the apical surface in polarized epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and Fischer rat thyroid cells (16Puertollano R. Martı́n-Belmonte F. Millán J. de Marco M.C. Albar J.P. Kremer L. Alonso M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Cheong K.H. Zacchetti D. Schneeberger E.E. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6241-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Martı́n-Belmonte F. Puertollano R. Millán J. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This highlights MAL as a component of the machinery acting in the organization of rafts for apical transport. The presence in the GenBankTM of cDNAs encoding for proteins with significant overall sequence identity with MAL was indicative of the existence of a family of proteins related to MAL, henceforth referred to as the “MAL family” of proteins (19Pérez P. Puertollano R. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Magyar J.P. Ebensperger C. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Suter U. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 189: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The demonstrated role of MAL as an element of the raft machinery in epithelial cells is consistent with the early proposal that the MAL family of proteolipid proteins might be involved in raft organization (19Pérez P. Puertollano R. Alonso M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The observation that GEMs are resistant to solubilization in nonionic detergents at low temperatures has been widely exploited for the biochemical isolation of a membrane fraction that appears to be derived from cellular rafts (21Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). So far, no member of the MAL family of proteolipid proteins has been identified in the GEM fraction of endothelial cells (22Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tank Z. Hermanowski-Vosatka A. Tu Y-H. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The BENE gene, a member of the MAL gene family, was originally cloned during a search for genes present in the vicinity of the human immunoglobulin κ chain locus (23Lautner-Rieske A. Thiebe R. Zachau H.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). BENE mRNA is expressed in the prostate, small intestine, colon, heart, and lung and is undetectable in brain, thymus, liver, and spleen (20Magyar J.P. Ebensperger C. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Suter U. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 189: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, using a newly developed anti-BENE monoclonal antibody (mAb) we have identified endogenous BENE in the GEM fraction of ECV304 cells, a human cell line displaying endothelial-like features (24Hughes S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have detected a physical interaction between BENE and caveolin-1 and observed a partial colocalization between these two proteins in vesicular/tubular structures in ECV304 cells. Oxidation of surface cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase (CO) and cessation of that process by CO withdrawal indicate that BENE participates in cholesterol-regulated processes also involving caveolin-1 (25Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Conrad P.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1185-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) in the endothelial-like ECV304 cell line. The mouse hybridoma producing mAb 9E10 (IgG1) to the human c-Myc epitope EQKLISEED was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the c-Myc tag were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse mAb MEM-43 (IgG2a) to CD59 was kindly provided by Dr. V. Horejsi (Institute of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic). The rabbit polyclonal antibody to caveolin-1, and the mouse mAbs to caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and calnexin, were from Transduction Laboratories (Nottingham, United Kingdom). The anti-human MAL 6D9 mAb has been described previously (12Martı́n-Belmonte F. Kremer L. Albar J.P. Marazuela M. Alonso M.A. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2077-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgG antibodies were supplied by Pierce. Fluorescein- and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL). Protein A-gold conjugates were obtained from the Department of Cell Biology of Utrecht University (Utrecht, The Netherlands). CO was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany). Human ECV304 cells (kindly provided by Dr. J. Riese, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologı́a, Madrid) and epithelial MDCK cells were grown on Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 unit/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml), at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. An incomplete human BENE cDNA clone (a kind gift from Dr. H. G. Zachau, Institute of Physiological Chemistry, Munich, Germany) lacking the 5′ end of the coding region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with specific oligonucleotide primers that anneal with the 5′ and 3′ ends of the BENE coding region contained in the template plasmid (23Lautner-Rieske A. Thiebe R. Zachau H.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition to the annealing sequence, the 5′ primer contained sequences required to reconstitute the entire coding region of the BENE cDNA in accordance with the additional ATG-containing 5′-upstream BENE sequence found in the EBI/GenBankTM data base (accession number D83824). To insert the 9E10 c-Myc epitope at the NH2 terminus of BENE, the reconstituted BENE cDNA was amplified with the same 3′ primer and a new 5′ end primer with sequences encoding the 9E10 c-Myc epitope placed between the first and second codons of the BENE cDNA coding region. After amplification under standard conditions, the product was cloned into the pCR3.1 DNA eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) to generate the pCR/BENE construct. Transfection of ECV304 cells with pCR/BENE was carried out by electroporation using the Electro Cell Manipulator 600 equipment (BTX, San Diego, CA). Selection of stable transfectants was carried out by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) for at least 4 weeks following transfection. Drug-resistant cells were selected, screened by immunofluorescence analysis with 9E10 mAb, and the clones that proved to be positive for tagged BENE expression were maintained in drug-free medium. After several passages in this medium >90% of cells within the selected positive clones retained expression of tagged BENE. The MDCK cell stable transfectants expressing tagged BENE used for the hybridoma screening were generated following an identical procedure. The peptide EKLLDPRIYYI, corresponding to amino acids 118–128 of the human BENE molecule, was synthesized in an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (AMS 422, Abimed, Langerfeld, Germany) using the solid phase procedure and standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (26Gausepohl H. Boulin C. Kraft M. Frank R.W. Peptide Res. 1992; 5: 315-320PubMed Google Scholar). After coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, the peptide was used to immunize Wistar rats. Spleen cells from immunized rats were fused to myeloma cells following standard protocols (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and plated onto microtiter plates. The culture supernatants were screened by immunoblot analysis using BENE-enriched membrane fractions prepared from epithelial MDCK cells that stably expressed the BENE protein tagged with the 9E10 c-Myc epitope. The hybridoma clone 5B1, which secretes antibodies to human BENE, was isolated after several rounds of screening and used to produce culture supernatants containing 5B1 mAb. Total RNA from different cell lines was extracted using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). For Northern blot analysis of different cell lines, ∼20 μg of RNA were denatured in 50% formamide and 2.2m formaldehyde at 65 °C, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and transferred to Nylon membranes. RNA samples were hybridized under standard conditions to cDNA fragments labeled by the random-priming method (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 8-13Crossref Scopus (16561) Google Scholar) corresponding to human BENE (23Lautner-Rieske A. Thiebe R. Zachau H.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As a control of the amounts of RNA present in each lane, blots were finally hybridized to a 0.6-kilobase pairHinfI/BamHI DNA fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of human β-actin mRNA (29Ponte P. Gunning P. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Final blot washing conditions were 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 65 °C. GEMs were prepared essentially as described by Brown and Rose (21Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). ECV304 cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a cell lifter, the dishes were rinsed with 1 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C, and the lysate was homogenized by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle. The lysate was finally brought to 40% sucrose (w/w) in a final volume of 4 ml and placed at the bottom of an 8-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 rotor. Fractions of 1 ml were harvested from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Density was determined by measuring the refractive index of the fractions. In some experiments, centrifugation to equilibrium was carried out using discontinuous sucrose density gradients consisting of a 4-ml bottom layer containing the cell lysate in 40% sucrose, overlaid with 6 ml of 30% sucrose and a 2-ml layer of 5% sucrose at the top. After centrifugation, the opalescent band containing GEMs, which migrates in the 5–30% sucrose interphase, was harvested from the top (fraction I). The 40% sucrose layer containing the cytosolic proteins and the solubilized proteins was also harvested (fraction S). For immunoblot analysis, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 15% acrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline, blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibody. After several washings, blots were incubated for 1 h with secondary goat anti-IgG antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, washed extensively, and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with a control antibody bound to protein G-Sepharose, centrifuged and the supernatant immunoprecipitated by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C with the indicated specific antibodies bound to protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed six times with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. To detect 35S labeling, dried gels were finally exposed to Fujifilm imaging plates. ECV304 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed, and treated with 10 mm glycine for 5 min to quench the aldehyde groups. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, rinsed, and incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. For double-label immunofluorescence analysis, cells were incubated for 1 h with mAb 9E10 (IgG1), rinsed several times, and incubated for 1 h with anti-mouse Igγ1 chain coupled to Texas Red. The procedure was then repeated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to caveolin-1, or mAb to CD59 or mannosidase II followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies pre-absorbed against mouse IgG or the appropriate isotype-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein. After extensive washing, the coverslips were mounted on slides. As indicated, images were obtained using either a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Confocal Laser microscope or a conventional fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Controls to assess the specificity of the labeling included incubations with control primary antibodies or omission of the primary antibodies. Stable transfectants of ECV304 cells expressing tagged BENE were used. The cells were processed for cryosectioning as described previously (30Martı́nez-Menárguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pelleted by centrifugation, embedded in 10% gelatin, and cut into small blocks. The blocks were infused with 2.3 m sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until cryoultramicrotomy. Cryosections were immunolabeled as described by Slot et al. (31Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The distribution of BENE was determined with anti-tag mAb 9E10 and that of caveolin-1 with specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies diluted 1:15 and 1:50, respectively. Nonspecific labeling was measured over the nucleus as described by Griffiths (32Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993Crossref Google Scholar) and was considered not significant (lower than 1 gold particle per μm2). The substitution of anti-tag 9E10 mAb by rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the same tag gave a similar immunolabeling pattern, whereas omission of the primary antibody abolished the labeling. The quantitative analyses were carried out in grids double-immunolabeled for tagged BENE and caveolin-1. The sections with the highest quality were selected and then were scanned systematically along a fixed track using a magnification of × 20,000. Ultrathin sections were scanned along a fixed track. Tubular/vesicular elements immunoreactive for BENE were ascribed to one of the following categories: clathrin-coated membranes (the presence of a clathrin coat was established on the basis of the typical thickness and appearance of the coats in cryosections (30Martı́nez-Menárguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Klumperman J. Cell. 1999; 98: 81-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 33Martı́nez-Menárguez J.A. Geuze H.J. Ballesta J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 137-143PubMed Google Scholar), caveolae (membranes immunoreactive for caveolin-1), and uncoated membranes (the remaining immunoreactive tubular/ vesicular elements not included in the former categories). The number of structures found for each category was expressed as a percentage of the total vesicles counted. At least 300 vesicles were counted in three independent sessions. Human tonsils were received as routine specimens obtained from surgery. Samples were fixed for several hours in 10% neutral buffered formalin and subjected to routine tissue processing and paraffin embedding. Sections of 5-μm thickness were prepared from paraffin-embedded tissues and were mounted on poly-l-lysine-coated glass microslides. Antigen retrieval was accomplished by subjecting deparaffinized sections to pressure cooker unmasking for 60 s in 200 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The tissue was then blocked with a 1:20 dilution of normal rabbit serum in 10 mm Tris-HCl saline buffer, pH 7.6, as described previously (34Marazuela M. Sánchez-Madrid F. Acevedo A. Larrañaga E. Landázuri M.O. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1995; 102: 328-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The sections were sequentially incubated with a 1:100 dilution of an ascites stock of anti-BENE 5B1 mAb and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Bio-Rad). Each incubation was followed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline. Then, sections were developed with Graham-Karnovsky medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and hydrogen peroxide. Sections were counterstained with Carazzi's hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted by routine methods. A partial BENE cDNA was identified during a search for genes in the proximity of the human immunoglobulin κ chain locus (23Lautner-Rieske A. Thiebe R. Zachau H.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This cDNA clone (EBI/GenBankTM data library accession number U17077) has an open reading frame of 148 amino acids showing ∼39% identity with the MAL protein sequence but lacks an in-frame ATG triplet that could be used as a translational initiation codon. During a search of the TIGR Human Gene Index we identified a partial cDNA clone that both matched the BENE sequence and contained an additional 5′-upstream sequence (EBI/GenBankTM data library accession number D83824). This additional sequence displays a unique ATG codon in-frame with the BENE open reading frame mentioned above. The sequence surrounding this ATG (AGCATGG) is consistent with the A/GXX ATGG consensus sequence (where Xstands for any nucleotide) for optimal ATG translational start sites in eukaryotic cells (35Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). The reconstituted open reading frame predicts a protein of 153 amino acids containing an NH2-terminal five-amino acid extension compared with the incomplete sequence deduced previously (23Lautner-Rieske A. Thiebe R. Zachau H.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 159: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).

To identify a suitable model cell system for studying BENE, we carried out Northern blot analysis using a wide range of human cell lines.

BENE transcripts were undetectable in the rest of the cell lines examined including T cells (Jurkat and HPB-ALL cells), epithelial MDCK cells, and hepatic HepG-2 cells. To identify BENE gene expression in ECV304 cells unambiguously, the BENE cDNA coding sequence was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using total RNA from ECV304 cells, and the product was cloned and sequenced.

Here we analyzed expression, activity, and subcellular localization profiles of YY1 during Xenopus laevis development. Abundant levels of YY1 mRNA and protein were detected in early stage oocytes and in all subsequent stages of oocyte and embryonic development through to swimming larval stages. The DNA binding activity of YY1 was detected only in early oocytes (stages I and II) and in embryos after the midblastula transition (MBT), which suggested that its potential to modulate gene expression may be specifically repressed in the intervening period of development. Experiments to determine transcriptional activity showed that addition of YY1 recognition sites upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter had no stimulatory or repressive effect on basal transcription in oocytes and post-MBT embryos. Although the apparent transcriptional inactivity of YY1 in oocytes could be explained by the absence of DNA binding activity at this stage of development, the lack of transcriptional activity in post-MBT embryos was not expected given the ability of YY1 to bind its recognition elements. Subsequent Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed that YY1 is localized in the cytoplasm in oocytes and in cells of developing embryos well past the MBT.

In developing muscle, proteolytic processing of YY1 is thought to be responsible for cell-specific derepression of sarcomeric α-actin genes (23Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite its apparent association with cell growth and differentiation in diverse cell types, however, very little is known about the expression and regulation of YY1 in vertebrate oocytes and embryos, and the biological role of YY1 during early vertebrate development is poorly understood. A recent study of YY1 in mouse development revealed that it is abundantly expressed in oocytes and early embryos, displays a dynamic pattern of subcellular localization in early development, and is selectively expressed in certain tissues later in development (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because heterozygous mutation of YY1 in the mouse resulted in growth and neurulation defects, and full knockout caused embryonic lethality around implantation, it appears likely that YY1 functions at multiple stages of mouse development (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).The objective of the present study was to identify and characterize YY1 in the Xenopus developmental model system. We found that YY1 mRNA and protein were expressed in early oocytes and were present at relatively constant levels throughout oocyte and embryonic development. The ability of YY1 to interact with its cis-recognition site was restricted to very early oocytes and to post-MBT stages in embryos, suggesting that the DNA binding activity of the maternal factor is modified specifically during development. Expression assays showed that YY1 had no effect on transcription from the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in oocytes, but we also found a similar lack of transcriptional activity in post-MBT embryos at a point in development when its DNA binding is reactivated. Analysis of the subcellular localization of YY1 showed it is sequestered in the cytoplasm of oocytes and in cells throughout the embryo up to as late as the neurula stage of development. We suggest that cytoplasmic sequestration is a mode of developmental regulation used to inhibit the transcriptional activity of YY1 during early stages of Xenopus development and that YY1 probably functions in cell differentiation events that occur later in development.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that YY1 is a maternally derived protein that is present throughout early Xenopusdevelopment. YY1 is expressed abundantly in early oocytes and, exists as a cytoplasmic protein in oocytes and early embryos, and its DNA binding activity is restricted to early oocytes and to post-MBT embryos. At first, the developmental profile of DNA binding prompted us to hypothesize that maternal YY1 might function to modulate expression of specific target genes in stage I oocytes and once again after MBT when expression from the zygotic genome commences in the embryo (46Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). However, we found that YY1 binding sites had no effect on expression from the TK promoter in oocytes or in post-MBT embryos, and so we surmised that endogenous YY1 is transcriptionally inactive during early development. The transcriptional inactivity of YY1 is consistent with our finding that YY1 remains in the cytoplasm of oocytes and in cells throughout the developing embryo well past MBT. Therefore, we suggest that the potential function of YY1 as a transcriptional regulator is specifically repressed by cytoplasmic partitioning during both oogenesis and early embryonic development.YY1 is a maternally expressed protein in unfertilized oocytes in both mouse (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and Xenopus. However, the subcellular localization pattern of YY1 in Xenopus is somewhat different from that in mouse development. Donohoe et al. (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) showed that YY1 is cytoplasmic in unfertilized mouse oocytes and becomes nuclear in two-cell embryos coincident with the onset of mouse zygotic transcription, and they suggested that YY1 probably functions to regulate gene expression early in mammalian embryonic development. No such nuclear relocalization occurs in Xenopus embryos at MBT, despite the apparent reactivation of its DNA binding activity at this stage. Unlike mouse embryos in which YY1 becomes nuclear at the 2-cell stage coincident with the onset of zygotic transcription, there is no apparent correlation between nuclear localization and the MBT inXenopus. Therefore, it would appear that YY1 does not have a direct transcriptional regulatory function at the initial stages of zygotic gene expression in Xenopus embryos or in early development to the neurula stage.The abundant maternal expression and subcellular localization reported in this study suggest two hypotheses for the potential developmental function of YY1. YY1 may function to regulate the transcription of genes important for differentiation and organ formation, which occur later in development. This has been suggested by numerous studies in various tissue culture model systems (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the expression pattern of YY1 in mouse embryos and the phenotype of heterozygous YY1 mutants (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Alternatively, YY1 may play an important role in the cytoplasm during oogenesis and early embryogenesis, perhaps in the transport, storage, or translational regulation of maternal mRNAs. Such a cytoplasmic function would be similar to that proposed for the CCAAT box transcription factor (CBTF), which is retained in the cytoplasm prior to MBT through its RNA binding capacity and is associated with transcriptionally quiescent mRNP complexes (47Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nuclear relocalization of CBTF is associated with degradation of maternal transcripts (47Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unlike CBTF, however, YY1 does not localize to the nucleus after MBT, which would suggest that it might associate with stable mRNAs. Further analyses will be aimed at determining whether YY1 has RNA binding activity and whether association with mRNPs might contribute to its cytoplasmic localization.It is paradoxical that YY1 remains in the cytoplasm and yet displays the differential ability to bind DNA through development, with peak activity in very early oocytes and in post-MBT embryos. Because it is unlikely that the extract preparation methods selectively activates DNA binding at these stages, we suggest that maternally derived YY1 is subject to post-translational modifications that occur in the cytoplasmin vivo. It could be that YY1 becomes primed to activate transcription but must receive the appropriate cellular signals to trigger nuclear translocation in specific tissues sometime during later in development.What is responsible for changes in the DNA binding activity of YY1 during development? There was no apparent correlation between nuclear localization and the ability of YY1 to bind DNA in gel mobility shift assays. DNA binding is probably not regulated by subcellular localization, because YY1 was retained in the cytoplasm throughout the same developmental time frame over which YY1 fluctuates between DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding forms. The ability to reactivate DNA binding activity in late stage oocytes by in vitrophosphatase treatments suggests that YY1 may be negatively regulatedin vivo by phosphorylation. However, we found no direct evidence that the phosphorylation state of YY1 changes as oocytes progress through developmental stages when DNA binding activity is lost or regained, and so the significance and mode of fluctuations in DNA binding during early development remain unclear.In summary, the data presented here suggest that the potential transcriptional activity of YY1 is repressed specifically during oocyte and embryonic development by sequestration to the cytoplasm. The functional significance of changes in the DNA binding activity of YY1 is unclear, and the potential role of YY1 the cytoplasm during development remains to be elucidated. Exclusion of YY1 from nuclei during early development explains the results of expression analyses in which YY1 binding sites had neither stimulatory nor repressive effects on basal transcription from the TK promoter in oocytes and embryos.

In bone the activity of YY1 appears to be controlled by targeting to the nucleolus and nuclear matrix, (32Guo B. Odgren P.R. van Wijnen A.J. Last T.J. Nickerson J. Penman S. Lian J.B. Stein J.L.

In developing muscle, proteolytic processing of YY1 is thought to be responsible for cell-specific derepression of sarcomeric α-actin genes (23Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Despite its apparent association with cell growth and differentiation in diverse cell types, however, very little is known about the expression and regulation of YY1 in vertebrate oocytes and embryos, and the biological role of YY1 during early vertebrate development is poorly understood. A recent study of YY1 in mouse development revealed that it is abundantly expressed in oocytes and early embryos, displays a dynamic pattern of subcellular localization in early development, and is selectively expressed in certain tissues later in development (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because heterozygous mutation of YY1 in the mouse resulted in growth and neurulation defects, and full knockout caused embryonic lethality around implantation, it appears likely that YY1 functions at multiple stages of mouse development (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was to identify and characterize YY1 in the Xenopus developmental model system. We found that YY1 mRNA and protein were expressed in early oocytes and were present at relatively constant levels throughout oocyte and embryonic development. The ability of YY1 to interact with its cis-recognition site was restricted to very early oocytes and to post-MBT stages in embryos, suggesting that the DNA binding activity of the maternal factor is modified specifically during development. Expression assays showed that YY1 had no effect on transcription from the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in oocytes, but we also found a similar lack of transcriptional activity in post-MBT embryos at a point in development when its DNA binding is reactivated. Analysis of the subcellular localization of YY1 showed it is sequestered in the cytoplasm of oocytes and in cells throughout the embryo up to as late as the neurula stage of development. We suggest that cytoplasmic sequestration is a mode of developmental regulation used to inhibit the transcriptional activity of YY1 during early stages of Xenopus development and that YY1 probably functions in cell differentiation events that occur later in development. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that YY1 is a maternally derived protein that is present throughout early Xenopusdevelopment. YY1 is expressed abundantly in early oocytes and, exists as a cytoplasmic protein in oocytes and early embryos, and its DNA binding activity is restricted to early oocytes and to post-MBT embryos. At first, the developmental profile of DNA binding prompted us to hypothesize that maternal YY1 might function to modulate expression of specific target genes in stage I oocytes and once again after MBT when expression from the zygotic genome commences in the embryo (46Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). However, we found that YY1 binding sites had no effect on expression from the TK promoter in oocytes or in post-MBT embryos, and so we surmised that endogenous YY1 is transcriptionally inactive during early development. The transcriptional inactivity of YY1 is consistent with our finding that YY1 remains in the cytoplasm of oocytes and in cells throughout the developing embryo well past MBT. Therefore, we suggest that the potential function of YY1 as a transcriptional regulator is specifically repressed by cytoplasmic partitioning during both oogenesis and early embryonic development.YY1 is a maternally expressed protein in unfertilized oocytes in both mouse (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and Xenopus. However, the subcellular localization pattern of YY1 in Xenopus is somewhat different from that in mouse development. Donohoe et al. (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) showed that YY1 is cytoplasmic in unfertilized mouse oocytes and becomes nuclear in two-cell embryos coincident with the onset of mouse zygotic transcription, and they suggested that YY1 probably functions to regulate gene expression early in mammalian embryonic development. No such nuclear relocalization occurs in Xenopus embryos at MBT, despite the apparent reactivation of its DNA binding activity at this stage. Unlike mouse embryos in which YY1 becomes nuclear at the 2-cell stage coincident with the onset of zygotic transcription, there is no apparent correlation between nuclear localization and the MBT inXenopus. Therefore, it would appear that YY1 does not have a direct transcriptional regulatory function at the initial stages of zygotic gene expression in Xenopus embryos or in early development to the neurula stage.The abundant maternal expression and subcellular localization reported in this study suggest two hypotheses for the potential developmental function of YY1. YY1 may function to regulate the transcription of genes important for differentiation and organ formation, which occur later in development. This has been suggested by numerous studies in various tissue culture model systems (1Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the expression pattern of YY1 in mouse embryos and the phenotype of heterozygous YY1 mutants (34Donohoe M.E. Zhang X. McGinnis L. Biggers J. Li E. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7237-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Alternatively, YY1 may play an important role in the cytoplasm during oogenesis and early embryogenesis, perhaps in the transport, storage, or translational regulation of maternal mRNAs. Such a cytoplasmic function would be similar to that proposed for the CCAAT box transcription factor (CBTF), which is retained in the cytoplasm prior to MBT through its RNA binding capacity and is associated with transcriptionally quiescent mRNP complexes (47Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nuclear relocalization of CBTF is associated with degradation of maternal transcripts (47Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Unlike CBTF, however, YY1 does not localize to the nucleus after MBT, which would suggest that it might associate with stable mRNAs. Further analyses will be aimed at determining whether YY1 has RNA binding activity and whether association with mRNPs might contribute to its cytoplasmic localization.It is paradoxical that YY1 remains in the cytoplasm and yet displays the differential ability to bind DNA through development, with peak activity in very early oocytes and in post-MBT embryos. Because it is unlikely that the extract preparation methods selectively activates DNA binding at these stages, we suggest that maternally derived YY1 is subject to post-translational modifications that occur in the cytoplasmin vivo. It could be that YY1 becomes primed to activate transcription but must receive the appropriate cellular signals to trigger nuclear translocation in specific tissues sometime during later in development.What is responsible for changes in the DNA binding activity of YY1 during development? There was no apparent correlation between nuclear localization and the ability of YY1 to bind DNA in gel mobility shift assays. DNA binding is probably not regulated by subcellular localization, because YY1 was retained in the cytoplasm throughout the same developmental time frame over which YY1 fluctuates between DNA-binding and non-DNA-binding forms. The ability to reactivate DNA binding activity in late stage oocytes by in vitrophosphatase treatments suggests that YY1 may be negatively regulatedin vivo by phosphorylation. However, we found no direct evidence that the phosphorylation state of YY1 changes as oocytes progress through developmental stages when DNA binding activity is lost or regained, and so the significance and mode of fluctuations in DNA binding during early development remain unclear.In summary, the data presented here suggest that the potential transcriptional activity of YY1 is repressed specifically during oocyte and embryonic development by sequestration to the cytoplasm. The functional significance of changes in the DNA binding activity of YY1 is unclear, and the potential role of YY1 the cytoplasm during development remains to be elucidated. Exclusion of YY1 from nuclei during early development explains the results of expression analyses in which YY1 binding sites had neither stimulatory nor repressive effects on basal transcription from the TK promoter in oocytes and embryos. In this study we have demonstrated that YY1 is a maternally derived protein that is present throughout early Xenopusdevelopment.

The ligand·receptor complex is based on experimental data from a series of photoaffinity labeling experiments and spectroscopic structural studies of extracellular domains of the NK-1R. Using the ligand/receptor contact points derived from incorporation of photolabile probes (p-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa)) into SP at positions 3, 4, and 8 and molecular dynamics simulations, the topological arrangement of SP within the NK-1R is explored. The model incorporates the structural features, determined by high resolution NMR studies, of the second extracellular loop (EC2), containing contact points Met174 and Met181, providing important experimentally based conformational preferences for the simulations. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to probe the nature of the two contact points identified for the Bpa3SP analogue (Bremer, A. A., Leeman, S. E., and Boyd, N. D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 22857–22861), examining modes of ligand binding in which the contact points are fulfilled sequentially or simultaneously. The resulting ligand·receptor complex has the N terminus of SP projecting toward transmembrane helix (TM) 1 and TM2, exposed to the solvent. The C terminus of SP is located in proximity to TM5 and TM6, deeper into the central core of the receptor. The central portion of the ligand, adopting a helical loop conformation, is found to align with the helices of the central regions EC2 and EC3, forming important interactions with both of these extracellular domains. The model developed here allows for atomic insight into the biochemical data currently available and guides targeting of future experiments to probe specific ligand/receptor interactions and thereby furthers our understanding of the functioning of this important neuropeptide system.

Over the years, a number of different methods have been employed to characterize the NK-1R and the mode in which it interacts with these peptide ligands as well as with a number of non-peptide antagonists that target the NK-1R. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence experiments, and engineering of zinc-binding pockets, a number of residues involved in the binding of the non-peptide antagonists has been identified (1Fong T.M.

Most of these residues are located within the hydrophobic core formed by the seven transmembrane helices (TM), predominantly in the region of TM5 and TM6. Using these putative sites of ligand/receptor interaction and computational models of the receptor, insight into the mode of ligand binding of these antagonists has been developed (7Holst B.

The development of a similar understanding of the binding of the peptide ligands SP and neurokinin A to the NK-1R has been much more challenging. Most of the residues identified as important for SP binding are in the N terminus or extracellular loops of the NK-1R (10Fong T.M., Yu, H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D.

These regions are not structurally characterized (in contrast to the bundle of transmembrane helices, homology modeling based on rhodopsin is not possible for the loops and termini); and therefore, molecular models have a much greater uncertainty associated with them. To address these issues, we have undertaken the structural characterization of the extracellular domains of the NK-1R (13MacDonald D. Mierke D.F. Li H. Pellegrini M. Sachais B. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The experimentally based conformational preferences can then be incorporated into the model of the full-length receptor. Coupling these data with the identification of ligand/receptor contact points as determined by photoaffinity labeling provides unique insight into the interactions involved in the binding of SP to the NK-1R. Here we describe a model for the binding of SP to the NK-1R that incorporates all of the experimental data currently available. The model contains the structural features of the second extracellular loop (EC2) of the NK-1R as recently determined by high resolution NMR (13MacDonald D. Mierke D.F. Li H. Pellegrini M. Sachais B.

Interestingly, Bpa3SP also forms a covalent bond with a residue in the proximal N terminus of the NK-1R (residues 11–21). The structural consequences of Bpa3SP interacting with two sites, either sequentially or simultaneously, are examined here by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Incorporating all of the results from photoaffinity labeling and structural studies provides for one of the most advanced, experimentally based models of any peptide hormone G protein-coupled receptor.

The loops connecting the transmembrane helices were generated using a metric matrix distance geometry program, employing the distances between the transmembrane helices as restraints. The structural features of the second extracellular loop, NK-1R-(162–198), as determined by high resolution NMR were directly incorporated into the model. The disulfide bond between Cys105 and Cys180, in the first and second extracellular loops, respectively, was created. In an attempt to develop the conformational preferences of the other extracellular domains of the NK-1R, the corresponding sequences were submitted to a BLAST search (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). The homologous regions of each of these protein structures were analyzed for conformational features. The secondary structural features were then incorporated into the molecular model (21Prado G.N.

Preliminary simulations were run to determine the preferred docking mode of the ligand to the receptor. Using three different orientations of SP placed above the receptor, extensive simulated annealing cycles (1000 to 300 K over 100 ps) were run in conjunction with distance restraints derived from the photoaffinity labeling experiments. The ligand·receptor complexes that best fulfilled the experimental restraints were utilized as starting structures for the following simulations. Based on numerous NMR studies of SP, an α-helix in the center of the sequence, from Gln4 to Phe8, was assumed (25Woolley G.A. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1987; 26 suppl.: S109-S121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Tallon M. Ron D. Halle D. Amodeo P. Saviano G. Temussi P.A. Zelinger Z. Naider F. Chorev M.

To guide the docking of the ligand to the receptor, restraints with a target value of 12 Å were applied for the following ligand/receptor pairs of atoms: CG Phe8/SG Met181, CG Gln4/SG Met174, CG Lys3/SG Met174, and CG Lys3/CG Glu21, with a force constant of 500 kJ mol−1nm−1. The latter two distance restraints, corresponding to the results presented in the accompanying article (17Bremer A.A. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22857-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were applied individually during separate simulations as well as simultaneously. The distance of 12 Å was chosen to provide ample freedom for the receptor and ligand to adjust to the constraint, to optimize the ligand/receptor interactions, and to account for the incorporation of a Bpa-containing ligand used in the photoaffinity labeling experiments. To refine the molecular model, molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization were carried out with the GROMACS program (30Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Buuren R. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1995; 95: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7193) Google Scholar). The membrane environment was mimicked by a 40-Å layer of decane molecules, with ∼40-Å layers of water above and below (31van Buuren A.R. Marrink S. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 9206-9216Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The simulation cell was 132 × 81 × 71 Å and consisted of 12,906 water molecules and 518 decane molecules. The seven-helix bundle of the receptor was placed in the decane layer with the extra- and intracellular regions within the water phases. All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out on an SGI Origin 2000 computer. The structure and arrangement of the transmembrane helices of our model of the NK-1R are based on the experimental data reported for rhodopsin (18Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 19Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Unger V.M. J. Mol.

This model has proven to be very effective when applied to the design of zinc-binding sites in the seven-TM bundle of the NK-1R (6Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Nielsen S.M. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 814: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Holst B. Zoffmann S. Elling C.E. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. Mol.

Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), supporting the use of rhodopsin as a good template for the modeling of peptide-based G protein-coupled receptors of class I. Indeed, during the simulations, the helical bundle was stable, undergoing very minor displacements (<1.0-Å root mean square deviation); the resulting structures were found to be in accord with the results from the incorporation of zinc-binding sites. For the modeling of the extracellular domains of the NK-1R, two different sources were used to provide structurally relevant data: experimentally based spectroscopic studies and theoretically based homology analysis. The NMR-derived structure of the receptor fragment NK-1R-(162–198), consisting of the entire second extracellular loop, was incorporated into the model (13MacDonald D. Mierke D.F. Li H. Pellegrini M. Sachais B. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Homology modeling, following published procedures (21Prado G.N. Mierke D.F. Pellegrini M. Taylor L. Polgar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33548-33555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 22Roelz C. Pellegrini M. Mierke D.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6397-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Paterlini G. Portoghese P.S. Ferguson D.M. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3254-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was used in an attempt to obtain structural information for the remaining extracellular loops and N terminus. A number of structures with sequences homologous to these regions of the NK-1R were identified. A comparison of the secondary structure motifs of these homologous regions suggests that the central portion of both EC1 (Val94–Trp98) and EC3 (Asp276–Ile283) has a propensity to form an α-helix. In addition, the far N terminus, consisting of Asn3–Asp10, was found to be α-helical, and a turn was found for Pro13–Asn14. These secondary structural elements were introduced into the initial model of the receptor. The contact points identified from photoaffinity labeling were used as distance restraints during the MD simulations. The different sites identified with Bpa3SP were examined individually and concurrently with separate simulations. The previously determined contact points (e.g. Bpa4SP/Met174and Bpa8SP/Met181) (13MacDonald D. Mierke D.F. Li H. Pellegrini M. Sachais B. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Kage R. Leeman S.E. Krause J.E. Costello C.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25797-25800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Li H. Macdonald D.M. Hronowski X. Costello C.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10589-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were utilized during all of the simulations. The results for Bpa3SP required special handling. The identification of two distinct regions of the NK-1R (EC2 and N terminus) that form covalent linkages with Bpa3SP presents two possible scenarios. Given the short distance required for photoaffinity covalent bond formation (values of 3.1 Å are assumed (34Winnik M.A. Chem. Rev. 1981; 81: 491-534Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar)), it is clear that the benzoylphenylalanine must be in close proximity to the identified contact point. The first scenario has the N terminus and EC2 of the NK-1R in close proximity to each other, and therefore, Bpa3SP can interact with both. The other possibility has the N terminus and EC2 distal from each other, and Bpa3 is in close proximity to either one at different times (e.g. during the binding process, Bpa3 is close to the N terminus and then to EC2 or vice versa); or there are two equilibrium binding modes (in one, Bpa3 is close to the N terminus; in the other, it is close to EC2). To explore these different possibilities for Bpa3SP, three different simulations were run starting with SP in the bound state using the distance restraints generated from Bpa4SP and Bpa8SP. The simulation employing a distance restraint between Bpa3SP and the N terminus alone was deemed uninformative since the distance between Bpa3 and Met174 satisfied the restraint anyway (recall that there is a restraint between SP Gln4 and NK-1R Met174 based on previous photoaffinity labeling experiments (16Li H. Macdonald D.M. Hronowski X. Costello C.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10589-10593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). Therefore, we describe below the results from the simulations in which Lys3 of SP is restrained to Met174 alone and to both Met174 and the N terminus (residues 11–21) simultaneously. In both of the simulations, the overall orientation of SP within the receptor is very similar. The N-terminal portion of SP, Arg1-Pro2-Lys3, projects toward TM1 and the proximal N terminus of the NK-1R. The C terminus of the ligand, Gly9-Met10-Leu11-NH2, projects toward the extracellular end of TM3 and TM6 and deeper into the core of the seven transmembrane helices. Concerning the extracellular domains, the helix centrally located in EC2 (13MacDonald D. Mierke D.F. Li H. Pellegrini M. Sachais B. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2530-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the putative helix in EC3 align in an almost parallel fashion with the helical loop in the middle of SP. The distal portion of EC2 is not involved in stabilizing the bound ligand. Many of these features are shown in Fig. 1. The C-terminal portion of EC2 lies over the ligand, forming a number of important ligand/receptor contacts. A superposition of the transmembrane helices and extracellular domains (backbone atoms of residues 30–56, 69–131, 144–218, and 244–306), excluding the N terminus, of the resulting structures from the two simulations produced a root mean square deviation of 1.0 Å. Including the ligand in the superposition produced a root mean square deviation of 1.2 Å. An illustration of the ligand structures from the former superposition of the receptors is shown in Fig.2. The conformation of the ligand from the two simulations is similar; when distance restraints between both the N terminus and EC2 to SP Lys3 are applied, the ligand structure is slightly elongated, resulting from the N terminus lying over the ligand. Importantly, the orientation and displacement of the side chains of SP are almost identical, especially in the C terminus of the ligand. The variation in the N terminus of the ligand can be attributed to the close proximity of the N terminus of the NK-1R brought about by the two distance restraints applied to Lys3 in one of the simulations. Concentrating on the C terminus of the ligand, clearly the resulting mode of binding is not altered by including the distance constraint between position 3 of SP and the N terminus. During simulations utilizing only the Bpa3SP/Met174 contact point, the N terminus of the NK-1R does not approach the central TM core of the receptor, maintaining the orientation and topology of the starting structure. Importantly, the secondary structure elements postulated from homology modeling are also maintained during the simulation and therefore are energetically stable by the force field. In contrast, when the distance restraints between Lys3 of SP and the N terminus and EC2 are applied simultaneously, the N terminus of the NK-1R folds up and over the N-terminal portion of the ligand, forming a number of additional ligand/receptor contacts. As expected, most of the ligand/receptor interactions are concentrated on the extracellular portion of the central core formed by the transmembrane helices. In Fig. 3, many of these interactions are depicted. The receptor has been cut in half, with TM2-EC1-TM3 and TM4-EC2-TM5 displayed on one panel and N terminus-TM1 and TM6-EC3-TM7 on the other. The residues of the NK-1R forming important interactions with SP are depicted. Beginning with Arg1 of SP, the side chain is found to project out away from the receptor, interacting with the solvent in the simulation using only the distance restraint to EC2. In the second simulation, in which the N terminus folds over the ligand, a number of ligand/receptor interactions are formed. Favorable coulombic interactions include SP Arg1 with the side chain of receptor Asp8 and Glu21. The guanidinyl function of Arg1 is also stabilized by interactions with NK-1R Ser16. In both simulations, SP Pro2 is directed downwards, forming a large number of interactions with the NK-1R. The side chain is found in a hydrophobic pocket formed by NK-1R Asn96, Tyr100, and Tyr104. In the simulation utilizing the distance restraint to the N terminus of the NK-1R, Val4, Met7, and Phe12 contribute to the hydrophobic pocket for SP Pro2 from the extracellular face. The side chain of SP Lys3 is projecting away from the central core of the receptor, toward the solvent, forming only minimal contacts with the receptor. In the second conformation, interaction between the side chain amino group and NK-1R Asn18 is observed. Consistent with the application of the distance restraints derived from the photoaffinity labeling experiments, the distance between the side chains of SP Lys3 and NK-1R Leu11, Pro13, Ile15, Met174, Pro175, and Met181 are 4.0, 4.6, 5.6, 3.6, 6.5, and 5.5 Å, respectively. The second proline of SP, Pro4, projects toward the extracellular end of TM1 and EC1, in a similar fashion as described for Pro2. Both Trp30 of the NK-1R proximal N terminus and Tyr104 of EC1 are in close proximity in both simulations. In the second simulation, Phe12 of the NK-1R far N terminus folds over, forming the pocket for SP Pro4. The distance between the CG of SP Pro4 and the CE of NK-1R Met174 is under 6.0 Å. Continuing along SP, Gln5 and Gln6 are found to project in opposite directions, with Gln5 directed toward the solvent (with minimal interaction with the NK-1R) and Gln6 forming a number of interactions deep within the central core of the receptor. The backbone carbonyl of Gln6forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain amino group of Lys177 of the NK-1R. The side chain amide of Gln6 is found sandwiched between a group of aromatic residues, including NK-1R Tyr99, Tyr104, Phe107, and His108. Based on previous studies substituting the amino acids of SP, Phe7 has been shown to be vital for binding to and activation of the NK-1R. Therefore, it is not surprising to find an extremely large number of ligand/receptor interactions. In Fig.4, all of the residues within a 6-Å radius of Phe7 are depicted. The residues are from the N terminus (Asn18, Thr19, Glu21, Gln31, and Ile32), EC1 (Phe107), EC2 (Arg177), and EC3 (Leu277, Tyr278, Leu279, Lys280, Phe282, and Gln284) of the NK-1R. During the simulations, the side chain of Phe7 undergoes transitions between the different χ1 rotamers. Energy minimization of the three different conformations results in low energy structures, without significantly altering the ligand/receptor contacts. This flexibility within the binding pocket could indicate an important role in activation or differences between the high and low affinity states of ligand binding. Position 8 of SP has been utilized for the incorporation of residues containing a photolabile moiety during the course of the photoaffinity labeling experiments with only a modest decrease in affinity for the NK-1R. Our results illustrate a number of interactions between Phe8 and hydrophobic residues of EC2 (Met181, Ile182, and Trp184), close to the disulfide bond that covalently connects EC2 to EC1 (i.e.Cys105–Cys180). The hydrophobic side chains of the C-terminal residues of SP, Leu10-Met11, are both projecting into the central core formed by the transmembrane helices, occupying hydrophobic pockets formed from a large number of residues mainly from TM3, TM6, and TM7. Phe107 and His108 from TM3; Trp184 from EC2; and Ile283, Gln284, and Trp297 from TM7 contribute to the binding pocket for SP Leu10. The binding pocket for SP Met11 is formed by Ile113 (TM3); Trp196 (TM5); and Pro268, Pro271, and Trp272 (TM6). The C-terminal amide forms a number of important contacts with the receptor, including the backbone of Pro271 and side chains of Lys106, Trp184, Tyr272, and Lys280. The binding pocket for SP Met11-NH2 is illustrated in Fig. 5. A number of studies aiming to identify the regions of the NK-1R involved in the binding of SP have appeared. These investigations fall into two general classes: mutational studies of the receptor and photoaffinity labeling studies. In mutational studies, the receptor is altered, and the effects on ligand binding are monitored. This classification includes engineering of zinc-binding sites and introducing chemically reactive cysteine residues for labeling (e.g. fluorescent tag) or formation of disulfide bonds. Photoaffinity labeling studies provide evidence for direct contacts between ligand and receptor by formation of covalent bonds. Results from the former were used to establish the starting structure (particularly the zinc-binding pockets), whereas findings from the latter were used during the simulations as experimentally based restraints for the interaction of SP with the NK-1R. One of the major topological features of the extracellular region of the NK-1R is the presence of a disulfide bond connecting the extracellular end of TM3 and EC2. This bond is observed in many seven-TM receptors and, in some cases, is the most conserved feature between distantly related receptors. In the NK-1R, the disulfide bond between Cys105 (on the extracellular end of TM3) and Cys180 (located centrally in EC2) has been shown to be essential for high affinity binding of the SP ligand (14Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Interestingly, engineering of additional cysteines into the NK-1R does not disrupt the wild-type disulfide bond (35Elling C.E. Raffetseder U. Nielsen S.M. Schwartz T.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The presence of the disulfide linkage leads to two pseudo-loops out of EC2, connecting TM3 to TM4 and TM3 to TM5. Importantly, many of the residues that have been implicated in SP binding by mutational or photoaffinity labeling studies are in close proximity to this disulfide bond (14Boyd N.D. Kage R. Dumas J.J. Krause J.E. Leeman S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the convergence of three extracellular domains of the receptor at the top of TM3, centrally located in the core of the seven-TM receptor, seems to be intimately involved in the binding of SP. Indeed, the resulting binding mode shows a parallel arrangement of the helix-like structure of SP with the helix in the center of EC2, with a large number of ligand/receptor interactions. The C terminus of SP is in close proximity to the extracellular ends of TM3, TM6, and TM7. The interactions with TM3 are particularly interesting because of the unusual orientation within the seven-TM bundle, traversing the membrane diagonally with respect to the other six transmembrane helices (20Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of rhodopsin has TM3 in the center of the TM bundle, involved in several key interhelical interactions. The binding mode of SP described here is in perfect accord with the results from a series of fluorescence-based experiments (4Turcatti G. Zoffmann S. Lowe III, J.A. Drozda S.E. Chassaing G. Schwartz T.W. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Placing fluorescent probes at the N and C termini of SP and using aqueous soluble quenching agents, it was clearly demonstrated that both of the termini of SP are solvent-accessible when bound to the NK-1R. Importantly, positions 1 and 3 of SP were deemed to be much more solvent-accessible than the C terminus (4Turcatti G. Zoffmann S. Lowe III, J.A. Drozda S.E. Chassaing G. Schwartz T.W. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21167-21175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). According to the results of the MD simulations carried out here, the covalent linkage between Bpa3SP and the N terminus of the NK-1R requires the N terminus to fold over on top of the seven-TM bundle, forming a number of contacts with the ligand. In the model, Lys3 of SP is found in close proximity to a number of hydrophobic residues of the NK-1R N terminus (Leu11, Pro13, and Ile15), suggesting that the substitution with Bpa may enhance this interaction and indeed result in the covalent linkage to the N-terminal fragment of residues 11–21. These residues are substantially closer together than the upper bound of 12 Å imposed during the simulations as distance restraints. The conformation of the N terminus of the NK-1R, determined from the MD simulations carried out here, must be regarded as only one possible result consistent with all of the experimental data in hand. Current computational methodologies do not allow for a full exploration of all possibilities. Nonetheless, the conformation resulting from the simulations not only fulfills the experimental restraints applied during the simulation, but can also account for previous results from site-directed mutagenesis and chimera studies (10Fong T.M., Yu, H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Fong T.M., Yu, H. Strader C.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 59-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These studies illustrate that the N terminus of the NK-1R, including residues 14–29, is required for high affinity peptide binding (10Fong T.M., Yu, H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 11Fong T.M., Yu, H. Strader C.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 59-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), with Asn23, Gln24, and Phe25 being particularly important (36Fong T.M. Huang R.R., Yu, H. Strader C.D. Regul. Pept. 1993; 46: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Fong T.M. Huang R.C., Yu, H. Swain C.J. Underwood D. Cascieri M.A. Strader C.D. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Asn23 and Gln24 are conserved between the NK-1R and NK-3R, and Phe25 is conserved among all three tachykinin receptor types; it is therefore intriguing that the covalent attachment site of Bpa3SP is just upstream from these residues. The conservation of these residues has led to the speculation that the Asn23–Phe25 region of the NK-1R may play an important structural role in positioning or stabilizing the tertiary structure of the N terminus. Indeed, in the resulting model, these residues are at the point where the N terminus bends; the residues preceding Asn23 are projecting over the seven-TM core, whereas the residues after Phe25 are largely associated with the membrane (e.g. the hydrophobic residues Trp30, Ile32, Val33, and Leu34) before the beginning of TM1 at Trp35. The N-linked glycosylation of the N terminus of the NK-1R (Asn14 and Asn18) would certainly play an important role in the proposed folding of the N terminus over the ligand in the central core of the seven transmembrane helices. The presence of the carbohydrate side chain residues does not appear to be necessary for ligand binding to the NK-1R as determined independently by photoaffinity labeling experiments (38Kage R. Hershey A.D. Krause J.E. Boyd N.D. Leeman S.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and receptor mutational analysis (10Fong T.M., Yu, H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that differentialN-linked glycosylation may function to maintain membrane receptors in different agonist binding states in vivo (39Rens-Domiano S. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20094-20102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a hypothesis that may receive more attention now that both SP and neurokinin A are reported to be high affinity NK-1R functional agonists (40Hastrup H. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 264-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 41Sagan S. Beaujouan J.C. Torrens Y. Saffroy M. Chassaing G. Glowinski J. Lavielle S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 42Bremer A.A. Leeman S.E. Boyd N.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The N-linked carbohydrate residues may also function to kinetically modulate the conformational conversion from a low affinity agonist binding state on the NK-1R into a high affinity agonist binding state. One possibility is that the N terminus folds over the central core of the receptor, inhibiting the dissociation of SP, thereby producing the high affinity state. In the binding mode proposed here, both Asn14 and Asn18 are projecting out away from the ligand, therefore consistent with glycosylation. Currently, the role of the N terminus of the receptor in ligand binding is still unresolved, and additional experimental data are required. Experiments toward this end are currently underway in our laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W1973648392,"Bright (B cell regulator of IgHtranscription) is a B cell-specific, matrix associating region-binding protein that transactivates gene expression from the IgH intronic enhancer (Eβ). We show here that Bright has multiple contextual requirements to function as a transcriptional activator. Bright cannot transactivate via out of context, concatenated binding sites. Transactivation is maximal on integrated substrates. Two of the three previously identified binding sites in Eβ are required for full Bright transactivation. The Bright DNA binding domain defined a new family, which includes SWI1, a component of the SWI·SNF complex shown to have high mobility group-like DNA binding characteristics. Similar to one group of high mobility group box proteins, Bright distorts Eβ binding site-containing DNA on binding, supporting the concept that it mediates Eβ remodeling. Transfection studies further implicate Bright in facilitating spatially separated promoter-enhancer interactions in both transient and stable assays. Finally, we show that overexpression of Bright leads to enhanced DNase I sensitivity of the endogenous Eβ matrix associating regions. These data further suggest that Bright may contribute to increased gene expression by remodeling the immunoglobulin locus during B cell development. Bright (B cell regulator of IgHtranscription) is a B cell-specific, matrix associating region-binding protein that transactivates gene expression from the IgH intronic enhancer (Eβ). We show here that Bright has multiple contextual requirements to function as a transcriptional activator. Bright cannot transactivate via out of context, concatenated binding sites. Transactivation is maximal on integrated substrates. Two of the three previously identified binding sites in Eβ are required for full Bright transactivation. The Bright DNA binding domain defined a new family, which includes SWI1, a component of the SWI·SNF complex shown to have high mobility group-like DNA binding characteristics.

Most of the previously identified factors bind to the enhancer core, and several have been shown to have some B cell specificity in terms of expression or ability to transactivate. However, no binding site in isolation can confer all of the tissue-specific regulation seen in vivo. Ultimately, this is the result of cumulative interactions of various nuclear factors with both DNA and each other. The Eβ core segment alone can increase transcription in transient systems (6Kiledjian M. Su L.K. Kadesch T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Lenardo M.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1999; 9: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Bright was the first shown to directly affect gene transcription.MARs and attachment to the nuclear matrix can mediate specific alterations in chromatin structure (31Käs E. Polijak L. Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Pemov A. Bavykin S. Hamlin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1998; 70: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism seemed reasonable for Bright, based on features of its DNA binding. Highly specific binding within the minor groove is achieved by virtue of two domains (reviewed in Ref. 35Webb C. Zong R.-T. Lin D. Wang Z. Kaplan M. Paulin Y. Smith E. Probst L. Bryant J. Goldstein A. Scheuermann R. Tucker P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a self-association/tetramerization domain, termed REKLES for a heptapeptide conserved within this region among Bright orthologues, and a DNA binding region, termed ARID for AT-rich interactiondomain. The Bright ARID defined a new family of DNA-binding proteins, including SWI1, a component of the SWI·SNF complex that has been shown to remodel chromatin (36Peterson C.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and p270, its apparent mammalian orthologue (37Dallas P.B. Cheney I.W. Liao D.-W. Bowrin V. Byam W. Pacchione S. Kobayashi R. Yaciuk P. Moran E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 18: 3596-3603Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Components of human SWI·SNF appear to be tightly associated with the nuclear matrix (38Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least a fraction of this complex could be involved in chromatin organizational properties associated with MARs (reviewed in Ref. 39Schnitzer G.R. Sif S. Kingston R.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 63: 535-543Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Like SWI·SNF, all ARID proteins bind AT-rich DNA, but only members that contain both ARID and REKLES bind specifically to AT-rich MAR motifs (35Webb C. Zong R.-T. Lin D. Wang Z. Kaplan M. Paulin Y. Smith E. Probst L. Bryant J. Goldstein A. Scheuermann R. Tucker P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In this report we further characterize the mechanisms through which Bright functions and the contextual requirements for Bright transactivation. We also show that Bright bends its DNA target on binding. This, along with the observation that Bright overexpression induces increased DNase I hypersensitivity of the enhancer, provides a rationale for how this protein may facilitate enhanced expression of the immunoglobulin gene.DISCUSSIONHerrscher et al. (13Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) described Bright as a B cell-specific transcription factor capable of transactivating expression from the IgH enhancer (Eβ). In this report we have characterized the contextual requirements of Bright transactivation to further understand how it, and potentially other MAR binding factors, can affect transcription levels. The data presented in this report support several mechanisms for Bright-mediated transcriptional regulation.Using transient transfection analysis we have demonstrated that context is important for Bright transactivation. Bright was unable to transactivate gene expression from a concatamerized binding site, suggesting that it required interaction with specific factors to function. Furthermore, Bright only acts through the P2 and P4 sites of the Eβ MARs. This was initially surprising, because Bright binds the P3 site as strongly as P2 and suggested spatial constraints for the interactions of Bright with other factors. This suggested that Bright might function to form tertiary structures of the enhancer DNA and interact with additional DNA-binding proteins or adaptor molecules. In support of this, we demonstrated that Bright distorts DNA. Studies with the T cell receptor α-chain enhancer have shown the requirement for DNA bending and distortion to remodel DNA so that transcription factors whose binding sites are spatially distant can interact (46Giese K. Kingsley C. Kirshner J.R. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 995-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It is possible that Bright plays a similar role in the induced immunoglobulin expression of late stage B cells.Synergy between promoter and enhancer transactivation in both the transient and stable transfections suggest an additional level of function for Bright. Because Bright exists in a tetrameric form, and only two functional chains are required for Bright binding in a gel shift assay (13Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), it is likely that one Bright molecule could bind two sites. Indeed, these studies suggest that Bright could bring an enhancer in apposition to the promoter and directly affect transcriptional activation. This effect would be consistent with studies that have implicated the IgH enhancer MARs in long range (Ig heavy chain variable gene segment promoter-mediated) transcriptional activation (8Forrester W.C. van Genderen C. Jenuwein T. Grosschedl R. Science. 1994; 265: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 44Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 385: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 47Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Forrester W. Grosschedl R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In comparing transgenic β expression in lines generated from wild-type and MAR-deleted Eβ constructs, no VH-initiated transcripts were detected from the MAR-deleted locus (47Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Forrester W. Grosschedl R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using a different approach, Artandiet al. (48Artandi S.E. Cooper C. Shrivastava A. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7704-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TFE3 proteins binding in the Ig promoter and enhancer could cooperate when binding sites were placed proximal and distal of a CAT gene, presumably through interaction of two dimers. Bright already exists as a tetramer and so would not require any additional protein-protein interactions to carry out this function.This study also provides functional evidence for the MAR binding function of Bright. Transient transfections with the S107 promoter fragment, which contains a MAR (45Webb C.F. Das C. Eneff K.L. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5206-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), demonstrated that Bright was unable to transactivate from this site. In contrast, when this construct was stably transfected, Bright was now able to affect a 4-fold increase in transcription consistent with the concept that MARs only have effects when they are integrated into the chromosome. We previously demonstrated that Bright protein can be matrix-associated (13Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The fact that Bright is only capable of transactivating from the S107 promoter only when it is integrated suggests that Bright can function by modifying or mediating matrix attachment. One difference between the S107 plasmid and the construct with Eβ in the proximal position, which can mediate transactivation in a transient assay, may be the availability of other interacting co-factors. This highlights the context-dependent activity of Bright. Bright may interact with some factors during a transient assay and allow activation from Eβ, whereas matrix attachment is required for transactivation from a substrate that may have limited DNA binding factors associated with it for Bright interaction. In support of interactions such as this, we have recently shown that Bright associates with members of the Sp100 family, which co-localize with Bright in nuclear domains and act as co-factors in transactivation (20Zong R.-T. Das C. Tucker P.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4123-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, Bright has multiple requirements for transactivation activity, but the context-dependent activity may also provide multiple mechanisms for Bright to activate gene transcription.Ectopic overexpression of Bright revealed an altered pattern of chromatin organization within the IgH enhancer in WEHI 231 B cell nuclei. Consistent with previous studies (44Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 385: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 47Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Forrester W. Grosschedl R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 49Ephrussi A. Church G. Tonegawa S. Gilbert W. Science. 1985; 227: 134-0138Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the pattern of untransfected WEHI 231 nuclei is restricted to the Eβ core. The assembly of this complex, as judged by in vivodimethyl sulfate methylation patterns, has been shown to be independent of the flanking MARs (47Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Forrester W. Grosschedl R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Under conditions where Bright is expressed at high levels, DNase I hypersensitivity appears to extend upstream, to include the high affinity P2 site-containing MAR, but not downstream of the core. This third, highly extended configuration extending across the 3′ MAR is observed in the two IgM-secreting plasmacytomas that transcribe β at ∼50-fold higher levels. Similarly, the Igκ 3′ enhancer assumes three states of DNase I detectable accessibility, which correlate strictly with stage of B cell development (50Roque M.C. Smith P.A. Blasquez V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3138-3155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). That the Bright overexpressing cells may have begun to transition from mature to activated is consistent with the increased Eβ accessibility and the slightly increased levels of β transcription observed here and with the appearance of active Bright·MAR binding complexes both in normal B cell populations and in B cell lines observed previously (13Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 19Webb C.F. Smith F.A. Medina K.L. Buchanan K.L. Smithson G. Dou S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4747-4754PubMed Google Scholar). Based on its SWI1 similarities, nuclear matrix residence, and MAR bending properties, it is tempting to consider a direct role for Bright in this remodeling. However, both known classes of chromatin remodeling enzymes, SWI·SNF and the histone acetyltransferases, exist as large multicomponent, ATP-hydrolyzing complexes (reviewed in Ref. 36Peterson C.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have no evidence for or against participation of Bright as a B cell-restricted member or recruiter of either. However, MARs do confer local regions of histone acetylation (51Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a different target gene system, Cux has been shown to form a complex with histone deacetylase that leads to gene inactivation (52Li S. Moy L. Pittman N. Shue G. Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7803-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Bright could mediate derepressive chromatin remodeling indirectly through its successful competition with Cux/histone deacetylase. In a similar logic, Bright, along with related chromatin remodeling proteins, would then be in a position to clear out regions carrying the cis-acting regulatory elements of the core, contributing to the accessibility of conventional DNA binding transactivators to promoter and enhancer elements.Studies presented in this report suggest some novel mechanisms for the regulation of immunoglobulin gene expression. They confirm that Bright acts in a restricted manner by binding specific sites in the IgH promoter and enhancer and by potentially interacting with other factors within the enhancer core. It further provides some insight into the mechanism of enhancer function and more specifically, how Bright may play an important role in Ig gene expression. Further analysis of these Bright new alternatives should yield a greater understanding of long-standing questions regarding gene regulation. Transcriptional regulation of genes during development and differentiation is tightly controlled through several mechanisms. The tissue specificity conferred by the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (Eβ)1 has been studied extensively both for understanding Ig regulation and as a model for enhancer function (reviewed in Ref. 1Ernst P. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1995; 2: 427-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Eβ is a complex unit containing binding sites for multiple transcription factors and can functionally be broken down into two segments, the core and the flanking matrix associating regions (MARs) (2Adams J.M.

However, no binding site in isolation can confer all of the tissue-specific regulation seen in vivo. Ultimately, this is the result of cumulative interactions of various nuclear factors with both DNA and each other.

This nonglucosylated oligosaccharide lipid precursor is used as donor forN-glycosylation. In this paper we demonstrate that a significant part of the glycans bound to the newly synthesized glycoproteins in MI8–5 cells are monoglucosylated. The presence of monoglucosylated glycans on glycoproteins determines their binding to calnexin as part of the quality control machinery.

This indicates that part of the monoglucosylated glycoproteins can be directed toward a deglycosylation process that occurs in the cytosol.

Dol, dolichol phosphate-buffered saline castanospermine high pressure liquid chromatography 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio[-1-propanesulfonic acid A key reaction of N-glycosylation is the transfer en bloc of a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2oligosaccharide from a lipid intermediate to an Asn residue in the Asn-Xaa-Ser(Thr) consensus sequence of a nascent protein. ThisN-glycosylation process is immediately followed by sequential deglucosylation leading to Man9GlcNAc2 protein. It is now clearly established that oligosaccharide trimming in the ER1 is intimately linked to the quality control process, leading to the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins or unassembled multimeric proteins. Indeed the presence of monoglucosylated oligomannosides on glycoproteins retained in the ER is essential for their binding to the molecular chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (1Ware F.E.

The presence of a glucosyl residue is controlled by reglucosylation-deglucosylation cycles involving UDP-glucose : glycoprotein glucosyltransferase acting as a folding sensor (3Sousa M.C. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and glucosidase II, respectively. It has been demonstrated that glucose trimming and reglucosylation cycles determine the association of a glycoprotein with calnexin, as well as its folding (4Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A.

During this quality control, part of newly synthesized glycoproteins are degraded after translocation of the glycosylated polypeptide chains from the ER to the cytosol. As first demonstrated by Wiertz et al. (6Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), using labeled protein with an amino acid precursor, this retrotranslocation is accompanied by the removal of the glycans by a cytosolic peptide N-glycanase (PNGase), such as the one isolated by Suzuki et al.

The relationship between the location of the enzyme and the degradation process has been discussed by Karaivanova and Spiro (8Karaivanova V.K. Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, it is worth mentioning that few labs follow the fate of newly synthesized proteins by labeling with [2-3H]mannose. In this case, theN-glycosylation process is accompanied by the release of glycans from either lipid intermediates or from newly synthesized glycoproteins (9Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M.

The trafficking of the released oligomannosides from both origins leads to the formation of oligosaccharides possessing one GlcNAc residue at the reducing end (OSGn1) in the cytosol (for reviews see Refs. 12Cacan R. Verbert A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1999; 258: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Verbert A. Cacan R. Biochim. Biophys.

A Chinese hamster ovary mutant, MI8–5, was found to synthesize Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol rather than fully glucosylated lipid intermediate (15Quellhorst G.J. O'Rear J.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Krag S.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This mutant cell line was found to be deficient in dolichol-P-Glc:Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol glucosyl transferase activity. This defect is similar to the one observed for CDGIc (congenital disorders ofglycosylation) (16Burda P. Borsig L. de Rijk-van Andel J. Wevers R. Jaeken J. Carchon H. Berger E.G. Aebi M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that although in MI8–5 the oligosaccharide lipids are nonglucosylated, part of the glycans bound to glycoproteins are monoglucosylated. Furthermore, we observe the formation of Glc1Man5GlcNAc1species that could only originate from a deglycosylation mechanism occurring during glycoprotein degradation. Our work demonstrates that the quality control system for newly synthesized glycoproteins is intact in MI8–5 cells. This cell line gives us a biological model to determine the nature of oligosaccharides released from protein independently of what is happening at the reducing end. Mutant cell line MI8–5 was isolated as described previously (15Quellhorst G.J. O'Rear J.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Krag S.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). [2-3H]Mannose (429 Gbq/mmol) and [U-14C]glucose (10 Gbq/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. PNGase F and castanospermine were purchased from Glyko, (Novato, CA). α-Mannosidase from jack bean, protease inhibitors, and trypsin were obtained from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody anti-calnexin was from StressGen. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and concanavalin A-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. MI8–5 cells were routinely cultured in monolayers in α-minimal essential medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 34 °C in 10-cm Petri dishes under air/CO2 (19:1). Cells were labeled with 50 μCi/ml of [2-3H]mannose in α-minimal essential medium containing 0.5 mm glucose and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After incubation, the medium was removed, and the cell layer was rinsed rapidly twice with ice-cold PBS. When a chase was performed, pulse-labeled cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for different times in α-minimal essential medium containing 5 mm glucose. When used, castanospermine (Cst) was maintained throughout the incubation and the chase periods at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Sequential extraction and purification of free oligosaccharide material were then achieved as described previously (9Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M. Michalski J.C. Mir A.M. Labiau O. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The protein pellet was digested overnight at room temperature with 0.2 mg of trypsin in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9. The glycan moiety linked to protein was cleaved by PNGase F as follows: the trypsin-treated protein was boiled for 10 min to destroy the trypsin activity, and the peptides were dried and dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm EDTA, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.02% NaN3. PNGase F was then added (0.5 mIU) for incubation overnight at 37 °C. Size analysis of the glycan moieties was achieved by HPLC on an amino-derivatized Asahipak NH2P-50 (250 mm × 4.6 mm) column (Asahi, Kawasaki-ku, Japan) with a solvent system of acetonitrile/water from 70:30 (v/v) to 50:50 (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 80 min. Under these conditions the oligomannosides can be resolved by their numbers of mannose, glucose, and GlcNAc residues from Man to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. Oligomannosides were identified by their retention times as described previously (9Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M. Michalski J.C. Mir A.M. Labiau O. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar); separation of the labeled oligosaccharides was monitored by continuous-flow detection of the radioactivity with a Flo-one β detector (Packard). For enzymatic treatment with jack bean α-mannosidase, oligosaccharides released after PNGase digestion were dissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. The incubation was achieved overnight at 37 °C with 0.5 units of jack bean α-mannosidase. The incubation mixture was then analyzed by HPLC. MI8–5 cells were labeled with 25 μCi/ml of [U-14C]glucose per dish in α-minimal essential medium without glucose containing 5 mm mannose, 50 μg/ml Cst, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Pulse-labeled cells were washed twice with PBS and chased during 2 h in α-minimal essential medium containing 5 mm glucose and 50 μg/ml Cst. Sequential extraction was then achieved as described previously (9Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M. Michalski J.C. Mir A.M. Labiau O. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The protein pellet was digested overnight at room temperature with trypsin in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9, and glycans were then removed by PNGase F treatment. Both oligosaccharides bound to glycoproteins, and free oligosaccharides were purified by concanavalin A chromatography. The lectin column (concanavalin A-Sepharose; 5 × 0.5 cm) was equilibrated in 5 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmMnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 at room temperature. The fraction resulting from PNGase F action on glycoprotein fraction and free oligosaccharides were applied to the column. The strongly retained [14C]-labeled oligomannosides were eluted with 100 mm α-d-mannoside. Peak A (originating from glycoproteins) and peak B (originating from free oligomannoside material) were then isolated by preparative HPLC. The isolated peaks A and B were then submitted to acid hydrolysis (4 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C during 4 h). After drying under nitrogen, free monosaccharides were cochromatographed with [2-3H]mannose as an internal standard using HPLC under isocratic conditions with a solvent system of acetonitrile/water (80:20 (v/v)) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 20 min. [2-3H]Mannose-labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin, 1 mg/ml 4-(2 aminoethyl) benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The cell lysate was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads and immunoprecipitated for 16 h at 4 °C with anti-calnexin antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed thrice in high salt buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS) followed by two washes in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Immunoprecipitated [2-3H]mannose-labeled glycoproteins were digested overnight at room temperature with 0.2 mg of trypsin in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.9. After PNGase treatment, glycan moieties linked to protein were analyzed by HPLC as described above. MI8–5 cells transfer onto proteins only nonglucosylated oligosaccharides (15Quellhorst G.J. O'Rear J.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Krag S.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To compare the fate of glycans bound to glycoproteins synthesized in parental (K1–2 cells) and MI8–5, these cells were pulse-labeled during 60 min with [2-3H]mannose in the conditions described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 1,a and b represent the pattern of glycans released from glycoproteins of K1–2 and MI8–5 after PNGase treatment. Although the oligosaccharide bound to lipid intermediates in K1–2 and MI8–5 cells was different (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol for parental cells and Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol for mutant cells), the oligomannoside species bound to proteins seems to be similar. In particular, a species having a higher retention time than Man9GlcNAc2 can be detected in MI8–5 (peak A). This raised the question of the nature and of the molecular composition of this oligomannosides species. Peak A has been isolated, and its sensitivity toward jack bean α-mannosidase has been compared with the Man9GlcNAc2 species used as control. The action of jack bean α-mannosidase on isolated Man9GlcNAc2 species (Fig.2 a) leads to the formation of 88% of free mannose and 12% of Man1GlcNAc2 species (see Fig. 2 b and Table I). These results indicate that the totality of α-linked mannose residues has been removed. In contrast, the same incubation of isolated peak A (Fig. 2 c) with jack bean α-mannosidase leads to the formation of 30% of free mannose and 70% of higher species migrating as hexose(6–8)GlcNAc2, peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively (see Fig. 2 d and Table I). The absence of a resulting Man1GlcNAc2 species suggests that only partial hydrolysis of peak A was performed by the enzyme. It has to be noted that when incubation was achieved with higher enzyme concentration, the proportion of peak 1 increases, but peaks 2 and 3 remained detectable. This suggests that peak 1 is the limit product of the hydrolysis of peak A by jack bean α-mannosidase. Moreover, peak 1 comigrated with the Glc1Man5GlcNAc2 species that corresponds to the major oligomannoside species synthesized by mannosylphosphoryldolichol-deficient cell line B3F7 (not shown). Partial digestion of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 species isolated from the glucosidase I-deficient cell line Lec23 has also been obtained leading to a mixture of three species (17Ray M.K. Yang J. Sundaram S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22818-22825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in our case, complete digestion to a single product was not observed even after longer incubations. Furthermore, it has been clearly demonstrated on bovine rhodopsin that jack bean α-mannosidase is not able to cleave an unsubstituted α1,6-linked mannose from the core β-mannose (18Liang C.J. Yamashita K. Muellenberg C.G. Shichi H. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6414-6418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these observations, because the smallest species is Glc1Man5GlcNAc2. According to our results, we can postulate that peaks 1, 2, and 3 correspond to Glc1Man5GlcNAc2, Glc1Man6GlcNAc2, and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2, respectively.Table IProportion of various species obtained after jack bean α-mannosidase treatment of [2-3 H]mannose-labeled oligomannoside species isolated from MI8–5 glycoproteinsHydrolysis productsTreated substratesMan9 GlcNAc2Isolated peak AOligosaccharides released from glycoproteins bound to calnexinFree mannose883030Man1GlcNAc21200Species ≥ Glc1Man5 GlcNAc2 (peaks 1 + 2 + 3)07070The values are expressed as percent of the input radioactivity. Open table in a new tab The values are expressed as percent of the input radioactivity. MI8–5 cells were metabolically labeled with tritiated mannose in the presence of 50 μg/ml of Cst (an inhibitor of rough ER glucosidases). Comparing panels a andb of Fig. 3, there was clearly an increase of the radioactivity bound to peak A in the presence of Cst. As Cst has been demonstrated to prevent deglucosylation of newly synthesized glycoproteins, this observation strongly suggests that peak A represents a glucosylated species. MI8–5 cells were pulse-labeled with [U-14C]glucose during 1 h in the presence of 50 μg/ml of Cst as described under ”Materials and Methods.“ After a PNGase treatment of the protein pellet, oligomannoside-type glycans were purified by concanavalin A chromatography. [14C]-Labeled peak A (see Fig. 1 b) was then isolated by HPLC and submitted to acid hydrolysis to release monosaccharides. Fig. 4 b shows chromatography of the [14C]-labeled hydrolysate of peak A with [2-3H]mannose as an internal standard. The HPLC profile showed the presence of both [14C]mannose and glucose residues. All the data from HPLC, α-mannosidase treatment, and composition analysis demonstrate that the species migrating as peak A is glucosylated and possesses the following molar composition: Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Because oligomannosides synthesized in MI8–5 are transferred onto nascent proteins as nonglucosylated species, it can be assumed that the presence of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 bound to glycoproteins originated from a subsequent glucosylation process of the Man9GlcNAc2 species. At the present time it has been well demonstrated that the presence of the glucosyl residue is controlled by reglucosylation-deglucosylation cycles involving the UDP-glucose : glycoprotein glucosyltransferase and glucosidase II, respectively (3Sousa M.C. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that the trimming and readdition of glucose to N-linked oligosaccharides determine the association of a glycoprotein with calnexin, as well as its folding (4Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 5Cannon K.S. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7537-7544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We next determined whether the reglucosylation of oligomannosides onto glycoproteins seen in MI8–5 cells resulted in an association with calnexin. MI8–5 cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with [2-3H]mannose, and the radioactivity was chased for 1 h. To preserve glucosylated oligomannosides, Cst was maintained in the media during the entire experiment. After immunoprecipitation of the cell lysate with anti-calnexin antibodies, immunoprecipitated glycoproteins were trypsin-treated and subjected to a PNGase treatment before being analyzed by HPLC. Fig. 5reveals the presence of two peaks, the first one migrating as Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 and the second one as Glc1Man8GlcNAc2. The hydrolysis of each peak by jack bean α-mannosidase leads to the same pattern as the one obtained after hydrolysis of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 (peak A) isolated from glycoproteins (Table I). These results indicate that the reglucosylated oligomannoside glycans of MI8–5 could associate with calnexin. Therefore, the quality control system for newly synthesized glycoproteins appeared intact in MI8–5 cells. It has been shown that the N-glycosylation process is accompanied by the release of free oligomannoside material originating from both oligosaccharide-lipid hydrolysis and degradation of glycoproteins (12Cacan R. Verbert A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1999; 258: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Verbert A. Cacan R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Moore S.E.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 441-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated in mutant cell lines lacking mannosylphosphoryldolichol that the free oligosaccharides released from oligosaccharide-lipid or glycoprotein are degraded into an oligomannoside isomer, Man5GlcNAc1 (9Kmiécik D. Herman V. Stroop C.J.M. Michalski J.C. Mir A.M. Labiau O. Verbert A. Cacan R. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because MI8–5 cells do not glucosylate the glycan bound to oligosaccharide-PP-Dol but do glucosylate the glycans on proteins, this offers a biological model to discriminate oligosaccharides originating from glycoproteins. Indeed, after plasma membrane permeabilization with streptolysine O of MI8–5 cells (not shown), free oligomannosides are released from semi-intact cells indicating their cytosolic location. As shown in Fig.3 c these oligomannosides recovered after a pulse-chase experiment with [2-3H]mannose possessed one GlcNAc residue at the reducing end indicating that they have been processed in the cytosol. Man5GlcNAc1 appeared as the major species. However, a peak B having a higher retention time could be observed. The proportion of radioactivity associated with peak B increased from 20 to 80% in the presence of 50 μg/ml Cst (Fig.3 d). Peak B was isolated after a pulse labeling of MI8–5 cells for 1 h in the presence of [U-14C]glucose and 50 μg/ml Cst. As shown in Fig.6, the cochromatography of this peak B with free oligomannosides synthesized by B3F7 cells (a Man-P-Dol-deficient cell line that synthesizes only truncated Man5 bearing oligomannosides) reveals that peak B coeluted with Glc1Man5GlcNAc1 species. Acid hydrolysis of the [14C]-labeled peak B revealed the presence of both mannose and glucose residues (Fig. 4 c). These data indicate that in MI8–5 cells, glucosylated glycans bound to glycoproteins are released and processed to give a unique intermediate, Glc1Man5GlcNAc1. The lack of dolichol-P-Glc:Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol glucosyl transferase activity in MI8–5 cells leads to the synthesis of nonglucosylated Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, which is transferred to protein (15Quellhorst G.J. O'Rear J.L. Cacan R. Verbert A. Krag S.S. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that reglucosylation-deglucosylation cycles occur on glycoproteins of MI8–5 cells, because the presence of monoglucosylated glycans has been demonstrated. As in all cell lines studied up to now, the presence of monoglucosylated glycans determines the association of newly synthesized glycoproteins with calnexin. Indeed, immunoprecipitation of glycoproteins synthesized in MI8–5 cells by anti-calnexin antibodies revealed the presence of two oligomannoside species, Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. The more interesting aspect of this work is the demonstration that the Glc1Man5GlcNAc1 species is a component of the soluble free oligomannoside material. These glucosylated oligosaccharides originated from glycoproteins, because in MI8–5 cells glucosyl residues are recovered only on glycoproteins. Endoplasmic reticulum to cytosol transport of oligomannosides possessing two GlcNAc residues at the reducing end (OSGn2) is known to be specific for nonglucosylated species (19Moore S.E.H. Bauvy C.

J. 1998; 335: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is now well established that OSGn2 are converted to OSGn1 species by a cytosolic chitobiase (21Cacan R. Dengremont C. Labiau O. Kmiécik D. Mir A.M. Verbert A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus the finding of glucosylated OSGn1 in MI8–5 cells indicates that the deglycosylation process of glycoproteins occurred in the cytosol prior to their degradation. When looking at the reducing end of the released oligomannosides, a discrepancy appears between the previous demonstration of the PNGase action (6Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) releasing OSGn2 and the monoglucosylated OSGn1 observed in this study. Two alternatives can be proposed, either there was successive action of PNGase and chitobiase, or there was cleavage by a cytosolic β-endoglucosaminidase (22Pierce R.J. Spik G. Montreuil J. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,23Pierce R.J. Spik G. Montreuil J. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The study of oligomannosides produced by MI8–5 cells suggests the following pathway for the formation of Glc1Man5GlcNAc1: after retrotranslocation of polypeptides bearing monoglucosylated glycans (Glc1Man8GlcNAc2 and Glc1Man9GlcNAc2), deglycosylation occurs in cytosol liberating Glc1Man8GlcNAc1 and Glc1Man9GlcNAc1. These OSGn1 are substrates for the cytosolic α-mannosidase (24Grard T. Herman V. Saint-Pol A. Kmiécik D. Labiau O. Mir A.M. Alonso C. Verbert A. Cacan R. Michalski J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) generating the observed Glc1Man5GlcNAc1. The fate of this oligosaccharide is still in question, because up to now, no α-glucosidase activity has been detected in the cytosol. Although its transport into lysosomes has not yet been studied (25Saint-Pol A. Codogno P. Moore S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13547-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), our results suggest a lysosomal degradation into Man5GlcNAc1 and lower species. The question remains whether glycoproteins bearing monoglucosylated glycans and being directed toward degradation must be linked to calnexin, as demonstrated by Liu et al. (26Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) for the degradation of misfolded α1-antitrypsin."

These tumor-suppressive and antiproliferative properties have been mapped to the left half of the AAV genome, which codes for the multifunctional regulatory protein Rep78 (15Yang Q. Kadam A.

Small DNA viruses such as adenovirus, papilloma virus, and SV-40 rely on the host cell for many of the steps needed for their own propagation. They encode proteins that inactivate the function of a key cellular growth-regulatory protein, the retinoblastoma gene product (pRB), to facilitate a productive viral infection in an otherwise quiescent cell (17Levine A.J. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The retinoblastoma protein, pRB, is an important regulator of the G1-S transition (18Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y.

It controls the expression of several genes activated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which includes its own expression (20Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1681-1686PubMed Google Scholar) disrupting the normal cell growth controls. Because AAV inhibits the oncogenic potentials of such a wide variety of DNA tumor viruses, we investigated whether AAV interferes with the disruption of the pRB-E2F-1 complex, which is the hallmark of all DNA tumor virus-mediated cell proliferation. This report shows that AAV Rep78 acts on E2F-1 at transcription as well as pRB interaction levels to decrease E2F-1 activity and provides a definite molecular mechanism for the antioncogenic property of AAV Rep78. pCMV-E2F-1 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Helin (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy); pE2F-1 Luc (−728) was supplied by Dr. Joseph R. Nevins (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC); and GST-E2F-1 and pE2-luciferase were from Dr. Ed Harlow (Harvard University, Boston, MA). pCMV-Rep78 was constructed as follows. AAV Rep78 was PCR-amplified using the ExpandTMhigh fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) withBglII overhangs using linearized plasmid, pAS203. The primers used were 1) Rep321BglF (forward) (5′-CTG CAG ATC TAT GCC GGG GTT TTA CGA G-3′) and 2) Rep2186, BglR (reverse) (5′ CTG CAG ATC TAT TTA TTG TTC AAA GAT GCA G 3′). PCR product was gel-purified (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and cloned into pBAD/TOPOR ThioFusion vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The resulting plasmid was digested with BglII, and the 1.87-kilobase pair AAV Rep78 was gel-purified. This Rep78 fragment was cloned into a pCMV vector, downstream of the CMV promoter, which was digested with BamHI. Cell lines (293, HeLa, and normal human fibroblasts) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin G/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. AAV type-2 was prepared from HeLa cells infected with adenovirus-2, and AAV-2 and purified as described previously (31Batchu R.B. Shammas M.A. Wang J.Y. Munshi N.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3592-3595PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out with 10 multiplicity of infection units of adenovirus-2 and/or AAV-2 on semiconfluent fibroblasts HeLa or 293 cells, and the cells were harvested at the described time intervals. Plasmids pCMV-E2F-1, pCMV-Rep78, pE2F-1 luciferase, and pE2 luciferase were transfected into human cells using the Effectene transfection kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), as described by the manufacturer. One day prior to transfection, 105 cells were plated per well of a six-well tissue culture plate. DNA (0.5 μg/transfection) was sequentially mixed with enhancer and effectene reagent and layered on monolayer cells. After 2–4 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh regular growth medium, and cells were further subjected to viral infections with adenoviral and/or AAV as described earlier. The cells were lysed inside the wells by using 200 μl of lysis buffer and harvested at described intervals. The luciferase assay was performed using a luciferase assay detection system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). RNase protection assay was performed using the “Riboquant” multiprobe RNase protection assay system (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). A human cell cycle regulator multiprobe template set, hTS-1 (containing E2F1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA sequences) was utilized to synthesize [32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA probe. Template DNA molecules were digested with RNase-free DNase, and the probe was purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Purified probe (105 cpm) was mixed with 10 μg of total RNA from 293 cells in hybridization buffer. Hybridization was carried out for 16 h at 56 °C. Free probe and single-stranded RNA molecules were digested with a mixture of RNase A and T1. The “RNase-protected” molecules were purified and resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. Histidine-tagged Rep78 protein was produced and purified as previously described (31Batchu R.B. Shammas M.A. Wang J.Y. Munshi N.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3592-3595PubMed Google Scholar). GST-E2F-1 fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were affinity-purified with the MicroSpinTM GST purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purification was carried out under native conditions, essentially following the protocol provided by the company. Briefly, small overnight cultures were transferred to 1 liter of LB broth and cultured until the absorbency (A600) reached 0.7. Then isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the incubation was continued for 4 h after the induction. The cell pellet was suspended in 40 ml of PBS and freeze-thawed three times and incubated with lysozyme at room temperature for 10 min. Later, the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 40 °C, and supernatant was used for the purification of GST-E2F-1. The purity of both proteins was confirmed by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. His-Rep78 protein was expressed as described earlier, and protein was adsorbed to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the instructions given by the manufacturer. p53 protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was chromatographed on the Rep78 affinity column by incubating at 4 °C for 30 min. Next, the His-Rep78 was eluted with 250 mmimidazole and subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Some blots were also transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as mentioned earlier for probing with antibodies. Approximately 100 ng of GST-E2F-1 already bound to the MicroSpinTM GST purification module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in 0.5 ml of 0.25% gelatin, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA. After this blocking step, the column was centrifuged at 2000 rpm at room temperature and washed twice with 0.5 ml of the appropriate binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 250 mm NaCl. Rep78 (100 ng) was added to the beads in the column containing 200 μl of binding buffer, and binding was allowed to take place with gentle rocking at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were washed five times with binding buffer, and each wash included a 10-min rocking step. After the final wash, the column was eluted with reduced glutathione, and samples were boiled for 2 min in Laemmli buffer and loaded onto 8–12% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-Rep78 antibodies. Aliquots of total protein extracts (100 μg) from cells after different virus treatments were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-Cl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1% SDS, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 2 min and applied on either 8, 12, or 8–12% (32Tyagi R.K. Babu B.R. Datta K. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) glycerol gradient SDS-acrylamide along with a 10-kDa protein ladder (Life Technologies), electrophoresed for 16 h (Bio-Rad PROTEIN II system) at 60 V. Gels were electroblotted overnight onto nitrocellulose paper (Trans-Blot, 0.2-μm transfer membrane; Bio-Rad) at 40 V for 3 h in a Tris-glycine buffer system. Transfer was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the blot. Nonspecific sites on the blots were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST). Incubation with various antibodies (AAV Rep78 (American Research Products; San Jose, CA), p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or β-actin (Sigma)) was performed for 2 h in PBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin with constant rocking. Blots were washed three times with PBST and incubated in either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates for 2 h in PBST containing 3% nonfat dry milk. After washing, specific proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence, according to the instructions provided in the manual (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cell culture plates (100 mm), after various treatments, were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) for 30 min with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A cell pellet was freeze-thawed three times and incubated on ice at 4 °C with constant shaking for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by refrigerated centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 rpm. Supernatants were collected, and protein content was estimated using the Micro BCA kit (Pierce). Protein contents of all samples were normalized to 10 mg/ml with lysis buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Immunoprecipitations were conducted as described previously (31Batchu R.B. Shammas M.A. Wang J.Y. Munshi N.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3592-3595PubMed Google Scholar). Oligomers used in the assay were custom synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) and 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITR) used in the assay were generated using three separate oligonucleotide ligations: AAV TR1, 5′-TGA GGC CGC CCG GGC AAA GCC CGG GCG TCG GGC GAC CTT TGG TCG CCC GGC CTC AGT GAG C-3′; AAV TR2, 5′-CAC TCG CTC GCT CGC GCG TCT CTC CCT CAC CGG TTG AGG TAG TGA TCC CCA ATG GA-3′; and AAV TR3, 5′-GAG CGA GCG CGC AGA GAG GGA GTG GCC AAC TCC CAT CAC TAG GGG TTC CT-3′. The E2F-1 promoter containing three Rep78 binding consensus sequence tetramers, GCTC together with the adjacent E2F-1 binding site, were synthesized, and complementary sequences were annealed before radiolabeling. This double-stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as E2F-1R+. A scrambled sequence of the three Rep78 binding tetrameric sequences of both polarity was custom synthesized and annealed, and this double-stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as E2F-1R−. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: E2F-1R+ forward oligonucleotide, 5′-GCG GCG CTC GGC GGC TCG TGG CTC TTT CGC GGC AA-3′; E2F-1R+ reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-TTG CCG CGA AAG AGC CAC GAG CCG CCG AGC GCC GC-3′; E2F-1R− forward oligonucleotide, 5′-GCG GCA GCA GGC GCG TCG TGC GAT TTT CGC GGC AA-3′; E2F-1R− reverse oligonucleotide, 5′-TTG CCG CGA AAA TCG CAC GAC GCG CCT GCT GCC GC-3′. Mobility shift assays were essentially conducted as described earlier (10Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Batchu R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5299-5304PubMed Google Scholar). An adenovirus-mediated increase in E2F-1 trans-activation activity is essential for activation of various genes leading to DNA amplification and cell proliferation (33Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because AAV inhibits the adenovirus and other DNA virus-mediated cellular DNA replication and cell proliferation, we examined the expression of E2F-1 protein in the presence or absence of AAV in adenovirus-infected human cells. Cell extracts were prepared from HeLa, infected at various time points with adenovirus and/or AAV, and analyzed by Western blot with E2F-1 antibodies. Adenoviral infection dramatically increased the E2F-1 protein levels that appeared at 24 h and reached maximum at 48 h after viral infection. The increased E2F-1 levels were significantly reduced upon co-infection with AAV (Fig.1 A). To correlate the changes in E2F-1 levels with AAV Rep protein expression, we probed the cell lysates with anti-Rep antibody. Significant Rep protein expression was observed at 48 h after the infection and reached a plateau by 72 h, correlating with the maximum inhibition in the E2F-1 levels (Fig. 1 A). To eliminate any bias associated with a particular cell line, we have evaluated these changes in two additional cell types: normal human fibroblasts and 293, a human kidney cancer cell line. Similar changes in E2F-1 levels were observed in normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4) and in 293 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–8), coinciding with maximal AAV Rep protein expression in these cell types. A RNase protection assay performed three times in normal human fibroblasts revealed an overall 7.5 ± 2.1-fold decrease in the E2F-1 RNA level upon AAV infection of adenovirus-infected fibroblasts (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the adenoviral mediated up-regulation of E2F-1 expression is significantly inhibited upon AAV infection, which is reflected at both RNA and protein levels. Rep78 is known to bind to various heterologous promoters, leading to inhibition of the transcription (15Yang Q. Kadam A. Trempe J.P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6058-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hermonat P.L. Plott R.T. Santin A.D. Parham G.P. Flick J.T. Gynecol.

Previous experiments indicated that AAV inhibits adenovirus-mediated up-regulation of E2F-1. To understand the mechanism behind AAV-mediated inhibition of E2F-1 gene expression, we evaluated the E2F-1 promoter sequence that revealed Rep78 DNA-binding motifs, GCTC (8Batchu R.B. Kotin R.M. Hermonat P.L. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 36Chiorini J.A. Wiener S.M. Owens R.A. Kyostio S.R. Kotin R.M. Safer B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7448-7457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Weitzman M.D. Kyostio S.R. Kotin R.M. Owens R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5808-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), proximal to the binding sites for E2F-1 on its own promoter element (Fig.2 A). Homologous binding sites for Rep78 on the E2F-1 promoter raised the possibility of its interaction and possible control of transcription of the E2F-1 gene. We designed a 35-base pair oligonucleotide of the E2F-1 promoter sequence encompassing the putative Rep78 and E2F-1 binding sites (E2FR+) and a mutated version where the Rep78 binding sequence is scrambled (E2FR−). A gel shift assay was used to determine whether Rep78 binds to these homologous motifs. We observed a dose-dependent increase in the binding activity of purified Rep78 protein to the homologous binding sites on E2F-1 promoter (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3). The band shifts were successfully competed by AAV ITR, a known DNA binding sequence of Rep78, indicating the specificity of binding (Fig.2 B, lanes 3–5). The specificity of binding was further confirmed by lack of competition by cold mutated E2F-1 oligonucleotide with a scrambled Rep78 binding sequence (E2FR−), (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). To further confirm the specificity of Rep78 binding to the E2F-1 promoter sequence, a change in band shift of known Rep78 binding DNA sequences (AAV ITR) with affinity-purified Rep78 was evaluated with E2F-1 promoter sequences. Cold oligonucleotide containing the Rep78 homologous DNA binding motif on the E2F-1 promoter (E2FR+) was able to compete with the gel shift, while mutated homologous Rep78 binding motif on E2F-1 promoter (E2FR−) was unable to compete with the band shifts generated by AAV ITR and Rep78 protein (Fig. 2 C). This strongly suggests the specific binding of AAV Rep78 to its putative binding motif on the E2F-1 promoter. To investigate the functional implications of AAV Rep78 binding to the E2F-1 promoter, we evaluated E2F-1 promoter activity in the presence or absence of AAV in adenovirus-infected cells. Cells were transfected with a E2F-1-luciferase plasmid construct (pE2F-1 Luc) followed by adenovirus and/or AAV infections, and cell extracts were prepared as noted under “Experimental Procedures.” Luciferase activity measured in these extracts directly reflects the E2F-1 promoter activity. The adenovirus-mediated increase in the E2F-1 promoter activity was dramatically reversed to basal levels upon AAV co-infection in normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 3 A), 293 cell line (Fig. 3 B), and HeLa cell line (Fig.3 C) at time points that coincided with the AAV gene expression in these cells (p < 0.001). Interestingly, AAV alone also inhibited the E2F-1 activity, although the conditions in the absence of helper virus do not allow maximal expression of Rep78. To specifically evaluate the role of Rep78 in the observed AAV-mediated inhibition of E2F-1 transcription, we conducted the same set of experiments using transfection of a eukaryotic expression plasmid containing the full-length Rep78 gene under CMV promoter control (pCMV-Rep78) instead of AAV infection. The adenovirus-mediated increase in the E2F-1 transcriptional activity, as determined by luciferase assay, was dramatically reversed to basal levels with the co-transfection of pCMV-Rep78 plasmid in all three cell types (Fig. 3,D–F) (p < 0.001). Combined, these experiments indicate that AAV through Rep78, interferes with the E2F-1 gene expression to inhibit the adenovirus-mediated up-regulation. Apart from the control at transcriptional level, activity of E2F-1 is also controlled through its binding to pRB. However, binding of adenoviral E1A to the pRB in adenovirus-infected cells results in the dissociation of pRB-E2F-1 complex (38Ikeda M.A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7029-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of AAV on E1A-induced dissociation of the pRB-E2F-1 complex, cellular extracts with and without AAV/Ad treatments were immunoprecipitated with anti-pRB antibodies, and the complex was resolved on 8–12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with E2F-1 antibodies in fibroblasts, 293 cells, and HeLa cells. In both untreated cells and cells treated with AAV alone (normal human fibroblasts, Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and 2; 293 cells, Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 2; and HeLa cells, Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6), E2F-1 co-immunoprecipitated with pRB antibodies. As expected, E2F-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with pRB in adenovirus-infected cells, indicating that the pRB-E2F-1 complex is dissociated in these cell types (Fig. 4,A, lane 3, and B,lanes 3 and 7). However, co-infection of adenovirus-infected cells with AAV showed E2F-1 co-immunoprecipitation with pRB antibodies, confirming the presence of Rb-E2F-1 complex in all three cell lines (Fig. 4, A,lane 4, and B, lanes 4 and 8). Additionally, we have analyzed the immunodepleted lysate from normal human fibroblast showing that, following pRB precipitation of adenovirus-infected cell lysate, there is a high level of E2F-1 remaining in the immunodepleted lysate; however, as the complex is stabilized in the presence of AAV Rep78, the amount of free E2F-1 is decreased in the immunodepleted lysate (Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 6), further indicating that pRB and E2F-1 are bound in adenovirus +AAV samples. Since we did not observe any change in the adenoviral E1A levels or its binding to pRB following AAV superinfection of adenovirus-infected cells (data not shown), we hypothesized that AAV Rep78 may directly bind to either pRB or E2F-1, resulting in the inhibition of the E1A-mediated dissociation of the complex. Cell lystates were immunoprecipitated separately with E2F-1 and pRB antibodies and probed for the presence of Rep78 protein. We observed AAV Rep78 and Rep52 (spliced product of Rep78) in the immunoprecipitates with both pRB and E2F-1 antibodies, indicating interaction of AAV Rep78 with either E2F-1 or pRB or both, leading to the stabilization of the complex (Fig.5 A). To further analyze whether Rep78 interacts with pRB or E2F-1, we investigated in vitro interaction between purified Rep78 with purified pRB and E2F-1 proteins. AAV Rep78 affinity columns were made, and different amounts of E2F-1 were passed through the columns. Bound proteins were eluted with imidazole, and the resulting extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using Rep78 and E2F-1 antibodies. We observed interaction of E2F-1 protein with AAV Rep78 as seen by the co-elution of Rep78 with E2F-1 (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). To exclude the possibility that GST E2F-1 protein may interact with a histidine tag on Rep78 protein, we passed the GST-E2F-1 alone in the histidine affinity column in the absence of AAV Rep78. As seen in Fig.5 B, lane 2, GST-E2F-1 does not bind to the histidine affinity column. We have also carried out GST-E2F-1 affinity chromatography, where the GST-E2F-1 affinity columns were prepared as mentioned in the methods and incubated with increasing concentrations of purified AAV Rep78. Bound GST-E2F-1 was eluted with reduced glutathione, and the resulting extracts were probed for AAV Rep78 by Western blot analysis. A dose-dependent increase in the binding of AAV Rep78 is observed with GST-E2F-1 (Fig.5 C, lanes 2–4). AAV Rep78 alone does not show any binding to the GST affinity column in the absence of GST-E2F-1 (Fig. 5 C, lane 1). When the purified pRB was passed through the AAV Rep78 affinity column, no pRB co-elution with AAV Rep78 was observed as confirmed by Western blotting with pRB antibodies of the eluted extracts (Fig. 5 D,lane 2). When a complex containing E2F-1 and pRB was applied to the column, we observed both of the proteins bound to the resin (Fig. 5 D, line 3). Thesein vitro experiments show that AAV Rep78 directly interacts with E2F-1 but not with pRB. Earlier experiments indicated that AAV Rep78 acts at the E2F-1 transcription and the pRB-E2F-1 complex levels. This dual level inhibition of adenovirus-mediated increase in the levels of E2F-1 results in the reduced “free E2F-1” in the cells. Reduced free E2F-1 levels should result in the down-regulation of E2F-1-mediated transcriptional activity of various S-phase cellular genes. We utilized a plasmid construct with E2 promoter containing several E2F-1 binding motifs along with a luciferase gene to evaluate the functional consequences of reduced “free E2F-1” levels upon AAV infection of adenovirus-treated cells. Here the measured luciferase activity will be directly proportional to the transcriptional activity of the E2 promoter. In all three cell types, fibroblasts, 293 cells, and HeLa cells, adenovirus-mediated up-regulation of E2 promoter activity was reduced to the basal level upon AAV infection (data not shown). To ascertain if the observed inhibition of E2 promoter activity by AAV is due to Rep78, we evaluated effect of transfection of pCMV-Rep78 plasmid. Adenoviral mediated up-regulation of E2 promoter activity was significantly reduced in all three cell lines upon transfection of CMV Rep78 (Fig. 6) (p < 0.001). Progression of cells from one phase of the cell cycle to the next is regulated by transformation-sensitive checkpoint genes (39Murray A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The pRB regulates progression of the cell past the restriction point in G1 by negatively regulating the activity of E2F-1 (18Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 293-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 19Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar,40Mulligan G. Jacks T. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 223-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The normal activity of E2F-1 is regulated at two different levels. First, the abundance of E2F-1 is regulated at the level of transcription. For example, E2F-1 is undetectable in quiescent cells but is transcriptionally induced following mitogenic stimulation in late G1. (20Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) Second, transactivation by E2F-1 is negatively regulated by complex formation with pRB (41Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The small DNA tumor viruses such as adenovirus, SV40, and the human papillomavirus have evolved specific early genes to disrupt the pRB and E2F-1 interactions, thereby effectively promoting cell proliferation (17Levine A.J. Bioessays. 1990; 12: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 42Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7474) Google Scholar) and also indicating that E2F-1 is a common cellular target of DNA tumor viruses (29Chellappan S. Kraus V.B. Kroger B. Munger K. Howley P.M. Phelps W.C. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4549-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 30Pagano M. Durst M. Joswig S. Draetta G. Jansen-Durr P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1681-1686PubMed Google Scholar). Adenovirus requires E2F-1 transcription factor for two purposes: to interact with adenovirus E4 protein and transactivate the E2 promoter (28Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 659-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and to activate transcription of multiple growth-responsive cellular genes that contribute to cellular and viral DNA synthesis (22DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 27Farnham P.J. Slansky J.E. Kollmar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The primary event in adenovirus-mediated cellular transformation is to enhance the cellular “free E2F-1” levels (28Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 659-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 43Raychaudhuri P. Bagchi S. Neill S.D. Nevins J.R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2702-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is in this context that we evaluated E2F-1 as a primary target for AAV in mediating anti-transforming effects. Co-infection with AAV clearly reduces the E2F-1 protein levels in adenovirus-infected cells, and the effect is mediated at the transcription level. Additionally, the level of free E2F-1 is further reduced by inhibiting dissociation of the pRB-E2F-1 complex. The ability of a single protein (Rep78) to inhibit function of a single target gene at both the transcriptional level and at the protein-protein interaction level is interesting. Although the function of Rep78 is similar to pRB in that it binds to E2F-1 and keeps it functionally dormant, there are no sequence similarities between pRB and Rep78. In addition, the mode of Rep78 action on pRB-E2F-1 interaction certainly appears to be through its interaction with E2F-1, since in vitro assays show binding of Rep78 only with E2F-1 and not pRB or E1A. The possibility of Rep78 acting by down-regulating E1A levels or by interfering with its binding ability to pRB was ruled out (data not shown). AAV Rep78 is a transcription factor with binding affinity, especially when multiple GCTC motifs are present in close proximity (8Batchu R.B. Kotin R.M. Hermonat P.L. Cancer Lett. 1994; 86: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Batchu R.B. Hermonat P.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Hermonat P.L. Santin A.D. Batchu R.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5299-5304PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of a putative Rep78 binding site on the E2F-1 promoter (Fig. 2 A) was confirmed by band shifts. The demonstrated repression of E2F-1 promoter activity provides clear evidence for control of E2F-1 expression by Rep78. Although the mechanism behind thetrans-inhibitory activity of Rep78 is not yet understood, the position of Rep78 binding site on E2F-1 promoter that lies within one base pair of the E2F-1 binding site raises an interesting possibility of Rep78 interfering with autoactivation by E2F-1 of its own promoter. Further studies are required to identify such a relationship. The activity of Rep78 on an important cellular target, E2F-1, also explains the ability of Rep78 to inhibit the transforming activity of a variety of DNA tumor viruses and also its antiproliferative activity in normal untransformed cells. The diminished levels of E2F-1 with AAV infection in primary human cells in the absence of adenoviral infection were recently reported (44Hermanns J. Schulze A. Jansen-Durr P. Kleinschmidt J.A. Schmidt R. zur Hausen H. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6020-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which further supports the activity of AAV Rep78 on E2F-1, even in the absence of transforming virus infection. Since E2F-1 is known to have autoregulatory activity, it is also possible that the observed down-regulation of the E2F-1 promoter is resultant of the activities of both Rep78 and E2F-1. However, autoregulation of E2F-1 promoter activity has been reported to be only modest (3.5-fold) (20Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In our observation in three different cell lines, down-regulation of adenovirus-induced E2F-1 activity by either AAV (Fig. 3, A–C) or Rep78 was between 6- and 10-fold, indicating that the binding of Rep78 to E2F-1 promoter does contribute to the down-regulation of the transcriptional activity. Evolution of AAV Rep78 remains an enigma; however, inclusion of two important checkpoints of E2F-1 function in one protein product raises the possibility that these functions may have later separated into various protein products capable of controlling E2F-1 transcription and its interaction and dissociation from pRB. The functional consequence of reduced free E2F-1 is confirmed using an E2F-1-responsive promoter with multiple E2F-1 binding sites. That similar effects are reproduced using transfection of CMV-Rep78 plasmid as with wild-type AAV provides compelling evidence that Rep78 is responsible for AAV's functional anti-transforming activity. The model of how AAV inhibits the oncogenicity of DNA viruses and possibly other transformation events is becoming more clear. Because the primary targets for the DNA tumor viruses are tumor suppressor genes, p53 and pRB, AAV Rep78 may target this level of cellular control of proliferation. We recently observed that AAV in fact protects the adenovirus-mediated destruction of p53 (31Batchu R.B. Shammas M.A. Wang J.Y. Munshi N.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3592-3595PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we show that it affects E2F-1 function not only by preventing Rb-E2F-1 dissociation but also at transcription level, so that overproduction of E2F-1 does not overcome the ability of pRB to regulate E2F-1 function (45Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments provide the evidence that Rep78 may be able to reverse some of the major early molecular events necessary for cellular transformation.

The three major hemoglobin components (HbI, HbII, and HbIII) from the hagfish Myxine glutinosahave been characterized and compared with lamprey Petromyzon marinus HbV, whose x-ray crystal structure has been solved in the deoxygenated, dimeric state (Heaslet, H. A., and Royer, W. E., Jr. (1999) Structure 7, 517–526). Of these three, HbII bears the highest sequence similarity to P. marinus HbV. In HbI and HbIII the distal histidine is substituted by a glutamine residue and additional substitutions occur in residues located at the deoxy dimer interface of P. marinus HbV. Infrared spectroscopy of the CO derivatives, used to probe the distal pocket fine structure, brings out a correlation between the CO stretching frequencies and the rates of CO combination. Ultracentrifugation studies show that HbI and HbIII are monomeric in both the oxygenated and deoxygenated states under all conditions studied, whereas deoxy HbII forms dimers at acidic pH values, like P. marinus HbV. Accordingly, the oxygen affinities of HbI and HbIII are independent of pH, whereas HbII displays a Bohr effect below pH 7.2. HbII also forms heterodimers with HbIII and heterotetramers with HbI. The functional counterparts of heteropolymer formation are cooperativity in oxygen binding and the oxygen-linked binding of protons and bicarbonate. The observed effects are explained on the basis of the x-ray structure ofP. marinus HbV and the association behavior of site-specific mutants (Qiu, Y., Maillett, D. H., Knapp, J., Olson, J.

Chem. 275, 13517–13528). high performance liquid chromatography Fourier transform infrared sperm wale In most vertebrate hemoglobins cooperativity in oxygen binding originates from the transition between a low affinity (T) and a high affinity (R) state of the familiar α2β2tetrameric molecule (1Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The structural constraints between unlike chains are such that isolated chains and αβ dimers are devoid of cooperativity (3Antonini E. Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Wyman J. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Kellett G.L. Gutfreund H. Nature. 1970; 227: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Ackers G.K. Johnson M.L. Mills F.C. Ip S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, in invertebrate hemoglobins cooperativity in ligand binding may be present also within homodimeric molecules, as in HbI from the clam Scapharca inaequivalvis(6Chiancone E. Vecchini P. Verzili D. Ascoli F. Antonini E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 577-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this hemoglobin cooperativity arises from the direct communication between the two heme groups through a subunit interface distinct from those of the vertebrate hemoglobin tetramer, because it is formed by the heme-carrying E and F helices (7Royer Jr., W.E. Hendrickson W.A. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21052-21061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A different mechanism of cooperativity in oxygen binding is operative in the hemoglobins from hagfishes and lampreys, the most primitive living chordates, often grouped together into the class of Agnatha (jawless) or Cyclostomata (round-mouths) (8Martini F.H. Sci. Am. 1998; 279: 44-49Crossref Google Scholar). In these hemoglobins cooperative ligand binding is based on the existence of a finite equilibrium between high affinity monomers and low affinity oligomers, notably dimers and tetramers (9Briehl R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2361-2366Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ligand-linked polymerization is responsible also for the Bohr effect (the decrease in oxygen affinity upon a decrease in pH). Despite these similarities, hagfishes and lampreys may have diverged before the separation between myoglobin and hemoglobin chains (10Goodman M. J. Mol. Evol. 1981; 17: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a fact that may explain the differences in the functional properties of their hemoglobins, such as the lower cooperativity and Bohr effect which characterize the hagfish proteins (11Brittain T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 99B: 731-740Google Scholar). The structural basis for the decrease in oxygen affinity upon dimerization has been disclosed recently by the crystal structure of deoxygenated lamprey Petromyzon marinus HbV (12Heaslet H.A. Royer Jr., W.E. Structure. 1999; 7: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The E helices and the AB corner form a novel subunit interface that stabilizes a dimeric assembly. The proximity of the heme groups to the interface and the displacement of the first part of the E helix that is coupled to dimer formation suggest that ligand affinity is affected directly by the disposition of distal residues. The hemoglobins from hagfishes have been studied less extensively than those from lampreys, which are easier to catch because they migrate into freshwater rivers and streams to spawn rather than living most of the time burrowed in the sea bottom sand. A further difficulty that presumably hindered the elucidation of structure-function relationships in hagfish hemoglobins is the high multiplicity of components, which is due to genetic polymorphism (13Ohno S. Morrison M. Science. 1966; 154: 1034-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Li S.-L. Tomita S. Riggs A. Biochim. Biophys.

A distinctive feature of hagfish hemoglobins concerns the oxygen-linked binding not only of protons but also of bicarbonate (16Fago A. Malte H. Dohn N. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding of bicarbonate to the hemoglobin favors transport of CO2 as intracellular rather than plasma-dissolved bicarbonate, as generally observed in vertebrates, and at the same time favors oxygen unloading. In hagfish, bicarbonate produced by the intracellular hydration of CO2 (catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase) is not transported to the plasma due to the absence of the anion-exchanger band III protein from the red blood cells membrane (17Ellory J.C. Wolowyk M.W. Young J.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 129: 377-383PubMed Google Scholar, 18Peters T. Gros G. Joergensen J.M. Lomholt J.P. Weber R.E. Malte H. The Biology of Hagfishes. Chapman and Hall, London1998: 307-320Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular basis of the bicarbonate effect is not known. Interestingly, it is remarkably large in whole blood (19Wells R.M.G. Forster M.E. Davison W. Taylor H.H. Davie P.S. Satchell G.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1986; 123: 43-53PubMed Google Scholar, 20Perry S.F. Fritsche R. Thomas S. J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 183: 165-184Google Scholar) and in the hemolysate (15Fago A. Weber R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Bauer C. Engels U. Paleus S. Nature. 1975; 256: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) but is not present in the isolated hemoglobin components, suggesting that some form of interaction between them is required (21Bauer C. Engels U. Paleus S. Nature. 1975; 256: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In lamprey hemoglobins the oxygen-linked binding of bicarbonate does not occur (22Nikinmaa M. Weber R.E. Bicudo J.E.P.W. The Vertebrate Gas Transport Cascade: Adaptations to Environment and Mode of Life. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 179-187Google Scholar). The present work reports the structural and functional characterization of the three major hemoglobin components from the Atlantic hagfishMyxine glutinosa. Paleus et al. (23Paleus S. Vesterberg O. Liljeqvist G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1971; 39B: 551-557Google Scholar) isolated three hemoglobin fractions from this species. However, the high heterogeneity of their samples allowed the determination only of the primary structure of HbIII, the component characterized by the highest isoelectric point (24Liljeqvist G. Paleus S. Braunitzer G. J. Mol. Evol. 1982; 18: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To avoid the problems posed by hemoglobin multiplicity, in this work the individual hemolysates were analyzed by isoelectric focusing (15Fago A. Weber R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and only those samples showing identical patterns with three distinct, common bands were pooled. At variance with the hemolysate, the oxygen affinity of the isolated hemoglobin components appeared at a first characterization to be essentially unaffected by pH and bicarbonate, a further indication that the molecular basis of these allosteric effects must reside in specific interactions between different components. Sedimentation velocity experiments carried out under conditions similar to those of the oxygen equilibrium experiments confirmed this contention and showed that the presence of HbII, the component characterized by an intermediate isoelectric point, is essential for oligomer formation. Possible structural reasons for these effects are proposed. Specimen of M. glutinosa were captured in wooden traps placed on the sea bottom in the vicinity of Kristineberg Marine Biological Station (Fiskebackskil, Sweden) and transferred into tanks with running sea water. Blood was taken with heparinized syringes from the caudal sinus, as previously described (15Fago A. Weber R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After plasma removal by low speed centrifugation, red blood cells from each individual were washed three times in cold 3.2% NaCl and frozen at −80 °C to facilitate hemolysis. A 3-fold volume of cold 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA was added to the thawed cells, and the hemolysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min to eliminate cellular debris. Due to the high genetic polymorphism of hemoglobins in hagfishes (13Ohno S. Morrison M. Science. 1966; 154: 1034-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 14Li S.-L. Tomita S. Riggs A. Biochim.

After a 10-min prefocusing step, performed to avoid artifactual bands (15Fago A. Weber R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a 1-µl sample was loaded on the alkaline region of the gel. More than 100 hemolysates were analyzed in this way. The number of bands detected in the samples varied from three to six. Only those samples (38 in total) showing the identical isoelectrophoretical pattern with the major three bands were pooled. The hemolysate was stripped from organic phosphates and endogenous cofactors by passage through a Sephadex G-25 fine column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 m NaCl, and dialyzed against three changes of CO-equilibrated 10 mmTris buffer, pH 7.8, before anion exchange chromatography. The three hemoglobins were separated on a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a 0–0.2 m NaCl gradient. The separated hemoglobin fractions were concentrated on 4-ml Ultrafree Millipore ultrafiltration tubes (cutoff 5000), dialyzed against three changes of CO-equilibrated 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA and stored in small aliquots at −80 °C. Under these conditions the samples remained stable for months. All preparative steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Heme was removed and the globin chains precipitated with acid acetone according to Rossi Fanelli et al. (25Rossi Fanelli A. Antonini E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 77: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The globin chains were purified by reverse-phase HPLC1 on a Vydac C4 column (3.9 × 300 mm) by a 35–80% linear gradient of 50% acetonitrile (solvent B) in 40% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) over 20 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.S-Pyridylethylation was performed according to Friedmanet al. (26Friedman M. Krull L.H. Kavins J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 3868-3871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The globin chains were submitted to digestion with endoproteinase Asp-N and to CNBr cleavage following the procedure described by Gross and Witkop (27Gross E. Witkop B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1510Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated in a Beckman System Gold apparatus by reverse-phase HPLC on a µ-Bondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm) (Asp-N digest) and on an Aquapore RP-300 column (4.6 × 250 mm) (CNBr fragments) by mixing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) in a multistep linear gradient over 120 min, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peaks were collected manually and dried in a Savant Speed Vac concentrator. Cleavage at the Asp-Pro bond was performed in HbII in 70% formic acid (28Landon Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) directly on a Polybrene-coated filter, and partial deacylation of the blocked N terminus was achieved by treatment of the N-terminal Asp-N peptide with 30% trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 55 °C. Automated repetitive Edman degradation was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise 492 sequencer. Mass spectrometry measurements were carried out on intact HbI and HbIII globins, on HbIIA and HbIIBS-pyridylethylated chains and on blocked N-terminal Asp-N peptides. Mass spectra were recorded in linear mode on a Voyager Elite matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PerSeptive, Framingham, MA). The protein samples were dissolved in 70% formic acid, and 0.5 µl of this solution was immediately applied using the sandwich method (29Kussmann M. Nordhoff E. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Haebel S. Larsen M.R. Jakobsen L. Gobom J. Mirgorodskaya E. Kristensen A.K. Palm L. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 32: 593-601Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar) in a 0.5-µl droplet of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid on a target precoated with sinapinic acid followed by addition of further 0.5 µl of matrix solution. Mass determination was based on external calibration. Multiple alignment of Agnatha globins was performed with ClustalW (30Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences used are M. glutinosa HbI and HbII, and the eight protein sequences are more similar to HbII based on a BLASTP search (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar), namely P. marinus GLB5 (SWISS-Prot accession number P02208), GLB3 (P09968), and GLB1 (P09967);Lampetra fluviatilis GLB (P02207); Mordacia mordax GLB1 (P21197), GLB2 (P21198), and GLB3 (P21199); andM. glutinosa GLB3 (P02209). FTIR spectra were measured on a MAGNA 760 Nicolet spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. The protein solutions at a concentration of about 1 mm (heme) in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, were equilibrated with 1 atm of CO gas and a few microliters of a sodium dithionite solution were added (final concentration of about 10 mm). The spectra were measured at 20 °C in a CaF2 cell with a 50-µm Teflon spacer; 512 scans at 2 cm−1 resolution were averaged. The spectra of the oxygenated proteins measured under the same experimental conditions (dithionite was omitted) were subtracted from the spectra of the CO derivative to obtain a flat baseline. All experiments were carried out on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, equipped with absorbance optics, and an An60-Ti rotor, at 10 °C. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 40,000 rpm. Data were collected at an appropriate wavelength (555 or 540 nm for deoxy- and oxyhemoglobin, respectively) and at a spacing of 0.005 cm with three averages in a continuous scan mode. They were analyzed with the program DCDT, provided by Dr. Walter Stafford (Boston Biomedical Research Institute), which yields the sedimentation coefficients (32Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The values were reconducted to water and 20 °C (s 20,w) using standard procedures. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 30,000, 35,000, and 40,000 rpm. Data were collected at a spacing of 0.001 cm with 10 averages in a step-scan mode every 3 h. Equilibrium was checked by comparing scans up to 24 h. Data sets were edited with REEDIT (J. Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT) and fitted with NONLIN (PC version provided by Emory Braswell, National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center) according to Johnson et al. (33Johnson M. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Data from different speeds were combined for global fitting. For fits to a monomer-dimer association scheme, the monomer molecular weight was fixed at the value determined from the amino acid sequence. The protein concentration varied in the range 20–250 µm (heme) in 200 mm HEPES buffer, pH 6.0 or 7.4, with or without 10 mmNaHCO3; it was calculated from the spectra of the oxygenated derivatives using an extinction coefficient of 13.8 cm−1 mm−1 on a heme basis for the oxygenated derivative at 540 nm. To obtain the deoxygenated protein, the solution at the desired concentration was degassed in a stoppered vial with N2. Cells were filled in an inflatable glove box (AtmosBag, Aldrich) after addition of sodium dithionite to avoid reoxygenation. As a control of the state of oxygenation, absorbance spectra of all samples were measured in the ultracentrifuge cell before and after the run. Oxygen equilibria were measured at 10 °C in 100 mm HEPES buffer, at a concentration of 0.5 mm (heme) in the absence and presence of 4% CO2, corresponding to a concentration of bicarbonate in solution of ∼15 mm at pH 7.2 (34Randall D.J. Fish Physiol. 1970; 4: 253-292Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Stepwise increases in oxygen saturation of 3-µl samples were obtained by a modified gas diffusion chamber connected to Wosthoff pumps for mixing pure N2 with air, O2, and CO2 (35Wells R.M.G. Weber R.E. Techniques in Comparative Respiratory Physiology: An Experimental Approach. Society for Experimental Biology Series, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1989Google Scholar). The change in absorbance upon oxygenation was monitored at 436 nm. Oxygen affinity (p50, the oxygen partial pressure necessary to achieve half-saturation) and cooperativity at half-saturation (n 50) were calculated from Hill plots (logY/(1 − Y) versus log pO2, where Y is the fractional oxygen saturation). pH values of the hemoglobin solutions were measured by a thermostatted BMS Mk2 microelectrode connected to a PHM64 pH meter (Radiometer). In experiments performed in the presence of CO2, pH values were measured after equilibration of the hemoglobin solutions with 4% CO2 in thermostatted micro-tonometers (Radiometer). Oxygen binding experiments on the isolated hemoglobins were performed in the absence and presence of 0.1m KCl or 4% CO2 and 1 µmcarbonic anhydrase. The functional interaction between different components was analyzed in hemoglobin mixtures at a 1:1 molar ratio, in the absence and presence of 4% CO2 and 1 µmcarbonic anhydrase. Kinetic measurements were carried out in an Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK) rapid mixing apparatus on the isolated components. In the CO binding experiments, the protein solutions at a concentration of about 10 µm (heme) in 0.2m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm sodium dithionite were mixed with the same buffer containing increasing amounts of dissolved CO gas. The reaction was followed at 434 nm (the absorbance maximum of the deoxy derivative) and at 20 °C. The second order rate constants were obtained from the pseudo first order plot by standard procedures. The O2 dissociation experiments were carried out by mixing the oxygenated protein with a solution containing an excess (0.1 m) sodium dithionite under the same experimental conditions described for CO binding measurements. Three hemoglobin fractions were separated from the M. glutinosa hemolysate by anion exchange chromatography and were named HbI, HbII, and HbIII in reverse order of elution to be consistent with the nomenclature adopted by Paleus et al. (23Paleus S. Vesterberg O. Liljeqvist G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1971; 39B: 551-557Google Scholar) based on increasing isoelectric points. These were assessed by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels and correspond to 6.35, 7.35, and 8.90 for HbI, HbII, and HbIII, respectively (data not shown). The three hemoglobin fractions HbI, HbII, and HbIII occur in a ratio of ∼15:50:35. Reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry show that each fraction separated on the DEAE-column contains essentially a single hemoglobin component, consistent with the fact that only the individual hemolysates presenting three major bands, common to all samples, were pooled. On reverse phase HPLC, HbI and HbIII elute as a single peak with average molecular masses of 17,033 and 16,643, respectively, whereas HbII resolves into two single, separate peaks, named HbII A and HbII B, with molecular masses of 17,790 and 17,993, respectively (data not shown). The molecular mass and the N-terminal sequence of the first five residues indicated that HbIII corresponds to the component (SWISS-PROT accession number P02209) sequenced by Liljeqvist et al. (24Liljeqvist G. Paleus S. Braunitzer G. J. Mol. Evol. 1982; 18: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The complete amino acid sequences of HbI and of HbII A and B were obtained by automated repetitive Edman degradation of the intact chain, of the HPLC purified Asp-N and CNBr peptides, and of the HbII fragment generated after cleavage of the single Asp-Pro bond. Direct sequencing of the intact chain proceeded to Glu-40 and provided the overlaps between the first three Asp-N peptides (N1-N2-N3) as shown in Fig.1. Incomplete cleavage at Asp residues 65 and 87 yielded peptide N4-N6, whose sequence proceeded from residues 49 to 89, providing the overlap of peptides N4, N5, and N6-N7. The expected N7 peptide, comprising residues 112–146, was not recovered, indicating that Asp-N endoproteinase failed to cleave at Asp-112. The resulting N6-N7 peptide coeluted with an N4-N5 uncleaved peptide and its sequence (up to Phe-121) was obtained unambiguously by subtracting the sequences of the N4 and N5 peptides. The lack of any detectable sequence after acidic treatment indicated the absence of the single Asp-Pro bond characteristic of globin chains. The sequence from Phe-121 to Tyr-146 was obtained from the CNBr fragments, which also provided the necessary overlaps to the Asp-N peptides. CNBr cleavage yielded three peptides. CB2 provided the sequence from Lys-93 to Met-113 and CB3 the sequence from Phe-114 to Glu-148. CB1 corresponds to the N-terminal part of the chain (residues 1–92). The complete amino acid sequence of HbI consists of 148 residues (Fig.1). The calculated molecular weight of HbI is 17,027, in agreement with the value of 17,033 measured by mass spectrometry. The Edman degradation of the intact chain was unsuccessful due to the presence of a blocking group at the N terminus. This was established to be an acetyl group by mass spectrometry measurements. The sequence of the N-terminal peptide N1 was obtained after deacylation of the N-terminal Ser as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following Asp-Pro cleavage, the internal sequences from Pro-111 to Ser-138 for HbII A and from Pro-111 to Glu-135 for HbII B were obtained (Fig. 1). The two sequences are identical except for residue 134, which is Gly in HbII A and Ala in HbII B. The Asp-N peptides of the two globins were purified in a single HPLC chromatography run using identical conditions. Comparison of the elution patterns indicated that all the peaks have the same elution time except those corresponding to peptides N6 and N10. The sequence was determined for all the peaks of HbII B and for peptides N6 and N10 of HbII A. The two N6 and N10 peptides of HbII A differed from the corresponding peptides of HbII B at only one position, namely 83 (N6) and 134 (N10) with Ile and Gly, respectively, in HbII A, and Thr and Ala, respectively, in HbII B, in agreement with the molecular masses measured by mass spectrometry. The sequence of peptides N9 and N10, coeluting in the same peak, were unambiguously established, because the fragment corresponding to N10 was also recovered as two distinct peptides, named E1 and E2 (see Fig.1), originating from an additional cleavage at Glu-135. The CNBr fragments and partially uncleaved Asp-N peptides provided the complete overlap of all the Asp-N peptides. The complete amino acid sequence of HbII comprises 155 residues (Fig.1). The calculated molecular mass is 17,690 for HbII A and 17,692 for HbII B. These values are in good agreement with those obtained by mass spectrometry of the S-pyridylethylated chains (17,791 and 17,794, respectively) after subtracting the mass of the pyridylethyl group at Cys-149. The sequences of M. glutinosaHbI, HbII, and HbIII (24Liljeqvist G. Paleus S. Braunitzer G. J. Mol. Evol. 1982; 18: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were compared with those of the lampreysLampetra fluviatilis, P. marinus, andMordacia mordax in an alignment made with ClustalW. In Fig.2, only the sequence of P. marinus HbV is shown as representative of all lamprey hemoglobins for the sake of simplicity. M. glutinosa HbII is the only known cyclostome hemoglobin with a blocked N terminus. Moreover, it lacks the first three residues and has two insertions relative to the other hemoglobins, one of a single residue at the FG corner, the other of eight residues in the region corresponding to the GH corner in vertebrate globins. HbI and HbIII lack one residue at the GH corner and two residues at the CD corner, and have a two-residue extension at the C terminus relative to HbII and to lamprey hemoglobins. Interestingly, HbI and HbIII possess a glutamine residue in the distal position E7 instead of the canonical distal histidine. To gain information on structural features of the distal pocket that are relevant for ligand binding, infrared spectra were measured in the region of the stretching frequency of the bound CO molecule (2000–1900 cm−1). The three main hemoglobin components have distinct absorption peaks (Fig. 3). HbI-CO has an absorption line at 1942 cm−1, HbII-CO is characterized by a sharp absorption peak at 1968 cm−1, whereas HbIII-CO displays a broad and asymmetric absorption band centered at 1942 cm−1. The spectrum of the hemolysate is included in Fig.3; it appears to be dominated by the contributions of the most abundant components, HbII and HbIII. The results of oxygen equilibrium experiments are presented in Fig.4. The isolated hemoglobins bind oxygen with no cooperativity (Hill coefficient, n 50, around unity) and with an affinity that is virtually independent on pH and on the presence of bicarbonate or KCl (data not shown). Only HbII displays a slight Bohr effect below pH 7.2 (Bohr factor, Δlogp 50/Δlog pH = −0.48 at pH 7.0) both in the absence and in the presence of bicarbonate. HbIII is cha"

This complex is capable of binding and activating the caspase-9 zymogen, which leads to activation of the caspase-3 zymogen, which catalyzes the proteolytic activation of several downstream caspases responsible for degradation of structural components of the cell.A recent study describes the ability for various adenine nucleotide analogs to supplant dATP in the assembly of the apoptosome (4Genini D.

The relative efficiencies of the tested nucleotides were Ara-ATP > F-Ara-ATP > dATP > CdATP > Ara-GTP > dADP > ATP. The non-phosphorylated forms of these nucleoside analogs (Ara-A, F-Ara-A, CdA, and Ara-G) are of pharmacological importance and are used as cytostatic or antiviral agents (5Carson D.A. Wasson D.B.

Much of their therapeutic effects have traditionally been attributed to their ability to terminate replication when the resulting triphosphate forms are incorporated into the DNA of target cells and thus stop cell division (reviewed in Ref. 6Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). However, nucleoside analogs that interfere with DNA synthesis can also induce cell death by apoptosis (7Leoni L.M. Chao Q. Cottam H.B. Genini D. Rosebach M. Carrera C.J. Budihardjo I. Wang X.

Pharmacol. 1998; 52: 270-273Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Examples of such analogs are F-Ara-A, CdA, and Ara-G, all precursors of the apoptogenic adenine deoxynucleotide analogs mentioned above (7Leoni L.M. Chao Q. Cottam H.B. Genini D. Rosebach M. Carrera C.J. Budihardjo I. Wang X. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The observation that the substrate specificity of dGK coincides with the nucleotide requirement for caspase-9 activation raises the possibility of a role for dGK during apoptosis. However, the assembly of the apoptosome takes place in the cytosol, and dGK is located in the mitochondrial matrix (13Jüllig M. Eriksson S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5466-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) where its deoxynucleotide products have limited access to the cytosol due to the impermeable nature of the inner mitochondrial membrane that surrounds the matrix compartment. To efficiently assist in dATP/adenosine deoxynucleotide analog production for the caspase-9 activating apoptosome, dGK would have to be present in the cytosol.dGK has been proposed to mediate apoptosis of T-cells in SCID disease by causing elevated intramitochondrial levels of dGTP in T-cells lacking purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) (14Snyder F.F.

Thus, dGK plays a vital role in the early chain of reactions that eventually leads to dGuo-induced apoptosis, and the fact that dGK is present inside the mitochondria is a prerequisite for the proposed mechanism of T-cell toxicity. It was therefore important to monitor the subcellular location of dGK during apoptosis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHEK 293 cells are well suited for this dGK study because they provide a rich source of mitochondria and are ideal for immunohistochemistry. It has been shown that Cd2+ induces apoptosis in cultured proximal tubule cells (20Hamada T. Tanimoto A. Iwai S. Fujiwara H. Sasaguri Y. Nephron. 1994; 68: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that incubation with 20 μm CdCl2 raises the apoptotic index of HEK 293 cells at least 15 times compared with untreated cells (21Hamada T. Sasaguri T. Tanimoto A. Arima N. Shimajiri S. Abe T. Sasaguri Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 219: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Western blot analysis of extracts of HEK 293 cells treated with CdCl2 showed that the intramitochondrial protein levels of dGK and cytochrome c decreased in a time-dependent manner and at similar rates. After incubation for 6 h, the intramitochondrial concentrations of dGK and cytochrome c were reduced to half that of the untreated control cells (Fig. 1 A). In the corresponding cytosolic fractions, cytochrome c (Fig.1 B) and dGK (Fig. 1 C) levels increased after the addition of CdCl2 to the medium. After 6 h of treatment, the detected level of cytochrome c in the cytosol was >40% higher than in the untreated control. dGK was detected in the cytosolic fraction after 24 and 48 h.Similar observations were made by Western blot analysis of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from Molt-4 cells treated with daunorubicin. After treatment with 1 μm daunorubicin, 40% of the dGK had relocated to the cytosol, whereas the cytochromec level was largely unaffected (Fig.2 A). After incubation with 10 μm daunorubicin ∼50% of both dGK and cytochromec had left the mitochondria (Fig. 2 A). Elevated levels of both dGK and cytochrome c were detected in the cytosolic fraction at both tested concentrations (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Protein levels detected by Western blotting of mitochondrial (A) and cytosolic (B) extracts from Molt-4 cells treated for 6 h with daunorubicin at the indicated concentrations.

The DEVD-AMC cleavage assay used to monitor apoptosis in Molt-4 cells showed a 6-fold increase of the apoptotic index when the cells were incubated with 5 μm daunorubicin for 6 h (Fig. 2, A andB).Because induction of apoptosis in HEK 293 cells was carried out by treatment with CdCl2 in serum-free medium, the effects of serum removal itself had to be investigated to interpret the results with CdCl2. The intramitochondrial levels of cytochromec, dGK, and the integral inner membrane protein ANT were monitored in mitochondrial isolates throughout a 72-h incubation in serum-free medium. Western blot analysis showed no decrease in protein concentration for either of the tested proteins. Instead, the levels of cytochrome c and dGK increased (50 and 150%, respectively) as a response to serum depletion (Fig.3). This observation strongly indicates an increased synthesis of the two proteins upon serum starvation. Recent studies demonstrate that inhibition of DNA synthesis in human lymphocytes increases the activity of the cytosolic deoxynucleoside salvage enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (22Csapo Z. Sasvari-Szekely M. Spasokoukotskaja T. Talianidis I. Eriksson S. Staub M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is possible that serum depletion invokes an increase in dGK levels similar to the activation of dCK. The mechanisms behind these effects remain to be determined.Citrate synthase (CS), a mitochondrial matrix enzyme with a molecular mass of 49 kDa, was assayed in the mitochondrial fractions to monitor leakage of mitochondrial matrix material. No inhibition of CS activity was detected when CdCl2 was added to previously untreated mitochondria (not shown), indicating that the moderate decrease in CS activity observed in mitochondria obtained from CdCl2-treated HEK 293 cells reflects a true loss of CS from the mitochondria (Fig. 1 E). This finding probably represents CS efflux from necrotic cells in which the mitochondrial membranes are known to disintegrate. Due to interference with the assay by daunorubicin, citrate synthase activity could not be determined in apoptotic Molt-4 cells.In an immunohistochemical experiment, the dGK antibody was used with HEK 293 cells treated with 20 μm CdCl2 for 6 h followed by incubation with MitoTracker® Red CM-H2XRos to visualize respiring mitochondria. In non-treated cells, dGK labeling colocalized with MitoTracker® Red CM-H2XRos in practically all the examined cells (Fig.4 A). The punctuate labeling pattern around the nuclei was identical to that previously reported for HEK 293 cells (13Jüllig M. Eriksson S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5466-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and similar to that obtained when a mouse dGK was fused to green fluorescent protein and overexpressed in Cos-1 cells (23Petrakis T.G. Ktistaki E. Wang L. Eriksson S. Thalianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24726-24730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The majority of the CdCl2-treated cells showed a diffuse cytosolic staining pattern with the dGK antibody (Fig. 4,B and C). Six h after addition of CdCl2 to HEK 293 cells, dGK was localized extramitochondrially in many cells. The localization pattern was similar to that reported for the cytosolic isoform of mouse dGK (23Petrakis T.G. Ktistaki E. Wang L. Eriksson S. Thalianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24726-24730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Smac/DIABLO 4 h after induction of apoptosis (24Chai J. Du C. Wu J.-W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In many CdCl2-treated cells, the overall dGK labeling was more intense compared with the control cells. The most likely explanation for this finding is that relocated, cytosolic dGK, compared with mitochondrial, was more easily available for detection with antibodies. However, it can not be excluded that induction of the enzyme was contributing to the increased fluorescence observed in apoptotic cells. The CdCl2-treated cells showed varying degrees of apoptotic characteristics. Although some cells appeared largely unaffected by the treatment, most exhibited early morphological changes associated with apoptosis such as spherical shape and substantial size reduction (Fig.4 C). In many CdCl2-treated HEK 293 cells that appeared clearly apoptotic, labeling with MitoTracker® Red CM-H2XRos was still detected indicating that the mitochondrial membrane potential was not disrupted (Fig. 4, Band C).Figure 4Immunohistochemistry experiment with HEK 293 cells. The cells were incubated with the purified anti-dGK antibody (green fluorescence) and MitoTracker® Red CM-H2XRos (red fluorescence) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, untreated control cells; B and C, cells incubated with 20 μm CdCl2 for 6 h.

Benveniste P. Cristofano A.D. Gu Y. Dalal I. Kelly S. Hershfield M. Pandolfi P.P. Roifman C.M. Cohen A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Individuals suffering from SCID disease have an inherited deficiency of either adenosine deaminase or PNP, both enzymes crucial for the degradation of deoxyribonucleosides. Complete PNP deficiency in mice leads to accumulation and elevated urine contents of the PNP substrates (dGuo, Guo, dIno, and Ino), but it is also reported that the intramitochondrial levels of dGTP are increased. Arpaia et al. (15Arpaia E. Benveniste P. Cristofano A.D. Gu Y. Dalal I. Kelly S. Hershfield M. Pandolfi P.P. Roifman C.M. Cohen A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) propose that dGK is responsible for the latter by catalyzing the formation of dGMP from accumulated dGuo, after which dGTP is formed by deoxynucleoside mono- and diphosphate kinases. The abnormal levels of dGTP thus produced causes an imbalance of the deoxynucleotide pools, which damages the mitochondrial DNA and leads to apoptosis. In this scenario dGK is present inside the mitochondria when catalyzing dGMP formation, which is not in conflict with the finding that dGK relocates to the cytosol during apoptosis because the dGTP-mediated damage on the mtDNA in SCID disease is an event that proceeds cytochrome c relocation and caspase activation.Zhu et al. have suggested that dGK may be involved in the cytotoxicity observed during treatment with the anti-proliferative nucleoside analogs CdA, dFdG, and Ara-G (25Zhu C. Johansson M. Permert J. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Overexpression of dGK was reported to lead to increased sensitivity to the above-mentioned drugs in human pancreatic cancer cell lines. It was suggested that the analogs, after intramitochondrial phosphorylation catalyzed by dGK, were exported to the cytosolic compartment where they could interfere with nuclear DNA replication. Whether the observed effect on cell viability in this report was due to apoptotic cell death is not clear. However, evidence suggest that mitochondrial deoxynucleotides are not exported to the cytosol. Already in 1982, Bestwick et al.showed that depletion of cytosolic deoxynucleotide pools is not accompanied by a similar depletion of the corresponding mitochondrial pools (26Richard K. Bestwick R.K. Moffett G.L. Mattews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9300-9304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mitochondrial deoxynucleotide carrier was recently reported and initial studies of the protein indicate that it is primarily involved in the mitochondrial uptake of various deoxynucleotides including several analogs in exchange for internal ATP (27Dolce V. Fiermonte G. Runswick M.J. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2284-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the light of this, it seems reasonable to assume that intramitochondrially phosphorylated nucleoside analogs are confined to the mitochondrial compartment and cause damage to mtDNA rather than the nuclear DNA, provided that the inner mitochondrial membrane is not disrupted.In a more recent publication the importance of the cellular site of phosphorylation of CdA and other nucleoside analogs is discussed (28Zhu C. Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26727-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). dCK, normally a cytosolic enzyme, was overexpressed with a leader sequence targeting the enzyme to different cellular compartments. When CdA was administered, mitochondrial expression of dCK resulted in less cell death compared with when dCK was targeted to the cytosol or the nucleus. This was most likely due to entrapment of the intramitochondrially phosphorylated analogs inside the mitochondria and further strengthen the assumption that dGK, as well as dCK, must be present in the cytosol to efficiently contribute to caspase activation.Our results show that dGK relocates to the cytosolic compartment during apoptosis in the two cell types tested. dGK was recently localized in the mitochondrial matrix in human placenta mitochondria (13Jüllig M. Eriksson S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5466-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and to the best of our knowledge, no other matrix protein has previously been demonstrated to leave the mitochondrial matrix in apoptotic cells. It was recently reported that mitochondria in apoptotic Jurkat cells release the intermembraneous form of adenylate kinase (AK2) to the cytosol, whereas the matrix isoform (AK3) remains inside the mitochondria (29Köhler C. Gahm A. Noma T. Nakazawa A. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The question of how dGK crosses the virtually impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane remains to be answered. One intriguing possibility is that the enzyme could be transported into the cytosol to assist in amplifying the apoptotic cascade in the proximity of the caspase-9 activating apoptosome by being involved in the formation of dATP. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a highly regulated cellular suicide machinery that enables cells to die without causing an inflammatory response. A key event in apoptosis is the relocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembraneous space to the cytosol (1Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4435) Google Scholar). The presence of cytochrome c in the cytosol initiates the formation of a cytosolic apoptosome (a multimeric complex consisting of cytochrome c, apoptosis protein-activating factor Apaf-1, and dATP (2Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar, 3Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar)). This complex is capable of binding and activating the caspase-9 zymogen, which leads to activation of the caspase-3 zymogen, which catalyzes the proteolytic activation of several downstream caspases responsible for degradation of structural components of the cell. A recent study describes the ability for various adenine nucleotide analogs to supplant dATP in the assembly of the apoptosome (4Genini D. Budihardjo I. Plunkett W. Wang X. Carrera C.J. Cottam H.B. Carson D.A. Leoni L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The relative efficiencies of the tested nucleotides were Ara-ATP > F-Ara-ATP > dATP > CdATP > Ara-GTP > dADP > ATP. The non-phosphorylated forms of these nucleoside analogs (Ara-A, F-Ara-A, CdA, and Ara-G) are of pharmacological importance and are used as cytostatic or antiviral agents (5Carson D.A. Wasson D.B. Kaye J. Ullman B. Martin D.W. Robins R.K. Montgomery J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Much of their therapeutic effects have traditionally been attributed to their ability to terminate replication when the resulting triphosphate forms are incorporated into the DNA of target cells and thus stop cell division (reviewed in Ref. 6Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). However, nucleoside analogs that interfere with DNA synthesis can also induce cell death by apoptosis (7Leoni L.M. Chao Q. Cottam H.B. Genini D. Rosebach M. Carrera C.J. Budihardjo I. Wang X. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Kim C.N. Wang X. Huang Y. Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Fang G. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 15: 3115-3120Google Scholar). Deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK)1is a 60-kDa enzyme localized in the mitochondria, and it catalyzes the phosphorylation of the natural substrates dGuo, dAdo, and dIno to the corresponding monophosphate nucleotides (9Gower W.R.J. Carr M.C. Ives D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2180-2183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Park I. Ives D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme has been studied and shown to accept various cytostatic nucleoside analogs as substrates (11Wang L. Karlsson A. Arnér E.S.J. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sjöberg A.H. Wang L. Eriksson S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 52: 270-273Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Examples of such analogs are F-Ara-A, CdA, and Ara-G, all precursors of the apoptogenic adenine deoxynucleotide analogs mentioned above (7Leoni L.M. Chao Q. Cottam H.B. Genini D. Rosebach M. Carrera C.J. Budihardjo I. Wang X. Carson D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9567-9571Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The observation that the substrate specificity of dGK coincides with the nucleotide requirement for caspase-9 activation raises the possibility of a role for dGK during apoptosis. However, the assembly of the apoptosome takes place in the cytosol, and dGK is located in the mitochondrial matrix (13Jüllig M. Eriksson S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5466-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) where its deoxynucleotide products have limited access to the cytosol due to the impermeable nature of the inner mitochondrial membrane that surrounds the matrix compartment. To efficiently assist in dATP/adenosine deoxynucleotide analog production for the caspase-9 activating apoptosome, dGK would have to be present in the cytosol. dGK has been proposed to mediate apoptosis of T-cells in SCID disease by causing elevated intramitochondrial levels of dGTP in T-cells lacking purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) (14Snyder F.F. Jenuth J.P. Dialy J.E. Fung E. Lightfoot T. Mably E.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 15Arpaia E. Benveniste P. Cristofano A.D. Gu Y. Dalal I. Kelly S. Hershfield M. Pandolfi P.P. Roifman C.M. Cohen A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, dGK plays a vital role in the early chain of reactions that eventually leads to dGuo-induced apoptosis, and the fact that dGK is present inside the mitochondria is a prerequisite for the proposed mechanism of T-cell toxicity. It was therefore important to monitor the subcellular location of dGK during apoptosis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHEK 293 cells are well suited for this dGK study because they provide a rich source of mitochondria and are ideal for immunohistochemistry. It has been shown that Cd2+ induces apoptosis in cultured proximal tubule cells (20Hamada T. Tanimoto A. Iwai S. Fujiwara H. Sasaguri Y. Nephron. 1994; 68: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and that incubation with 20 μm CdCl2 raises the apoptotic index of HEK 293 cells at least 15 times compared with untreated cells (21Hamada T. Sasaguri T. Tanimoto A. Arima N. Shimajiri S. Abe T. Sasaguri Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 219: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Western blot analysis of extracts of HEK 293 cells treated with CdCl2 showed that the intramitochondrial protein levels of dGK and cytochrome c decreased in a time-dependent manner and at similar rates. After incubation for 6 h, the intramitochondrial concentrations of dGK and cytochrome c were reduced to half that of the untreated control cells (Fig. 1 A). In the corresponding cytosolic fractions, cytochrome c (Fig.1 B) and dGK (Fig. 1 C) levels increased after the addition of CdCl2 to the medium. After 6 h of treatment, the detected level of cytochrome c in the cytosol was >40% higher than in the untreated control. dGK was detected in the cytosolic fraction after 24 and 48 h.Similar observations were made by Western blot analysis of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions from Molt-4 cells treated with daunorubicin.

The levels of ANT remained constant throughout the experiments (Figs. 1 A, 2 A, and 3).Figure 3Protein levels detected by Western blotting of mitochondrial extracts from HEK 293 cells incubated in serum-free medium.

These regulators contain DNA binding domains (transcription factors) or RNA binding domains (translational regulators). The homeobox encodes a 60-amino acid nucleic acid binding domain, the homeodomain (HD),1 which is present in many eukaryotic transcription factors and plays a critical role in development (1Billeter M.

Because of this unique DNA and RNA binding capability, Bcd-HD is a particularly compelling target for investigations of molecular structure and nucleic acid recognition mechanisms. The HD has also become a paradigm for studying DNA-protein interactions. HDs fold into a module with a characteristic structure comprising three α-helices. Structural studies, first elucidated for the Antennapedia and Engrailed HDs, show that the three helices of the HD are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving residues Leu-16, Trp-48, and Phe-49, which are conserved in all HDs (9Billeter M.

Despite the extensive data on sequence and structure-function relationships accumulated over the past years, some aspects of HD function still remain obscure. Little is known about how HDs achieve specific recognition of their targets, the role of the N-terminal arm, and the effects of other highly conserved residues, mostly within helix III. Among these, the centrally located Trp residue (Trp-48) is invariant. The available structural data indicate that Trp-48 plays a role in DNA-protein interactions through a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the phosphate backbone (10Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Otting G.

Cell. 1991; 67: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, the absolute conservation of Trp-48 in evolution indicates a far more important function in the HD. We have used biophysical methods combined with site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate the molecular structure-function relationships of the Bcd-HD, for which a high resolution structure is not yet available and have focused on the highly conserved aromatic residues tryptophan (Trp-48, helix III), and phenylalanine (Phe-8, helix I). In homeodomains, Trp-48 exhibits a strongly quenched fluorescence in the native state (22Subramaniam V. Rivera-Pomar R. Jovin T.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A108Google Scholar, 23Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Nanda V. Brand L. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A448Google Scholar) most likely because of specific interactions with neighboring residues. Conservative mutation of the strictly conserved Trp-48 to a phenylalanine (W48F) reduces DNA binding affinity and destabilizes the HD, suggesting that the role of Trp-48 is to stabilize critical structural features required for DNA recognition. Replacement of Phe-8 by a tyrosine residue (F8Y, Antennapedia like) yields a stable HD with fluorescence and binding properties similar to the wild-type HD. Replacement of Phe-8 by an alanine (F8A) yields a less stable HD, with lower quenching of Trp-48 fluorescence in the native state. These results suggest the following. (i) An aromatic residue in position 8 may be required to provide the scaffold, holding the HD in a conformation required for DNA binding and (ii) that the quenching of Trp-48 in the native state has more complex origins. The recombinant protein (Bcd-HD) was expressed and purified as described (8Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Perrimon N. Taubert H. Jäckle H. Nature. 1995; 376: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further purification was performed as required over an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech mono-P column in 10 mm triethanolamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. Site-directed mutagenesis of Bcd-HD was carried out using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit using the following primers and the wild-type Bcd-HD plasmid pRSETBcdHDCHis (8Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Perrimon N. Taubert H. Jäckle H. Nature. 1995; 376: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) as a template: W48F, 5′-GCCCAGGTGAAGATATTTTTTAAGAACCGTCGGCGTC-3′ and 5′-GACGCCGACGGTTCTTAAAAAATATCTTCACCTGGGC-3′; F8Y, 5′-CGTCGCACCCGCACCACTTATACCAGCTCTCAAATAG-3′ and 5′-CTATTTGAGAGCTGGTATAAGTGGTGCGGGTGCGACG-3′; F8A, 5′-CGTCGCACCCGCACCACTGCTACCAGCTCTCAAATAG and 5′-CTATTTGAGAGCTGGTAGCAGTGGTGCGGGTGCGACG-3′. Expression and purification of the mutant proteins (Bcd-HD W48F, F8Y, and F8A) was performed as described (8Rivera-Pomar R. Lu X. Perrimon N. Taubert H. Jäckle H. Nature. 1995; 376: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The proteins were extensively dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl for fluorescence and CD experiments. CD measurements were performed on a JASCO J-720 CD spectropolarimeter. Far-UV CD data are presented as molecular ellipticity [Θ] (in deg·cm2·dmol−1). Secondary structure was predicted using the SSE-338 prediction algorithm supplied by JASCO, using the reference spectra of Yanget al. (25Yang J.T. Wu C.-S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured on an SLM 8000C (SLM, Urbana, IL) or a PTI Quantamaster (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ) photon counting spectrofluorometer with double excitation and single emission monochromators. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm or 295 nm (to avoid excitation of Tyr and Phe). Polarization effects were eliminated by using magic angle settings of the polarizers (0° excitation, 54.7° emission). The emission spectra were corrected, and a solvent blank was subtracted. All measurements were at 5 °C. Time-resolved measurements were performed in the frequency domain using a system of our design incorporating a modulated D2 lamp (Cathodeon, Cambridge, UK) as the excitation source (26Morgan C.G. Mitchell A.C. Peacock N. Murray J.G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1995; 66: 48-51Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 27Morgan C.G. Hua Y. Mitchell A.C. Murray J.G. Boardman A.D. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1996; 67: 41-47Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All measurements were at 5 °C. Excitation at 280 nm was through a 10-nm bandpass filter, and the emission was selected with a 325-nm long-pass filter. The reference lifetime compound was N-acetyl-tryptophanamide in 30% (v/v) glycerol/water solution, which has a lifetime of 4.88 ns at 5 °C (28Gryczynski I. Malak H. Lakowicz J.R. Biospectroscopy. 1996; 2: 9-15Crossref Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using global analysis software (Globals Unlimited, LFD, Urbana, IL). The Bcd target site oligonucleotides (5′-AATCTAATCCCTATA-3′) were 5′-γ-32P-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 5.68-5.72Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were carried out as described (7Burz D. Rivera-Pomar R. Jäckle H. Hanes S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5998-6009Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA (10 fmols) and protein were mixed in 25 mm potassium Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol at 4 °C for 15 min. Free and complexed DNA were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE buffer at 12 V/cm. The DNA concentrations were sufficiently low so that the fraction of bound protein was negligible. Quantitation was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The CD spectra of the Bcd-HD under native conditions showed a double minimum at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of a helical structure (Fig.1 a), and similar to that observed for other homeodomains (21Ades S.E. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9187-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Carra J.H. Privalov P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Damante G. Tell G. Leonardi A. Fogolari F. Bortolotti N. Di Lauro R. Formisano S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A secondary structure prediction algorithm applied to the spectra yielded an α-helical content of 41% (Fig. 1 a, inset). As noted by Ades and Sauer for the Engrailed HD (21Ades S.E. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9187-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the CD signal at 222 nm was somewhat lower than that expected for a protein with a ∼60% helical content, but the discrepancy can be attributed to positive ellipticity contributions from the aromatic residues in the sequence (32Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Padmanabhan S. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1451-1467Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We monitored the loss of helical structure upon thermal denaturation of the Bcd-HD by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm as a function of temperature (Fig. 1 b). The protein exhibited a two-state folding transition with a Tm ∼44 °C, comparable with the value reported for the rat TTF-1 HD (42.8 °C) (31Damante G. Tell G. Leonardi A. Fogolari F. Bortolotti N. Di Lauro R. Formisano S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the Antennapedia HD (48 °C) (34Otting G. Qian Y.Q. Muller M. Affolter M. Gehring W. Wuthrich K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4305-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A fit to the thermal denaturation data yielded a ΔHm ∼38 kcal mol−1. The unfolding of the Bcd-HD monitored by the Trp-48 fluorescence produced a similar Tm. We further explored the structure of the Bcd-HD using the fluorescence of Trp-48. Trp-48 was excited selectively at 295 nm to avoid contributions from the single Tyr residue in the sequence, Tyr-25. In the folded state, the emission was strongly quenched (95%) relative to that in the unfolded state (Fig.2 a). The protein fluorescence excited at 280 nm was dominated by Tyr-25 and had an emission peak at 314 nm (Fig. 2 b). Upon unfolding in 6 mguanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl), the intensity of the Trp-48 fluorescence (excited at 295 nm) increased by a factor of ∼20 and was accompanied by a 15-nm red-shift in the emission spectra (Fig.2 c). A similar result was obtained for unfolding in urea (data not shown). For comparison, we studied the fluorescence properties of the Ubx-HD. This HD also contains a single Trp (Trp-48) but unlike Bcd-HD has three Tyr residues (Tyr-8, Tyr-11, and Tyr-25). As in the Bcd-HD, the Trp-48 fluorescence of the Ubx-HD in the native state was strongly quenched (Fig. 2 d). This result suggests that the quenching of Trp-48 fluorescence is not restricted to the Bcd-HD but may rather be a property of homeodomains in general, implying that Trp-48 may serve as a sensitive conformational marker for studying the entire homeodomain protein family. Similar results have been observed for other homeodomains by Nanda and Brand (23Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The quenching of Trp was explored further by measuring the fluorescence lifetimes of the Bcd and Ubx HDs in the native and GdmHCl-denatured states, using frequency domain fluorimetry. In both cases, the native HDs exhibited shorter fluorescence lifetimes than the denatured HDs, evidenced by the higher frequency crossovers of the phase and modulation curves (data not shown). The fluorescence decays were multicomponent, yielding mean lifetimes of ∼4.1 ns for native Bcd-HD, ∼4.9 ns for denatured Bcd-HD, ∼1.9 ns for native Ubx-HD, and ∼5.1 ns for denatured Ubx-HD. The ratio of the native and denatured lifetimes did not correspond to the relative quantum yields, indicating a combination of dynamic and static quenching mechanisms. We note that both native and denatured lifetimes were multi-exponential and that the analysis of the native state fluorescence lifetime was difficult because of the potential contamination by even a minute fraction of denatured or partially denatured polypeptide, leading to a perturbation of the mean lifetime to longer values. Nonetheless, the trend (reduction of fluorescence lifetime, i.e. quantum yield, in the native state) was clear in both cases. We mutated Trp-48 in the recognition helix to a Phe to evaluate the role of this residue in determining the structure and binding properties of the Bcd-HD. Phe was selected as a conservative replacement for Trp-48 to avoid disrupting the immediate environment of helix III. The equilibrium CD spectra of Bcd-HD W48F revealed the characteristic helical minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 1 a), with a predicted helical content of ∼35% (Fig. 1 a, inset), suggesting that the mutation did not have significant effects at the level of secondary structure. However, electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that Bcd-HD W48F bound DNA with significantly reduced affinity compared with the wild-type Bcd-HD (Fig.3; a, b ande). This result was not consistent with the limited effect on secondary structure. Furthermore, structural data based on x-ray crystallography of HDs had indicated that Trp-48 is not critically involved in DNA binding, providing only indirect contacts to the phosphate backbone. It follows that the pronounced reduction of affinity for DNA could not be attributed solely to a slight change in secondary structure or loss of a weak contact to DNA. To further investigate the origin of the impaired DNA binding of Bcd-HD W48F, we analyzed the stability of the mutated HD. The thermal denaturation of Bcd-HD W48F monitored by CD spectroscopy revealed a sharp reduction in the Tm from 44 to 27 °C (Fig. 4), suggesting that the mutation had a strong destabilizing effect. We conclude that Trp-48 imparts rigidity to the helix-turn-helix motif of the homeodomain, perhaps thereby potentiating DNA binding. As expected, the Bcd-HD W48F exhibited a fluorescence spectrum characteristic of the single Tyr-25 in the mutant protein. Upon unfolding Bcd-HD W48F in GdmHCl or urea, the fluorescence intensity increased by ∼50% (data not shown). We mutated the native phenylalanine residue in position 8 of the HD to an alanine or to a tyrosine (similar to that of the Antennapedia HD, which is often described as the canonical HD). Both mutants exhibited significant helical structure measured by CD (data not shown). From the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, Bcd-HD F8A had a similarly reduced affinity to DNA as Bcd-HD W48F, whereas the Antennapedia-like Bcd-HD F8Y mutant retained the wild-type binding affinity (Fig. 3, c–e). The Bcd-HD F8A mutant was destabilized (Tm 37 °C) whereas the Bcd-HD F8Y mutant is slightly more stable (Tm 46 °C) than the wild-type HD (Tm 44 °C, see also Fig. 4). Fluorescence spectra of native and denatured Bcd-HD F8A and Bcd-HD F8Y mutants are shown in Fig. 2, e and f. The Trp fluorescence intensity of denatured Bcd-HD F8A was ∼11 times that of the native Bcd-HD F8A, whereas denatured Bcd-HD F8Y showed an intensity ∼23 times larger than the native Bcd-HD F8Y. Clearly there was a correlation between the presence of an aromatic residue in position 8 of the HD and the quenching of native Trp fluorescence, but this interaction could not account for the full extent of the quenching. Knowledge-based protein modeling methods (SWISS-MODEL automated protein modeling server (35Peitsch M.C. Bio-Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 36Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar)) were used to generate a model for the structure of the Bcd-HD (Fig. 5, a andb) based on the coordinates of existing homeodomain structures. The relative orientations of the three helices and the positions of Trp-48 and other aromatic residues (Phe-8, Phe-20, Tyr-25, Phe-49) in the Bcd-HD are shown in this model. We have probed the structural characteristics of Bcd-HD, a nucleic acid binding domain specifically recognizing RNA and DNA in its capacity as a dual regulator of gene expression and translation, by exploiting the single Trp in the molecule (Trp-48), a strictly invariant residue in the primary sequences of the HD family, as a sensitive probe of conformational changes in the protein. The strict conservation of Trp-48 in the HD family suggests that it plays a key role in the function of homeodomains. Although Trp-48 lies in the recognition helix, it is not involved in direct contacts with the DNA but rather makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the phosphate backbone (12Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 15Tucker-Kellogg L. Rould M.A. Chambers K.A. Ades S.E. Sauer R.T. Pabo C.O.

Biol. 1998; 284: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The CD spectra confirmed that the α-helical content of the Bcd-HD is similar to that of other HDs. From the thermal denaturation profile, the Bcd-HD is an autonomously folded domain exhibiting a reversible two-state unfolding transition. TheTm (44 °C) is comparable with that of other known homeodomains (30Carra J.H. Privalov P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Damante G. Tell G. Leonardi A. Fogolari F. Bortolotti N. Di Lauro R. Formisano S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The conservative mutation W48F, designed to minimally perturb the overall hydrophobicity of the helix III environment, has a significant α-helical structure yet exhibits 50-fold lower affinity for DNA, suggesting that Trp-48 plays a more complex role in DNA binding than that postulated previously. In addition, the dramatic destabilization (reduction ofTm by ∼17°) of the mutant confirms that Trp-48 forms an integral part of the hydrophobic core of the HD. Trp-48 and Phe-49 are conserved in all known HDs and must play a role in stabilizing the folded structure and determining the spatial relationships required for DNA recognition (12Kissinger C.R. Liu B. Martin-Blanco E. Kornberg T.B. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1990; 63: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In addition to a direct role in DNA binding, a major function of Trp-48 in the helix III of the HD is to stabilize the global structure, thus allowing other residues to make critical DNA contacts. According to the relatively blue-shifted fluorescence peak (329 nm) in the native state, Trp-48 is buried within the molecule and thus shielded from solvent. The few known HD structures and molecular modeling of the Bcd-HD are consistent with these data. The fluorescence of Trp-48 increased dramatically (20-fold) upon denaturation. That is, Trp-48 fluorescence displays an unprecedented degree of quenching in the native state. Ubx-HD also possesses a single Trp residue that is highly quenched (this work and Ref. 23Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In view of the observations of Nanda and Brand (23Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Nanda V. Brand L. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A448Google Scholar) of native state Trp quenching in the Ubx, Engrailed, and Antennapedia C39S mutant HDs, we conclude that the fluorescence properties of Trp-48 may be general in the context of the HD fold and thus applicable to all HDs. In other words, Trp-48 fluorescence may be useful as a probe for comparing the structures of other members of this family for which high resolution structural information is not yet available. A surprising result of this work is the importance of the aromatic residue in position 8. The Bcd-HD F8A mutant shows a significantly reduced DNA binding ability (comparable with W48F) and a destabilized structure. Conversely, the Bcd-HD F8Y mutant binds as well as the wild-type HD and is slightly more stable. This suggests that an aromatic residue in position 8, and the resultant interaction with Trp-48, may be critical to mediate the structure of the HD by bringing helix I and the recognition helix, helix III, into a conformation optimal for DNA binding. Carra and Privalov (30Carra J.H. Privalov P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 526-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported quenching of fluorescence in the native state of the MATα2-HD and suggested that interactions with adjacent residues might be responsible. Native state quenching was also observed in thetrp aporepressor protein (38Fernando, T., and Royer, C. A. (1992) Biochemistry, 31.Google Scholar) and recently in the immunophilin domain of the FK506-binding protein FKBP59-I (39Rouviere N. Vincent M. Craesu C.T. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7339-7352Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FKBP59-I contains two Trp residues, one of which is deeply buried in the hydrophobic core and which fluoresces very weakly compared with the second, surface-exposed, Trp residue. The quenching of this residue was attributed to an atypical hydrogen-bond interaction involving the indole nitrogen of the buried Trp and the benzene ring of a neighboring Phe residue. In this conformation, the indole NH group points toward the center of the Phe benzene ring, which can act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor interacting with a donor (40Levitt M. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The strength of this interaction (∼3 kcal mol−1) is about half that of commonly occurring H-bonds (40Levitt M. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and 5× kT at room temperature. Thus, it could have a significant role in stabilizing molecular interactions. Burley and Petsko (41Burley S.K. Petsko G. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar) found that such interactions between amino and aromatic groups occur more frequently than expected. In FKBP59-I, the planes of the aromatic rings of the interacting Trp and Phe residues are oriented almost perpendicular to each other, which could be expected to facilitate the quenching more than a parallel configuration. Using time-correlated single photon counting techniques, Suwaiyan and Klein (42Suwaiyan A. Klein U.K.A. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1989; 159: 244-250Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) measured a dramatic decrease in the lifetime of indole in cyclohexane solution upon the addition of benzene and suggested that the quenching was because of H-bonding between the indole NH and the π system of benzene. In addition, Van Duuren (43Van Duuren B.L. J. Org. Chem. 1961; 26: 2954-2960Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that the fluorescence intensities of 1,2-dimethylindole and 1-methyl-2-phenylindole do not decrease in benzene solution relative to other solvents, implying that the free indole NH is essential for such complex formation. These results correlate well with the observed decrease of the lifetime of Trp-48 fluorescence in Bcd-HD and Ubx-HD. Nanda and Brand (23Nanda V. Brand L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have used similar arguments to suggest that the Trp-Phe NH–π hydrogen bond is responsible for the quenching of the Trp fluorescence in HDs and have proposed an excited state rearrangement model in which a simple rotation of the Trp around the Cα–Cβ bond would be sufficient to bring the indole nitrogen in proximity to the aromatic acceptor on the N-terminal arm. In the absence of a x-ray crystallographic or solution NMR-derived structure for the Bcd-HD, one cannot state conclusively that the proposed interaction plays a role in the quenching of the Trp-48 in the Bcd-HD. Closer inspection of the surroundings of Trp-48 in the homology-based molecular model of the Bcd-HD reveal a possible interaction of the indole nitrogen with the benzene ring of Phe-8 (Fig.5 b; ∼ 4 Å distance of closest approach), which might contribute to the quenching of Trp-48. In fact the planes of the aromatic rings of the two residues are almost orthogonal to each other (Fig. 5 b). Similarly, although a high-resolution structure of the Ubx-HD is not available, it is plausible that an interaction between Trp-48 and the aromatic ring of Tyr-8 in Ubx-HD also contributes to the fluorescence quenching. A survey of the known homeodomains reveals that all, except for the LIM and POU class proteins, possess a Tyr or Phe residue at position 8. However, as our fluorescence data for the Bcd-HD F8A and Bcd-HD F8Y mutants (Fig. 2,e–f) indicate, this interaction alone cannot account for the full extent of the quenching. That is, other mechanisms or interactions must intervene, possibly involving other neighboring aromatic residues, which are clustered around Trp-48 (Fig.5 b). A likely candidate is Phe-49, which is also nearly invariant in HDs with the exception of the MATα2 (valine) and DmBarHI and DaBarHI (tyrosine) (44Laughon A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11357-11367Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Chen and Barkley (45Chen Y. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9976-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) have recently identified amino acid side chains that quench Trp fluorescence in solution. Lys and Tyr residues quench by excited-state proton transfer whereas Gln, Asn, Glu, Asp, Cys, and His quench by electron transfer. Electron transfer has less stringent geometric requirements than proton transfer, can occur through-space or through-bond over distances of up to 10 Å, and is thus likely to play a major role in quenching. In the Bcd model structure described above, His-19 and His-56 are within 10 Å of Trp-48. However the ionization state of His residues critically affects their quenching ability, with positively charged His residues being much more effective than neutral His residues. We would not expect His-19 or His-56 to be protonated under our experimental conditions. The quenching ability of other amino acid side-chains such as Arg, of which a stretch of four residues occurs in helix III of the Bcd HD, might be enhanced by the proximity and orientation of these side-chains in the context of the protein fold, even though at neutral pH these show negligible quenching of model compound fluorescence (45Chen Y. Barkley M.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9976-9982Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Further insight into the dynamics and nature of the interactions of the indole proton of Trp-48 of Bcd-HD with surrounding residues will be provided by hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments and by progress in the structure determination of the Bcd-HD.

Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1985; 82: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These molecules are complexes of a large number of polypeptide components that assemble into hierarchical ordered quaternary structures. The extracellular Hbs and Chls1 of Annelida are formed by two kinds of polypeptide chains, the globins and the linkers (2Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Vestimentifera have two types of extracellular Hbs (2Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that are indicated here as heavy hemoglobin (HbH) and light hemoglobin (HbL). HbH is very similar in shape and molecular mass (∼ 3,000 kDa) to the Hbs and Chls of Annelida and is also composed of globin and linker chains. In contrast, the HbL has a molecular mass of ∼ 400 kDa and contains globin chains only. Pogonophora contain an Hb very similar to the HbL of Vestimentifera; therefore, it is also indicated here as HbL (2Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In their pioneering work on the molecular evolution of extracellular Hbs, Gotoh et al. (3Gotoh T. Shishikura F. Snow J.W. Ereifeji J.W. Vinogradov S. Walz D.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) divided the globin polypeptides into two groups with a common origin. Successively, Suzuki and Riggs (4Suzuki T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that linker chains share similarities with the low density lipoprotein receptor and that they cannot be related to the globins because of the high divergence of their primary structures. More recently, Yuasa et al. (5Yuasa H.J. Green B.N. Takagi T. Suzuki N. Vinogradov S. Suzuki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have proposed a general evolutionary model for the Hbs, HbH, and HbL. According to these authors the common ancestor of all these molecules was a protein formed by globin chains only. During the successive evolution the linker chains would have been added to the final structure of Hbs and HbH. Chls were not included in their analysis, because no sequences were available at that time. Moreover, their model implies an independent evolution of Hbs and HbH. As a consequence two points still remain unsettled: (i) the placement of Chl in this scenario and (ii) the evolutionary pathway followed by Hbs, Chls, and HbH with respect to HbL. To investigate these points we have sequenced the globin and linker chains of Chl of the polychaete Sabella spallanzanii (6Pallavicini A. Negrisolo E. Barbato R. Dewilde S. Ghiretti-Magaldi A.

They have been aligned with other available sequences of Annelida, Vestimentifera, and Pogonophora to perform phylogenetic analyses applying both cladistic and distance-based methods. Using this approach we have been able to retrace the molecular evolution of Hbs, Chls, HbHs, and HbLs. The comparison of our new phylogenetic reconstruction with the previously advanced hypotheses (3Gotoh T. Shishikura F. Snow J.W. Ereifeji J.W. Vinogradov S. Walz D.A. Biochem.

Acta. 1996; 1296: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) lead us to propose an alternative model for the evolution of annelid hemoglobins. We aligned all the sequences of extracellular Hbs, Chls, HbHs, and HbLs of Annelida, Pogonophora, and Vestimentifera available in the literature including the newly presented globin and linker sequences of S. spallanzanii(6Pallavicini A.

Globin sequences were aligned manually according to the nonvertebrate globin template (7Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and linker sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program (8Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar). Pairwise comparisons were performed on the coding and 3′-UTR portions of the S. spallanzanii globin cDNAs and some selected globins of Annelida using the program ALIGN. Similar comparisons were carried out on the linker sequences using the ClustalW program (8Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55720) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments were used to build phylogenetic trees using the maximum parsimony 2Glossary of phylogenetic terms: apomorphy, a derived state of a character that represents an evolutionary novelty with respect to the ancestral state; autoapomorphy, a derived character state that is unique for a particular sequence; bootstrap test, a statistical test used to verify the robustness of the topology of an evolutionary tree; bootstrap value, the result of the bootstrap test (in this paper it is expressed as a percentage); cladistic analysis, a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the principle of maximum parsimony; cladogram, a tree depicting the phylogenetic relationships that results from a cladistic approach; clade, a monophyletic group in a cladistic context; ingroup, a set of sequences that are considered the focus of interest; monophyletic group, a group that includes all the sequences that originate from a common ancestor; most parsimonious tree, a tree produced in a cladistic analysis that has the shortest length; orthologous sequences, two sequences derived from a speciation event (i.e. the same sequence in different species); outgroups, a set of sequences that are brought into the analysis to determine the root of the ingroup and ancestral states; strict consensus tree, a tree derived from a set of trees in which all conflicting branching patterns are collapsed into multifurcations; synapomorphy, a derived state of a character that is shared by all the taxa belonging to a clade; tree length in the cladistic analysis, the value obtained by computing the sum of the minimum numbers of substitutions in all the positions of the alignment. (9Li W.H. Molecular Evolution. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1997Google Scholar) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods (10Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Globin sequences with known x-ray structures were chosen as outgroups. Based on the phylogeny of Metazoa (11Conway Morris S. Nature. 1993; 361: 219-225Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), the sequences of the closest relatives of Annelida, Vestimentifera, and Pogonophora were selected as outgroups. These groups are (i) the globins of the mollusk Scapharca inaequivalvis, (ii) the globin of the echiuran Urechis caupo, and (iii) the intracellular globins of the annelidGlycera dibranchiata. No outgroup for the linker sequences could be selected because their evolutionary position is unknown (4Suzuki T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cladistic analyses were done using the program PAUP, version 3.1.1. (12Swofford D.L. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Center for Biodiversity, Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar). Globin evolution was studied using a heuristic approach because the number of sequences involved excludes the exhaustive approach (12Swofford D.L. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Center for Biodiversity, Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar). All characters were weighted equally, and those uninformative were excluded from the analysis. After a series of trials, we set the PAUP options to perform more efficiently in finding the shortest trees. For the optimization of characters, theACCTRAN option was set. For the heuristic searches, the options set were: (i) keep minimal trees only, (ii)collapse zero-length branches, (iii) starting tree sources,get by stepwise addition, (iv) swap on, minimal trees only, (v) addition sequence, random, (vi) replications,50, (vii) swapping algorithm, TBR tree bisection-reconnection, (viii) MULPARS on, and (ix)steepest descent on. For the phylogenetic analysis of linker chains, we applied an exhaustive approach because of the smaller size of the data set (12Swofford D.L. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Center for Biodiversity, Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar). Uninformative characters were also excluded, and the remaining characters were weighted equally. The PAUP optimization of characters (ACCTRAN on) and exhaustive search (keep minimal trees only and collapse zero-length branches on) options were set. Two indexes are traditionally used to test the robustness of the most parsimonious tree obtained by cladistic analyses, the consistency and retention indexes (13Kluge A.G. Faris J.F. Syst. Zool. 1969; 18: 1-32Crossref Google Scholar, 14Faris J.F. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 417-419Crossref Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). These indexes were calculated as implemented in PAUP (12Swofford D.L. Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Center for Biodiversity, Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1993Google Scholar). Values of the consistency index and retention index > 0.5 indicate that convergent/parallel evolution does not affect strongly the phylogenetic reconstruction and that the obtained topologies of trees are reliable. Molecular synapomorphies in the cladistic analysis were detected using the program MacClade (Version 3), which allows the tracking of the evolution of each character (15Madison W.P. Madison D.R. MacClade: Analysis of Phylogeny and Character Evolution, Version 3. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). The distance-based phylogenetic reconstructions were performed on globin and linker alignments according to the NJ method (10Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) as implemented in the TREECON program (Version 1.3b) (16Van de Peer Y. De Wachter R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 3: 227-230Google Scholar). The NJ trees were created by applying the following settings: (i) distance calculation, Kimura 83; (ii) alignment positions, all; and (iii) insertions and deletions, not taken into account. The bootstrap resampling (17Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was performed to test the robustness of the trees obtained by cladistic and neighbor-joining phylogenetic reconstructions. In both cases, 500 replicates were run. In Fig. 1 we present the results of a global alignment of the Sabellaglobin sequences with the globins of other annelids, vestimentiferans, pogonophorans, and the canonical globin fold (7Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Eight sequences chosen according to the criteria described under “Materials and Methods” were added as outgroups. An inspection of the alignment clearly indicates that the key residues Trp (A12), Phe (CD1), His (E7), and His (F8), consistent with the canonical globin fold, are absolutely conserved. Conversely, the presence of Pro (C2), which usually determines the bend of the corner between helices B and C, is not universal to all the globins. In two Sabella globins (Glb1 and Glb2), the small residues Ala and Cys are found at positions B6 and E8. In these sites the majority of annelid globins have a Gly residue, with the exception of globin I of Tylorrhynchus, in which a Phe is found at position B6. These substitutions in theSabella globins would result in a closer crossing of the B and E helices. All the extracellular annelid globins shown in the alignment have in common the Cys residues at positions NA2 and H11. These amino acids are important for the formation of the first supramolecular aggregate in the assembly of the whole Hb (18Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.N. Oliver R.W.A. Braswell E.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), which is confirmed by the fact that they are replaced in the intracellular globins of Glycera, Urechis, andScapharca by other residues. Four other residues, namely Arg (E10), Phe (E4), His (F3), and Gln (F7), are highly conserved in the extracellular globins, but the structural and functional significance of this conservation remains to be clarified. A similar alignment was carried out for the linker sequences of Sabella with the five other linkers available in the data bases (Fig. 2). The main feature that seems to be conserved is a cysteine-rich segment ((Cys-X 6)3-Cys-X 5-Cys-X 10-Cys) that is typical for all the linker chains sequenced thus far and has been related to the low density lipoprotein-receptor motif (4Suzuki T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the current global alignment (Fig. 2), the cysteine-rich segment can be written more precisely as ((Cys-X 5-6)2-Cys-X 6-Cys-Asp-X 3-Asp-Cys-X 4-Asp-Glu-X 4-Cys). The analysis of the pairwise comparison of the globin cDNAs (Fig. 3) shows a higher percentage of identity in the open reading frame portion (57.59% mean value) than in the 3′-UTR portion (47.82% mean value). This is consistent with a higher degree of variability of the globin 3′ UTRs that are less subject to structural constrains. However, it should be noted that Lumbricus d1 globin and d2 are more similar in 3′ regions than in the coding portions. The pairwise comparisons performed on the linker chains (Fig.4) give the following main results. (i)Tylorrhynchus L2 and Neanthes L2 markedly differ from the general structure of other linkers. In fact they share 74.58% of identical amino acids, whereas the mean for the whole data set is 25.79%. The latter value decreases to 23.35%, if the comparison ofTylorrhynchus L2 versus Neanthes L2 is excluded from the computation. (ii) Roughly 40% of the amino acids are specific for each chain (mean of dissimilar amino acids = 39.45%). (iii) Identical amino acids represent one fourth of the whole data when sequences are pairwise-compared. However, the residues common to all the linker chains in the global alignment are only 15 (5.7%) (Fig. 2), and they are mainly restricted to the cysteine-rich segment. We have applied both cladistic and distance-based methods to study the molecular evolution of annelid globins. The cladistic analysis results in 18 equally parsimonious cladograms. The resulting strict consensus (SC) tree is presented in Fig. 5 A together with the distance-based tree (Fig. 5 B). Both phylogenetic reconstructions recognize a monophyletic origin of Hbs, Chls, HbHs, and HbLs. A more detailed analysis of the ingroup shows that the extracellular Hbs, Chls, HbHs, and HbLs can be divided into two distinct groups. However, the actual position of the Lumbricus III globin cannot be resolved in the SC tree. The topologies of the two trees show some discrepancies. In particular the placement of theLamellibrachia BIV globin seems controversial. In fact, in the cladogram it is placed into the A group according to the classification of Gotoh et al. (3Gotoh T. Shishikura F. Snow J.W. Ereifeji J.W. Vinogradov S. Walz D.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), whereas in the NJ tree it is included in the B group. Both hypotheses are poorly supported by bootstrap values, revealing the weakness of the more basal nodes. In Table I we list the clades that belong to the ingroup and are supported by one or more molecular synapomorphies. Several of them are also sustained by high bootstrap values.Table IGlobin cladesiCladeBTMolecular synapomorphies%aTylorrhynchusIIA + TylorrhynchusIGln (20), Val (29), Asn (52)bLamellibrachia AIII + Riftiab100Tyr (8), Phe (42), His (46), Val (47), Thr (74), Thr (82), Thr (103), Val (129), His (131), Met (135), Gln (168)cPontodrilus I + (Pheretima sie.

BT, bootstrap values supporting the different clades. Only values ≥ 50% are indicated. The cladistic analysis of linker sequences produced two equally parsimonious cladograms. The SC tree is showed in Fig. 6, where the NJ tree is also presented. Cladistic and distance-based analyses were performed only on the available sequences of linker chains because no convincing putative outgroups are known. In fact, with the exception of the cysteine-rich segment that relates the linkers with the low density lipoprotein receptor (4Suzuki T. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no other significant similarity is known between linker chains and other proteins. Nevertheless,Tylorrhynchus L2 and Neanthes L1 were used to root the trees, because they are much more similar to each other than to other linkers. The SC and NJ trees show some discrepancies in their topology. The cladogram structure favors a strict relationship betweenTylorrhynchus L1, Lamellibrachia LAV1, andSabella L3. This clade is also supported by a very high bootstrap value. Conversely, the NJ tree supports the two groupsTylorrhynchus L1 + Lumbricus L1 andSabella L1 + Sabella L3. The first is also corroborated by the bootstrap value (72%), whereas the second does not receive strong support by the bootstrap test (48%). Both cladistic and distance-based analyses strongly favor the grouping ofTylorrhynchus L2 and Neanthes L2 with respect to other linker chains. The cladistic and distance-based analyses that we performed on the extracellular Hbs of annelids, pogonophorans, and vestimentiferans confirm the previous results of Gotoh et al. (3Gotoh T. Shishikura F. Snow J.W. Ereifeji J.W. Vinogradov S. Walz D.A. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These authors proposed the division of the globin chains into two main groups, A and B, each divided further into two subgroups, A1/A2 and B1/B2. This classification was successively applied to HbHs and HbLs (19Suzuki T. Takagi T. Ohta S. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Zal F. Suzuki T. Kawasaki Y. Childess J.J. Lallier F.H. Tulmond A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, a correction of this nomenclature has been proposed that recommends an inversion of the names of the two main strains (21Shishikura F. Ochiai T. Yamanaka I. Zool. Sci. 1997; 14: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However the identification of homologous chains, i.e.globins that are the products of orthologous genes, does not seem to be a trivial task. In both our analyses Tylorrhynchus IIA andTylorrhynchus I are grouped together more closely than the respective “homologous” sequences. Therefore it seems problematic to name them Tylorrhynchus A2 and TylorrhynchusA1 as previously suggested (22Gotoh T. Suzuki T. Takagi T. Vinogradov S.N. Kapp O.H. Structure and Function of Invertebrate Oxygen Carriers. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1991: 279-283Crossref Google Scholar). In this light Lumbricus d1 and Lumbricus d2 can be defined either as two allelic forms of the same gene or as the products of a very recent gene duplication. The same reasoning can be applied to Sabella Glb1 andSabella Glb2. The subdivision into four homologous groups of globins could be an oversimplification of the real situation. In fact we have found a higher number of globin chains in the Chl, purified from a single specimen of Sabella (6Pallavicini A. Negrisolo E. Barbato R. Dewilde S. Ghiretti-Magaldi A. Moens L. Lanfranchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26384-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A study of the entire portion of the genome coding for these proteins should be the best way to understand these discrepancies. The globins and linkers, forming the Chls, are tightly associated in the phylogenetic reconstructions with those included in the Hbs. This clearly identifies the Chl as a variant of Hb. On this assumption the name chlorocruorin must be considered only as a descriptive term. The phylogenetic reconstruction presented in this paper reveals that the genes coding for the polypeptides that form Chls, Hbs, HbHs, and HbLs appeared before the separation of Vestimentifera and Pogonophora phyla from Annelida (Sensu stricto) (11Conway Morris S. Nature. 1993; 361: 219-225Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The evolutionary pathway does not change even if we consider pogonophorans and vestimentiferans as members of the class Opisthochaeta within the phylum Annelida (20Zal F. Suzuki T. Kawasaki Y. Childess J.J. Lallier F.H. Tulmond A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The critical question is: what was the scenario in which Chls, Hbs, HbHs, and HbLs evolved? Yuasa et al. (5Yuasa H.J. Green B.N. Takagi T. Suzuki N. Vinogradov S. Suzuki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) previously suggested that Hb, Chl, and HbH evolved from HbL, which is made only of globin chains, adding linker chains to form the final hexagonal bilayered structure. If we accept this hypothesis we must make four assumptions (Fig. 7 A): (i) HbL was present in the common ancestor of Annelida, Vestimentifera, and Pogonophora, (ii) in the Annelida phylum HbL disappeared, originating Hb and Chl, (iii) in Vestimentifera HbH evolved from HbL but the latter did not disappear, and (iv) HbH evolved separately from Hb and Chl. The last assumption is supported by the fact that vestimentiferans and pogonophorans are sister groups, independent from their systematic position. As a consequence, HbH could not be present in their common ancestor (an annelid) because otherwise we should admit its subsequent loss in Pogonophora, which contrasts with the starting hypothesis. Our analyses performed on linkers of Hb, Chl, and HbH show that the genes coding for these polypeptides were already present in the common ancestor of Annelida, Vestimentifera, and Pogonophora. We therefore suggest an alternative scenario for the evolution of this group of respiratory pigments. Our most parsimonious hypothesis is based only on the following three assumptions (Fig. 7 B). (i) The common ancestor of Annelida, Vestimentifera, and Pogonophora had in its genome the whole set of genes coding for globin and linker chains. As a consequence Hb, Chl, and HbH did not evolve independently. (ii) The common ancestor of Vestimentifera and Pogonophora evolved the HbL from HbH, starting from the set of genes coding for the latter. (iii) Pogonophora lost HbH during evolution. The data deduced from our phylogenetic analyses fit nicely in this new hypothesis, which requires fewer ad hoc assumptions to explain the origin of this group of proteins. The new evolutionary model that we propose can be applied also to the Hbs of leeches, which were not considered in our study because the available sequences are not sufficiently complete. However, the data based on the amino termini of some leech globins clearly show that they are homologous to other extracellular Hbs (21Shishikura F. Ochiai T. Yamanaka I. Zool. Sci. 1997; 14: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Lucio Cariello, Director of the Stazione Zoologica “A.

They contain an altered heme with a formyl group substituting the canonical three-vinyl group and consequently appear as greenish red (1Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Chls have in electron micrographs the hexagonal bilayer (HBL) appearance and size characteristic of annelid and vestimentiferan extracellular Hbs, a similar sedimentation coefficient of ∼60 S (molecular mass ∼3, 600 kDa), and an abnormally low iron content of 0.23 weight % (2Terwilliger R.C.

The HBL Hbs, including the Chls, have almost identical three-dimensional structures as determined by cryoelectron microscopy at about 3-nm resolution (7De Haas D. Taveau J.C. Boisset N. Lambert O.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All HBL Hbs and Chls are composed of two type of chains, heme-containing 16–17-kDa globin chains and nonglobin linker chains of 25–32 kDa in an approximate 2:1 molar ratio (1Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The structural hierarchy within the HBL Hb of Lumbricus terrestris was determined recently by x-ray diffraction analysis at 5.5 Å resolution (12Royer W.E. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This Hb, composed of 144 globin and 36 linker chains, is arranged in dodecameric substructures. Twelve trimeric linker complexes project triple-stranded helical coiled-coil “spokes” toward the center of the complex; interdigitation of these spokes seems crucial for stabilization. The resulting complex of linker chains forms a scaffold on which 12 Hb dodecamers assemble. The nature of the disulfide-bonded globin subunits composing the dodecameric structures is different among the different classes. Monomers and disulfide-bonded trimers or monomers and disulfide-bonded dimers are found in oligochaete/polychaete and leeches/vestimentiferans Hbs, respectively (5Vinogradov S.N. Standley P.R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6598-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) consists of two types of globin subassemblies, a dodecamer formed by the noncovalent association of three disulfide-bonded trimers and a tetramer formed by the noncovalent association of disulfide-bonded dimers. In contrast to annelid Hbs, in which a wealth of sequence information of globin chains is available, only a single primary structure of a Chl globin chain has been published (17Suzuki T. Hirao Y. Vinogradov S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Globin chain E ofSabellastarte indica shows 27–49% sequence identity with the annelid globin chains. Five cysteines, crucial for the subunit formation, are present. Two adjacent cysteines just preceding A1 and one at position H11 are conserved as in all annelid globin chains of type I (18Zal F. Suzuki T. Kawasaki Y. Childress J.J. Lallier F.H. Toulmond A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Two other cysteines occur at position E8 and within the corner between the G and H helices, as frequently seen in other annelid Hbs as well (19Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Chl of Sabella spallanzanii, a marine fan worm polychaete formerly known as Spirographis spallanzanii, was chosen as a model molecule to identify the set of polypeptides that form the complete protein. The globin and linker polypeptides that compose its supramolecular structure have been resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Three globin and three linker mRNAs and some variants have been isolated from S. spallanzanii cDNA libraries by screening with specific antibodies and have been completely sequenced and characterized. Live specimens of S. spallanzanii were collected in the Bay of Napoli. When Chl was prepared from pools of animals, the collected hemolymph was first centrifuged (10 min at 1,000 × g) and then frozen at −20 °C in 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 35 mm CaCl2, and 20% sucrose. Tablets of the Complete protease inhibitor kit (Roche) were added to prevent proteolytic activity. The Chl was sedimented by ultracentrifugation (3.5 h at 300,000 ×g) at 4 °C, and the obtained pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and stored at −20 °C. The Chl concentration was determined using E1cm1% = 2.18 for Chl at 280 nm. Absorption spectra were measured with an 8452A Hewlett Packard spectrophotometer. For single S. spallanzaniispecimens, the crowns were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The Chl was purified by running directly the hemolymph obtained from each crown on a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 0.1 mTris/HCl, pH 7.0. The final purity was checked by transmission electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and polyacrylamide gel separation. One- and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) were performed according to Fling and Gregerson (20Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and Görg et al.(21Görg A. Postel W. Günter S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The first dimension was isoelectric focussing on a 4.0–7.0 Immobiline pH gradient. A 15% polyacrylamide/SDS slab gel electrophoresis was used as second dimension. Globin and linker chains were separated by 2-DE, and the band pattern was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). Selected spots were sequenced in an Applied Biosystems ABI 471-B sequencer operating as recommended by the manufacturer. The monolayer hematopoietic tissue of S. spallanzanii (22Mezzasalma V. Tognon G. Ghiretti-Magaldi A. Anim. Biol. 1992; 1: 85-96Google Scholar) was prepared from living animals, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80 °C. The extraction of total RNA was performed according to Chomczynsky and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) using the tissues of a total of seven specimens. Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified by oligo(dT) affinity chromatography (24Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo(dT)-NotI primer using the Copy kit (Invitrogen). The double-stranded blunt-ended cDNA was ligated to BstXI nonpalindromic adaptors, NotI-digested, and finally directionally cloned into a BstXI-NotI-cut pcDNAII plasmid vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant vectors were electroporated into Escherichia coli strains InvαF′ and Top10F′ (Invitrogen). Purified Chl was separated into its components by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and the gel was stained with acid-free Coomassie. Three main bands were cut out from the gel and electro-eluted as described previously (25Barbato R. Shipton C.A. Giacometti G.M. Barber J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After checking the purity by a second SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run, the purified proteins were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into rabbits. Animals were booster-injected every second week over a period of 2 months. Blood was collected, and the serum was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. As controls, sera were collected from the same rabbits before the immunization protocol. The specificity of the different antisera was checked by immunoblotting according to standard protocols (26Bjerrum O.J. Heegaard N.H.H. CRC Handbook of Immunoblotting of Proteins: Technical Descriptions. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988Google Scholar). In a first round of screening, 100,000 bacteria colonies were grown on 10 nylon filters laid on square Luria Bertani broth plates (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The colonies were then replicated twice on nitrocellulose filters and re-grown on Luria Bertani broth plates containing isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as an inducer for the expression of the recombinant proteins. The clones containing the globin and linker cDNAs were detected by immunological screening using the specific antibodies at a dilution of 1:1,000. Two rounds of subscreening were performed to select single positive clones. Both strands of the cDNA inserts were sequenced by a primer-walking strategy using the fluorescent BigDye™ terminators chemistry (PE Biosystems), and the sequencing reactions were analyzed on an ABI-377 automated DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems). The sequences were assembled using the SeqMan II program from the Lasergene software package (DNAStar, Madison, WI). Full-length sequences of linker 3 and globin 1 were completed by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends on theS. spallanzanii cDNA. A primer designed onBstXI adaptor was used for the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends, whereas the oligo(dT)-NotI was used as primer for the 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends reaction. One µl of adaptor-ligated cDNA was mixed with 200 µm dNTPs, 200 nm primers, 2.5 units of AmpliTaq GOLD (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1.75 mm MgCl2. After the activation of AmpliTaq GOLD at 94 °C for 15 min, 35 cycles of amplification were performed using the following steps: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The same protocol was adopted for the isolation of globin 3 cDNA, because immunoscreening identified no positive clones. In this case, a degenerated reverse primer coupled to theBstXI adaptor primer was designed on the amino terminus of globin D. A 180-base pair fragment was obtained and sequenced. On this sequence two nested forward primers were designed for reaching the 3′ end of mRNA using the oligo(dT)-NotI as reverse primer. Several programs, available at the ExPASy molecular biology server, were used to analyze the new sequences. The ORFs codified by the cDNAs were obtained using the Translate program. Then the ORFs were manually aligned to the polypeptide amino termini sequenced during this work or with globins and linkers available from the literature and data bases to identify the export signal peptides. Successively, the pI and molecular mass were computed from the cDNA sequences with the program Compute pI/Mw and compared with the experimental data obtained from the 2-DE gel analysis. The pI and Mw measured with the two protocols are perfectly comparable. Amino acid compositions of the mature polypeptides were determined with the program ProtParam. Finally, the linker chains were aligned using the ClustalW program (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), and the globins were manually aligned according to the tertiary structure template of invertebrate globins (19Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A representative 2-DE separation of the Chl extracted from a single specimen is shown in Fig. 1 A. A complex pattern of multiple spots is clearly detectable. They can be divided into three groups: heavy linkers (molecular mass ∼35 kDa), light linkers (molecular mass ∼31 kDa), and globin chains (Glb) (molecular mass ∼14.4 kDa). This pattern is comparable with that obtained for the Chl of E. vancouverii, in which two groups of linkers (L1a–f and L2a–d, 10 chains) and six globin chains where detected by electron spray ionization mass spectrometry (16Green B.N. Braswell E.H. Kuchumov A.R. Walz D.A. Moens L. Vinogradov S.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6598-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although the solution of the three-dimensional structure of the HBL Hb of L. terrestris offers a splendid explanation for the structural hierarchy within the molecule, no rationale is presented for the globin and linker chain multiplicity (12Royer W.E. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The observed high cooperativity of the HBL Hbs (Hill coefficient n50 > 3) (29Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. Caputo A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. Caputo A. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1985; 147: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as the aggregation into trimers, tetramers, and dodecamers definitively need different globin types (1Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (a,b, c, and d in L. terrestris). The formation of the coiled coils in the linker scaffold complex also probably needs structurally different linker chain types (1Lamy J.N. Green B.N. Toulmond A. Wall J.S. Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (L1–4 in L. terrestris). A comparison of the globin and linker chains of a single animal (Fig.1 A) with that of a pool of 500 S. spallanzaniispecimens (Fig. 1 B) reveals a high degree of heterogeneity. Sixteen spots in the range of ∼31 kDa and thirteen in the range of 14.4 kDa are clearly distinguishable. Amino-terminal sequencing of the major spots and alignment with published sequences confirm their identification as linkers and globin chains (TableI). There are three possible explanations for this heterogeneity: (i) the described variations (see below) suggest the presence of multiple copies of the same gene such that allelic as well as nonallelic variations can occur, (ii) post-translational modifications, or (iii) artificial modifications might be induced by the extraction and separation procedures used (21Görg A. Postel W. Günter S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). It should be considered however that in invertebrates as well as in vertebrates, multiple copies of globin genes are a rule rather than an exception (33Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, Evolution and Pathology. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar, 34Rashid A.K. Van Hauwaert M.-L. Haque M. Siddiai A.H.

Therefore this multiplicity could most likely be explained by the necessity to synthesize huge amounts of the oxygen carrier (35Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M.L. Van Houtte K. Pesce A.

A final conclusion on the exact number of globin and linker chains in S. spallanzanii must wait for a careful analysis of the Chl of single animal by electron spray ionization mass spectrometry.Table IPrimary structure of Sabella globins and linkersPolypeptideplSequenceLinker f(36)4.81XXXWGSXLTTARVDSQEMRLDQLAKQLDWXEGXXWVLinker g(28)4.90XXXWGSXLTTARVDSQEMRLDQLAKQLDGlobin B(44)5.14EAEEXMEDRQEVLKAWEAMWXAEFTGRRVXXXXXXFQRLFEKKPGlobin C(25)5.40EAEEXMEDRQEVLKAWEAMWXAEFTGlobin D(23)5.47XNILQRLKVKHQWQEAFGYADDRGlobinE(44)5.66WNILQRLKVKHQWSQAFGFTDEREDLNTDVVRYIFQVKPEAEAKGlobinJ (32)6.08EGCCSMGDRQEVLNAWEALWSAEYTGRRVMIAAmino-terminal sequences of linker and globin chains of S. spallanzanii chlorocruorin.

Linker and globin sequences are named according to the spot lettering of Fig.1 B. The total number of amino acids determined for each polypeptide is indicated in brackets. X, undetermined amino acid. For the molecular cloning of globin and linker cDNAs, we produced specific antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” Immunological tests on Chl Western blots reveal that the produced antibodies are efficient and specific for the detection of the polypeptides for which they were developed (Fig.2). No cross-reaction was found between antibodies for globins and linkers. Some cross-reaction, however, was observed for the two classes of linkers (heavy and light) with the corresponding antisera, probably because of the high level of similarity among the members of the two classes. A cDNA library was constructed using mRNA extracted from the hematopoietic tissue of S. spallanzanii. Immunological screening detected many recombinant clones that were sequenced. Six complete cDNAs, coding for three globin and three linker chains, have been identified and are presented in Fig.3, A and B, respectively. Each cDNA represents the consensus sequence of at least three independent clones except for Glb3, for which only two positive clones were obtained (see “Materials and Methods”). The main features of the cDNA sequences are summarized in TableII.Table IIMain features of linker and globin cDNAs of S. spallanzani chlorocruorincDNAlengthORF LAAmP LAAmP molecular massmP plbpDaLinker 1187224622224120.734.80Linker 2186724622224120.734.80Linker 3135224823326170.354.96Globin 1108616514916793.115.79Globin 2, var.

Open table in a new tab LAA, length expressed as the total number of amino acids; mP, mature protein without signal peptide. Molecular mass and pl were determined by computer analysis of the cDNA sequences. The ORF codified by the Glb1 cDNA can be identified as the polypeptide J in 2-DE (Fig. 1 B) because the corresponding amino-terminal sequences are identical. Two variants for Glb2 cDNA were obtained that differ for two transversions in the coding region. The first (G versus T) is placed in the third base of the codon 66 and does not change the coded amino acid (Leu). The second (A versus C), however, produces a variation of the ORF (codon 92) with the presence of Ala instead of Asp in six of seven independent Glb2 cDNA clones. The signal peptide of Glb2 was identified by aligning the amino-terminal sequences obtained from the Glb B and C 2-DE spots (Fig. 1 B; TableI). The cDNA for Glb3 is about 200 bases shorter than the cDNAs for Glb1 and Glb2. The signal peptide was identified aligning the ORF with the amino-terminal of the Glb D polypeptide. For this cDNA we found also some variants that differ both in the coding and in the 3′-noncoding regions. The C→T transition in the coding region (codon 42) produces Pro-Leu variants that have the same pI but vary slightly in molecular mass. One transversion and two transitions are also present in the 3′-noncoding regions of these two variants. The cDNAs of L1 and L2 share 99% identity and code for the same ORF (Fig. 3 B). They are identical in the 5′-noncoding regions, whereas some transitions and transversions are accumulated in the coding and in the 3′-noncoding regions. The most important differences are a six-base deletion (5′→GAATA→3′) and the insertion of a single T in L2. These two genes could have originated in a very recent gene duplication, because the observed differences are regularly present in all the independent clones. The amino-terminal amino acid sequences deduced from L1 and L2 cDNAs match with the amino-terminal sequences obtained, at the protein level, from the spotsf and g in the 2-DE of Chl components (Fig.1 B; Table I). The cDNA for L3 is markedly shorter than those for L1 and L2; nevertheless it codes for an ORF that is two amino acids longer. No amino terminus was available to determine the signal peptide of L3. However, a putative signal can be identified by aligning the ORF with the amino terminus of Linker LAV1 ofLamellibrachia sp. (36Suzuki T. Takagi T. Ohta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1551-1555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of the globin and linker chains deduced from the cDNA sequences were computed using the program ProtParam. The data are summarized in Fig. 4. Glb1 and Glb2 have a rather similar composition even though they show some peculiar differences (e.g. Glu is more abundant in Glb2). The amino acid composition of Glb3, however, differs more strikingly from the other two globins. This is particularly evident for Ser residues. The percentage of Ser in Glb3 is twice that in Glb1 and Glb2. As mentioned above, L1 and L2 cDNAs code for an identical polypeptide that differs in composition from L3 (e.g. the percentage of Ser in L1 and L2 is twice that in L3, whereas Lys instead is two times more abundant in L3). Both globin and linker chains show a high percentage of negatively charged residues that explains the low pI calculated for all the chains (Table II). To characterize the primary structure of the Sabella globin chains, we have aligned them with the annelid, pogonophoran, and vestimentiferan globin sequences available in our data base including a globin chain from the Chl of S. indica and globin references (17Suzuki T. Hirao Y. Vinogradov S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Zal F. Suzuki T. Kawasaki Y. Childress J.J. Lallier F.H. Toulmond A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A representative selection of this alignment is presented in Fig.5. The alignment is unambiguous because of the presence of the globin landmarks A12-Trp, C2-Pro, CD1-Phe, E7-His, F8-His and H8-Trp. All three novel globin chains fit the nonvertebrate globin template quite well, resulting in low penalty scores (19Kapp O.H. Moens L. Vanfleteren J. Trotman C. Suzuki T. Vinogradov S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Glb3 has a hydrophobic residue at the surface positions A6 and CD2. Because similar hydrophobic substitutions occur in other annelid globin sequences, it might be that they represent specific adaptations for the aggregation into high molecular mass complexes. No specific adaptations can be localized to harbor the formyl group on the heme ring. The positions of cysteine residues in annelid globin chains are strictly conserved because of their role in the formation of disulfide-bonded subunits (18Zal F. Suzuki T. Kawasaki Y. Childress J.J. Lallier F.H. Toulmond A. Proteins. 1997; 29: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On the basis of the pattern of these residues, two types of chains can be distinguished. Type I has absolutely conserved cysteines at positions NA2 and H11 and a less conserved one at position GH4. Type II displays the same pattern with an additional cysteine at position NA1. As such, Glb3 can be classified as type I and Glb1 and Glb2 can be classified as type II. In all annelid-like globin chains studied thus far, the cysteines at positions NA2 and H11 are involved in an intrachain disulfide bridge linking the NA terminus to the H-helix and leaving the two other cysteine residues free for the formation of inter-chain bridges (12Royer W.E. Strand K. van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,16Green B.N. Braswell E.H. Kuchumov A.R. Walz D.A. Moens L.

As such, based on the alignment it can be concluded that the globin chains of S. spallanzanii are similar to the other annelid, pogonophoran, and vestimentiferan globin sequences. Therefore, the Sabella globin primary structure is not sufficiently informative to explain how these Hbs have acquired the possibility of harboring the modified heme group. A similar alignment was carried out for the linker sequences translated from the cloned cDNAs with two other linkers ofLumbricus and Lamellibrachia (Fig.6). The most remarkable feature of the linker chains, including these of S. spallanzanii, is a conserved 38–39-residue segment containing a repeating pattern of cysteinyl residues ((Cys-X 5–6)3-Cys-X 5-Cys-X 10-Cys) (36Suzuki T.

This pattern is identical with the cysteine-rich repeats of the ligand-binding domain of the low density lipoprotein receptors of man and Xenopus laevis. The sequence Asp-Gly-Ser-Asp-Glu, characteristic of the low density lipoprotein receptor repeats, is less conserved in S. spallanzanii L1, L3, andLamellibrachia LAV1 than in L. terrestris L1. Nevertheless, the pattern Asn-Gly-X-Asp-Glu is easily recognizable in the S. spallanzanii linker sequences (38Suzuki T. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other cysteines at positions 129 and 228 are also conserved together with a Leu, a Gly, and a Tyr residue at positions 31, 122, and 182, respectively. The suggestion that linker chains resulted from gene duplication of a heme-containing chain with a three exon/two intron structure and that the first exon of domain 1 and the last exon of domain 2 have been lost during evolution can not be confirmed (37Suzuki T. Takagi T. Gotoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12168-12177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is more likely that the cysteine-rich motif of the low density lipoprotein receptor and linker chains represents a multipurpose protein-binding unit of ancient origin that has been incorporated into diverse unrelated proteins by the process of exon shuffling (38Suzuki T. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we have presented the primary structure of three globin and three linker chains composing the Chl of S. spallanzaniiand thereby significantly increase the number of annelid, pogonophoran, and vestimentiferan sequences available today. A detailed evolutionary analysis of our data in combination with that available from the literature is presented in an accompanying paper (39Negrisolo E. Pallavicini A. Barbato R. Dewilde S.

 tells the story of the Lunaticks, a group of intellectuals in the English Midlands who, around 1765, began to come together regularly to discuss science and technology. The group included James Watt, whose work on the steam engine the author describes as the outcome of inspiration, luck, and help from friends. The story of the Lunaticks shows that science and technology advance through intellectual exchange between people from all walks of life."
