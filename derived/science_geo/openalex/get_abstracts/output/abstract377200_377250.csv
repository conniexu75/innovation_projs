This was questioned by Chanutin and Kinard (4) but was conclusively proved by Bloch, Schoenheimer, and Rittenberg (5, 6) by isotope tracer evidence, which also showed that creatinine was the only normal urinary constituent containing any significant amount of body creatine nitrogen (1)."

https://openalex.org/W2135425519,"Ricin, the highly toxic, hemagglutinating protein of the castor bean, has always been of great interest to the chemist and the immunologist (l-4), partly because it, may readily be obta.ined in considerable quantities. Earlier methods of preparation were carried out before the development of modern physicochemical and immunochemical methods for characterizing proteins and data are therefore lacking on the purity and homogeneity of the products obtained. In the present report a summary is given of a portion of a study carried out during 1943-45 in consultation and collaboration with other laboratories engaged in parallel investigations which, it is hoped, will soon be published. Since results and materials were freely exchanged, some of the data included here were obtained on material from other laboratories, as indicated in the text."

https://openalex.org/W51370780,"an acid pH is cleaved to yield a pteridine and p-aminobenzoylglutamic acid.â€™ The reaction seems to be general for this group of compounds and is suggested as a basis for a chemical method for the determination of pteroylglutamic acid, its derivatives, and analogues. The method consists of reducing the compound with zinc dust in 0.5 N hydrochloric acid. The aromatic amine is measured by the method of Bratton and Marshall (1) before and after reduction. The difference between the two values multiplied by the appropriate factor is a measure of the pteroyl derivative present."

https://openalex.org/W2090768581,A FEW days ago I discovered at Sterkfontein remains of two new skulls of Plesianthropus transvaalensis. The specimens were found within a few feet of the spot where the type was discovered. One of the specimens is the crushed snout of apparently a young male with some beautiful teeth. The other is a fragment of the snout of a young child of about three years. This latter specimen has the milk molars shown in almost perfect condition.

https://openalex.org/W1489424264,"This paper describes the purification of two antibiotic substances produced by strains of Actinomyces isolated from soil. Both organisms were isolated and studied by Dr. Albert Iielner of the University of Pennsylvania for their cultural characteristics and conditions for maximum production of the antibiotic substances. Animal experiments, determination of antibacterial spectrum, etc., were conducted by Dr. Harry E. Morton, also of the University of Pennsylvania (l-3). One strain of Actinomyces, designated as A-10 in earlier work, resembles Actinomyces lavendulae, and the antibacterial substance produced by it has been called lavendulin (2). The other strain of Actinomyces, originally designated as A-105, resembles in some respects Actinomyces erythreus, A. jradii, A. albosporeus, and A. calijornicus, and the antibacterial substance produced by it has been called actinorubin (2). Under suitable conditions of growth both strains of Actinomyces produce antibacterial substances which are active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. Purification of the antibiotics is achieved by the same method. The antibiotic principle is adsorbed on a cation exchanger (notably Decalso) and eluted with saturated NaCl. The NaCl eluate containing the active principle is evaporated to dryness and extracted with boiling methanol. The methanol extract is precipitated with half its volume of ether, the supernatant discarded, and the precipitate washed with absolute ethanol. The resulting dried powder is the partially purified antibiotic. Most of the animal and toxicity experiments conducted by Dr. Morton were carried out with these preparations. The final purification of the antibiotics is accomplished through chromatographic adsorption on activated aluminum oxide in 85 per cent methanol. Certain fractions of the chromatogram containing the hydrochlorides of lavendulin (strain A-10) and actinorubin (strain A-105) form insoluble addition compounds with methyl orange, which are recrystallized from methanol-water mixtures."

https://openalex.org/W2029086684,"ALMOST any collection of freshwater animals will contain a high proportion of insects in the larval or nymphal stage,and a number of these cannot, at present, be named with certainty. The work of many biologists, whether their interest be in ecology, physiology or the food of fish, is affected bythis gap in our knowledge, and the importance of closing it need not be stressed. It is the belief of the Freshwater Biological Association that, with sufficient co-operation from workers in other parts of the country, it should be possible, within a few years, to produce keys for the identificationof the aquatic stages of all the important groups, except the Diptera. The purpose of this article is to appeal for thisco-operation, to which end it includes brief notes on the existing systematic literature of the various groups and a short account of some of the methods of rearing adults from their nymphs or larvae."
