https://openalex.org/W2161224111,"DNA methylation is essential for normal development and has been implicated in many pathologies including cancer. Our knowledge about the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation, how it changes during cellular differentiation and how it relates to histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally, the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2004582874,"TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1) has a crucial role in the regulation of cell growth and size. A wide range of signals, including amino acids, is known to activate TORC1. Here, we report the identification of Rag GTPases as activators of TORC1 in response to amino acid signals. Knockdown of Rag gene expression suppressed the stimulatory effect of amino acids on TORC1 in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. Expression of constitutively active (GTP-bound) Rag in mammalian cells activated TORC1 in the absence of amino acids, whereas expression of dominant-negative Rag blocked the stimulatory effects of amino acids on TORC1. Genetic studies in Drosophila also show that Rag GTPases regulate cell growth, autophagy and animal viability during starvation. Our studies establish a function of Rag GTPases in TORC1 activation in response to amino acid signals."

https://openalex.org/W2051497876,"A simple negative feedback loop of interacting genes or proteins has the potential to generate sustained oscillations. However, many biological oscillators also have a positive feedback loop, raising the question of what advantages the extra loop imparts. Through computational studies, we show that it is generally difficult to adjust a negative feedback oscillator's frequency without compromising its amplitude, whereas with positive-plus-negative feedback, one can achieve a widely tunable frequency and near-constant amplitude. This tunability makes the latter design suitable for biological rhythms like heartbeats and cell cycles that need to provide a constant output over a range of frequencies. Positive-plus-negative oscillators also appear to be more robust and easier to evolve, rationalizing why they are found in contexts where an adjustable frequency is unimportant."
https://openalex.org/W2052918792,"To determine how spatial scale is represented in the pyramidal cell population of the hippocampus, we recorded neural activity at multiple longitudinal levels of this brain area while rats ran back and forth on an 18-meter-long linear track. CA3 cells had well-defined place fields at all levels. The scale of representation increased almost linearly from &lt;1 meter at the dorsal pole to ∼10 meters at the ventral pole. The results suggest that the place-cell map includes the entire hippocampus and that environments are represented in the hippocampus at a topographically graded but finite continuum of scales."
https://openalex.org/W2093559267,"Protected areas (PAs) have long been criticized as creations of and for an elite few, where associated costs, but few benefits, are borne by marginalized rural communities. Contrary to predictions of this argument, we found that average human population growth rates on the borders of 306 PAs in 45 countries in Africa and Latin America were nearly double average rural growth, suggesting that PAs attract, rather than repel, human settlement. Higher population growth on PA edges is evident across ecoregions, countries, and continents and is correlated positively with international donor investment in national conservation programs and an index of park-related funding. These findings provide insight on the value of PAs for local people, but also highlight a looming threat to PA effectiveness and biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1968548830,"The anion-exchange ability of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) has been exploited to create materials for use in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. The specific cation arrangements in the hydroxide layers of hydrotalcite-like LDHs, of general formula Mg 2+ 1– x Al 3+ x OH 2 (Anion n– x / n )· y H 2 O, have, however, remained elusive, and their elucidation could enhance the functional optimization of these materials. We applied rapid (60 kilohertz) magic angle spinning (MAS) to obtain high-resolution hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectra and characterize the magnesium and aluminum distribution. These data, in combination with 1 H- 27 Al double-resonance and 25 Mg triple-quantum MAS NMR data, show that the cations are fully ordered for magnesium:aluminum ratios of 2:1 and that at lower aluminum content, a nonrandom distribution of cations persists, with no Al 3+ -Al 3+ close contacts. The application of rapid MAS NMR methods to investigate proton distributions in a wide range of materials is readily envisaged."

https://openalex.org/W2025824234,"After fertilization, maternal proteins in oocytes are degraded and new proteins encoded by the zygotic genome are synthesized. We found that autophagy, a process for the degradation of cytoplasmic constituents in the lysosome, plays a critical role during this period. Autophagy was triggered by fertilization and up-regulated in early mouse embryos. Autophagy-defective oocytes derived from oocyte-specific Atg5 (autophagy-related 5) knockout mice failed to develop beyond the four- and eight-cell stages if they were fertilized by Atg5-null sperm, but could develop if they were fertilized by wild-type sperm. Protein synthesis rates were reduced in the autophagy-null embryos. Thus, autophagic degradation within early embryos is essential for preimplantation development in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2081080245,"The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) mediates responses to cell danger and stress. When bound by its many ligands (which include advanced glycation endproducts, certain members of the S100/calgranulin family, extracellular high-mobility group box 1, the integrin Mac-1, amyloid beta-peptide and fibrils), RAGE activates programs responsible for acute and chronic inflammation. RAGE is therefore also involved in cancer progression, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. RAGE has several isoforms deriving from alternative splicing, including a soluble form called endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE). We show here that most soluble RAGE, either produced by cell lines or present in human blood, is not recognized by an anti-esRAGE antibody. Cells transfected with the cDNA for full-length RAGE, and thus not expressing esRAGE, produce a form of soluble RAGE, cleaved RAGE (cRAGE) that derives from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound molecules and acts as a decoy receptor. By screening chemical inhibitors and genetically modified mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we identify the sheddase ADAM10 as a membrane protease responsible for RAGE cleavage. Binding of its ligand HMGB1 promotes RAGE shedding. Our data do not disprove the interpretation that high levels of soluble forms of RAGE protect against chronic inflammation, but rather suggest that they correlate with high levels of ongoing inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2065470001,"Continuous Global Positioning System observations reveal rapid and large ice velocity fluctuations in the western ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Within days, ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4. Such a response is much stronger and much faster than previously reported. Over a longer period of 17 years, annual ice velocities have decreased slightly, which suggests that the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input, which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years. The positive-feedback mechanism between melt rate and ice velocity appears to be a seasonal process that may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades."
https://openalex.org/W2156833447,"Sarcomeres are the basic contractile units of striated muscle. Uncovering how sarcomeres change length and develop force is fundamental to understanding biomechanics, muscle physiology, and neuromuscular control. Llewellyn et al. describe the use of optical microendoscopy to visualize sarcomeres and their micrometre-scale motions in live mice and humans, revealing unanticipated local variations in sarcomere lengths. Imaging of human sarcomeres is expected to enable advances in biomechanical modelling, orthopaedic therapeutics, and the understanding and treatment of neuromuscular disorders. This paper describes the use of optical microendoscopy to visualize sarcomeres and their micron-scale motions in live mice and humans, revealing unanticipated local variations in sarcomere lengths. Imaging of human sarcomeres is expected to enable advances in biomechanical modelling, orthopedic therapeutics, and the understanding and treatment of neuromuscular disorders Sarcomeres are the basic contractile units of striated muscle. Our knowledge about sarcomere dynamics has primarily come from in vitro studies of muscle fibres1 and analysis of optical diffraction patterns obtained from living muscles2,3. Both approaches involve highly invasive procedures and neither allows examination of individual sarcomeres in live subjects. Here we report direct visualization of individual sarcomeres and their dynamical length variations using minimally invasive optical microendoscopy4 to observe second-harmonic frequencies of light generated in the muscle fibres5,6 of live mice and humans. Using microendoscopes as small as 350 μm in diameter, we imaged individual sarcomeres in both passive and activated muscle. Our measurements permit in vivo characterization of sarcomere length changes that occur with alterations in body posture and visualization of local variations in sarcomere length not apparent in aggregate length determinations. High-speed data acquisition enabled observation of sarcomere contractile dynamics with millisecond-scale resolution. These experiments point the way to in vivo imaging studies demonstrating how sarcomere performance varies with physical conditioning and physiological state, as well as imaging diagnostics revealing how neuromuscular diseases affect contractile dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2018272303,"Phototaxis behavior is commonly observed in animals with light-sensing organs. C. elegans, however, is generally believed to lack phototaxis, as this animal lives in darkness (soil) and does not possess eyes. Here, we found that light stimuli elicited negative phototaxis in C. elegans and that this behavior is important for survival. We identified a group of ciliary sensory neurons as candidate photoreceptor cells for mediating phototaxis. Furthermore, we found that light excited photoreceptor cells by evoking a depolarizing conductance carried by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-sensitive cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, revealing a conservation in phototransduction between worms and vertebrates. These results identify a new sensory modality in C. elegans and suggest that animals living in dark environments without light-sensing organs may not be presumed to be light insensitive. We propose that urbilaterians, the last common ancestor of bilaterians, might have already evolved a visual system that employs CNG channels and the second messenger cGMP for phototransduction."
https://openalex.org/W2003500217,"Vasopressin controls water excretion through regulation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) trafficking in renal collecting duct cells. Using mass spectrometry, we previously demonstrated four phosphorylated serines (Ser256, Ser261, Ser264, and Ser269) in the carboxyl-terminal tail of rat AQP2. Here, we used phospho-specific antibodies and protein mass spectrometry to investigate the roles of vasopressin and cyclic AMP in the regulation of phosphorylation at Ser269 and addressed the role of this site in AQP2 trafficking. The V2 receptor-specific vasopressin analog dDAVP increased Ser(P)269-AQP2 abundance more than 10-fold, but at a rate much slower than the corresponding increase in Ser256 phosphorylation. Vasopressin-mediated changes in phosphorylation at both sites were mimicked by cAMP addition and inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) antagonists. In vitro kinase assays, however, demonstrated that PKA phosphorylates Ser256, but not Ser269. Phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser269 did not occur when Ser256 was replaced by an unphosphorylatable amino acid, as seen in both S256L-AQP2 mutant mice and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing an S256A mutant, suggesting that Ser269 phosphorylation depends upon prior phosphorylation at Ser256. Immunogold electron microscopy localized Ser(P)269-AQP2 solely in the apical plasma membrane of rat collecting duct cells, in contrast to the other three phospho-forms (found in both apical plasma membrane and intracellular vesicles). Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing an S269D “phosphomimic” AQP2 mutant showed constitutive localization at the plasma membrane. The data support a model in which vasopressin-mediated phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser269:(a) depends on prior PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser256 and (b) enhances apical plasma membrane retention of AQP2.

Aquaporins are molecular water channels that mediate rapid water transport across lipid membranes in a variety of cell types (1Kozono D. Yasui M. King L.S. Agre P. J. Clin.

AQP2-mediated osmotic water transport from the lumens of the renal collecting ducts returns filtered water to the bloodstream under the control of the peptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). This control is exerted through binding of AVP to the V2 receptor (a G protein-coupled receptor) in the collecting duct cells. The V2 receptor, working via Gs-mediated elevation of intracellular cAMP, increases epithelial osmotic water permeability via regulated trafficking of AQP2-containing intracellular vesicles to and from the apical plasma membrane (3Nielsen S.

This process is impaired in several common disorders of water balance (2Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol.

Exo- and endocytosis of AQP2 are believed to be independently regulated, and the amount of AQP2 in the plasma membrane is dependent on a balance between the two processes (4Knepper M.A. Nielsen S.

Recently, we have demonstrated by phosphoproteomic analysis of native rat renal inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells that Ser256 is part of a polyphosphorylated region containing four phosphorylated serines (Ser256, Ser261, Ser264, and Ser269) within the last 16 amino acids of the AQP2 COOH-terminal tail (10Hoffert J.D.

Prior studies have established that the abundance of the Ser256-phosphorylated form of AQP2 is increased in response to AVP (11Nishimoto G. Zelenina M. Li D. Yasui M. Aperia A. Nielsen S. Nairn A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F254-F259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that the Ser261 phosphorylation of AQP2 is decreased (12Hoffert J.D. Nielsen J. Yu M.J. Pisitkun T. Schleicher S.M. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F691-F700Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas Ser264 phosphorylation is increased by AVP (13Fenton R.A. Moeller H.B. Hoffert J.D. Yu M.-J. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3134-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The role of the Ser269 phosphorylation site in AQP2 trafficking has not been investigated. In this study, we use a novel phospho-specific antibody to Ser(P)269-AQP2, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), site-directed mutagenesis in MDCK cells, as well as mice expressing mutant forms of AQP2 to investigate the role of AQP2 phosphorylation at Ser269 in regulated trafficking of AQP2. The findings show that vasopressin markedly increases Ser269-AQP2 phosphorylation and that this phosphorylated form is localized exclusively in the apical plasma membrane of collecting duct cells. Studies using site-directed mutagenesis in MDCK cells support the hypothesis that Ser269 phosphorylation serves as a plasma membrane retention signal. The results also indicate that dependence of Ser269-AQP2 phosphorylation on protein kinase A (PKA) is indirect and is due to requirement for a PKA-dependent “priming” phosphorylation at Ser256 prior to Ser269 phosphorylation. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing Ser(P)256-AQP2 (11Nishimoto G. Zelenina M. Li D. Yasui M. Aperia A. Nielsen S. Nairn A.C. Am. J.

Here, an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to Ser(P)269-AQP2 was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of rat AQP2 that included Ser(P)269 (PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CA) as described (12Hoffert J.D.

Specificity was documented by dot blotting against synthetic phosphopeptides and non-phosphopeptides (supplemental Fig. S1). A goat polyclonal antibody directed against the amino terminus of AQP2 (N-20; Santa Cruz) recognizes all known modified forms of AQP2. Another antibody recognizing total AQP2 (L127) has been described previously (14DiGiovanni S.R. Nielsen S. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8984-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). A new antibody recognizing all forms of AQP2 investigated in this paper was created using a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids in the COOH terminus upstream from the polyphosphorylated region of rat AQP2 (CLKGLEPDTDWEEREVRRRQ) as described (15Knepper M.A. Masilamani S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2001; 173: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The antiserum (K5007) was affinity purified using the synthetic peptide linked to agarose beads (Sulfo-Link; Pierce). A 1:5000 dilution was used for the immunoblotting. Data-dependent Mode—The samples were trypsinized, and the phosphopeptides were enriched by immobilized metal affinity chromatography exactly as described (10Hoffert J.D. Pisitkun T. Wang G. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7159-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). They were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system (Palo Alto, CA) connected to an LTQ-FT hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo, San Jose, CA) run in “neutral loss scanning” mode as described (10Hoffert J.D.

Label-free phosphopeptide quantification was performed as described (16Hoffert J.D. Wang G. Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) Mode—Freshly isolated rat IMCD suspensions were prepared as above and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 nm of dDAVP (synthetic analog of vasopressin) for 0, 5, and 30 min. Upon reaction, the cell suspensions were flash lysed in 6 m guanidine HCl, and a standard reduction/alkylation and enzymatic digestion (trypsin or chymotrypsin) protocols were carried out as previously described (12Hoffert J.D. Nielsen J. Yu M.J. Pisitkun T. Schleicher S.M. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F691-F700Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) except that immobilized metal affinity chromatography was not used. The samples were subjected to nanoLC using the TEMPO™ nanoMDLC System and PepMap100 C18, 75 μm × 5 μm × 15 cm nanoLC column (Dionex LC Packings). The chromatographic method employed a 10-min on-line trapping and desalting step followed by a 1-h 5–40% mobile B gradient (mobile B = 98% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). The samples were analyzed on the 4000 QTrap™ system by a MRM-triggered MS/MS information-dependent acquisition. Several MRM transitions for each phosphorylated form of the AQP2 COOH-terminal peptide were designed and optimized using MRM Pilot™ 0.9 beta software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Q1 to Q3 transitions were generated to encompass both the characteristic H3PO4 neutral loss fragments and distinguishable peptide backbone fragments for Ser(P)256, Ser(P)261, Ser(P)264, Ser(P)269, and nonphosphorylated forms of the AQP2 COOH-terminal tail peptide. Triplicate data sets of both untreated and 5–30-min vasopressin-treated IMCD lysates were submitted to MultiQuant™ 1.0 software (Applied Biosystems) to quantitate the MRM profiles of all COOH-terminal phosphopeptides of AQP2. MRM traces were matched for retention time, and areas were integrated for relative quantitation between controls and vasopressin-treated samples. IMCD tubule suspensions were prepared from kidneys of rats (Sprague-Dawley strain, NHLBI animal protocol H-0110) as described (17Chou C.L. DiGiovanni S.R. Luther A. Lolait S.J. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F78-F85Google Scholar). Suspensions were incubated for the designated time periods in the absence or presence of 1 nm [deamino-Cys,1D-Arg8]vasopressin (dDAVP) or 0.1 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (cpt-cAMP). In some experiments, H-89 (10 μm) was included for a 20-min preincubation prior to addition of cpt-cAMP to assess the effect of PKA inhibition. In osmotic stress experiments, IMCD suspensions were incubated in either isotonic (290 mOsm) or hypertonic (490 mOsm, addition of NaCl) medium. After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 s and resuspended in 1× sample buffer (1.5% SDS, Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), followed by DNA shearing via QIAShredder column (Qiagen) and immunoblotted as described (14DiGiovanni S.R. Nielsen S. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8984-8988Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), with reagent and protocol modifications based on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LiCor, Lincoln, NE). Three microgram aliquots of a synthetic, unmodified AQP2 carboxyl-terminal peptide (Anaspec, EPDTDWEEREVRRRQSVELHSPQSLPRGSKA) or the same peptide prephosphorylated at Ser256 were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 0.1 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and each of the following kinases: 60 ng of PKA, 200 ng of ERK1, 400 ng of p38α, 300 ng of JNK1, 300 ng of Cdk1, 200 ng of Cdk5 plus 60 units of Cdk5 activator, 100 ng of protein kinase Cα. All of the kinases were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Phosphorylation of the peptide was assessed by both LC-MS/MS (data-dependent mode, described above) and immunoblotting. To stop the reaction, Laemmli solubilization buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) was added to the peptide/kinase incubation product. The mixture was heated to 60 °C for 10 min and was run on 4–15% gradient gels for immunoblotting as described (14DiGiovanni S.R. Nielsen S. Christensen E.I. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total AQP2 peptide was detected using the AQP2 COOH-terminal antibody (K5007), whereas the various phosphorylated forms of the AQP2 peptide were detected with appropriate phospho-specific AQP2 antibodies. Ten-day-old homozygotic mice with an S256L mutation (19McDill B.W. Li S.Z. Kovach P.A. Ding L. Chen F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6952-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and WT control mice from the same litters were injected intraperitoneally with dDAVP (4 μl/g of body weight of a 2 μm solution in water). After 45 min, the right kidney was removed and immersion fixed in 10% formalin. Kidneys were processed for immunohistochemistry as described (20Frokiaer J. Marples D. Valtin H. Morris J.F. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F179-F190PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous Brattleboro rats had free access to standard rat chow and water before the experiment. Four rats were treated with intramuscular injection of 5 ng of dDAVP in 50 μl of saline/animal, and four saline-injected rats served as controls. After 30 min, the rats were anesthetized, and the kidneys were perfusion fixed through the abdominal aorta with 3% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The kidneys were perfusion fixed, cryoprotected in 2.3 m sucrose, frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in Lowicryl, and immunogold-labeled as previously described (20Frokiaer J. Marples D. Valtin H. Morris J.F. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F179-F190PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown to confluency on semi-permeable supports, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 m PBS for 20 min at room temperature, layered with gelatin, cryo-protected with 2.3 m sucrose, mounted on holders, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunogold electron microscopy was performed on thin (80-nm) cryo-sections (Reichert Ultracut S cryo-ultramicrotome, Leica) with an antibody (N-20) that recognizes total AQP2. A cDNA for aquaporin-2 was created by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse inner medulla cDNA, cloned into the vector pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations into AQP2 at positions Ser256 and Ser269 by standard methods. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Stable cell lines were generated using the Flp-In™ system (Invitrogen). The MDCK host cell line containing one FRT site (21Frohlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was transfected with aquaporin-2 constructs using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected using 500 μg/ml hygromycin. Clonal cell lines were subjected to reverse transcription-PCR followed by sequencing to confirm their identity. A minimum of two cell lines expressing the same protein were selected for further studies. With this system, all cell lines contain a single copy of AQP2 inserted into an identical position in the genome. Stably transfected cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% donor bovine serum, 100 IU/ml each of penicillin, streptomycin, and hygromycin (250 μg/ml). Cells seeded on semi-permeable supports (0.02 μm; Nunc) were grown to confluence in hygromycin-free medium. From 24 h before experiments, all of the media contained 10 μm indomethacin. The cells were incubated in serum- and antibiotic-free media for 1 h followed by 25 μm forskolin for 30 min at 37 °C. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, washed in PBS, permeabilized for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The filters were incubated with 1:1000 goat anti-AQP2 (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (1:1000; Molecular Probes). The filters were washed in PBS and mounted on glass slides using Glycergel mounting medium (Dako). A Leica TCS SL confocal microscope was used for imaging of the cells. Image stacks were taken using a 63× oil objective lens and a z distance of 0.3 μm between images. Time Course of Vasopressin-induced AQP2 Polyphosphorylation—The terminal 30 amino acids of the AQP2 COOH-terminal tail (amino acids 242–271) are shown in Fig. 1A, indicating the four phosphorylated amino acids (10Hoffert J.D.

A phospho-specific antibody was produced against Ser(P)269-AQP2, complementing our existing antibodies against total AQP2, Ser(P)256-AQP2 (11Nishimoto G. Zelenina M. Li D. Yasui M. Aperia A. Nielsen S. Nairn A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F254-F259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ser(P)261-AQP2 (12Hoffert J.D. Nielsen J. Yu M.J. Pisitkun T. Schleicher S.M. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F691-F700Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and Ser(P)264-AQP2 (13Fenton R.A. Moeller H.B. Hoffert J.D. Yu M.-J. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3134-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of rat IMCD tubule suspensions in the absence and presence of V2 vasopressin receptor agonist dDAVP demonstrated a >10-fold increase in phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser269 (Fig. 1B). The time course of this increase is compared with vasopressin-induced changes at the other three phosphorylation sites in Fig. 1B (see supplemental Fig. S2 for examples of the original immunoblots). As we previously reported (12Hoffert J.D. Nielsen J. Yu M.J. Pisitkun T. Schleicher S.M. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: F691-F700Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), dDAVP rapidly increases AQP2 phosphorylation at Ser256 (t½ = 41 s), whereas phosphorylation at Ser261 falls following AVP exposure (t½ = 10.6 min). dDAVP-induced increases in phosphorylation at Ser264 occurred with a t½ of 4.2 min, and the increase in phosphorylation at Ser269 occurred with a t½ of 3.2 min. Thus, the vasopressin-mediated increase in AQP2 phosphorylation at both Ser264 and Ser269 occurred significantly more slowly than the increase in Ser256 phosphorylation. Role of Cyclic AMP and PKA in Vasopressin-induced AQP2 Polyphosphorylation—Binding of AVP to V2 receptors triggers an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (2Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Marples D. Kwon T.H. Agre P. Knepper M.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 205-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). When rat IMCD cell suspensions were exposed to the cyclic AMP analog cpt-cAMP, the entire sequence of phosphorylation events observed with dDAVP was recapitulated (Fig. 1C), indicating that all phosphorylation changes in response to vasopressin are downstream from cyclic AMP-dependent steps (see supplemental Fig. S2 for examples of the original immunoblots). We conclude that vasopressin, acting through an increase in intracellular cAMP concentration, regulates phosphorylation at all four serines in a distinct time-dependent manner. cpt-cAMP-induced phosphorylation at Ser256, Ser264, and Ser269 was markedly reduced by the PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 1D). When a nonphosphorylated synthetic peptide corresponding to the polyphosphorylated region of the AQP2 COOH-terminal tail was incubated with PKA in the presence of ATP in vitro, phosphorylation at Ser256 occurred, as demonstrated both by immunoblotting with the phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 1E) and by LC-MS/MS analysis (not shown). However, PKA-induced phosphorylation at the other three sites was not detectable in vitro. Similarly, when a synthetic peptide prephosphorylated at Ser256 was incubated with PKA, no downstream phosphorylation was detectable. Thus, PKA is likely to be responsible for the phosphorylation at Ser256 but does not appear to phosphorylate the other sites directly. Control incubations of synthetic AQP2 COOH-terminal peptides with several other kinases (ERK1, p38α, JNK1, Cdk1, and Cdk5) did not result in phosphorylation, whereas protein kinase Cα produced only a faint signal at Ser256 (supplemental Fig. S3). Does Phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser264 and Ser269 Depend on Prior Phosphorylation at Ser256?—The inhibition of AQP2 phosphorylation at Ser264 and Ser269 by the PKA inhibitor H-89 could be explained if the downstream phosphorylation events were mediated by other kinases but had a requirement for prior PKA-mediated phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser256. To address this possibility, we performed immunolabeling, using the phospho-specific antibodies, on kidney sections from mice with a spontaneous S256L-AQP2 mutation (19McDill B.W. Li S.Z. Kovach P.A. Ding L. Chen F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6952-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the hypothesis, there was an absence of labeling for Ser(P)264-AQP2 or Ser(P)269-AQP2 in S256L-AQP2 mice, either with or without dDAVP administration. Furthermore, dDAVP administration resulted in increased Ser(P)261 labeling in contrast to the decrease seen in WT mice (Fig. 2A) and in rat IMCD suspensions (Fig. 1B). To test the hypothesis further, MDCK cells were stably transfected with either WT-AQP2 or AQP2 with an S256A mutation. The AQP2-S256A mutation resulted in an elimination of detectable Ser264 or Ser269 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). In contrast, WT-AQP2 MDCK cells manifested abundant phosphorylation at both Ser264 and Ser269. Overall, the data from the S256L substitution in mice and the S256A substitution in MDCK cells are compatible with the view that Ser256 phosphorylation is required for downstream phosphorylation at both Ser264 and Ser269. Quantification of Multiply Phosphorylated Forms of AQP2 Using Mass Spectrometry—Phospho-specific antibodies have the limitation that they cannot give information about what phosphorylated amino acids are found in combination. To address what multiply phosphorylated forms of AQP2 are present and how they change in response to the vasopressin analog dDAVP, we used protein mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). Previous studies have demonstrated that dDAVP-treated IMCD cells contain readily detectable quantities of AQP2 singly phosphorylated at Ser256 or Ser261 (10Hoffert J.D. Pisitkun T. Wang G. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7159-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), doubly phosphorylated at Ser256 and Ser261 (10Hoffert J.D. Pisitkun T. Wang G. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7159-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and triply phosphorylated at Ser256, Ser261, and Ser264 (16Hoffert J.D. Wang G. Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To detect and quantify Ser269-phosphorylated AQP2 peptides in the rat IMCD using LC-MS/MS in a data-dependent mode, we took advantage of the fact that a missed trypsin cleavage at Arg267 (Fig. 1A) produces peptides that contain all four phosphorylation sites. Using an LTQ-FTICR LC-MS/MS system (Thermo, San Jose), two multiply phosphorylated forms that included Ser(P)269 were detected at the MS4 level, namely Ser(P)256/Ser(P)261/Ser(P)269-AQP2 (Fig. 3) and Ser(P)256/Ser(P)269-AQP2 (supplemental Fig. S4). Based on integration under the curves representing reconstructed ion chromatograms (see Fig. 3B for an example), the abundance of both phosphopeptides appeared to be substantially increased in response to dDAVP. Despite repeated analyses of rat IMCD homogenates, we could not detect AQP2 peptides that were phosphorylated at Ser269 but not at Ser256. To quantify AQP2 tryptic phosphopeptides, we used targeted LC-MS/MS (multiple reaction monitoring or MRM). In contrast to the data-dependent approach (previous paragraph), MRM ignores all peptides other than those with preset MS1 and MS2 mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios, thereby assuring that a given peptide can be successfully quantified in each experiment (22Pisitkun T. Hoffert J.D. Yu M.J. Knepper M.A. Physiol. (Bethesda). 2007; 22: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), permitting statistical analysis of the results. We carried out MRM in a triple quadrupole-based LC-MS/MS system (QTrap 4000, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to sequence and quantify several AQP2 tryptic phosphopeptides from rat IMCD suspensions incubated for 0, 5, or 30 min with dDAVP after an initial equilibration period (Fig. 3C). The MRM results confirmed our prior observations that dDAVP decreases the abundance of Ser261 monophosphoryla"
https://openalex.org/W2069314092,"The ability to sense molecular tension is crucial for a wide array of cellular processes, including the detection of auditory stimuli, control of cell shape, and internalization and transport of membranes. We show that myosin I, a motor protein that has been implicated in powering key steps in these processes, dramatically alters its motile properties in response to tension. We measured the displacement generated by single myosin I molecules, and we determined the actin-attachment kinetics with varying tensions using an optical trap. The rate of myosin I detachment from actin decreases >75-fold under tension of 2 piconewtons or less, resulting in myosin I transitioning from a low (<0.2) to a high (>0.9) duty-ratio motor. This impressive tension sensitivity supports a role for myosin I as a molecular force sensor."
https://openalex.org/W2101636354,"Spatial attention works to modulate neuronal responses as early as V1, according to this study. Using electrophysiological recordings in monkey primary visual cortex, the authors found that there are two distinct cell populations (differentiated by direction selectivity, spike width, interspike interval distribution and contrast sensitivity) whose responses are either suppressed or enhanced by attention. Spatial attention enhances our ability to detect stimuli at restricted regions of the visual field. This enhancement is thought to depend on the difficulty of the task being performed, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms for this dependency remain largely unknown. We found that task difficulty modulates neuronal firing rate at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing (area V1) in monkey (Macaca mulatta). These modulations were spatially specific: increasing task difficulty enhanced V1 neuronal firing rate at the focus of attention and suppressed it in regions surrounding the focus. Moreover, we found that response enhancement and suppression are mediated by distinct populations of neurons that differ in direction selectivity, spike width, interspike-interval distribution and contrast sensitivity. Our results provide strong support for center-surround models of spatial attention and suggest that task difficulty modulates the activity of specific populations of neurons in the primary visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2053362173,"Detailed understanding of growth mechanisms in organic thin-film deposition is crucial for tailoring growth morphologies, which in turn determine the physical properties of the resulting films. For growth of the rodlike molecule para -sexiphenyl, the evolution of terraced mounds is observed by atomic force microscopy. Using methods established in inorganic epitaxy, we demonstrate the existence of an additional barrier (0.67 electron volt) for step-edge crossing—the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. This result was confirmed by transition state theory, which revealed a bending of the molecule at the step edge. A gradual reduction of this barrier in the first layers led to an almost layer-by-layer growth during early deposition stage. The reported phenomena are a direct consequence of the complexity of the molecular building blocks versus atomic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2150047753,"The Notch1 gene has an important role in mammalian cell-fate decision and tumorigenesis. Upstream control mechanisms for transcription of this gene are still poorly understood. In a chemical genetics screen for small molecule activators of Notch signalling, we identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a key negative regulator of Notch1 gene expression in primary human keratinocytes, intact epidermis and skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). The underlying mechanism for negative control of the Notch1 gene in human cells, as well as in a mouse model of EGFR-dependent skin carcinogenesis, involves transcriptional suppression of p53 by the EGFR effector c-Jun. Suppression of Notch signalling in cancer cells counteracts the differentiation-inducing effects of EGFR inhibitors while, at the same time, synergizing with these compounds in induction of apoptosis. Thus, our data reveal a key role of EGFR signalling in the negative regulation of Notch1 gene transcription, of potential relevance for combinatory approaches for cancer therapy."

Alkylating compounds are ubiquitous and modify cellular macromolecules such as DNA and RNA. In the human environment, tobacco-specific nitrosamines are probably the major source (1Drabløs F. Feyzi E.

Various cellular defense mechanisms counteract the deleterious effects of alkylating agents (2Sedgwick B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For instance, Escherichia coli induces the expression of a set of genes involved in DNA repair after exposure to low doses of alkylating agents (3Sedgwick B. Lindahl T.

As part of this adaptive response, the inducible E. coli AlkB protein protects the cells against harmful effects of methylating agents (4Kataoka H. Yamamoto Y. Sekiguchi M. J.

Importantly, tRNA and rRNA carry numerous natural N-methylations that may be important for structure, stability, and function (9Rozenski J. Crain P.F. McCloskey J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 196-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Many of these, e.g. 3-methylcytosine, are chemically identical to aberrant methylations. However, unlike aberrant methylations, natural methylations are located in distinct sequences. It is unknown whether demethylation has a role in regulating functions of RNA. In addition, numerous N-methylations in Lys and Arg residues of proteins, e.g. histone 3 and histone 4, are also known and these are important in regulation of transcriptional activities. Recently, oxidative demethylation of arginine in histones was demonstrated to be carried out by an enzyme related to those in the AlkB family (10Chang B. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Bruick R.K.

Sikandar S. Witherspoon M. Dizon D. Nguyen T. Benirschke K. Wiley C. Vrana P. Lipkin S.M. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the widely expressed hABH1 is a mitochondrial demethylase that demethylates 3-meC, but not 1-meA, in DNA and RNA. The repair activity is lower than that of AlkB, hABH2, and hABH3, and it cannot be ruled out that hABH1 may have additional substrates. Earlier failure to detect demethylase activity may be due to difficulties in purifying an active form of the enzyme. Recently, results from a mouse model deficient in mAbh1 demonstrated a role of Abh1 in development, probably at the epigenetic level (16Pan Z. Sikandar S. Witherspoon M. Dizon D. Nguyen T. Benirschke K. Wiley C. Vrana P. Lipkin S.M. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that hABH1 also is a mitochondrial DNA/RNA demethylase, indicating that mammalian ABH1 may have dual roles in nuclei and mitochondria. Molecular Cloning—hABH1 cDNA (IMAGE ID 3854233) was amplified by PCR using primers containing appropriate restriction sites. The open reading frame of the IMAGE 3854233 clone lacked the codons for the three N-terminal amino acids (MGK), see GenBank™ accession number AC008044 and cDNA data base entries (e.g. NM_006020). Therefore, the protein product is referred to as hABH1(Δ3) (hABH1-(4-389)). A second primer was used to amplify the full-length hABH1. hABH1 and hABH1(Δ3) were subcloned into NdeI/NotI sites of pET28a (Novagen) and pTYB12 (Clontech), and EcoRI/XmaI-blunted pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). hABH1-(11-389) was amplified using appropriate primers and subcloned in pEYFP-N1 at AgeI/EcoRI site. To generate hABH1-(1-119)-EYFP, hABH1-pEYFP-N1 was cleaved with AflII, blunted, and recleaved with HindIII, and subcloned into Xma-blunted/HindIII site of pEYFP-N1. For site-directed mutagenesis we used the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Northern Hybridization—Multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech, number 7759-1/7760-1) were hybridized with 32P-end-labeled full-length cDNA probes of hABH1 or β-actin, according to the manufacturer's instructions and bands were visualized by phosphorimaging. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% gentamicin, and 0.5% Fungizone. For transfections we used a calcium phosphate-based transfection kit (Promega) or FuGENE 6 (Roche), and analyzed cells in a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 or Meta) as described (8Aas P.A. Otterlei M. Falnes P.O. Vaagbø C.B. Skorpen F. Akbari M. Sundheim O. Bjørås M. Slupphaug G. Seeberg E. Krokan H.E. Nature. 2003; 421: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HeLa cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde on ice for 10 min prior to addition of ice-cold methanol and incubation at -20 °C for 20 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal calf serum, monoclonal anti-hABH1 (Sigma) or polyclonal rabbit anti-human mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein antibodies (a marker of the outer mitochondrial membrane, Abcam) (17Yang Y. Liang Y. Qu L. Chen Z. Yi M. Li K. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 7253-7258Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After 3 washes, antibodies for double staining were added with further incubation for 1 h. Finally, the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor goat anti-mouse (GAM) 546 and Alexa Fluor goat anti-rabbit (GAR) 647 (Invitrogen), were added alone (single-staining) or together (double-staining). The cells were analyzed in a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM Meta) with excitation at 546 nm and detection between 560 and 615 nm (GAM), or excitation at 633 nm and detection at >650 nm (GAR). Subcellular Fractionation—Whole cell protein extract from HeLa cells was prepared as described (18Akbari M. Otterlei M. Peña-Diaz J. Aas P.A. Kavli B. Liabakk N.B. Hagen L. Imai K. Durandy A. Slupphaug G. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5486-5498Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To isolate nuclei, harvested cells were re-suspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm dithothreitol (DTT) and EDTA-free protease inhibitor Complete) and disrupted by a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 680 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 200 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, Complete®, Phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma)) and proteins extracted at 4 °C for 2 h. The extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Mitochondrial fractions were isolated essentially as described (19Akbari M. Otterlei M. Peña-Diaz J. Krokan H.E. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), except that cell debris was removed by centrifugation 3 times at 2000 × g for 10 min before the crude mitochondrial fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and further purified by MSH (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.21 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.75 mm spenmidine)/Percoll gradient centrifugation. The mitochondrial fraction was washed and resuspended in 1 ml of MSH buffer (19Akbari M. Otterlei M. Peña-Diaz J. Krokan H.E. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and treated with proteinase K or digitonin, as described below. To obtain crude mitochondrial protein extract, the pellet was resuspended in the extraction buffer and proteins extracted as described above. Freshly prepared mitochondria were treated with Proteinase K(0-3 μg/μg protein) at 37 °C for 30 min, then phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 5 mm and the protease inhibitor Complete® were added to inactivate proteinase K, denatured in NuPAGE LDS gel loading buffer (Invitrogen) at 90 °C for 15 min, and subjected to Western blotting. Alternatively, mitochondria were treated with digitonin (0-1 μg/μg of protein) on ice for 30 min, centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant collected. The pellet was washed once and resuspended in MSH. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis as described below. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon™, Millipore) (19Akbari M. Otterlei M. Peña-Diaz J. Krokan H.E. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-hABH1 (Sigma) or anti-hABH2 (Sigma), anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz), polyclonal anti-VDAC (Abcam), or anti-COX antibodies (Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h. Washed membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies, either peroxidase-labeled polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse or swine anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase. Chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal® West Femto Maximum, Pierce) was added and blots were developed in Image Station 2000R (Eastman Kodak Co.). Protein Purification—His-tagged AlkB, hABH1, and hABH3 were purified as described (8Aas P.A. Otterlei M. Falnes P.O. Vaagbø C.B. Skorpen F. Akbari M. Sundheim O. Bjørås M. Slupphaug G. Seeberg E. Krokan H.E. Nature. 2003; 421: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Intein-tagged hABH1(Δ3) and mutant proteins were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) RIPL or DE3 lysogens of HK82 (AlkB-deficient) (11Duncan T. Trewick S.C. Koivisto P. Bates P.A. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16660-16665Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. B. Sedgwick, Clare Hall Laboratories, United Kingdom) using the IMPACT-CN system (New England BioLabs). Cells were cultured at 37 °C, induced by 0.6 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 0.5-0.8, and further incubated at 18 °C for 16 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete), and disrupted by sonication. The centrifuged lysate was loaded onto a chitin column. The Intein tag was cleaved off on-column with 50 mm DTT at 4 °C for 40 h. The effluent containing hABH1 was filtered and dialyzed against 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, containing 30 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT prior to FPLC separation on a 1-ml Hitrap SP cation exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), using a linear salt gradient (0.05-1 m). rhABH1(Δ3) eluted at ∼0.15-0.3 m NaCl. One-liter cultures yielded ∼0.2 mg of >95% pure recombinant protein as confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The identity of the protein was confirmed both by Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry. Assay for Decarboxylation of 2OG—Decarboxylation of 2OG was assessed by monitoring the release of 14CO2 from 1-[14C]2OG (Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described (20Sabourin P.J. Bieber L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7468-7471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the enzyme, the reaction mixture contained 100 μm 2OG containing 10% 1-[14C]2OG (∼24,000 dpm, specific activity 54.5 mCi/mmol), 80 μm FeSO4(NH4)2SO4, 4 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.5 mg/ml catalase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. In each vial, a small tube containing 2 m hyamine hydroxide (150 μl) was placed without contact with the sample. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, following addition of 15 μl of trifluoroacetic acid (50%) and incubation on ice for 1 h. The released 14CO2 was collected in hyamine hydroxide and analyzed by scintillation counting. Chemical Methylation of Polynucleotides—[3H]Methyl-labeled poly(dA), poly(dC), poly(rA), or poly(rC) were prepared as described (5Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Methylnitrosourea-treated poly(rC) was prone to degradation, whereas the other substrates were stable. Alternatively, 0.3-1 mg of polynucleotides were dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and treated with 500 mm MMS at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were ethanol-precipitated, washed three times in 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Demethylase Assays—The proteins were incubated with methylated substrates in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm FeSO4(NH4)2SO4, 100 μm 2OG, and 4 mm ascorbic acid or DTT at 37 °C for 20-60 min, unless otherwise stated. Demethylation of Radiolabeled Substrates—[3H]Methyl-homopolymers poly(dA), poly(rA), and poly(dC) were used as substrates. After the reaction, the substrate was ethanol-precipitated and the ethanol-soluble supernatant analyzed by scintillation counting. The pellet was hydrolyzed in either 0.1 m HCl (poly(dA)) or 1 m HCl (poly(rA)) at 95 °C for 1 and 4 h, respectively. Poly(dC) was decomposed in formic acid at 170 °C for 30 min. The hydrolyzed substrates were analyzed using a cation exchange column (SCX-Partisil 10, Pharmacia Biosciences) connected to an HPLC system (Agilent) and run isocratically in 0.1 m ammonium formate, pH 3.6, containing 8% methanol (6Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and fractions analyzed by scintillation counting. The elution pattern was compared with that of non-labeled 1-meA or 3-meC detected by absorption at 260 nm. LC/MS/MS Analysis for Measuring Demethylation of DNA and RNA—MMS-treated DNA and RNA were incubated with hABH1(Δ3), hABH3, or AlkB as described above except using 10 μm Fe(II). The substrates were degraded enzymatically to deoxynucleosides or nucleosides and analyzed by LC/MS/MS using an Agilent HP1100 HPLC system interfaced an Applied Biosystems API4000 hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer, essentially as described (21Ringvoll J. Nordstrand L.M. Vaagbø C.B. Talstad V. Reite K. Aas P.A. Lauritzen K.H. Liabakk N.B. Bjørk A. Doughty R.W. Falnes P.O. Krokan H.E. Klungland A.

The oligodeoxynucleotide was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in DpnII reaction buffer (New England Biolabs), annealed to the complementary oligodeoxynucleotide and treated with 10 units of DpnII at 37 °C for 1 h. Substrate and product bands (49- and 22-mer) were separated by PAGE and fluorescence visualized using a Typhoon TRIO GE scanner. hABH1 Is a Widely Expressed Mitochondrial Protein—Northern blot analysis revealed that hABH1 is widely expressed in different human tissues at the mRNA level (Fig. 2A). The highest levels of mRNA were detected in skeletal muscle and heart, which are both rich in mitochondria. A major band of 2.3 kb was detected in all tissues, although at very low levels in peripheral blood leukocytes. In skeletal muscle three bands of sizes ∼0.9, 2.3, and 3 kb were detected. The weaker band of 3 kb was detected in several other organs. We are currently investigating whether the two extra transcripts observed in skeletal muscle and heart may represent cell-specific isoforms having particular functions in these organs. HeLa cells transiently expressing fluorescent hABH1-EYFP displayed accumulation of fluorescence in “rod-like” structures almost exclusively in the cytoplasm. Moreover, co-transfection experiments revealed that hABH1-EYFP co-localized with UNG1-ECFP (Fig. 2B). This form of uracil-DNA glycosylase (22Nilsen H. Otterlei M. Haug T. Solum K. Nagelhus T.A. Skorpen F. Krokan H.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), as well as the endogenous form (19Akbari M. Otterlei M. Peña-Diaz J. Krokan H.E. Neuroscience. 2007; 145: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), have previously been demonstrated to be located in mitochondria. C-terminal truncated hABH1-(1-119)-EYFP also sorted to mitochondria (Fig. 2C) as did hABH1-(4-389)-EYFP (data not shown), whereas a more fuzzy cytoplasmic localization was seen when the first 26 N-terminal amino acids were removed (Fig. 2C, hABH1-(27-389)-EYFP). These results indicate that the mitochondrial targeting signal is located in the N-terminal region of hABH1. Programs used to identify mitochondrial targeting signals failed to predict mitochondrial localization. However, when disregarding the 21 N-terminal residues, MitoProt II and Predotar predicted 87.5 and 66% probability for mitochondrial targeting, respectively. Furthermore, the N-terminal region 22AFRKLFR- FYRQSR34 is predicted to form an amphipathic helix with one positively charged and one hydrophobic face and may be part of the mitochondrial targeting signal. Furthermore, when the fluorescent tag was placed at the N-terminal end of hABH1, cytoplasmic fluorescence was diffuse and the largest fraction was found in the nucleus (EYFP-hABH1, Fig. 2C), probably due to negative interference with mitochondrial targeting. The C-terminal end contains a cluster of positive residues that may constitute a nuclear targeting signal (381KRAR384, see Fig. 4A). Immunocytochemistry using a monoclonal mouse anti-hABH1 antibody demonstrated that endogenous hABH1 colocalizes with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, Western blot analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear protein extracts confirmed that the endogenous hABH1 is apparently mitochondrial, in contrast to the nuclear protein hABH2 analyzed as a control (Fig. 3A). However, a faint band in the nuclear fraction indicated that a small fraction of hABH1 may be nuclear. After treatment of the cells for 4 h with 0.6 mm MMS, hABH1 remained predominantly mitochondrial (data not shown). To ensure that hABH1 is a genuine mitochondrial protein and not merely unspecifically attached to the outer surface, isolated mitochondria were treated with either Proteinase K (0-3.0 μg/μg of protein) to degrade proteins attached to the outer membrane, or digitonin (0-1.0 μg/μg of protein) to remove the mitochondrial outer membrane. Similar to the well established mitochondrial proteins VDAC and COX, endogenous hABH1 is quite resistant to treatment of the mitochondrial fraction with Proteinase K. However, whereas VDAC and COX are completely resistant, hABH1 in the mitochondrial fraction is slightly reduced by the treatment. In contrast, contaminating PCNA, as well as recombinant hABH1, were rapidly digested by the lowest concentrations of Proteinase K (Fig. 3B). Similarly, treatment with digitonin did not extract hABH1, VDAC, or COX, but readily solubilized PCNA (Fig. 3C). The amount of contaminating PCNA reflects its abundance in the cell and preponderance for unspecific binding to proteins. Together, these three approaches (transfection, immunocytochemistry, and subcellular fractionation) demonstrate that hABH1 is a genuine mitochondrial protein in HeLa cells and not just a contaminant attached unspecifically to the surface of mitochondria. It may be misleading to determine localization of a protein by transfection of fusion protein constructs alone. Comparison of AlkB and Human Homologs and Modeling of hABH1 Active Site—hABH1 contains the five perfectly conserved amino acids in the AlkB family that constitute the iron- and 2OG-binding motifs. In hABH1 the predicted iron-binding motif His231-X-Asp233-XnHis287 corresponds to His131-X-Asp133-Xn-His187 in AlkB (asterisks). Furthermore, in hABH1 and AlkB the predicted 2OG binding sequences are 338RXXXXXR344 and 204RXXXXXR210 (filled circles), respectively (Fig. 4A). The second Arg residue in the 2OG motif is only conserved in the AlkB family of dioxygenases (7Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0007.1-0007.8Crossref Google Scholar, 8Aas P.A. Otterlei M.

https://openalex.org/W1974338734,"Protein photosensors are versatile tools for studying ligand-regulated allostery and signaling. Fundamental to these processes is the amount of energy that can be provided by a photosensor to control downstream signaling events. Such regulation is exemplified by the phototropins—plant serine/threonine kinases that are activated by blue light via conserved LOV (light, oxygen and voltage) domains. The core photosensor of oat phototropin 1 is a LOV domain that interacts in a light-dependent fashion with an adjacent α-helix (Jα) to control kinase activity. We used solution NMR measurements to quantify the free energy of the LOV domain–Jα-helix binding equilibrium in the dark and lit states. These data indicate that light shifts this equilibrium by ∼3.8 kcal mol−1, thus quantifying the energy available through LOV-Jα for light-driven allosteric regulation. This study provides insight into the energetics of light sensing by phototropins and benchmark values for engineering photoswitchable systems based on the LOV-Jα interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2068092274,"Streptomycetes are exploited for production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, and there is much interest in enhancing the level of production of these metabolites. Secondary metabolites are synthesized in dedicated biosynthetic routes, but precursors and co-factors are derived from the primary metabolism. High level production of antibiotics in streptomycetes therefore requires engineering of the primary metabolism. Here we demonstrate this by targeting a key enzyme in glycolysis, phosphofructokinase, leading to improved antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Deletion of pfkA2 (SCO5426), one of three annotated pfkA homologues in S. coelicolor A3(2), resulted in a higher production of the pigmented antibiotics actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin. The pfkA2 deletion strain had an increased carbon flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, as measured by 13C metabolic flux analysis, establishing the ATP-dependent PfkA2 as a key player in determining the carbon flux distribution. The increased pentose phosphate pathway flux appeared largely because of accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, as experimentally observed in the mutant strain. Through genome-scale metabolic model simulations, we predicted that decreased phosphofructokinase activity leads to an increase in pentose phosphate pathway flux and in flux to pigmented antibiotics and pyruvate. Integrated analysis of gene expression data using a genome-scale metabolic model further revealed transcriptional changes in genes encoding redox co-factor-dependent enzymes as well as those encoding pentose phosphate pathway enzymes and enzymes involved in storage carbohydrate biosynthesis.

Streptomyces are well known for their production of biologically active secondary metabolites, with almost two-thirds of all known natural antibiotics being produced by Streptomyces. The best genetically characterized strain is Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), which produces pigmented antibiotics and has become the preferred model organism in Streptomyces research. Secondary metabolites are generally synthesized in dedicated biosynthetic pathways, but these are linked to the primary metabolism through the use of specific precursors and various cofactors. Although still largely unclear, the link between primary and secondary metabolism has been repeatedly observed (1Gunnarsson N. Eliasson A. Nielsen J. Adv. Biochem. Eng.

Thus, deletion of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoding gene gap1 improved clavulanic acid production in Streptomyces clavuligerus because of increased supply of precursor glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (4Li R. Townsend C.A. Metab. Eng. 2006; 8: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase acc in S. coelicolor improved the yield of actinorhodin, which uses the Acc product, malonyl-CoA, as a precursor for actinorhodin biosynthesis (5Ryu Y.G. Butler M.J. Chater K.F. Lee K.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 7132-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In another study deletion of important tricarboxylic acid cycle genes, such as citrate synthase (citA) or aconitase (acoA) in S. coelicolor, resulted in glutamate auxotrophy, overproduction of organic acids, as well as changes in secondary metabolite production and morphological differentiation (6Viollier P.H.

To further evaluate the link between primary and secondary metabolism, we decided to study the effect of phosphofructokinase (Pfk) 4The abbreviations used are: PfkphosphofructokinaseTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyRTreverse transcriptionqRTquantitative RTACTactinorhodinREDundecylprodigiosinEMPEmbden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathwayG6PDHglucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenaseSFLsummed fractional labelingPPPpentose phosphate pathway. deletion on secondary metabolism in S. coelicolor. Pfk is a highly regulated enzyme in the conserved Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP or glycolysis) catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer to the first position of the substrate fructose 6-phosphate (fructose-6-P). The enzyme generally employs ATP as the source of the phosphoryl group and is allosterically regulated, usually by a number of effectors. The reaction catalyzed by ATP-dependent Pfks is irreversible, and therefore the six-carbon sugars are confined to the subsequent glycolytic reactions once they passed the Pfk catalyzed step. Besides going to the EMP, glucose 6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) can also enter either the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or serve as a precursor for carbohydrate polymer biosynthesis. Alteration of the committing phosphofructokinase activity might influence the flux distribution at the glucose-6-P node. Therefore, Pfk is a high profile target for altering metabolic fluxes in the cell. phosphofructokinase 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography reverse transcription quantitative RT actinorhodin undecylprodigiosin Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase summed fractional labeling pentose phosphate pathway. The full genome sequence of S. coelicolor A3(2) (11Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Kieser H. Harper D. Bateman A. Brown S. Chandra G. Chen C.W. Collins M. Cronin A. Fraser A. Goble A. Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of three highly similar family A-type pfk genes (pfkA), SCO2119, SCO5426, and SCO1214, with 56–72% identity and 69–82% similarity at the amino acid level. This number of copies is large when compared with closely related, less developmentally complex actinomycetes like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (12Cole S.T. Barrell B.G. Novartis Found. Symp. 1998; 217: 160-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Camus J.C. Pryor M.J. Medigue C. Cole S.T.

Wiegrabe I. Tauch A. J. Biotechnol. 2003; 104: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), which both contain only one pfkA gene. The biological reason for the presence of multiple copies of primary metabolic genes such as pfk is not known, and there is little information available about the regulation of primary metabolic isoenzymes in S. coelicolor. For instance, it is not known whether expression of various isoenzymes is dependent on the developmental phase of a colony or whether the isoenzymes convey different kinetics. Previously, an. coelicolor PfkA enzyme had been purified and characterized as described by Alves et al. (15Alves A.M. Euverink G.J. Bibb M.J. Dijkhuizen L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 956-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ATP-dependent, allosterically controlled enzyme was linked to the pfkA1 gene (SCO2119). However, inspection of the original N-terminal sequence of the protein purified in that study revealed that the N-terminal sequence does not exactly fit that predicted for PfkA1 but has an identical match to the PfkA2 (SCO5426) enzyme N terminus (Table 1). In this study, we also report that PfkA2 is the only isoenzyme with detectable Pfk activity in S. coelicolor extracts, which further confirms that the enzyme studied by Alves et al. is indeed PfkA2 (15Alves A.M. Euverink G.J. Bibb M.J. Dijkhuizen L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 956-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5A. M. da Costa Rodrigues Alves, personal communication. TABLE 1Alignment of N-terminal sequences of all three S. coelicolor PfkA isoenzymes and the N-terminal sequence of the previously purified S. coelicolor ATP-dependent PfkA protein Open table in a new tab In this study we show that the deletion of pfkA2 drastically increases pigmented secondary metabolite production in S. coelicolor. For this reason we studied the effect of pfkA2 deletion on intracellular carbon fluxes, metabolite levels, gene expression, and secondary metabolite production to gain more insight in flux distribution and the link between the fluxes in the primary metabolism and secondary metabolism. Alignment—The alignment of N-terminal amino acid sequences of S. coelicolor PfkA isoenzymes, including the PfkA N terminus as determined by Alves et al. (15Alves A.M. Euverink G.J. Bibb M.J. Dijkhuizen L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 956-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was performed using ClustalX (16Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar). Strains—The S. coelicolor M145 (SCP1–, SCP2–) strain used for construction of the pfkA single gene deletions was kindly supplied by Matthias Redenbach. The ordered cosmid library made from this strain (17Redenbach M. Kieser H.M. Denapaite D. Eichner A. Cullum J. Kinashi H. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) was used in the S. coelicolor genome sequencing project (11Bentley S.D. Chater K.F. Cerdeno-Tarraga A.M. Challis G.L. Thomson N.R. James K.D. Harris D.E. Quail M.A. Kieser H. Harper D. Bateman A. Brown S. Chandra G. Chen C.W. Collins M. Cronin A. Fraser A. Goble A. Nature. 2002; 417: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2602) Google Scholar). Later genotyping of the strain indicated a possible duplication of 20 genes (SCO4672–4695) mostly coding for proteins of unknown function. No gene was found under-represented in this strain. The reference strain used for metabolic flux analysis was S. coelicolor M145, which was a gift from Mervyn Bibb, John Innes Centre, UK. To ensure that the unintended duplication in the Redenbach supplied parental strain did not influence the observed phenotype, we also have deleted pfkA2 in the reference M145 strain. No morphological differences between M145 and the Redenbach strain, or between the pfkA2 mutants thereof, were observed on plates or in liquid complex medium. Ten genes from the duplicated region, most of them assigned as hypothetical proteins, were found to be overexpressed in the Redenbach ΔpfkA2 mutant as compared with the reference M145. The single gene deletion mutants ΔpfkA1, ΔpfkA2, and ΔpfkA3 were constructed by λ-mediated recombination in Escherichia coli according to the REDIRECT protocol (18Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). The REDIRECT strategy is based on replacement of a chromosomal sequence within an S. coelicolor cosmid (17Redenbach M. Kieser H.M. Denapaite D. Eichner A. Cullum J. Kinashi H. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) by a selectable marker. This marker is PCR-generated using primers with 39-nucleotide homology extensions. These homology extensions are designed to match the immediate flanking regions of the genes targeted allowing stable in-frame, full-length gene replacements. The pfkA1 gene was fully replaced with a viomycin resistance cassette, which was amplified from plasmid pIJ780. The pfkA2 and pfkA3 genes were replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette generated by PCR from plasmid pIJ773. The primers used in this process are listed in Table 2. The strains were maintained on master plates of mannitol soy flour (MS) agar (19Kieser T. Bibb M. Buttner M. Chater K. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 408-414Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml apramycin/viomycin for the mutants. The spores from the master plates were streaked onto fresh MS plates, from which spores were harvested to make dense spore plates. The dense spore plates provided inocula for further studies.TABLE 2Nucleotide sequence of primers used for λRED-mediated deletion of the pfkA genes, of primers used for amplifying internal pfkA fragments in RT-PCR, and of primers used for qRT-PCR Open table in a new tab Batch Cultivations for Metabolic Flux Analysis and Transcription Analysis—Batch cultivations were performed in fermentors with 1 liter working volume (Applikon Biotechnology) at 30 °C, pH 6.8–7.0, 800 rpm agitation rate, and a 1 volume per volume per min aeration rate. The fermentors were equipped with a cooled condenser to avoid evaporation from the medium. pH was controlled by automatic addition of 1 n NaOH. The aeration rate was adjusted after every sampling to compensate for working volume reduction. The concentrations of CO2 and O2 were monitored by an acoustic gas analyzer (model number 1311, Bruël & Kjær). The defined minimal medium was limited in phosphate and contained 3 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm Na2SO4, 2 mm citric acid as chelating agent, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm CaCl2, as well as the following per liter: 20 g of glucose, 5 ml of trace elements solution (20 mm FeCl3, 10 mm CuCl2, 50 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.02 mm Na2MoO4, 20 mm CoCl2, 10 mm H3BO4), 1 ml of vitamins solution (0.05 g of biotin, 1 g of calcium pantothenate, 1 g of nicotinic acid, 25 g of myo-inositol, 1 g of thiamine-HCl, 1 g of pyridoxine-HCl, and 0.2 g of para-aminobenzoic acid/liter), and 100 μl of organic antifoam 204 (Sigma). All components, except glucose and vitamins, were added to the MilliQ water (Millipore) in the fermentor and autoclaved at 121 °C for 40 min. Glucose and vitamins were added after autoclaving, and pH adjustment was by sterile filtration. 30% of the added glucose for the labeled cultivations consisted of [1-13C]glucose (Omicron Biochemicals). The inoculum for each fermentor was prepared as follows: spores from one dense spore plate were harvested with 2 ml of 20% sterile glycerol, filtered through glass fiber wool to remove mycelial fragments, and inoculated into a 500-ml volume baffled shake flask with 50 ml of 2×YT medium (19Kieser T. Bibb M. Buttner M. Chater K. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 408-414Google Scholar) and 30 glass beads (3 mm diameter). The culture was incubated at 30 °C and 150 rpm agitation for 12 h, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 3–5 ml of residual liquid, and immediately inoculated into a fermentor. Analysis of Biomass Dry Weight—Throughout cultivation 12-ml samples were taken. Of these samples, 8 ml was filtered through pre-dried Supor®-450 membrane filters (0.45 μm pore, Pall Corp.). The filtrate was collected in a pre-cooled tube and kept at –20 °C until extracellular metabolite analysis. The cells were washed twice with 0.9% sodium chloride and dried in a microwave oven at 150 watts for 20 min, after which the dry weight of the biomass was calculated. The remaining 4 ml of the sample was divided into 2 × 2-ml portions and kept at –20 °C for antibiotic analysis. Shake Flask Cultivations for Analysis of Antibiotics, Intracellular Sugar Phosphates, and Carbohydrates—The defined minimal medium for the shake flask cultivation was the same as described for the batch cultivations, but contained 40 g per liter of glucose instead of 20 g per liter, and was supplemented with 50 mm MES for buffering purposes. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.8 before autoclaving. The cultivations were performed in 500-ml baffled shake flasks with 50 ml of defined medium and 30 glass beads (3 mm diameter). The cultures were kept at 30 °C on a shaking table with an agitation speed of 150 rpm. The inoculum for shake flasks was prepared in the same way as for the fermentors, except for the centrifugation step. Preculture (2.5 ml) was added directly to each shake flask (5% v/v). Shake Flask Cultivations for Antibiotic Phenotyping in Complex Medium—Streptomyces strains used were grown under standard conditions in 200 ml of R2YE medium (19Kieser T. Bibb M. Buttner M. Chater K. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 408-414Google Scholar). The 1-liter flasks were inoculated with 106 spores per ml of medium. Spores were pregerminated for 15 min at 50 °C in TY medium (19Kieser T. Bibb M. Buttner M. Chater K. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000: 408-414Google Scholar) and spun down (15 min, 16,100 × g). Most of the supernatant was removed before inoculation. The cultures were grown in 1-liter shake flasks equipped with stainless steel spirals at 30 °C while shaken at 200 rpm. Actinorhodin (ACT) and Undecylprodigiosin (RED) Quantifications—To extract actinorhodin, 2 ml of 3 n KOH was added to a 2-ml sample, vortexed, and left shaking overnight at 2 °C. The suspensions were centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 640 nm. The actinorhodin concentration was calculated based on an extinction coefficient of 25,320 m–1 cm–1 (20Bystrykh L.V. Fernandez-Moreno M.A. Herrema J.K. Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Dijkhuizen L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2238-2244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Undecylprodigiosin was extracted in the same manner but with methanol acidified to pH 1.5 with HCl in a tube with 0.25–0.5 mm (diameter) glass beads. The extinction coefficient of undecylprodigiosin used was 100,500 m–1 cm–1 at 530 nm (21Tsao S.W. Rudd B.A. He X.G. Chang C.J. Floss H.G. J. Antibiot. 1985; 38: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Analysis of Extracellular Metabolites—A range of extracellular metabolites, including glucose, was analyzed by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad). The operating temperature was 60 °C. Separation was achieved using 5 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The HPLC was equipped with a Waters 410 differential refractometer (Millipore) and a tunable absorbance detector set at 210 nm (Waters 486, Millipore). Glucose, glycerol, succinate, and ethanol were quantified using a refractometer, and acetate and pyruvate were quantified by UV absorbance. A calibration curve was made using six different metabolite concentrations. Analysis of Intracellular Sugar Phosphate Concentrations—Cells from triplicate shake flask cultures were quenched in cold methanol and then extracted with chloroform, pH 7, according to a slightly modified method from de Koning and van Dam (22de Koning W. van Dam K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Cell culture (10 ml) was used to determine biomass dry weight to calculate the sugar phosphate portion per g dry weight. Cell suspension (5 ml) was sprayed into 20 ml of 60% (v/v) methanol buffered with 12.5 mm Tricine, pH 7.4, and kept in a –40 °C ethanol bath. The cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 4,000 × g at –20 °C. The supernatant was collected and kept at –80 °C until further analysis. Pure methanol (2.5 ml) was added to the cell pellet, after which the tube was immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The extraction was performed by shaking the tubes at –20 °C overnight at 300 rpm after addition of 5 ml of chloroform, 2 ml of buffer (3 mm Tricine, 3 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), and glass beads 0.25–0.5 mm (diameter). The mixture was centrifuged at 1,200 × g for 12 min at –20 °C, and the upper phase was collected. Pure methanol (2 ml) was added to the remaining chloroform, and cells were vortexed, separated by centrifugation, and pooled with the first portion of the extract. The extract and the quenching liquid were freeze-dried, and the solid matter was redissolved in 1 ml of MilliQ water. Glucose 6-phosphate (glucose-6-P) and fructose 6-phosphate (fructose-6-P) were analyzed in an enzymatic assay with glucose 6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and phosphoglucose isomerase by fluorimetric measurement of NADPH formation on a luminescence spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) set at 340 nm for excitation and 456 nm for emission. The reaction was carried out at room temperature in 250 mm triethanolamine buffer with 0.025 mm NADP+. The sample was added to the buffer, and the base-line absorbance was measured after which 1 unit of G6PDH was added per ml. The increase in absorbance was measured after 5–7 min. The increase in absorbance, and thus NADPH, is proportional to the conversion of glucose-6-P. The additional increase in absorbance after addition of phosphoglucose isomerase corresponds to the amount of fructose-6-P converted. Glucose-6-P and fructose-6-P amounts were calculated from the calibration curves, which were linear in the 0 to 10.5 nm range. The samples fell within the range of the calibration curve. Some of the samples were measured a few times to determine the measurement error, which was not higher than 5%. Measurement of Carbohydrate Content—The samples for measurement of carbohydrate content were collected during the stationary phase when the triplicate shake flask cultures became red indicating undecylprodigiosin production. Samples taken (5–10 ml) were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, washed twice with distilled water, and freeze-dried. 5 mg of dried sample was then dispersed in 1 ml of distilled water. To this mixture 2 ml of 0.5% anthrone in 70% sulfuric acid was added (23Morris D.L. Science. 1948; 107: 254-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled in a water bath for 20 min and cooled to room temperature, and absorbance was measured at 625 nm and compared with a glucose standard curve. Measurement of Amino Acid Labeling and Estimation of Metabolic Fluxes—For the labeled cultivations additional samples of 5–10 ml were withdrawn. The biomass was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice with cold 0.9% NaCl, and kept at –20 °C until further analysis. The biomass was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl at 105 °C and then derivatized as described in Christensen and Nielsen (24Christensen B. Nielsen J. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The labeling of amino acid fragments was measured by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (24Christensen B. Nielsen J. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The labeling of each fragment was expressed as summed fractional labeling (SFL) determined by Equation 1, SFL=i0·0+i1·1+i2·2+...+in·ni0+i1+i2+...+in(Eq. 1) where in is the peak intensity of mass isotopomer with n 13C atoms. The data were corrected for natural isotope abundance before usage (24Christensen B. Nielsen J. Metab. Eng. 1999; 1: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The labeling data together with growth parameters and cellular composition were used to calculate fluxes by an algorithm from Wiechert (25Wiechert W. Metab. Eng. 2001; 3: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) implemented in an in-house software package based on Matlab (The MathWorks). The cellular composition was taken from Borodina et al. (26Borodina I. Krabben P. Nielsen J. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 820-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), except for protein composition, which was specifically determined for S. coelicolor cultivations on a defined minimal medium (27Davidson, A. (1992) Quantitative Microbial Physiology of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Ph.D. thesis, University of Glasgow, GlasgowGoogle Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Diamide Sensitivity Assays—Diamide sensitivity assays were performed as described previously (3Butler M.J. Bruheim P. Jovetic S. Marinelli F. Postma P.W. Bibb M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Paget M.S. Kang J.G. Roe J.H. Buttner M.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5776-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Halo surfaces were determined after 48 h of incubation at 30 °C. Sampling for Microarray Analysis and RNA Isolation—The samples for gene expression analysis were taken during the exponential growth phase, when the carbon dioxide concentration in the outlet gas was 0.1%, corresponding to ∼2 g/liter of dry weight biomass. Samples of 20 ml were withdrawn quickly and sprayed into 50-ml falcon tubes filled with crushed ice resulting in almost immediate cooling down to 0–2 °C. The mixture was shaken and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the cells were immersed in liquid nitrogen and then stored at –80 °C until RNA extraction. The total time spent on the sampling procedure did not exceed 2 min. Total RNA extraction was performed with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) using a FastPrep FP120 (3 × 40 s; Qbiogene) for breaking the cells. After the removal of cellular debris additional steps were performed as follows: two rounds of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, pH 8, extraction, and 1 round of chloroform extraction. The rest of the procedure was according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNA was subjected to DNase digestion and then concentrated from the reaction solution using an RNeasy CleanUp kit (Qiagen). The quality of RNA was assessed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent) to ensure that no degradation of 23 S rRNA or 16 S rRNA had occurred. Microarray Analysis—The arrays were spotted oligonucleotide arrays (University of Surrey fabricated oligonucleotide (50 mer) microarrays), containing duplicate spots of probes for 7623 S. coelicolor genes. Each probe was 50 nucleotides long and was designed for minimal cross-hybridization with other genes. The RNA samples were labeled and hybridized to the arrays according to the procedure described on line. The design included three biological replicates for the reference strain and two biological replicates for the ΔpfkA2 mutant as well as dye swaps. Only two biological replicates were analyzed in case of ΔpfkA2 because one of the RNA preparations did not pass the quality control. We applied loop design (29Vinciotti V. Khanin R. D'Alimonte D. Liu X. Cattini N. Hotchkiss G. Bucca G. de Jesus O. Rasaiyaah J. Smith C.P. Kellam P. Wit E. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 492-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where samples were compared directly to each other without a common reference (supplemental Fig. S2). Array Image Analysis and Data Normalization—The arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix 428 laser scanner (Affymetrix). Image analyses were carried out using BlueFuse software (BlueGnome Ltd.), which allows automatic grid alignment, spot boundary detection, background subtraction, and signal intensities estimation. The quality of the spots was scored 0 or 1 (0 for bad quality,"
https://openalex.org/W2053516515,"The neural circuitry of primary auditory cortex is known to have a critical period during which the representation of sound frequency is shaped to represent the external world. De Villers-Sidani and colleagues now show that the end of this critical period is driven by local patterns of activity reflecting environmental stimuli. During early brain development and through 'adult' experience-dependent plasticity, neural circuits are shaped to represent the external world with high fidelity. When raised in a quiet environment, the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) has a well-defined 'critical period', lasting several days, for its representation of sound frequency. The addition of environmental noise extends the critical period duration as a variable function of noise level. It remains unclear whether critical period closure should be regarded as a unified, externally gated event that applies for all of A1 or if it is controlled by progressive, local, activity-driven changes in this cortical area. We found that rearing rats in the presence of a spectrally limited noise band resulted in the closure of the critical period for A1 sectors representing the noise-free spectral bands, whereas the critical period appeared to remain open in noise-exposed sectors, where the cortex was still functionally and physically immature."

Moreover, S1P administration greatly reduces lung capillary leakage induced in mice by lipopolysaccharide treatment (4Peng X. Hassoun P.M. Sammani S. McVerry B.J. Burne M.J. Rabb H. Pearse D.

Mechanistically, S1P acts to enhance tight junction formation in neighboring endothelial cells by influencing subcellular distributions of tight junction components including ZO-1 and claudin-5 (5Lee J.F.

In addition, S1P induces endothelial cortical actin assembly (1Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin.

In plasma, S1P is found associated with multiple lipoproteins including low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, and high density lipoproteins (HDL). However, the bulk of the lipoprotein particle-associated S1P (54%) is bound to HDL (6Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). A number of recent studies point to the S1P cargo of HDL as being a mediator of many of the cardiovascular effects of HDL including the ability to promote vasodilation, vasoconstriction, and angiogenesis, protect against ischemia/reperfusion injury, and inhibit/reverse atherosclerosis (7Argraves K.M. Argraves W.S. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2325-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). One important cardiovascular-related effect of S1P that has not yet been attributed to HDL is regulation of endothelial barrier activity, a major physiological function of the endothelium. Here we investigate the role of HDL as a regulator of endothelial barrier integrity processes known to be dependent on S1P signaling. Reagents—d-Erythro-S1P was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Stock solutions of S1P (100 μm) were prepared by dissolving S1P into Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing 4 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma). S1P levels in the stock solution were confirmed by the Lipidomics Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC (Department of Biochemistry) using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Pertussis toxin (PTX) was purchased from Sigma. The S1P1 antagonist 857390 and the S1P1/S1P3 antagonist VPC23019 were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and reconstituted at 1 mm in acidified DMSO, 4 mg/ml BSA. The Akt inhibitor, LY294002, and Erk inhibitor, PD98059, were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). HDL Preparation—Blood for HDL isolation was collected from healthy volunteers in 0.4 mm EDTA after 12 h of fasting. The donors were normolipemic volunteers, not receiving prescription medication for any acute or chronic condition and without family history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or stroke. None of the volunteers was receiving antioxidant therapy. Low density lipoprotein was isolated from pooled plasma (typically from 4 to 5 donors) after density adjustment (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml) with potassium bromide (KBr), by preparative ultracentrifugation at 50,000 rpm (about 360,000 × g) for 17 h, 5 °C, on a Beckman Optima™ XL-100K ultracentrifuge, using a type 70 Ti rotor. HDL was then isolated after density adjustment (1.063 < d < 1.21 g/ml) with KBr at 68,000 rpm (500,000 × g) for 22 h using the same rotor. Isolated HDL was washed by ultracentrifugation (SW 41 Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm, 280,000 × g, 36 h), dialyzed against a 0.15 m sodium chloride solution containing 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Prior to use in cell culture, the HDL was dialyzed against DPBS containing 0.3 mm EDTA. Protein levels in HDL preparations were measured by the Lowry method. To determine S1P levels in the purified HDL preparations, aliquots were diluted 1:50 in DPBS and subjected to LC-MS-MS described by Bielawski et al. (8Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods (Amst.). 2006; 39: 82-91Google Scholar). These analyses showed that the average S1P level was 381.87 ± 32.22 pmol/mg of HDL protein (n = 4). Cells—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) were maintained on Corning tissue culture dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air in endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2; Lonza, Walkersville, MD), which contains 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used between passages 3 and 7. Electrical Cell Substrate Impedance Sensing Assay—Electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a non-invasive means of measuring electrical resistance across cultured cell monolayers in real time (9Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In ECIS, cells are grown on the surface of gold-film electrodes. From readings of the electrical impedance (a measure of opposition to a sinusoidal alternating current) of the cell-covered electrode performed with low amplitude-sensing voltages, alterations in cell-cell contacts can be deduced. Changes of impedance are attributed to changes of the resistance in the paracellular pathway and the resistance between the ventral cell surface and the electrode (α: α = R(ρ/h)0.5, where R is the cell radius, ρ is the resistivity of the culture medium, and h is the gap between the cells and the electrode) (10Giaever I. Keese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7896-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 11Kataoka N. Iwaki K. Hashimoto K. Mochizuki S. Ogasawara Y. Sato M. Tsujioka K. Kajiya F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15638-15643Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Disruption in the barrier integrity of an epithelial monolayer results in increased ion flow across the cell layer leading to decreased electrical resistance. ECIS has been used to monitor transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) as an index of endothelial cell barrier function (1Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 5Lee J.F. Zeng Q. Ozaki H. Wang L. Hand A.R. Hla T. Wang E. Lee M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29190-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Herein, TEER was measured using an ECIS Model 1600 instrument (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY). HUVEC in EGM-2 medium were seeded into the wells of ECIS 8W10E+ electrode arrays at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The arrays were precoated with human plasma fibronectin (Invitrogen) at 100 μg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0. The cells were cultured in EGM-2 medium, and impedance was measured every 5 min at 15 kHz frequency. For every 48 h of culture, 50% volume of medium was replaced with fresh EGM-2. When the electrical resistance reached a maximal plateau (∼3 days), the medium was replaced with serum-free endothelial basal medium (EBM; Lonza) containing 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Invitrogen). Electrical resistance was monitored until a minimal plateau was reached (∼24 h). Effectors (i.e. S1P-albumin, HDL, or albumin in DPBS) were introduced into the culture medium by removing a volume corresponding to that of the effector to be added. The maximum volume of each effector added did not exceed 1/25 of the 400-μl volume of conditioned culture medium in each well. For experiments evaluating the effects of PTX on TEER, PTX (2 μg/ml in 50% glycerol with 50 mm Tris, 10 mm glycine, and 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5) was added to EBM during the final 12 h of serum starvation. Controls received PTX buffer alone. S1P or HDL was then added to the medium. For experiments evaluating the effects of S1P1 antagonists on TEER, antagonist stocks (1 mm in 5% acidified DMSO, 4 mg/ml BSA) were diluted 1:100 into the conditioned EBM at the same time that S1P or HDL was added. For experiments evaluating the effects of Akt and Erk inhibition on TEER, inhibitor stocks (25 μm LY294002 in DMSO or 50 μm PD98059 in DMSO) were diluted to 50 nm into the conditioned EBM 1 h prior to the addition of S1P or HDL. Bio-Plex Phosphoprotein Detection Assay—HUVEC were seeded into 6-well dishes (Corning) at 1 × 106 cells/well and grown for 18 h in EGM-2. The medium was then replaced with EBM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were grown for 24 h. The medium was then supplemented with a range of S1P concentrations (37 nm-1 μm) or a range of HDL concentrations (37 μg-1 mg of protein/ml, corresponding to 18-493 nm S1P). For experiments evaluating the effects of PTX, PTX (100 ng/ml) or the PTX buffer was added to EBM during the final 12 h of serum starvation. For experiments evaluating the effects of the S1P1 antagonist 857390 and the S1P1/S1P3 antagonist VPC23019, the antagonists (1 mm in 5% acidified DMSO, 4 mg/ml BSA) were diluted 1:100 into the conditioned EBM during the final 15 min of serum starvation. S1P or HDL was then added to the medium and allowed to incubate for 3 min. The cells were then extracted with Bio-Plex cell lysis buffer (Bio-Rad), and protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt in the extracts were determined by multiplex bead assay using kits (Bio-Rad) and a Bioplex-200 instrument (Bio-Rad). HUVEC Migration Assay—ECIS was also used to evaluate the effects of S1P and HDL on HUVEC motility. HUVEC were seeded onto 8W1E electrode arrays at 1 × 105 cells/well in EGM-2 medium. The cells were grown until electrical resistance reached a maximal plateau. Each cell-covered electrode was subjected to a pulse of 4 V for 20 s. This brief elevated field effectively killed the cells on the electrode as indicated by a drop in impedance. Electrical resistance was then monitored for the subsequent 10-h period during which, under control conditions, electrical resistance recovers as cells migrate and fill in the void. During this period, the EBM medium was supplemented either with S1P (250 nm) or with HDL (333 μg/ml), each in the presence or absence of PTX (1 μg/ml) or S1P1 receptor antagonists (10 μm). For experiments that evaluated the effects of Akt and Erk inhibitors, the cells were treated with inhibitors or buffer vehicle 1 h prior to wounding and throughout the period in which the cells migrate to fill the void. HDL Augments TEER—As shown in Fig. 1A, S1P induces a dose-dependent increase in TEER. The TEER response to S1P displays a bimodal distribution over a 5-h period. Each of the two modes spans 2 h. For all of the S1P doses tested, the height of the second peak was always less than that of the first. HDL treatment also produces a dose-dependent increase in TEER (Fig. 1B). Like S1P, HDL also produced a bimodal TEER response. By contrast, the effect of HDL on the second TEER peak was sustained longer at the higher HDL doses than observed with any S1P dose tested. HDL-induced Enhancement of TEER Is Pertussis Toxin-sensitive—Gi protein-coupled S1P receptor signaling in endothelial cells is inhibited by PTX (12Lee M.J. Evans M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11272-11279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the TEER response of endothelial cell monolayers to S1P treatments was inhibited by PTX. Similarly, the TEER response to HDL was completely abrogated by PTX (Fig. 2B), suggesting the requirement for Gi-coupled S1P receptors. S1P Receptor Antagonists Inhibit HDL-induced Enhancement of TEER—The S1P receptor, S1P1, has been shown to mediate S1P-stimulated augmentation of endothelial barrier activity (1Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of S1P1 receptor antagonists on the barrier enhancement response of endothelial cell monolayers to HDL. Both the S1P1 antagonist, 857390, and the S1P1/S1P3 antagonist, VPC23019, inhibited the TEER response to HDL as well as the TEER response to S1P (Fig. 2, C and D). HDL Stimulates Erk1/2 and Akt Activation in Endothelial Cells—S1P signaling in endothelial cells involves Erk1/2 and Akt activation (13Taha T.A. Argraves K.M. Obeid L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1682: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Multiplex microbead suspension array analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of HDL on the activation of Erk1/2 and Akt signaling pathway intermediates, which have been implicated in endothelial barrier function (5Lee J.F.

J. 2002; 367: 873-879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, S1P elicits a transient increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation with peak phosphorylation detectable within 3-5 min of treatment. The response to S1P was dose-dependent, although a plateau was not reached using the highest dosage of S1P tested (Fig. 3B). Similarly, HDL produced a transient increase in Erk1/2 phosphorylation with peak phosphorylation detectable within 3-5 min of treatment (Fig. 3C). The activation response to HDL was also dose-dependent, reaching a maximal plateau at 333 μg/ml (based on LC-MS-MS analysis, this amount of HDL contained 135 nm S1P) (Fig. 3D). Similar effects of HDL and S1P on the activation of Akt were also observed (Fig. 3, E-H). Furthermore, the findings indicate that when equimolar amounts of S1P were carried either on HDL or on albumin, they elicit a similar magnitude of Erk and Akt activation (Fig. 3, compare B with D and compare F with H). Activation of Erk1/2 and Akt by HDL Is Blocked by Pertussis Toxin and an S1P1 Antagonist—Previous studies have shown that S1P-mediated activation of Erk and Akt is PTX-sensitive (16Park K.S. Kim M.K.

Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 1210-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We performed multiplex microbead suspension array analysis to evaluate the effect of PTX on HDL-induced activation of Erk1/2 and Akt in endothelial cells. The activation of Akt and Erk1/2 by either HDL or S1P was inhibited by PTX (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting the requirement for Gi-coupled S1P receptors. The S1P receptor, S1P1, was implicated in this process by the finding that the S1P1 antagonist, 857390, and the S1P1/S1P3 antagonist, VPC23019, inhibited HDL-induced and S1P-induced activation of Erk1/2 and Akt (Fig. 4, C and D). Inhibition of Akt Blocks HDL-induced Enhancement of TEER—In light of the finding that HDL stimulates activation of both Erk and Akt, we next evaluated the effects of antagonists of activation of these signaling pathway intermediates on endothelial barrier function. Inhibition of both S1P-induced and HDL-induced TEER was observed using the Akt inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 5, A and B). By contrast, partial inhibition of both S1P-induced and HDL-induced TEER was observed using the Erk inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 5, C and D). Control multiplex microbead suspension array analyses showed that LY294002 blocked 100% of Akt phosphorylation and PD98059 blocked ∼70% of Erk1/2 phosphorylation in response to either S1P or HDL stimulation in HUVEC (data not shown). HDL Promotes Endothelial Cell Motility via S1P1/Akt Signaling—Endothelial cell motility has been shown to be regulated by the S1P1/Akt/Rac small GTPase pathway (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S. Wu M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D.R. Hla T. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 20Lee M.J.

An ECIS-based electrical wound healing assay (5Lee J.F. Zeng Q. Ozaki H. Wang L. Hand A.R. Hla T. Wang E. Lee M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29190-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was used to investigate the ability of HDL to influence endothelial cell motility. Endothelial cells attached to circular micro-electrodes were killed by a burst of electrical current. The migration of viable cells into the wounded area was monitored using ECIS. In the presence of either S1P or HDL, there was an increase in TEER (Fig. 6, A and B), which correlated with increased numbers of cells migrating into the wound area as determined by microscopic examination. The rate of endothelial migration into the wounded area achieved by HDL treatment was reproducibly greater than observed using an amount of S1P equimolar to that carried on HDL. The effects of S1P and HDL on endothelial cell motility were inhibited by PTX (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting the requirement for Gi-coupled S1P receptors. Given evidence that the S1P receptor, S1P1, can mediate S1P-induced HUVEC migration (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S. Wu M. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Alessi D.R.

Cell. 1999; 99: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of S1P1 receptor antagonists on HDL induced endothelial cell motility. The results show that S1P1 antagonists inhibit endothelial cell motility promoted by either HDL or S1P (Fig. 6, C and D). We next evaluated the impact of Akt and Erk inhibitors on the process of HDL-induced endothelial cell motility. As a result, it was found that inhibition of Akt abrogated HDL-induced motility (Fig. 7B). Similarly, inhibition of Akt also abrogated motility induced by S1P carried on albumin (Fig. 7A). By contrast, inhibition of Erk1/2 activation produced partial inhibition of the motility induced by either HDL or S1P (Fig. 7, C and D). Together, these findings indicate that HDL is capable of enhancing endothelial cell motility via S1P signaling primarily through the S1P1/Akt pathway. This signaling may play an important role in the process by which an injured endothelium is repaired. Here we explored the effects of HDL on endothelial permeability. A number of studies have established that HDL administration can reduce organ injury and mortality in animal models of shock and ischemia/reperfusion (21Hubsch A.P. Casas A.T. Doran J.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1995; 126: 548-558PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cockerill G.W. McDonald M.C. Mota-Filipe H. Cuzzocrea S. Miller N.E. Thiemermann C.

Chatterjee P.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1833-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, such beneficial effects have been attributed to a variety of HDL properties including the ability of HDL to bind and inactivate lipopolysaccharide, to inhibit cytokine-induced expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, and to prevent neutrophil adhesion and transmigration through the endothelium (23Thiemermann C. Patel N.S. Kvale E.O. Cockerill G.W. Brown P.A. Stewart K.N. Cuzzocrea S. Britti D. Mota-Filipe H. Chatterjee P.K. J. Am. Soc.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). These latter activities involve effects on the semipermeable barrier function of the endothelium. Alteration in endothelial barrier function is a factor underlying postischemic edema, the recruitment and migration of monocytes, as well as the introduction of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles into the intima of the blood vessel (27Nordestgaard B.G. Wootton R. Lewis B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The findings presented in the present study establish that HDL can act to promote endothelial barrier integrity as evidenced by its ability to increase TEER in the ECIS assay. This study also provides insights into the mechanisms underlying HDL-mediated endothelial barrier enhancement. It is shown that the elevated TEER response to HDL is PTX-sensitive, thus implicating Gi-coupled S1P receptor signaling. This inference was substantiated by the finding that HDL enhancement of TEER is blocked by S1P1 antagonists. These results are consistent with findings presented here and elsewhere showing that TEER is augmented by S1P carried on albumin and mediated by S1P1 (1Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A.

Lee M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29190-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of this activity of HDL will likely relate to endothelial barrier function in vivo particularly in light of findings showing that S1P prevents pulmonary edema in rodent and canine models of acute lung injury (28McVerry B.J. Peng X. Hassoun P.M. Sammani S. Simon B.A. Garcia J.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004; 170: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The present study also showed that HDL stimulates several known endothelial cell responses to S1P including activation of Erk1/2 and Akt and augmentation of cell motility. These responses to HDL were each found to be mediated by S1P1 signaling. Furthermore, the activation of Akt and Erk1/2 was found to be important in HDL-induced enhancement of endothelial barrier function. However, barrier enhancement showed a greater dependence on Akt activation as compared with Erk1/2 activation. Together, the observed HDL effects on barrier enhancement are consistent with reported evidence that stimulation of endothelial cells by S1P carried on albumin leads to redistribution of tight junction-associated proteins to cell-cell junctions via the S1P1/G(i)/Akt/Rac pathway (5Lee J.F. Zeng Q. Ozaki H. Wang L. Hand A.R. Hla T. Wang E. Lee M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29190-29200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It was also observed that both HDL and S1P (carried on albumin) induced bimodal TEER responses over a range of doses. Considering that S1P receptors are G-coupled receptors, these findings may relate to the process by which many G protein-coupled receptors when exposed to agonist become refractory to further stimulation by the same agonist (29Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). This process, known as agonist-induced desensitization, can be mediated by receptor internalization, down-regulation, and G protein uncoupling. Importantly, S1P has been shown to induce internalization and recycling of the endothelial cell S1P receptor, S1P1 (30Jo E. Sanna M.G. Gonzalez-Cabrera P.J. Thangada S. Tigyi G. Osborne D.A. Hla T. Parrill A.L. Rosen H. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 703-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, agonist-induced internalization and recycling of S1P receptors may underlie the observed bimodal TEER response to HDL-S1P. We thank the Lipidomics Core Facility (Drs. J. Bielawski and A.

In addition to LDL-A binding repeats, the mosaic receptor SorLA/LR11 also possesses a Vps10p domain. Here we show that apoA-V also binds to sortilin, a receptor from the Vsp10p domain gene family that lacks LDL-A repeats. Binding of apoA-V to sortilin was competed by neurotensin, a ligand that binds specifically to the Vps10p domain. To investigate the biological fate of receptor-bound apoA-V, binding experiments were conducted with cultured human embryonic kidney cells transfected with either SorLA/LR11 or sortilin. Compared with nontransfected cells, apoA-V binding to SorLA/LR11- and sortilin-expressing cells was markedly enhanced. Internalization experiments, live imaging studies, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses demonstrated that labeled apoA-V was rapidly internalized, co-localized with receptors in early endosomes, and followed the receptors through endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. The observed decrease of fluorescence signal intensity as a function of time during live imaging experiments suggested ligand uncoupling in endosomes with subsequent delivery to lysosomes for degradation. This interpretation was supported by experiments with 125I-labeled apoA-V, demonstrating clear differences in degradation between transfected and nontransfected cells. We conclude that apoA-V binds to receptors possessing LDL-A repeats and Vsp10p domains and that apoA-V is internalized into cells via these receptors. This could be a mechanism by which apoA-V modulates lipoprotein metabolism in vivo.

The physiological relevance of apoA-V modulation of LPL-mediated lipolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins has therefore been questioned. Another as yet unexplained observation is that apoA-V levels in human plasma are positively correlated with plasma TG levels (16Dallinga-Thie G.M. van Tol A. Hattori H. van Vark-van der Zee L.C.

Both lipid-free apoA-V and apoA-V dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) complexes bound to LRP1 (LDL receptor-related protein I) and to the mosaic receptor SorLA/LR11.

Besides the N-terminal Vps10p-D that is present in all five Vps10-D receptors, SorLA/LR11 (from now on referred to as SorLA) also shares structural similarities with members of the LDL-R gene family (27Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The Vps10p-D contains a propeptide that is removed by the endopeptidase, furin, in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the propeptide is essential for normal processing of sortilin (28Munck Petersen C. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). SorLA and sortilin are multiligand receptors, and among the ligands that bind to both receptors are receptor-associated protein (RAP), apoE, and LPL. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, we examined the binding of apoA-V to sortilin and investigated the effects of other known sortilin ligands on this interaction. Furthermore, interaction between human chylomicrons and sortilin was demonstrated. Binding and internalization studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transfected with sortilin or SorLA showed that apoA-V undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis. The endocytotic itinerary of apoA-V was investigated and characterized. Materials—Soluble sortilin was expressed in CHO-K1 cells and purified on a RAP-Sepharose 4B column as previously described (29Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). RAP was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein in Bl21 (DE3) cells and purified using a Talon metal affinity resin according to the manufacturer's manual (Clontech). Neurotensin (NT) and bovine serum albumin fraction V were purchased from Sigma, and heparin was obtained from Leo Pharma (Malmö, Sweden). LRP1 was purified as previously stated (18Nilsson S.K.

ApoA-V-DMPC Disks—Recombinant human apoA-V was prepared, isolated, and incorporated into DMPC disks, as described elsewhere (32Beckstead J.A. Oda M.N. Martin D.D. Forte T.M. Bielicki J.K. Berger T. Luty R. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9416-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged recombinant apoA-V and DMPC disks were prepared similarly (33Shu X. Chan J. Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1445-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The apoA-V-DMPC disks were dialyzed in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl using tubes with a cut-off of 14 kDa (SpectraPor). An Alexa Fluor 488 protein labeling kit from Invitrogen was used to label apoA-V when the protein was present in DMPC disks. For degradation studies, apoA-V-DMPC discs were labeled with 125I using IODO-BEADs (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeling corresponded to 260 cpm/ng apoA-V protein. Internalization and Ligand Binding—Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated apoA-V or 125I-labeled apoA-V (∼95,000 cpm/well) was incubated with HEK cells (wild type or transfected with SorLA or sortilin constructs) in 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (+ 10% fetal calf serum) for 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated apoA-V was removed, and the cells were then either directly fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde to visualize binding of the ligand to the cell surface or further incubated at 37 °C for given periods of time to study internalization. Unbound 125I-labeled apoA-V remaining in the medium was removed and precipitated with 12.5% tricloroacetic acid to estimate degradation. Cell-associated tracer was released from the plastic dish with 1 m NaOH and counted directly without precipitation. Immunocytochemistry on cells stably transfected with SorLA or sortilin was made with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against the SorLA Vps10p domain or monoclonal antibodies raised in mouse against the sortilin-Vps10p domain. Cell organelles were visualized using rabbit-anti-Lamp-1 (GLA7; Hybridoma Bank, Iowa), mouse anti-MPR300 (2C2; personal gift from Prof. Regina Pohlmann, Münster, Germany), or goat-anti-TGN-46 (Serotec, Norway). All secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated immunoglobolins were from Invitrogen. Microscopy of stained fixed cells and live imaging were carried out using a confocal LSM510 META laser-scanning microscope from Zeiss. A ×63 or ×40 water objective lens (numerical aperture 1.2) was used in all recordings. Brightness and contrast were adjusted using NIH ImageJ software. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—For FRET measurements, cultured HEK293 cell samples transfected with SorLA or sortilin were incubated with apoA-V488 for 20 min and then incubated with anti-SorLA or anti-sortilin, followed by Alexa 568-labeled secondary antibodies. FRET measurements and analysis were performed according to the sensitized acceptor emission PFRET procedure using the associated ImageJ PFRET plugin developed by the group of Periasamy et al. (34Elangovan M. Wallrabe H. Chen Y. Day R.N. Barroso M. Periasamy A. Methods. 2003; 29: 58-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35Wallrabe H. Chen Y. Periasamy A. Barroso M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2006; 69: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Donor and acceptor fluorescence signals were detected in the 501–533 nm and 565–651 nm spectral regions, and images were acquired with zoom 4 and line average 8 (scan speed 7). 10 donor (a), acceptor (d), and FRET (b and c) images were acquired for each donor- and acceptor-only sample, whereas 13–15 e, f, and g images were acquired for the double-labeled samples (for nomenclature, see Ref. 34Elangovan M. Wallrabe H. Chen Y. Day R.N. Barroso M. Periasamy A. Methods. 2003; 29: 58-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For calculation of the apparent FRET effeciencies, Eapp, the PFRET program contains an option for selection of lower and upper thresholds (bounds) on intensity values in the e, f, and g images acquired for double-labeled samples. For those images, upper bounds were set one unit lower than the (eventual) saturated intensity. Lower bounds were empirically chosen as 15 and 20 intensity units for sortilin-ApoA-V and Sorla-ApoA-V, respectively; this choice was judged to represent the best compromise between an increasing amount of noisy (high) Eapp values appearing at low e, f, and g signal levels versus an increasing loss of information about FRET behavior in cellular regions with low staining efficiency. For further quantitative FRET analysis, ROIs of size 5 × 5, 4 × 6, or 6 × 4 pixels were defined automatically (SorLA-apoA-V) or manually (sortilin-apoA-V) within e images based on the criteria of an average e signal of at least 25 within the ROIs and a fulfillment of the lower bound settings for at least 80% of the pixels within an ROI. Since negative Eapp values are rounded up to zero by the PFERT program, we decided to exclude those values from the results. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding studies were performed on a Biacore 2000 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) using CM5 sensor chips. Sortilin and bovine serum albumin were immobilized using the Biacore amine coupling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hepes (20 mm, pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl was used as running buffer. In studies of interactions in the absence of lipids, 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20 was used. The temperature was 25 °C, and the flow was maintained at 5 μl/min. ApoA-V was dialyzed against running buffer and inhibitors were diluted in running buffer just prior to injection. Reference flow cells containing a corresponding amount of covalently bound bovine serum albumin was used as previously described (18Nilsson S.K. Lookene A. Beckstead J.A. Gliemann J. Ryan R.O. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Sensorgrams were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software version 3.2 (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). Binding of ApoA-V to Sortilin Studied by SPR—Binding of apoA-V-DMPC disks to sortilin, covalently bound to Biacore sensor chips, was studied during a 6-min injection (Fig. 1). To evaluate the nature of the interaction, competition experiments were conducted using known ligands for sortilin: RAP and NT. Heparin was also used, because it is known to bind to apoA-V and prevent its interaction with members of the LDL-R gene family (18Nilsson S.K. Lookene A. Beckstead J.A. Gliemann J. Ryan R.O. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that RAP interaction with receptor-covered sensor chips elicits a detector response. Therefore, this ligand was injected prior to the apoA-V-DMPC disks. In this case, RAP prevented binding of apoA-V (Fig. 1). Instead, there was a decreased response, probably corresponding to dissociation of RAP from the receptor-bound chip surface. In contrast to RAP, the small molecule NT induces only a weak SPR detector response. Thus, NT could be co-injected with apoA-V, contributing a negligible addition to the response signal. Co-injection of NT and apoA-V-DMPC did not give rise to any response (Fig. 1). Since the apoA-V interaction with sortilin was prevented by RAP and was competed by NT, it may be concluded that apoA-V interacts with the Vps10p domain of sortilin. By the same token, when heparin was co-injected with apoA-V-DMPC disks, no binding to sortilin was detected (Fig. 1). Thus, we conclude that the receptor-binding site in apoA-V overlaps with or is located close to the heparin-binding region. To further study the interaction between the apoA-V-DMPC disks and sortilin, NT was injected after apoA-V-DMPC disks were bound to the receptor. In this case, a rapid dissociation of bound apoA-V from the sensor chip surface occurred (Fig. 2A). Compared with the slow dissociation of apoA-V-DMPC disks from sortilin in the absence of NT (Fig. 1), these data show that NT competes with apoA-V for binding to sortilin. Given the nature of NT binding to sortilin, we conclude that apoA-V binds to the receptor's Vps10p domain in a specific manner. The dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction of lipid-free apoA-V with sortilin was determined in the presence of 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20 and was found to be 350 × 10–9 m. This was ∼3 times higher than the KD for the interaction of apoA-V with LRP1 determined under the same conditions and consistent with what was previously reported (18Nilsson S.K. Lookene A. Beckstead J.A. Gliemann J. Ryan R.O. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3896-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The role of sortilin as a lipoprotein receptor was investigated using human chylomicrons from an apoC-II-deficient patient by SPR. The chylomicrons contained relatively high amounts of apoA-V 3J. Heeren, personal communication. and bound to sortilin-covered sensor chips in a concentration-dependent manner. The binding of chylomicrons was fully competed, as in the case of apoA-V-DMPC disks, by NT (Fig. 2B). Due to higher nonspecific binding to the control surface, the sensorgram displayed a weak inverted response curve when NT was used to compete chylomicron binding. Binding and Endocytosis of ApoA-V-DMPC Disks by Cells Expressing SorLA and Sortilin—To determine if apoA-V undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis, we investigated cell surface binding of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled apoA-V (apoA-V488)-DMPC disks to HEK293 cells. Binding of apoA-V to control nontransfected HEK293 cells at 4 °C was low. The low level of binding observed is probably due to interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycan structures on the cell surfaces (Fig. 3, top panels, 0 min). On the other hand, HEK cells transfected with SorLA (HEK-SorLA) or sortilin (HEK-sort) displayed markedly enhanced fluorescence intensity. Internalization was observed in HEK-SorLA and HEK-sort upon incubation of the cells at 37 °C for 30 min (Fig. 3, middle panels). Furthermore, a high degree of co-localization between apoA-V488 and both receptors was detected (yellow, indicated by white arrows). By contrast, with nontransfected HEK cells, no apoA-V488 internalization was observed. To investigate the specificity of the observed interactions, control experiments were performed using cell lines expressing previously defined nonfunctional receptor variants. Internalization of apoA-V488 DMPC disks was investigated in cells expressing a variant sortilin construct mutated in the furin cleavage site, termed prosortilin (HEK-prosort) (28Munck Petersen C. Nielsen M.S. Jacobsen C. Tauris J. Jacobsen L. Gliemann J. Moestrup S.K. Madsen P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Unlike sortilin, prosortilin is unable to bind ligands. The results of this experiment (Fig. 3) reveal staining for prosortilin (in red) but no internalization of apoA-V488 (in green) after 15 min at 37 °C. In the middle and right lower panels (Fig. 3), apoA-V488 was incubated with HEK cells expressing two additional receptor variants, one of SorLA (HEKSorLA-mut) and the other of sortilin (HEKsortilin-mut). These receptor constructs were mutated in their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, resulting in markedly slower rates of endocytosis. The HEKsortilin-mut is altered in the tyrosine internalization motif (YXXL to AXXA) and in the dileucine motif (LL to AA) (29Nielsen M.S. Madsen P. Christensen E.I. Nykjaer A. Gliemann J. Kasper D. Pohlmann R. Petersen C.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The HEKSorLA-mut refers to a mutated amino acid cluster DD, EDDED, which is involved in internalization (31Nielsen M.S. Gustafsen C. Madsen P. Nyengaard J.R. Hermey G. Bakke O. Mari M. Schu P. Pohlmann R. Dennes A. Petersen C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6842-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). No significant internalization of apoA-V488 was observed after incubation for 15 min with cells expressing these mutant receptors. As a negative control, we generated DMPC disks containing Alexa 488-labeled apoC-II (apoC-II488). In addition, DMPC liposomes without protein were also taken through to the Alexa 488 labeling protocol (DMPC488). Experiments with cultured HEK cells showed that apoC-II488 did not interact with any of the cells investigated, and the DMPC particles alone did not show any surface binding and internalization (data not shown). FRET Results—By means of FRET, it is possible to check for a direct interaction between donor- and acceptor-labeled protein partners of interest. The Eapp probability value calculated by means of the PFRET method is proportional to the molecular FRET efficiency E and is positive for donor-acceptor pairs that are within a distance of less than 10 nm from each other. In Fig. 4 (A and B), examples are shown of donor (e), acceptor (g), and FRET (f) images as well as the resulting Eapp image for double-Alexa-labeled SorLA-apoA-V and sortilin-ApoA-V samples, indicating the apparent FRET probabilit"
https://openalex.org/W2057751289,"Sudden infant death syndrome is the leading cause of death in the postneonatal period in developed countries. Postmortem studies show alterations in serotonin neurons in the brainstem of such infants. However, the mechanism by which altered serotonin homeostasis might cause sudden death is unknown. We investigated the consequences of altering the autoinhibitory capacity of serotonin neurons with the reversible overexpression of serotonin 1A autoreceptors in transgenic mice. Overexpressing mice exhibited sporadic bradycardia and hypothermia that occurred during a limited developmental period and frequently progressed to death. Moreover, overexpressing mice failed to activate autonomic target organs in response to environmental challenges. These findings show that excessive serotonin autoinhibition is a risk factor for catastrophic autonomic dysregulation and provide a mechanism for a role of altered serotonin homeostasis in sudden infant death syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1979950508,"Mutations in human KCNE2, which encodes the MiRP1 potassium channel ancillary subunit, associate with long QT syndrome (LQTS), a defect in ventricular repolarization. The precise cardiac role of MiRP1 remains controversial, in part, because it has marked functional promiscuity in vitro. Here, we disrupted the murine kcne2 gene to define the role of MiRP1 in murine ventricles. kcne2 disruption prolonged ventricular action potential duration (APD), suggestive of reduced repolarization capacity. Accordingly, kcne2 (-/-) ventricles exhibited a 50% reduction in I(K,slow1), generated by Kv1.5--a previously unknown partner for MiRP1. I(to,f), generated by Kv4 alpha subunits, was also diminished, by approximately 25%. Ventricular MiRP1 protein coimmunoprecipitated with native Kv1.5 and Kv4.2 but not Kv1.4 or Kv4.3. Unexpectedly, kcne2 (-/-) ventricular membrane fractions exhibited 50% less mature Kv1.5 protein than wild type, and disruption of Kv1.5 trafficking to the intercalated discs. Consistent with the reduction in ventricular K(+) currents and prolonged ventricular APD, kcne2 deletion lengthened the QT(c) under sevoflurane anesthesia. Thus, targeted disruption of kcne2 has revealed a novel cardiac partner for MiRP1, a novel role for MiRPs in alpha subunit targeting in vivo, and a role for MiRP1 in murine ventricular repolarization with parallels to that proposed for the human heart."

Here we have examined the mechanisms underlying this hypersensitivity. We found that TAK1 deficiency up-regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in cell death upon TNF or oxidative stress challenge. Because blockade of NF-κB did not increase ROS or did not sensitize cells to oxidative stress in keratinocytes TAK1 regulates ROS mainly through the mechanisms other than those mediated by NF-κB. We found that c-Jun was decreased in TAK1-deficient keratinocytes and that ectopic expression of c-Jun could partially inhibit TNF-induced increase of ROS and cell death. Finally, we show that, in an in vivo setting, the antioxidant treatment could reduce an inflammatory condition in keratinocyte-specific Tak1 deletion mice. Thus, TAK1 regulates ROS partially through c-Jun, which is important for preventing ROS-induced skin inflammation.

TNF initiates intracellular signaling by binding to its receptor, initiating the formation of the TNF receptor complex, which consists of several proteins including RIP1 kinase, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and pro-caspase-8 (also called FLICE). The TNF receptor complex in turn activates two opposing intracellular signaling pathways; one leads to up-regulation of the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) (4Micheau O. Lens S. Gaide O. Alevizopoulos K. Tschopp J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5299-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and caspase inhibitor IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) (5Wang C.-Y.

TNF-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-κB is one of the major pathways of anti-apoptotic gene up-regulation and cell death inhibition. NF-κB is activated upon degradation of IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB), which is induced by its phosphorylation by IκB kinases (6Hayden M.S. Ghosh S.

FADD recruits the apoptosis-initiating protease caspase-8, which is in turn autoactivated by proteolysis. Caspase-8 cleaves and activates executor caspases such as caspase-3. c-FLIP is a specific inhibitor of caspase-8 (7Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Additionally, the TNF receptor complex activates NADPH oxidase 1 and increases ROS production (8Kim Y.S. Morgan M.J. Choksi S.

Prolonged JNK activation down-regulates the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch, which degrades c-FLIP (11Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ROS-facilitated caspase pathway is believed to be the major pathway of TNF-induced cell death. TAK1 kinase is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family and is activated by innate immune stimuli including bacterial components and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and TNF (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 14Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). TAK1 is an ubiquitin-dependent kinase and plays an essential role in innate immune signaling by activating both IκB kinases-NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways leading to activation of transcription factor AP-1 (15Chen Z.J. Bhoj V. Seth R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Reiley W.W. Jin W. Lee A.J. Wright A. Wu X. Tewalt E.F. Leonard T.O. Norbury C.C. Fitzpatrick L. Zhang M. Sun S.C. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have recently generated mice harboring a skin keratinocyte (epidermal)-specific deletion of Tak1 and found that TAK1 is essential for keratinocyte survival in vivo (17Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We have found that TAK1 deficiency causes hypersensitivity to TNF-mediated killing in keratinocytes. TNF expressed in the skin kills TAK1-deficient keratinocytes and induces an inflammatory condition in the Tak1 mutant skin. However, the mechanism by which TAK1 deficiency increases the susceptibility to TNF killing has not yet determined. One plausible mechanism is that TAK1 deficiency impairs TNF-induced NF-κB resulting in activation of the pro-death caspase pathway. However, the degree of cell death is somewhat greater in TAK1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than NF-κB-deficient MEFs as described previously (18Shim J.-H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.-Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently found that Tak1 deletion in the intestinal epithelium causes epithelial cell death at a much higher degree compared with the intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of NEMO (19Kajino-Sakamoto R. Inagaki M. Lippert E. Akira S. Robine S. Matsumoto K. Jobin C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1143-1152Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A.

Therefore, we speculate that TAK1 may participate in cell survival pathways other than those mediated by NF-κB. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which TAK1 regulates sensitivity to TNF-induced cell death. Particularly, we are interested in whether TAK1 deficiency induces cell death through the mechanisms mediated by other than lack of NF-κB activation in TAK1-deficient keratinocytes. To this end, we generated NF-κB-deficient keratinocytes by expressing non-degradable IκB(IκBΔN) that completely blocks activation of NF-κB, and compared them with TAK1-deficient keratinocytes. We show here that TNF-induced ROS is mainly regulated by a non-NF-κB mechanism in TAK1-deficient keratinocytes, and that this TAK1-dependent ROS regulation is important for preventing the inflammatory conditions in mice having an epidermal specific Tak1 deletion. Mice—Tak1-floxed (Tak1flox/flox) mice were from Dr. Akira, Osaka University (14Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). K14-CreERT mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (21Vasioukhin V. Degenstein L. Wise B. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Mice harboring an epidermal-specific inducible Tak1 deletion (K14-CreERT Tak1flox/flox) were generated and at 5 weeks of age were topically treated on the dorsal skin once a day for 5 consecutive days with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (1 mg/mouse). Some mice were fed with food containing 0.7% butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) starting at 3 days prior to the tamoxifen treatment. Deletion of the Tak1 gene was confirmed by PCR using the following primer set that can detect the truncated from of Tak1 (Tak1Δ): CACCAGTGCTGGATTCTTTTTGAGGC and GGAACCCGTGGATAAGTGCACTTGAAT. TNF receptor was done as a loading control using the following primer set: TGTGAAAAGGGCACCTTTACGGC and GGCTGCAGTCCACGCACTGG. All animal experiments were done with the approval of the North Carolina State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Culture—Tak1+/+ and Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes were isolated from Tak1flox/flox, K5-Cre Tak1flox/flox mice described previously (17Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes derived from the skin of postnatal day 0-2 mice were cultured in Ca2+-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4% Chelex-treated bovine growth serum (Hyclone), 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 0.05 mm calcium chloride, and penicillin-streptomycin at 33 °C in 8% CO2. Reagents—Reagents used were TNF-α (human recombinant; Roche), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (Calbiochem), BHA (Sigma), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP; Sigma), and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma). Polyclonal antibodies were TAK1 described previously (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), JNK1 (FL), p65 (F-6; Santa Cruz), caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), CREB (Santa Cruz), and phospho-c-Jun (Ser73; Cell Signaling). Monoclonal antibodies were c-FLIP (Abcam), phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185; Cell Signaling), c-Jun (BD Bioscience), β-actin (Sigma), and nidogen (Chemicon). Annexin V Binding Assay—To determine apoptotic cells, Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 binding and propidium iodide staining were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Images were taken using an inverted fluorescent microscope (TE2000-S; Nikon). 3-5 randomly selected areas were photographed with the same exposure time. The images were processed using the fixed threshold in all samples in each experiment, and more than 1000 cells were counted for each sample. Crystal Violet Assay—The viable adherent cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The stain was solubilized by adding 25% ethanol containing 50 mm sodium citrate, and the absorbance of each plate was determined at 595 nm. Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from keratinocytes using the RNeasy protect mini kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using the reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR analysis was performed using the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system and the Assays-on-Demand gene expression kit (Applied Biosystems). All samples were normalized to the signal generated from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The binding reactions contained radiolabeled 32P-NF-κB oligonucleotide probe (Pro-mega), cell extracts, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin to a final volume of 15 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, separated by 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. ROS Measurement—Keratinocytes were stimulated with TNF and incubated with 10 μm CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C, harvested, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and whole cell extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μm aprotinin, 0.5% Triton X-100). Cell extracts were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL Western blotting system (GE Healthcare). Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—Cytosolic fraction was obtained using cytochrome c release apoptosis assay kit (Calbiochem). Briefly, keratinocytes were collected by trypsinization and sonicated in cytosol extraction buffer. Homogenates were fractionated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Immunoblot was performed using monoclonal antibody against cytochrome c (BD Bioscience). Retroviral Infection—Retroviral vectors for c-Jun (pMX-puro-c-Jun) and IκbΔn (pQCXIP-IκBΔN) was generated by inserting c-Jun cDNA into the retroviral vector pMX-puro (22Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or IκBΔN into the retroviral vector pQCXIP (Clontech). IκBΔN cDNA was a gift from Dr. Ballard, Vanderbilt University (23Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EcoPack293 cells (BD Biosciences) were transiently transfected with pMX-puro-c-Jun or pQCXIP-IκBΔN. After 48 h culture, growth medium containing retrovirus was collected and filtered with 0.45-μm cellulose acetate membrane to remove packaging cells. Keratinocytes were incubated with the collected virus-containing medium with 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. Uninfected cells were removed by puromycin selection. Histology and TUNEL Staining—Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed on frozen sections using an apoptotic cell death detection kit (Pro-mega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on paraffin sections using polyclonal antibodies against K5, K6, Loricrin (Convance), and cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. TNF Induces Pro-cell Death Events in Tak1Δ/Δ Keratinocytes—We first determined which cell signaling events were induced in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes following TNF stimulation. Tak1 wild-type and Δ/Δ keratinocytes were isolated from Tak1flox/flox or K5-Cre Tak1flox/flox mice, respectively. In this floxed Tak1 system, Cre recombinase catalyzes the deletion of the TAK1 ATP binding site, amino acids 41-77, resulting in the generation of a truncated form of TAK1 (TAK1Δ) (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). As reported previously (17Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), TNF activated NF-κBin Tak1 wild-type keratinocytes, but this activation was largely abolished in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 1A, top panel). We next examined pro-cell death events, including activation of JNK, degradation of c-FLIP, and activation of caspase in Tak1 wild-type and Δ/Δ keratinocytes. TNF activated JNK in a transient manner, peaking at 10 min post-stimulation in Tak1 wild-type keratinocytes, whereas no transient JNK activation was detected in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 1A, third panel). Thus, TAK1 is essential for TNF-induced transient JNK activation, consistent with earlier studies using TAK1-deficient MEFs (14Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 18Shim J.-H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.-Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, JNK was greatly activated at 3-6 h after TNF stimulation in Tak1Δ/Δ but not in wild-type keratinocytes. It has been reported that ROS accumulation activates JNK in a prolonged manner following TNF stimulation (9Sakon S. Xue X. Takekawa M. Sasazuki T. Okazaki T. Kojima Y. Piao J.H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Doi T. Nakano H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 10Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). Prolonged activation of JNK has been linked to c-FLIP degradation and subsequent caspase activation (10Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). We examined c-FILP degradation and caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1A, fifth and sixth panels). As anticipated, c-FLIP was degraded and caspase-3 was activated in Tak1Δ/Δ but not in wild-type keratinocytes. We measured ROS production using CM-H2DCFDA, a substrate that exhibits increased fluorescence when oxidized by intracellular ROS (Fig. 1B). The levels of ROS were greatly increased in Tak1Δ/Δ but not in wild-type keratinocytes following TNF stimulation. We also examined whether cell death is through the apoptotic or necrotic pathways. Apoptosis and necrosis were assessed by Annexin V binding and propidium iodide staining (Fig. 1C). The numbers of both apoptotic and necrotic cells were greatly increased in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes at 2-6 h post-TNF stimulation. Cytochrome c was increased in the cytoplasm in TNF-stimulated Tak1Δ/Δ but not in wild-type keratinocytes (Fig. 1D), suggesting that TNF activates the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TNF induces pro-cell death events including activation of JNK and caspase-3 in TAK1Δ/Δ keratinocytes, which occur concomitantly with accumulation of ROS, resulting in apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Inhibition of ROS Completely Blocks TNF-induced Cell Death in Tak1Δ/Δ Keratinocytes—It is known that ROS activates JNK resulting in activation of caspases through c-FLIP degradation. Furthermore, the activation of JNK and caspase-3 in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes occurred concomitantly with ROS accumulation. Therefore, we assume that ROS is the cause of these pro-cell death events. We examined the effect of inhibiting ROS with antioxidants on TNF-induced pro-cell death events. Cells were treated with the antioxidant BHA and the activation of JNK and caspase-3 and c-FLIP degradation examined (Fig. 2A). BHA could abolish all these pro-cell death events. We also measured apoptosis and cell viability. BHA could completely inhibit an increase of apoptotic cells following TNF stimulation in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, BHA and another antioxidant N-acetylcysteine could totally block TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that ROS is the major mediator of TNF-induced cell death in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes. NF-κB Deficiency Does Not Effectively Induce ROS or Apoptosis in TNF-stimulated Keratinocytes—Our results thus far demonstrated that TAK1 deficiency causes ROS accumulation upon TNF stimulation, which results in apoptotic and necrotic cell death. One likely mechanism by which TAK1 deficiency causes ROS accumulation is a lack of activation of NF-κB. It is known that NF-κB regulates several enzymes and molecules that are involved in ROS metabolism such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and ferritin heavy chain (10Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 24Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K.

To examine the role of NF-κB in TNF-induced cell death in keratinocytes, we generated wild-type keratinocytes stably expressing the repressor of NF-κB, IκBΔN(IκBΔN keratinotyes). We used Tak1 wild-type keratinocytes isolated from the littermate mice of those we isolated from our Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes. Therefore, the backgrounds of Tak1Δ/Δ and IκBΔN keratinocytes are similar. We confirmed that TNF-induced NF-κB activation was completely abolished in IκBΔN keratinocytes (Fig. 3A). We examined TNF-induced ROS accumulation, apoptosis, and cell death. Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes exhibited a large increase of ROS at 5 h and ROS could not be measured due to cell death at 16 h after TNF stimulation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, ROS was not increased even at 16 h in IκBΔN keratinocytes (Fig. 3B). Annexin V-binding positive cells were also not increased in IκBΔN keratinocytes (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that TAK1 regulates ROS and cell death not through NF-κB. In MEFs, MnSOD is one of the major targets of NF-κB and regulates ROS (10Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). To further examine the involvement of NF-κB in ROS regulation in keratinocytes, we observed the expression levels of MnSOD following TNF stimulation (Fig. 3D). A chemokine MIP2, which is a NF-κB target, was greatly increased by TNF in Tak1 wild-type keratinocytes, indicating that NF-κB was activated under this experimental condition. However, unlike MEFs, MnSOD was not increased by TNF in keratinocytes and TAK1 deficiency did not decrease the level of MnSOD. Collectively, we conclude that NF-κB is not primarily important for ROS regulation at least in keratinocytes. Finally, we examined TNF-induced cell death at 24 h after stimulation. Cell death was moderately increased in IκBΔN keratinocytes, however, cell death was significantly less compared with that in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that TAK1 deficiency causes an increase of ROS and cell death mainly not through the lack of NF-κB activation. We next examined the relationship between TAK1 and ROS. If TAK1 regulates ROS, TAK1 deficiency should cause an increase of sensitivity not only to TNF but also to ROS-induced cell death. We treated keratinocytes with tBHP, a prototypical organic oxidant. Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes died by 0.3 mm tBHP treatment (Fig. 3E, left panel), whereas Tak1 wild-type and IκBΔN keratinocytes were resistant to 0.5 mm tBHA and died with 1.0 mm tBHP treatment (Fig. 3F, right panel). These results demonstrate that TAK1 but not NF-κB affects sensitivity to ROS-induced cell death in keratinocytes, suggesting that TAK1 regulates ROS mainly through non-NF-κB mechanisms. c-Jun Is Partially Involved in TAK1 Regulation of ROS—We next attempted to determine the mechanism by which TAK1 regulates ROS. TAK1 can activate two groups of transcription factors, namely NF-κB and AP1. As described above, we found that ROS is regulated through non-NF-κB mechanisms. Therefore, we examined the levels of AP1 family transcription factors including the Jun family and c-Fos. We also examined CREB. Among these, we found that the levels of c-Jun were reduced in TAK1-deficient keratinocytes under the basal condition (Fig. 4, A and B). The level of c-Jun was not significantly altered by TNF stimulation both in wild-type and Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes. Thus, only the basal level of c-Jun is regulated by TAK1. TAK1 is activated by the number of stimuli including cytokines and stresses (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 25HuangFu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28802-28810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), which presumably are constitutively present at low levels even in unstimulated conditions. We speculate that TAK1 may be constitutively activated at a low level under the normal culture conditions, and this constitutive activity of TAK1 is important to maintain the basal level of c-Jun. We hypothesized that TAK1-dependent basal expression of c-Jun is involved in ROS regulation and cell survival. To examine this possibility, we generated Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes that ectopically express c-Jun (Fig. 4C), and examined accumulation of ROS, apoptosis, and cell death following TNF stimulation. We found that the levels of ROS were reduced by c-Jun expression in TNF-treated Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes (Fig. 4D). Concomitantly, TNF-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced in c-Jun expressing keratinocytes (Fig. 4E). However, cell viability at 24 h after TNF stimulation was not greatly rescued by c-Jun expression (Fig. 4F). We note that higher levels of c-Jun expression did not increase the level of rescuing the TNF-induced cell death (data not shown). These results suggest that the TAK1-c-Jun pathway participates in ROS regulation but is not sufficient to rescue cell death at later time points. Antioxidants Rescue the Skin Disorder in Mice Caused by Epidermal-specific Deletion of TAK1—Our results in cultured keratinocytes indicate that TAK1-dependent ROS regulation is important for cell survival. Finally, we asked whether ROS are the cause of keratinocyte death and subsequent skin inflammation in mice harboring an epidermal-specific deletion of TAK1. Mice with an epidermal-specific deletion of Tak1 were born at the expected Mendelian ratio but developed a severe skin inflammatory condition and were lethal by postnatal days 6-7. Because small pups are difficult to effectively treat with antioxidants, we generated mice with epidermal-specific inducible Tak1 deletion. We crossed homozygous Tak1-floxed (Tak1flox/flox) mice to transgenic mice expressing the tamoxifen-dependent Cre-ERT recombinase under the control of the cytokeratin K14 promoter (K14-CreERT) (21Vasioukhin V. Degenstein L. Wise B. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The resulting mice (K14-CreERT Tak1flox/flox) were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and grew normally, at least until the age of 6-7 months. To induce deletion of the Tak1 gene, we topically treated the K14-CreERT Tak1flox/flox mice with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), an active metabolite of tamoxifen. We confirmed that this treatment induced deletion of TAK1 by PCR, using a primer set that could only detect the deleted allele of Tak1 (Fig. 5B). The mutant mice harboring an epidermal-specific Tak1 deletion developed an inflammatory skin condition 2-5 days after treatment with 4-OHT. The inflammatory conditions were severe and similar to the conditions in the constitutive epidermal specific Tak1 deletion mice at postnatal days 5-7 (17Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mutant epidermis was hyperplastic, hypertophic, and hyperkeratotic, and microabscesses were commonly found (supplementary Fig. S1A). An inflamed skin marker K6 was highly expressed in the entire area where 4-OHT was treated (supplementary Fig. S1B). Expression of the epidermal differentiation marker loricrin was diminished and apoptotic keratinocytes are greatly increased all over the 4-OHT-treated skin (supplementary Fig. S1B). To examine whether ROS are the cause of this inflammation, we fed the mice food containing BHA. The mice consuming food containing BHA showed less flaky skin compared with the TAK1-deficient littermates who did not consume BHA (Fig. 5A). Histological analysis revealed that BHA decreased epidermal hyperplasia, infiltration of immune cells, and hyperkeratotic stratum corneum that are frequently observed in TAK1-deficient epidermis (Fig. 5C). Importantly, keratinocyte death was significantly reduced in BHA-treated mice (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrated that ROS are the cause of the skin inflammation in mice having TAK1-deficient epidermis. TNF induces ROS, activation of JNK, degradation of c-FLIP, and activation of caspases in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes, and all of these events cooperatively promote cell death. Because inhibition of ROS could abolish pro-cell death events and ultimately blocked cell death in Tak1Δ/Δ keratinocytes, we surmise that accumulation of ROS in the TAK1-deficient keratinocytes is the central mediator of keratinocyte death. How Does TAK1 Regulate ROS?—ROS are regulated by a number of enzymes including NF-κB target gene products such as MnSOD and ferritin heavy chain (10Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 24Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E.

Sci. 2005; 30: 453-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). TAK1 is an essential intermediate in the TNF signaling pathway leading to activation of NF-κB transcription factors (Fig. 1A). Therefore, it was anticipated that TAK1 would influence the expression of MnSOD and/or ferritin heavy chain. However, we found that deletion of TAK1 did not affect their expression (Fig. 3D and data not shown). Moreover, we found that NF-κB-deficiency did not induce ROS following TNF stimulation (Fig. 3B). Thus, NF-κB does not regulate the level of ROS in keratinocytes, and the mechanisms mediated by other than NF-κB should be important for ROS regulation. We found that TAK1-dependent c-Jun expression may partially contribute to ROS regulation in keratinocytes. However, we could not totally block either TNF-induced ROS accumulation or cell death by ectopic expression of c-Jun. Therefore, TAK1 activates several mediators including c-Jun, and unidentified factors that may cooperatively regulate the levels of ROS in keratinocytes. We have recently found that intestinal epithelial specific Tak1 mutant mice die immediately after birth and they show massive epithelial cell death (19Kajino-Sakamoto R. Inagaki M. Lippert E. Akira S. Robine S. Matsumoto K. Jobin C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 1143-1152Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast, intestinal epithelial specific NF-κB-deficient (NEMO deletion) mice slowly develop intestinal inflammation by 6 weeks of age (20Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A. Gareus R. van Loo G. Danese S. Huth M. Nikolaev A. Neufert C. Madison B. Gumucio D. Neurath M.F. Pasparakis M. Nature. 2007; 446: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Our current results raise the possibility that Tak1 deletion increases ROS, thereby inducing cell death and tissue damage in intestinal epithelial specific Tak1 deletion mice more severely compared with the epithelial specific NEMO deletion mice. TAK1, ROS, and Psoriasis—ROS has been associated with psoriasis; however, it has not been determined whether ROS is the cause or the consequence of inflammation (28Bickers D.R. Athar M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 2565-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). We have shown here that Tak1 deletion causes dysregulation of ROS in keratinocytes, which is causally associated with skin inflammation (Ref. 17Omori E. Matsumoto K. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Smart R.C. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and Fig. 5). TAK1 can be activated by cytokines and innate immune stimuli including interleukin-1, TNF, and microbial components and stress conditions (13Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 25HuangFu W.-C. Omori E. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The levels of those TAK1 stimuli in the epithelial tissues may be fluctuated in vivo. For example, reduction of commensal bacteria decreases TAK1 activity, thereby increasing the accumulation of ROS. Such dysregulation in TAK1 activity may contribute to ROS-mediated epithelial inflammation. Our results warrant further studies on the relationship of the TAK1 signaling pathway, ROS metabolism, and psoriasis. We thank S. Akira for Tak1-floxed mice, D. Ballard for IκBΔN cDNA, and Y.

https://openalex.org/W2037657431,"Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor that plays a critical role in the glucose-mediated induction of gene products involved in hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis. Glucose affects the activity of ChREBP largely through post-translational mechanisms involving phosphorylation-dependent cellular localization. In this work we show that the N-terminal region of ChREBP (residues 1-251) regulates its subcellular localization via an interaction with 14-3-3. 14-3-3 binds an alpha-helix in this region (residues 125-135) to retain ChREBP in the cytosol, and binding of 14-3-3 is facilitated by phosphorylation of nearby Ser-140 and Ser-196. Phosphorylation of ChREBP at these sites was essential for its interaction with CRM1 for export to the cytosol, whereas nuclear import of ChREBP requires dephosphorylated ChREBP to interact with importin alpha. Notably, 14-3-3 appears to compete with importin alpha for ChREBP binding. 14-3-3beta bound to a synthetic peptide spanning residues 125-144 and bearing a phosphate at Ser-140 with a dissociation constant of 1.1 microm, as determined by isothermal calorimetry. The interaction caused a shift in the fluorescence maximum of the tryptophan residues of the peptide. The corresponding unphosphorylated peptide failed to bind 14-3-3beta. These results suggest that interactions with importin alpha and 14-3-3 regulate movement of ChREBP into and out of the nucleus, respectively, and that these interactions are regulated by the ChREBP phosphorylation status."
https://openalex.org/W1966468660,"Huntington disease (HD) is characterized by polyglutamine expansions of huntingtin (htt), but the underlying pathomechanisms have remained unclear. We studied brain mitochondria of transgenic HD rats with 51 glutamine repeats (htt(51Q)), modeling the adult form of HD. Ca(free)(2+) up to 2 mum activated state 3 respiration of wild type mitochondria with glutamate/malate or pyruvate/malate as substrates. Ca(free)(2+) above 2 mum inhibited respiration via cyclosporin A-dependent permeability transition (PT). Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, did not affect the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of respiration but reduced Ca(2+)-induced inhibition. Thus, Ca(2+) activation was mediated exclusively by extramitochondrial Ca(2+), whereas inhibition was promoted also by intramitochondrial Ca(2+). In contrast, htt(51Q) mitochondria showed a deficient state 3 respiration, a lower sensitivity to Ca(2+) activation, and a higher susceptibility to Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition. Furthermore htt(51Q) mitochondria exhibited a diminished membrane potential stability in response to Ca(2+), lower capacities and rates of Ca(2+) accumulation, and a decreased Ca(2+) threshold for PT in a substrate-independent but cyclosporin A-sensitive manner. Compared with wild type, Ca(2+)-induced inhibition of respiration of htt(51Q) mitochondria was less sensitive to ruthenium red, indicating the involvement of extramitochondrial Ca(2+). In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of mitochondrial regulation by extramitochondrial Ca(2+). We suggest that specific regulatory Ca(2+) binding sites on the mitochondrial surface, e.g. the glutamate/aspartate carrier (aralar), mediate this regulation. Interactions between htt(51Q) and distinct targets such as aralar and/or the PT pore may underlie mitochondrial dysregulation leading to energetic depression, cell death, and tissue atrophy in HD."

Deletions or mutations of genes involved in the p53 pathway are often associated with HBV-mediated HCC, indicating rescue from p53 apoptosis is a likely mechanism in HBV-HCC pathogenesis. Herein, we determined the mechanism by which pX sensitizes hepatocytes to p53-mediated apoptosis. Although it is well established that the Rb/E2F/ARF pathway stabilizes p53, and the DNA damage-activated ATM/ATR kinases activate p53, the mechanism that coordinates these two pathways has not been determined. We demonstrate that the p38MAPK pathway activated by pX serves this role in p53 apoptosis. Specifically, the activated p38MAPK pathway stabilizes p53 via E2F1-mediated ARF expression, and also activates the transcriptional function of p53 by activating ATR. Knockdown of p53, E2F1, ATR, or p38MAPKα abrogates pX-mediated apoptosis, demonstrating that E2F1, ATR, and p38MAPKα are all essential in p53 apoptosis in response to pX. Specifically, in response to pX expression, the p38MAPK pathway activates Cdk4 and Cdk2, leading to phosphorylation of Rb, release of E2F1, and transcription of ARF. The p38MAPK pathway also activates ATR, leading to phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-18 and Ser-23, transcription of pro-apoptotic genes Bax, Fas, and Noxa, and apoptosis. In conclusion, pX sensitizes hepatocytes to p53 apoptosis via activation of the p38MAPK pathway, which couples p53 stabilization and p53 activation, by E2F1 induction and ATR activation, respectively.

In this study, we investigate the mechanism of p53 activation by pX, employing the well-characterized 4pX-1 cell line (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol.

The significance of this cellular model is that pX expression is very low, resembling expression levels occurring in natural HBV infection (22Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In our earlier studies we have shown that pX sensitizes 4pX-1 cells to apoptosis only when challenged by additional sub-apoptotic signals such as growth factor deprivation, by activating the p38MAPK pathway (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have shown that pX expression induces sustained activation of the p38MAPK pathway within 6 h following serum withdrawal (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the absence of pX expression, serum withdrawal induces the p38MAPK pathway later, at 24 h. Thus, the effect of pX on the activation of the p38MAPK pathway precedes the effect of serum withdrawal. Moreover, inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway by SB 202190 inhibits pX-mediated apoptosis. Accordingly, our earlier studies (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have clearly established that the activation of the p38MAPK pathway by pX is necessary for initiation of pX-mediated apoptosis. The role of the p38MAPK pathway in pX-mediated apoptosis remains to be determined. Herein we demonstrate that the p38MAPK pathway, activated by pX following growth factor withdrawal, induces p53 stabilization by E2F1-mediated ARF expression. The p38MAPK pathway also induces the transcriptional activity of p53 by activating ATR, leading to phosphorylation of Ser-18 and Ser-23 of murine p53. Knockdown of p53, E2F1, ATR, or p38MAPKα abrogates pX-mediated apoptosis, identifying the essential role of the p38MAPK pathway, E2F1, and ATR in p53 apoptosis. We conclude that activation of the p38MAPK pathway by the weakly oncogenic pX couples the stabilization and activation of p53, via ARF induction and ATR activation, respectively, leading to p53-mediated apoptosis.

Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Specifically, 4pX-1 cultures expressing pX via the Tet-off expression system (22Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), exhibit sustained activation of the p38MAPK pathway within 6 h following growth factor withdrawal. By contrast, in the absence of pX expression, serum withdrawal induces the p38MAPK pathway later at 24 h. Thus, the effect of pX on the activation of the p38MAPK pathway precedes the effect of serum withdrawal. Moreover, inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway by SB 202190 inhibits pX-mediated apoptosis. Thus, our earlier studies (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) established that the activation of the p38MAPK pathway by pX is necessary for initiation of pX-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, the pX-mediated activation of the p38MAPK pathway induces expression of TNFRI/TNF-α, Fas/FasL, and p53-regulated genes Fas, Bax, and Noxa (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Expression of pro-apoptotic p53-regulated genes in response to pX suggested the involvement of p53 in pX-mediated apoptosis, in agreement with earlier observations (30Chirillo P. Pagano S. Natoli G. Puri P.L. Burgio V.L. Balsano C. Levrero M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8162-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which pX stabilizes and activates pro-apoptotic p53 transcription is unknown. To obtain initial indications whether pX activates p53 transcription, the p53-responsive luciferase constructs p53-Luc, pBax-Luc (23Lee S. Tarn C. Wang W.H. Chen S. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8730-8740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and pFas-Luc (31Cerrato J.A. Khan T. Koul D. Lang F.F. Conrad C.A. Yung W.K. Liu T.J. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 409-417PubMed Google Scholar) were transiently transfected in apoptotic 4pX-1 cells. All p53-responsive promoters display induction in response to pX expression (Fig. 1A). Treatment with 10 μm PFT-α, known to specifically inhibit p53 transcriptional activity (29Murphy P.J. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Harrell J.M. Kwok R.P. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30195-30201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), inhibits induction by pX from the p53-dependent reporter, without significantly inhibiting NFκB- or NFAT-driven luciferase expression, suggesting pX activates p53 (Fig. 1A). To confirm the effect of pX on p53 transcriptional activation and pX-mediated apoptosis, we examined expression of the endogenous p53-regulated genes Bax and p21, in a time course, following incubation of 4pX-1 cells in apoptotic conditions by growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 1B). pX induces expression of both p21 and Bax, as early as 3 h following incubation in apoptotic conditions. Importantly, by 12 h pX mediates a 3-fold increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax in comparison to a 1.6-fold increase in expression of the growth arrest gene p21, suggesting the involvement of p53 in apoptosis, in response to pX expression. To determine whether p53 activation is involved in pX-dependent apoptosis, radioactive DNA fragmentation assays were performed in apoptotic 4pX-1 cultures, as a function of PFT-α addition (Fig. 1C). PFT-α profoundly inhibits onset of apoptosis in response to pX (Fig. 1C). Likewise, PFT-α inhibits pX-dependent caspase3 activation and apoptosis, assayed by the cell-permeable fluorigenic Z-DEVD-FMK caspase3 substrate (Fig. 1D). To directly demonstrate involvement of p53 in pX-mediated apoptosis, a 4pX-1 p53 knockdown (kd) cell line was generated, 4pX-1-p53kd, displaying more than 90% silencing of p53. p53-responsive luciferase plasmids transfected in the 4pX-1-p53kd cell line do not exhibit pX-dependent induction. Importantly, this cell line is resistant to apoptosis in response to pX expression (Fig. 1D), assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy, using the cell-permeable fluorigenic Z-DEVD-FMK caspase3 substrate (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Together, these results (Fig. 1) support that pX activates p53 and induces p53-mediated apoptosis. p53 Stabilization by pX Requires Activation of the p38MAPK Pathway—Our earlier studies (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have linked apoptosis by pX to activation of the p38MAPK pathway. Because our results now show that p53 mediates apoptosis in response to pX expression (Fig. 1), we investigated the link between the p38MAPK pathway and p53. A p38MAPKα knockdown cell line (4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd) was constructed, exhibiting ∼80% reduction in the endogenous p38MAPKα (Fig. 2A). Employing the 4pX-1 and 4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd cell lines, we investigated whether pX stabilizes p53, and if p53 stability is dependent on activation of the p38MAPK pathway. Confluent, 4pX-1, and 4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd cultures were grown as a function of pX expression, and apoptosis was initiated by serum withdrawal (21Wang W.H. Gregori G. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 10352-10365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide was added 2 h after onset of apoptosis. p53 protein levels were determined by Western blot analyses and quantified in a time course, following cycloheximide addition (Fig. 2, B and C). In 4pX-1 cells grown in the absence of pX, 50% of p53 remains 30 min after cycloheximide addition, reaching basal levels by 120 min. By contrast, in the presence of pX, 80% of p53 remains at the 30-min interval, decreasing to 60% by 60 min, and reaching the basal level 180 min after cycloheximide addition. The half-life of p53 is estimated to be ∼30 min in apoptotic 4pX-1 cultures without pX, whereas in the presence of pX, the p53 half-life is increased to 75 min, demonstrating that pX stabilizes p53. Interestingly, in 4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd cells expressing pX, knockdown of the p38MAPKα decreased the half-life of p53 to 45 min, indicating the p38MAPK pathway plays a role in pX-mediated stabilization of p53. Similar conclusions were derived from pulse-chase studies of p53, employing in vivo metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, in conjunction with treatment using the p38MAPK pathway inhibitor SB202190 (data not shown). The p38MAPK Pathway Activated by pX Promotes E2F1 Function via Cdk4/Cdk2 Activation—The E2F family of transcription factors is sequestered from function by binding to unphosphorylated Rb. Activated Cdk4 and Cdk2 phosphorylate Rb, releasing E2Fs which mediate transcription of either proliferative S-phase genes, or pro-apoptotic genes such as Arf (7Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A.

To obtain initial indications whether pX induces E2F1 activity, the E2F1-responsive APAF-Luc (33Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3890-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reporters were transiently transfected in apoptotic 4pX-1 cultures. pX expression promoted a 3–4-fold luciferase induction (Fig. 3A), suggesting that pX mediates E2F1 release. Based on these observations, we determined the phosphorylation status of Rb in pX-expressing cells grown in apoptotic conditions. Enhanced Rb phosphorylation was observed in apoptotic 4pX-1 cultures expressing pX, detected by Western blot analyses with the phospho-Rb Ser-800/804 antibody (Fig. 3B). Specifically, in pX-expressing 4pX-1 cells, phosphorylation of Rb increased by 8-fold starting 0 to 12 h after growth factor withdrawal. By contrast, in 4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd cells expressing pX, only a 1.5-fold increase in Rb phosphorylation is observed (Fig. 3B), supporting that the pX-activated p38MAPK pathway is required for Rb phosphorylation. Because Rb phosphorylation is mediated by G1 phase cyclin-dependent kinases, we examined by in vitro immunocomplex kinase assays, the level of Cdk4 activation as a function of pX expression (Fig. 3C). Employing extracts isolated from apoptotic 4pX-1 cells, we demonstrate that Cdk4 activation is maintained for 12 h following onset of apoptosis in the presence of pX. Inhibition of the p38MAPK pathway by SB202190 suppresses this pX-dependent Cdk4 activation, whereas inhibition of the JNK pathway by treatment with SP600125 has only a small effect (Fig. 3C). To further confirm these results, we also examined the activation state of Cdk2, and its link to the p38MAPK pathway. A critical step in Cdk2 activation, similar to Cdc2 activation (35Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar), is dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 (36Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar). Employing extracts from the 4pX-1 and 4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd cell lines, we monitored by Western blot analyses the phosphorylation state of Tyr-15 of Cdk2 as a function of pX expression (Fig. 3D). In 4pX-1 cells grown in apoptotic conditions for 12 h, pX expression results in Tyr-15 dephosphorylation of Cdk2, indicating pX mediates activation of Cdk2. By contrast, the inhibitory Tyr-15 phosphorylation is maintained in 4pX-1 cells not expressing pX, as well as in pX-expressing cells in which p38MAPKα has been knocked-down (4pX-1-p38MAPKαkd cells). We interpret these results to mean that pX cannot activate Cdk2 in the absence of the p38MAPK pathway. We conclude activation of the p38MAPK by pX expression mediates activation of Cdk4 and Cdk2, in turn phosphorylating Rb. Phosphorylation of Rb results in release of E2F leading to transcription of E2F-responsive genes. Functional E2F1 binding sites have been mapped in the promoters of Arf (7Bates S. Phillips A.C.

https://openalex.org/W2093010275,"A body of evidence is emerging that shows a requirement for ephrin ligands in the proper migration of cells, and the formation of cell and tissue boundaries. These processes are dependent on the cell–cell adhesion system, which plays a crucial role in normal morphogenetic processes during development, as well as in invasion and metastasis1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Although ephrinB ligands are bi-directional signalling molecules, the precise mechanism by which ephrinB1 signals through its intracellular domain to regulate cell–cell adhesion in epithelial cells remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that ephrinB1 associates with the Par polarity complex protein Par-6 (a scaffold protein required for establishing tight junctions) and can compete with the small GTPase Cdc42 for association with Par-6. This competition causes inactivation of the Par complex, resulting in the loss of tight junctions. Moreover, the interaction between ephrinB1 and Par-6 is disrupted by tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of ephrinB1. Thus, we have identified a mechanism by which ephrinB1 signalling regulates cell–cell junctions in epithelial cells, and this may influence how we devise therapeutic interventions regarding these molecules in metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1980201109,"Stromal cell-derived factor alpha (SDF1alpha) and its cognate receptor CXCR4 play an important role in neuronal development in the hippocampus, but the genes directly regulated by SDF1alpha/CXCR4 signaling are unknown. To study the role of CXCR4 targeted genes in neuronal development, we used neuronal cultures established from embryonic day 18 rats. Hippocampal neurons express CXCR4 receptor proteins and are stimulated by SDF1alpha resulting in activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and the transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein. SDF1alpha rapidly induces the expression of the early growth response gene Egr1, a transcription factor involved in activity-dependent neuronal responses, in a concentration-dependent manner. Gel-shift analysis showed that SDF1alpha enhances DNA binding activity to the Egr1-containing promoter for GAD67. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis using an Egr1 antibody indicated that SDF1alpha stimulation increases binding of Egr1 to a GAD67 promoter DNA sequence. SDF1alpha stimulation increases the expression of GAD67 at both the mRNA and protein levels, and increases the amount and neurite localization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neurons already expressing GABA. SDF1alpha-induced Egr1/GAD67 expression is mediated by the G protein-coupled CXCR4 receptor and activation of the ERK pathway. Reduction of Egr1 gene expression using small interfering RNA technology lowers the level of GAD67 transcripts and inhibits SDF1alpha-induced GABA production. Inhibition of CXCR4 activation in the developing mouse brain in utero greatly reduced Egr1 and GAD67 mRNA levels and GAD67 protein levels, suggesting a pivotal role for CXCR4 signaling in the development of GABAergic neurons in vivo. Our data suggest that SDF1alpha/CXCR4/G protein/ERK signaling induces the expression of the GAD67 system via Egr1 activation, a mechanism that may promote the maturation of GABAergic neurons during development."

Although it is not yet feasible to assemble these data into a single phylogenetic tree of life, it is possible to quantify how much phylogenetic signal is present. Analysis of 14,289 phylogenies built from 2.6 million sequences in GenBank suggests that signal is strong in vertebrates and specific groups of nonvertebrate model organisms. Across eukaryotes, however, although phylogenetic evidence is very broadly distributed, for the average species in the database it is equivalent to less than one well-supported gene tree. This analysis shows that a stronger sampling effort aimed at genomic depth, in addition to taxonomic breadth, will be required to build high-resolution phylogenetic trees at this scale."
https://openalex.org/W2136182947,"Maurocalcine (MCa), initially identified from a Tunisian scorpion venom, defines a new member of the family of cell penetrating peptides by its ability to efficiently cross the plasma membrane. The initiating mechanistic step required for the cell translocation of a cell penetrating peptide implicates its binding onto cell surface components such as membrane lipids and/or heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Here we characterized the interaction of wild-type MCa and MCa K20A, a mutant analogue with reduced cell-penetration efficiency, with heparin (HP) and heparan sulfates (HS) through surface plasma resonance. HP and HS bind both to MCa, indicating that heparan sulfate proteoglycans may represent an important entry route of the peptide. This is confirmed by the fact that (i) both compounds bind with reduced affinity to MCa K20A and (ii) the cell penetration of wild-type or mutant MCa coupled to fluorescent streptavidin is reduced by about 50% in mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines lacking either all glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or just HS. Incubating MCa with soluble HS, HP, or chondroitin sulfates also inhibits the cell penetration of MCa-streptavidin complexes. Analyses of the cell distributions of MCa/streptavidin in several Chinese hamster ovary cell lines show that the distribution of the complex coincides with the endosomal marker Lyso-Tracker red and is not affected by the absence of GAGs. The distribution of MCa/streptavidin is not coincident with that of transferrin receptors nor affected by a dominant-negative dynamin 2 K44A mutant, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, entry of the complex is greatly diminished by amiloride, indicating the importance of macropinocytosis in MCa/streptavidin entry. It is concluded that (i) interaction of MCa with GAGs quantitatively improves the cell penetration of MCa, and (ii) GAG-dependent and -independent MCa penetration rely similarly on the macropinocytosis pathway."

Increasing evidence supports a role for the NADPH oxidase dual oxidase (Duox) as an important source for regulated H2O2 production in the respiratory tract epithelium. In this study Duox expression, function, and regulation were investigated in a fully differentiated, mucociliary airway epithelium model. Duox-mediated H2O2 generation was dependent on calcium flux, which was required for dissociation of the NADPH oxidase regulatory protein Noxa1 from plasma membrane-bound Duox. A functional Duox1-based oxidase was reconstituted in model cell lines to permit mutational analysis of Noxa1 and Duox1. Although the activation domain of Noxa1 was not required for Duox function, mutation of a proline-rich domain in the Duox C terminus, a potential interaction motif for the Noxa1 Src homology domain 3, caused up-regulation of basal and stimulated H2O2 production. Similarly, knockdown of Noxa1 in airway cells increased basal H2O2 generation. Our data indicate a novel, inhibitory function for Noxa1 in Duox regulation. This represents a new paradigm for control of NADPH oxidase activity, where second messenger-promoted conformational change of the Nox structure promotes oxidase activation by relieving constraint induced by regulatory components.

Pulmonary oxidant stress is associated with disease states, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, hyperoxia, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. On the other hand, ROS are important second messengers in various biological processes such as cellular signaling, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Burdon R.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 775-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and play a pivotal role in host defense against microbial infection (2Babior B.M.

In phagocytic cells, the Nox2 (gp91phox)-based NADPH oxidase constitutes the main source for ROS generation in response to pathogens. This oxidase consists of at least six components as follows: Nox2, p22phox, p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and the GTPase Rac. In resting cells, p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox exist in the cytosol as a complex, whereas p22phox and Nox2 form the heterodimer cytochrome b558, which is located in the plasma membrane (4Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Upon activation, multiple phosphorylations and conformational changes occur, permitting translocation of the cytosolic proteins and association with the Nox2-p22phox complex. This active oxidase complex then catalyzes the one-electron reduction of oxygen to O2- at the expense of NADPH (5Yu L. Quinn M.T. Cross A.R. Dinauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nonphagocytic cells can also produce ROS, albeit usually at much lower levels when compared with the output of the phagocyte oxidase (6Cross A.R. Jones O.T. Biochim. Biophys.

Many different ROS sources are implicated in these cell types, including the mitochondrial electron transport chain and NADPH oxidases (Nox). Six Nox homologs with restricted tissue expression profiles have been identified. The Nox family is now comprised of Nox1–4, whose features resemble the phagocyte gp91phox (now Nox2), and Nox5, which possesses four EF hands. The additional members, Duox1 and Duox2, are characterized by an N-terminal extracellular peroxidase homology domain, followed by a transmembrane segment and an EF hand-containing cytosolic region, which connects to a Nox2 homology structure. Unlike their Nox homologs, mature Duox enzymes release hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) without forming a detectable amount of superoxide. This distinct feature of Duox may be caused by the rapid conversion of superoxide via intramolecular dismutation (8Ameziane-El-Hassani R. Morand S. Boucher J.L. Frapart Y.M. Apostolou D. Agnandji D.

In mammals, Duox1 and Duox2 were first characterized in the thyroid as essential H2O2-generating enzymes (9Dupuy C. Ohayon R. Valent A. Noel-Hudson M.S. Deme D. Virion A. J. Biol.

At the apical surface of the thyrocytes, H2O2 is the final electron acceptor for the thyroperoxidase-catalyzed biosynthesis of thyroid hormone (11De Deken X. Wang D. Dumont J.E. Miot F. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The critical role of Duox in thyroid hormone synthesis has been confirmed by the development of congenital hypothyroidism in patients with inactivating Duox2 mutations (12Moreno J.C. Bikker H.

A contribution of Duox to the host innate immune response was recently suggested in Drosophila melanogaster and by in vitro studies, where H2O2 generated by Duox might be used by lactoperoxidase to oxidize thiocyanate anions present in the air-surface liquid to antimicrobial hypothiocyanite (3Moskwa P.

Pharmacol. 2001; 429: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), indicating that ROS production has to be tightly regulated to ensure its targeted and limited generation. The activation of Nox2, Nox1, and Nox3 relies on regulatory proteins such as the GTPase Rac and the proteins p47phox, p67phox, and their homologs Noxo1 and Noxa1, respectively (19Geiszt M.

Of importance is their activation domain that is located adjacent to the GTP-Rac-binding tetratrico-peptide repeat domain. Introducing an alanine for valine in position 204 of the p67phox activation domain renders the Nox2-based NADPH oxidase inactive (25Han C.H. Freeman J.L. Lee T. Motalebi S.A. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Little is known about the regulation of Duox enzymes in the lung. Although ROS production by Duox is dependent on calcium flux and seems not to require Rac, more in-depth analysis of Duox regulation has not been performed. We decided to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating Duox in the context of primary human airway epithelial cells. Characterization of ROS generation in a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelial model indicates an important role for Duox as apical H2O2 source. We present evidence of a functional interaction between membrane-localized Duox and Noxa1, which is disrupted in the presence of calcium. Our data suggest that Noxa1 plays a vital role in stabilizing the inactive state of Duox in resting cells, possibly to prevent Duox-mediated ROS generation by transient, low level calcium flux. Antibodies and Plasmids—Polyclonal antibodies directed against c-Myc (A-14) and anti-RhoGDI (A-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and actin (A2066) was from Sigma. The expression plasmid for hDuox1 in pcDNA3.1 was kindly provided by F. Miot and subcloned into pGEX-2T. A point mutation, Duox1 (P1497A), was prepared by QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent-Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. The full coding sequence of hDuoxA1 was amplified by PCR with Platinum® Pfx (Invitrogen) using total RNA of small airway epithelial cells and specific primers (GenBank™ accession number DQ489735). DuoxA1 was cloned into pcDNA3.1. after adding in-frame a 3′ Myc tag. The expression plasmid for hNoxa1 in pRK5Myc was kindly provided by T. Leto. The Noxa1(V205A) and Noxa1(W436R) mutations were prepared by QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent-Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Duox1 calcium-binding domain (amino acids 775–1026, GST-Duox1-Δ1), Duox1 C-terminal wild type (amino acids 1270–1551, GST-Duox1-Δ2) or mutated GST-Duox1M-Δ2 P1497A), the Nox2 C terminus (amino acids 290–570, GST-Nox2-Δ), or the Nox1 C terminus (amino acids 290–565, GST-Nox1-Δ) and full-length Noxa1 were inserted into pGEX-4T-3 (GE Healthcare). Proteins were expressed and affinity-purified according to standard protocols. Recombinant Noxa1 was purified after thrombin cleavage to remove the GST moiety, assessed for purity and identity by Coomassie Blue staining, and immunoblotting. Purified GST-Duox-Δ1 and Noxa1 proteins were used for polyclonal antibody generation. Antibody specificity controls were performed (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B). The Duox antibody detects Duox1 and Duox2 at 180 kDa. Cell Culture—Small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) were purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD) and used at culture passages 3–4. Cells were grown in serum-free medium (SABM, Lonza) supplemented with SAGM SingleQuots (Lonza) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For the differentiated lung epithelial model (three-dimensional), cells were detached with trypsin and seeded onto inserts (Costar Transwell-clear culture insert, 0.4 μm pore; Corning Costar) coated with human placenta collagen type VI (15 μg/cm2; Sigma). Airway epithelial cells in three dimensions were grown in serum-free culture medium (50% SABM, 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose) supplemented with defined growth factors in the SingleQuots and 20–50 nm retinoic acid, prepared freshly to induce differentiation. After 2–4 days in immersed culture conditions, cell culture was switched to an air-liquid interface system for 3 weeks. Differentiation was assessed by MUC5AC expression, mucin production, resistance, and permeability measurement and electron microscopy. NCI-H292, A549, HEK293, HeLa, and H661 cells were cultured in the appropriate media. Cells were preincubated with DPI (25 μm) or BAPTA/AM (0–0.75 μm; BD Biosciences) for 10 and 5 min, respectively, before exposure to stimuli. Cells were treated with ionomycin (2–3 μm, Sigma) for 30–60 min. Expression Analysis of Nox/Duox and NADPH Oxidase Components—Total RNA was extracted from NCI-H292 cells, A549 cells, or SAEC cells grown in monolayer or on inserts by using RNAzol B reagent (TelTest, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amplification by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed. Briefly, cDNA was generated from 1 to 2 μg of extracted total RNA using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. cDNAs were amplified by standard PCR using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen), except for Noxa1 and Noxo1 PCR, which were performed with the Advantage-GC 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences). Sense and antisense primers were designed based on human sequences published in GenBank™. The primers used were as follows: 5′-CCATCGACTACACGCAGCTG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTAGGCAGTCGACGTGCAGC-3′ (reverse primer) for Noxa1 cDNA; 5′-GCAGGACATCAACCCTGCACTCTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTGCCATCTACCACACGGATCTGC-3′ (reverse primer) for Duox1 cDNA; 5′-ATGTTCTTTCCGACGTGGTGAGCGTGGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGAATCCAGTAGTTGTTGCAGACCCTGAGA-3′ (reverse primer) for Duox2 cDNA; 5′-GCAGTTTAAGACCATTGCAGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTCAGGTTCTCCATGACTCCG-3′ (reverse primer) for Nox5 long form cDNA; 5′-CAATCCCTGTGCTCCTGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GTCTGACGTTTCCAACACGC-3′ (reverse primer) for Noxo1 cDNA; and 5′-CGGGATTCACAATGGGAAACTGGGTGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CAAGATAGAAGCAAAGGGGGTGAC-3′ (reverse primer) for Nox1 cDNA. RT-PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels and visualized by UV. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Treatment—Double strand siRNA targeting hDuox was designed with BLOCK-it RNAi Designer (Invitrogen) to target both Duox1 and Duox2 (GenBank™ accession numbers AF213465 and AF267981, respectively). Predesigned hNoxa1 siRNA sets (NOXA1HSS145807, NOXA1HSS145808, and NOXA1HSS145809) were purchased from Invitrogen. The sequences of Duox siRNA 1 were (sense) GGACAAGGAGGAACUGACAUGGGAA and (antisense) UUCCCAUGUCAGUUCCUCCUU GUCC, and the sequences of Duox siRNA 2 were (sense) GCAUAAGUUUGAGGUGUCAGUGUUA and (antisense) UAACACUGACACCUCAAACUUAUGC. Silencer Negative Control siRNA GC medium (Invitrogen) was used as control siRNA. siRNA transfection into cells was carried out by using Lipofectamine 2000. To optimize conditions, different concentrations of siRNA (1–100 nm) and various duration of RNAi treatment were applied. Two separate transfections of the same cell population with siRNA were performed before ROS generation was measured. Measurement of H2O2 Release—H2O2 generation was determined by measuring the oxidation of homovanillic acid (HVA) into its fluorescent derivative in the presence of horseradish peroxidase as described previously (27Martyn K.D. Frederick L.M. von Loehneysen K. Dinauer M.C. Knaus U.G. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The activity is expressed in fluorescent units or quantified using a standard curve obtained by incubating increasing amounts of H2O2 (0–25 μm) in HVA solution. In parallel, cells were scraped and lysed in RIPA buffer, and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (28Dinauer M.C. Pierce E.A. Bruns G.A. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). H2O2 generation was then normalized to the protein concentration. The calcium dependence of H2O2 production was determined by assaying cells in parallel in HVA solution prepared with calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline or by preincubating cells with BAPTA/AM as described above. Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—Protein extracts in Laemmli buffer (2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol) were homogenized by repeatedly passing through a 0.24-mm gauge syringe to obtain total lysate. Protein samples were heated 5 min at 65 °C for Duox detection and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked in TBS containing 5% fat-free dry milk and 0.1% Tween before incubation with primary antibodies and secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies. Detection was achieved by ECL (Pierce). A nondenaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 5 mm EGTA, and inhibitors mixture set I and II (Sigma), pH 7.4) was used for immunoprecipitation experiments. After preclearing, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with Noxa1 antibody and then bound to a mix of 50% protein A- and G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. The effect of calcium on complex formation between Duox and Noxa1 was analyzed by adding water or calcium chloride (5 and 10 mm) to lysates (prepared with 5 mm EGTA-containing lysis buffer, see above) and split into equal aliquots before addition. Free final calcium concentration in the experiment was estimated to be 0.3–1 μm. Immunofluorescence—SAEC, NCI-292, and A459 cells were seeded on a glass coverslips coated with human placenta collagen type VI (10 μg/ml), HEK293, and HeLa cells on polylysine or fibronectin. At 60% confluence or after transfection (siRNA or overexpression), the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either anti-Duox or anti-Noxa1 antibody in 2% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Rabbit preimmune sera were used to verify the specificity of the staining. The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 568 (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted and examined with indirect immunofluorescence (Olympus IX70) and confocal microscopy (×6, MRC 2100; Bio-Rad). All images are representative of several independent experiments recording multiple cells in different sections of the coverslip. Cell Fractionation—With or without stimulation, cells were harvested and resuspended in relaxation buffer (KCl 100 mm, NaCl 3 mm, MgCl2 3.5 mm, EGTA 1 mm, Hepes 10 mm, PIPES 0.5 mm, pH 7.4). The cells were then disrupted by two 15-s cycles of sonication at 4 °C using a microprobe sonicator (Microson XL). Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S1) was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in an Optima TLX ultracentrifuge with a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The high speed supernatant (S2) represented the soluble cytosolic fraction. The pellet (P2) was resuspended in relaxation buffer with vigorous mixing, and this sample was again centrifuged for 15 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The final supernatant (S3) represented a wash fraction. The final pellet (P3), representing the membrane fraction, was resuspended in relaxation buffer. An equivalent of 100–200 μg of protein was resolved by gel electrophoresis, and the membranes were probes for Noxa1, Duox, actin, RhoGDI, HSP72, or epidermal growth factor receptor. Pulldown Assay—Recombinant GST, GST-Duox1-Δ1, GST-Duox1-Δ2, GST-Duox1M-Δ2, GST-Nox1-Δ, and GST-Nox2-Δ bound to Sepharose beads were incubated with purified, recombinant Noxa1 for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and boiled 5 min to elute proteins from the beads. The amount of Noxa1 and GST fusion proteins contained in the eluates was evaluated by electrophoresis using anti-Noxa1 and anti-GST antibodies and quantified by densitometry performed with ImageJ software. The quantity of Noxa1 bound to the different GST-coupled peptide fragments was normalized by the ratio Noxa1/GST density versus the background represented by GST beads alone using values from four different experiments. For GST-Nox1-Δ and GST-Duox1M-Δ2, two experiments were performed. Transfection—HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h prior to transfection, which was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. In studies expressing mutant proteins, equal amounts of mutant plasmid were used in place of wild type plasmid. Twenty four hours after transfection, HEK293 cells were assayed for ROS release (with or without ionomycin stimulation) using the HVA assay, as described above. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were evaluated with the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The symbol * indicates a value of p < 0.05; ** indicates p < 0.01, and *** indicates p < 0.001. Expression of Oxidase Components in Human Airway Epithelial Cells—Several NADPH oxidases have been implicated in ROS production in the airways. The calcium-activated oxidases Duox1 and Duox2 were linked to H2O2 generation in lung epithelial cells (16Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L.

Other reports connected the Nox1/Noxo1 system as well as Nox3 to tumor necrosis factor receptor or Toll-like receptor4 signaling in ROS-mediated lung alterations (29Pantano C. Anathy V. Ranjan P.

RT-PCR and immunoblotting were performed to assess expression of NADPH oxidases and oxidase-regulatory components in primary human small airway cells (SAEC) and in the lung cancer cell lines NCI-H292 and A549. Duox1 and Duox2 message and protein were expressed in SAEC and NCI-H292 cells, whereas A549 cells showed faint transcripts for Duox2 only, and expressed no detectable Duox protein by immunoblot analysis. SAEC cell lysates showed a 180-kDa band representing mature Duox (Fig. 1A, see also Fig. 1C) together with a sporadic appearance of an unidentified, faster migrating band that disappeared upon airway cell differentiation and upon Duox RNAi. Comparison of SAEC cells cultured in monolayer versus air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions on inserts (three-dimensional SAEC) indicated a 5–10-fold increase in Duox expression after differentiation (Fig. 1A). This result correlates well with the initial suggestion by Geiszt and co-workers (16Geiszt M. Witta J. Baffi J. Lekstrom K. Leto T.L. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1502-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) that Duox expression increases with cell differentiation. Other oxidases or certain oxidase regulatory components were absent from the cell types used in this study (supplemental Fig. 1A and data not shown). Duox-mediated ROS Generation—As a physiological stimulus for Duox activation remains unidentified, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin was added to SAEC or NCI-H292 cells for 30–60 min to stimulate calcium influx. In resting conditions H2O2 release was not detected, whereas exposure to ionomycin led to substantial H2O2 production. Duox expression levels correlated with the extent of H2O2 production, with ∼5-fold higher ROS production in differentiated SAEC (three-dimensional SAEC) than in SAEC cultured in monolayer (Fig. 1B). ATP and thapsigargin, two other stimuli known to increase calcium availability in cells, also led to a substantial increase in H2O2 generation in differentiated SAEC (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with Duox-expressing primary human bronchial epithelial cells and an immortalized SAEC cell line (data not shown). By using ALI-cultured SAEC, the location of Duox-mediated H2O2 production was probed by treatment of the upper and lower chamber of the inserts with ionomycin. H2O2 production was only detected on the apical side of ionomycin-stimulated cells. This ROS production was abolished after pretreatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI), an irreversible flavoenzyme inhibitor (Fig. 1B). The contribution of Duox proteins to ROS generation by airway cells was probed with RNAi. Two different siRNAs were designed to regions identical in Duox1 and Duox2, thus targeting both Duox homologs at the same time. Time courses for both Duox1 and Duox2 mRNA and protein expression were performed in SAEC and NCI-H292 cells (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting confirmed depletion of Duox1 and Duox2 after 96 h of RNAi treatment, which did not affect cell viability. After 96 h of treatment with Duox siRNA ROS production was inhibited by 90–100% (Fig. 1D), whereas control siRNA had no effect. These data indicate that Duox proteins are the main source for calcium-stimulated H2O2 generation in primary human lung epithelial cells and H292 cells. Noxa1 Translocates from the Membrane to the Cytosol upon Calcium Influx—The oxidase regulatory component Noxa1 was detected in cell lysates of lung epithelial cells or lung cancer cells (Fig. 2A). In resting cells immunostaining of endogenous Noxa1 showed localization at the plasma membran"

Although Cdt1 is known to be essential for loading of Mcm onto the chromatin, its precise role in pre-RC formation and replication initiation is unknown. Using purified proteins, we show that Cdt1 forms a complex with Mcm4/6/7, Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, and Mcm2/4/6/7 in glycerol gradient fractionation through interaction with Mcm2 and Mcm4/6. In the glycerol gradient fractionation, Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 forms a complex (speculated to be a (Mcm4/6/7)2-Cdt13 assembly) in the presence of ATP, which is significantly larger than the Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complex generated in its absence. Furthermore, DNA binding and helicase activities of Mcm4/6/7 are significantly stimulated by Cdt1 protein in vitro. We generd a Cdt1 mutant, which fails to stimulate DNA binding and helicase activities of4/6/7. This mutant Cdt1 showed reduced interaction with Mcm and is deficient in the formation of a high molecular weight complex with Mcm.

In Escherichia coli, the initiator, DnaA, binds to oriC and unwinds the origin. The DnaB helicase complexed with ATP-bound DnaC is then recruited to the origin to form a prepriming complex. DnaC, the DnaB-loading factor, forms a tight complex with DnaB protein at a 1:1 molar ratio in the presence of ATP (16Kobori J.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Upon loading onto the origin DNA, ATP bound to DnaC is hydrolyzed, resulting in release of DnaC and activation of the DnaB helicase (21Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, Mcm4/6/7 complexes were found to possess DNA helicase activity in vitro, and it was proposed that MCM may play a role in unwinding of the duplex DNA and progression of the replication forks (22Ishimi Y.

Cdt1 has been shown to be an essential component of the pre-RC, required for the recruitment of the Mcm proteins to origins. It interacts with Mcm (30Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and binds both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA (31Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this report, we have purified and characterized mouse Mcm4/6/7 and Cdt1 proteins. We report here that Mcm4/6/7 forms a complex with multiple molecules of Cdt1 in the presence of ATP, and Cdt1 protein significantly stimulates the DNA binding and helicase activities of Mcm4/6/7. We generated a Cdt1 mutant deficient in the activation of Mcm4/6/7 helicase and DNA binding. Results described in this report suggest a role for Cdt1 protein not only in the loading of MCM onto chromatin but also in execution of its helicase activity. Cloning of Wild-type and Mutant Forms of Cdt1 Gene into a Baculovirus Transfer Vector and an E. coli Expression Vector—A DNA fragment containing the full-length mouse Cdt1 gene (Gene ID 67177, GI: 31982545) was cloned into the plasmid pFastBac1 (Invitrogen) and pET24a (Novagen). To facilitate the purification of Cdt1 protein in High5 insect cells and E. coli, sequences encoding a six histidine + FLAG tag were added to the C terminus of the Cdt1 gene by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Cdt1 gene was conducted with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide 5′-TAGAGCGGATAAGGGCCGCAGAGGTCCAGGCACAGCTGGCAAGGATGACA-3′ was used as the primer to prepare the Cdt1 KKAA mutant. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Protein in Insect Cells and E. coli—Sf9 and High five insect cells were cultured at 27 °C in Sf-900 II SFM (Invitrogen) and EX-CELL 405 medium (JRH Biosciences), respectively. For expression of the Mcm4/6/7 protein, cells were coinfected with recombinant baculoviruses carrying the Mcm4-His6+Mcm6 genes and those carrying the Mcm7-FLAG at a multiplicity of infection of ∼10 for each virus and then were collected at 48-h postinfection. For expression of the Mcm2∼7 complex, Sf9 cells were coinfected with the combination of Mcm2+Mcm7-His6, Mcm4-His6+Mcm6, and Mcm3+Mcm5-His6-FLAG baculoviruses, and were collected at 48-h postinfection. The recombinant Mcm4/6/7 and Mcm2∼7 complexes in infected High 5 cell lysates were purified with consecutive steps involving nickel-agarose affinity chromatography, anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose affinity chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation as previously described (27You Z. Ishimi Y. Mizuno T. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Masai H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6148-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The highly purified recombinant Cdt1 protein was prepared from insect cells and E. coli as follows. To generate recombinant baculovirus expressing the Cdt1 protein, the recombinant bacmid was constructed and used for transfection of the insect cell, according to the manufacturer's protocol (BAC-TO-BAC baculovirus expression system, Invitrogen). For expression of the Cdt1 protein, High five cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses and were collected at 60-h post-infection. The recombinant Cdt1 protein in the infected cell lysate was purified as follows. The infected insect cells were washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then suspended in lysis buffer (1 ml per 1.5 × 107 High 5 cells) consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mm Na4P2O7, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free, Roche Applied Sciences). After incubation for 40 min on ice, insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm (50.2 Ti rotor; Beckman) for 40 min at 4 °C. To 1 volume of the clarified lysate, 1:10 volume of Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid)-agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h on a rocking platform, the beads were collected and washed six times with 10 bed volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted stepwise in four bed volumes of buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions containing Cdt1 was mixed with anti-FLAG M2 Ab-agarose beads (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A (same as above except that the pH was adjusted at 7.5), and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rocking platform. After washing four times with 10 bed volumes of buffer A (pH 7.5), the Cdt1 protein was eluted stepwise with three bed volumes of buffer A (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 mg/ml of the FLAG peptide. Further purification of the Cdt1 protein was carried out by 15–35% or 15–30% linear glycerol gradient (2 ml) centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 17 h (TLS55 rotor; Beckman). The buffers used in the gradient was 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Fractions (130 μl each) were collected and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with silver. His-FLAG or T7-tagged Cdt1 was overproduced in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) codon plus grown in LB medium with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml chloroamphenicol. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at 28 °C. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min on a rocking platform after addition of 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was sonicated to reduce viscosity. The procedures for purification using the NTA column, FLAG antibody resin, and glycerol gradient centrifugation were the same as described above. After NTA and FLAG antibody purification, the elute was applied to a Mono Q PC 1.6/5 SMART column (GE Healthcare LifeScience) equilibrated with Buffer Q (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100) with 60 mm NaCl. The elution was carried out with Buffer Q containing a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. Further purification was performed using T7-tag antibody-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Finally, glycerol gradient centrifugation was carried out. Reagents—Labeled and unlabeled dNTPs/rNTPs were purchased from GE Healthcare LifeScience. M13mp18 single-stranded circular DNA (ssDNA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from TAKARA, and anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose and FLAG peptide were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. (Hokkaido, Japan), and were purified on polyacrylamide gel, followed by purification by Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridge column (Waters). Construction of Partial Heteroduplex Substrates for Helicase Assays—The oligonucleotide [5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-(dT)40-3′] (carrying the 40-mer oligo(dT) tail at the 3′-end of the hybridizing 37-mer sequence) was first labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled dT40-37-mer (37-mer region hybridizing at positions 6289–6326 of M13mp18 DNA) was annealed to the single-stranded circular M13mp18 DNA in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2, which were heated to 95 °C, kept at 67 °C for 1 h, and then allowed to slowly cool down to 37 °C. The labeled substrates were purified by Sepharose CL4B column chromatography (GE Healthcare LifeScience). Gel Shift and DNA Helicase Assays—In gel shift assays, the 77-mer oligonucleotide [5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-(dT)40-3′], the 5′-terminus of which was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, was used as a substrate. Mcm4/6/7 protein was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5 or 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm ATP, and labeled substrates of the amount indicated. After addition of 2 μl of 50% glycerol, the reaction mixtures were directly applied on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE), and electrophoresis was conducted at room temperature. For DNA helicase assays, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA (20 mm), SDS (0.1%), and 2 μg of proteinase K, and were incubated for an additional 15 min. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE. Pull-down Assays using Biotinylated Oligonucleotide—A 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide (bio-oligo) (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-dT40-3′) was purchased from Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd. (Hokkaido, Japan). Mcm4/6/7 and/or Cdt1 and bio-oligo (50 pmol) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml casein, 2 mm ATP, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Streptavidin-coated M-280 magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech ASA) was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After the removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed in buffer (200 μl) containing of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol, resuspended in 15 μl of SDS sample buffer, and were analyzed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using T7-antibody beads (Novengen). Pre-washed T7-antibody beads were mixed with indicated proteins in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% Triton X. After 1 h of incubation, beads were washed with the above buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m citric acid, pH 2.2. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining. Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7, Mcm4/6/7, and Mcm2/4/6/7 Form Complexes with Cdt1—During the loading and translocation on the template DNA, the Mcm helicase is expected to interact with many factors including Cdt1, a loading factor for Mcm. We examined the interaction between Cdt1 and various forms of Mcm complexes by glycerol gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1A, the purified Cdt1 protein sedimented predominantly in the fractions 12–13, at a molecular weight of about 70,000. The Mcm4/6/7 complex sedimented at around fractions 5– 6, expected for a dimer of two trimers as previously reported (Fig. 1B) (23You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). When Cdt1 was mixed with Mcm4/6/7, the peak moved to around fraction 4 corresponding to a molecular mass of 670 kDa (Fig. 1C). The Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7 or Mcm2/4/6/7 complex also cosedimented with a portion of Cdt1 in glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1, D and E). To find out which subunit of Mcm directly interacts with Cdt1, purified Mcm4/6 complex, Mcm3/5 complex, or Mcm2 was mixed with T7-tagged Cdt1 protein, and immunoprecipitation using T7-antibody beads was performed. Mcm2 and Mcm4/6 complex, but not Mcm3/5 complex, was pulled down with the beads, indicating that Cdt1 can interact with the Mcm2 and Mcm4/6 complex (Fig. 1F). Cdt1 Stimulates DNA Binding of Mcm—Cdt1 protein can bind both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, and Mcm4/6/7 binds single-stranded DNA (23You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When Cdt1 protein alone was incubated with ssDNA, it generated smeared shifted bands in electrophoretic mobility shift assays on polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2A, lane 16). On the other hand, Mcm4/6/7 alone incubated with ssDNA formed a single sharp mobility-shifted band along with fast-migrating smeared bands, which may have arisen from dissociation of the complex during the electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, lane 2). When Cdt1 was added to the reaction mixtures containing a fixed amount of Mcm4/6/7, the mobility of the complex was retarded, indicative of formation of a trimolecular complex containing Mcm4/6/7, Cdt1, and DNA. The amount of this complex increased, as more Cdt1 protein was added, suggesting a possibility that Cdt1 promotes binding of the Mcm complex to DNA. Quantification indicated that the stimulation was as much as 7-fold (Fig. 2A, right). Cdt1 did not significantly affect DNA binding of T-antigen helicase under the identical condition (Fig. 2A, right). Similar results were obtained in DNA binding assays using Cdt1 purified from E. coli (Fig. 2C). We also conducted pull-down assays using a biotin-labeled ssDNA to examine the effect of Cdt1 on DNA binding of Mcm. Almost all the Cdt1 protein bound to the biotin-labeled DNA (supplemental Fig. S1, lane 4), suggesting that the Cdt1 protein possesses strong ssDNA binding activity under this condition. Mcm4/6/7 was also pulled down by the biotin DNA under the same condition, and this binding was significantly stimulated by the presence of Cdt1 protein (supplemental Fig. S1, compare lanes 2 versus 3, 5 versus 6, 8 versus 9, and 11 versus 12). Cdt1-mediated stimulation of DNA binding of Mcm was more prominent in the absence of a nucleotide than in its presence. Strikingly, the addition of ATPγS or ADP decreased DNA binding of Mcm4/6/7 in the presence of Cdt1, whereas addition of ATP did not significantly affect it under the same condition. DNA binding assays using the glycerol gradient fractions of Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7+Cdt1 or Mcm4/6/7+Cdt1 also indicated increased formation of a complex of slower mobility compared with the Mcm complexes alone (data not shown). The above results on Cdt1-mediated promotion of DNA binding of Mcm may reflect an aspect of the Mcm-chromatin loading activity of Cdt1 protein. Cdt1 Stimulates DNA Helicase Activity of Mcm—Because Cdt1 protein forms a complex with Mcm4/6/7 and increases its DNA binding activity, we examined whether Cdt1 protein can stimulate the helicase activity of Mcm4/6/7. The same reaction mixtures for DNA binding assays (Fig. 2A) were examined for DNA helicase activities (Fig. 2B). Addition of increasing amounts of Cdt1 significantly stimulated the helicase activity of Mcm4/6/7, whereas that of T-antigen helicase was not affected under the same condition (Fig. 2B, lower). Cdt1 stimulated the helicase activity of Mcm4/6/7 as much as 5-fold (lanes 7 or 8 in Fig. 2B). The isolated Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complex exhibited more efficient DNA binding and helicase activities than Cdt1-free Mcm4/6/7 complex (supplemental Fig. S2). However, addition of excess amount of Cdt1 led to inhibition of the helicase activity (Fig. 2D). Titration of Cdt1 indicated that addition of more than 18 molecules of the Cdt1 monomer per Mcm4/6/7 hexamer resulted in inhibition. Excess Cdt1 may compete with Mcm for binding to the substrate DNA and titrate out the effective Mcm4/6/7 helicase. These behaviors of Cdt1 are similar to the known effect of DnaC on DnaB helicase activity (21Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2463-2468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Geminin binds to Cdt1 and inhibits its activity. We purified the wild-type geminin and a mutant geminin lacking the coiled-coiled domain. This mutant geminin does not interact with Cdt1 protein, as judged from immunoprecipitation assays (data not shown). Fig. 3A shows that addition of the wild-type geminin to the helicase reaction in the presence of Cdt1 resulted in strong inhibition of the helicase activity, whereas the mutant geminin did not affect the increase of helicase activity by Cdt1. Because geminin alone did not affect the helicase action of Mcm4/6/7 at the same concentrations (data not shown), almost complete inhibition by geminin (lanes 6 and 7) may be due to the inhibitory effect of the geminin-Cdt1 complex on Mcm helicase. In DNA binding assays, the wild-type geminin, when added to the Cdt1-DNA complex, formed a new complex migrating at a distinct position which represents the Cdt1-geminin-DNA ternary complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). When added to the Mcm-Cdt1-DNA complex, it disrupted the slow-migrating complex, regenerating the Mcm-DNA complex (Fig. 3B, lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, the mutant geminin did not affect the Mcm-Cdt1-DNA complex even at a high concentration (Fig. 3B, lanes 11 and 12), in keeping with the preservation of helicase activity under the same conditions. These results clearly indicate that the stimulation of the helicase activity was due to the action of Cdt1 protein. Although Cdt1 stimulated DNA binding activity of Mcm2/3/4/5/6/7 hexamer on single-stranded DNA, the Mcm heterohexamer did not show any DNA helicase activity even in the presence of Cdt1 protein (data not shown). The above results point to functional similarity between Cdt1 and DnaC proteins, the latter of which binds to DnaB helicase and stimulates its helicase activity. In light of critical roles of ATP in regulation of the DnaC-DnaB complex, we then examined the effect of ATP concentration on the DNA binding and helicase activities of Mcm4/6/7 in the absence and presence of Cdt1 protein (Fig. 4A). The optimum ATP concentration for the helicase reaction in the presence of Cdt1 was 10 mm, but DNA binding of Mcm4/6/7 did not require ATP either in the presence or absence of Cdt1 (Fig. 4A, lower). In contrast, DNA binding was inhibited, as more ATP was added (Fig. 4B). Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 Complex Formation in the Presence of ATP—We then examined whether the presence of ATP affects the nature of the Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complexes. When Mcm4/6/7 and Cdt1 were mixed and were subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation in the presence of ATP, most of the Cdt1 protein cosedimented with the Mcm4/6/7 complex (Fig. 5A). The peak fractions corresponded to the protein marker thyroglobulin with an estimated molecular mass of about 650 kDa. This value is larger than the Mcm4/6/7 protein alone in the presence of ATP, which sediments at ∼450 kDa (Fig. 5E). We previously reported that the Mcm4/6/7 in the absence of ATP sedimented at ∼350 kDa in glycerol gradient and migrates at 550 kDa in native acrylamide gel (22Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 23You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This was confirmed in Fig. 5F. Meanwhile, Cdt1 protein alone peaked at 70 kDa (fraction 12) as expected for a monomer under this condition (Fig. 5G). In the absence of ATP, on the other hand, the Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complex sedimented in a rather broad peak at around 350 kDa, smaller than the Mcm-Cdt1 complex in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5B). The Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complex formation was confirmed also in the regular native gel or blue native polyacrylamide gel (BN-PAGE, data not shown). The ratio of the protein amount of Mcm4/6/7 and Cdt1 was 3:1 in the peak fractions (fraction 2) of the glycerol gradient in Fig. 5A. Taking the molecular masses of Cdt1 (70 kDa) and Mcm4/6/7 (300 kDa) into account, a molar ratio of Cdt1 to Mcm is estimated to be ∼3:2. Thus, in the presence of ATP, about three Cdt1 molecules may bind to the two Mcm4/6/7 trimers (hexamers). In contrast, the Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complexes in the absence of ATP was more heterogeneous in size, and the amount of Cdt1 associated with Mcm4/6/7 was lower than the complex in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the Mcm4/6/7-Cdt1 complex exists as a mixture of different forms with different numbers of bound Cdt1 molecules, and that a large complex containing three Cdt1 molecules may be preferentially generated in the presence of ATP. A Mutant Cdt1 Protein Fails to Activate Mcm4/6/7 Helicase—To identify residues critical for stimulation of MCM helicase, we generated a mutant Cdt1 (KKAA) in which two lysine residues in the 441KXXXK445 were change to alanine (Fig. 6A). The Lys441 residue is conserved from fission yeast to human. We purified the mutant protein after overexpression in insect cells or in E. coli. We next examined the activity of the mutant protein in DNA binding and helicase assays of Mcm4/6/7. The KKAA mutant showed very little stimulatory effect on"

The proton-translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.3) (complex I) is the largest energy-transducing complex in the aerobic respiratory chains of many prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1Walker J.E.

Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus HB-8 complex I has been determined at 3.3 Å resolution (5Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). It revealed the spatial localization of all of the redox centers and their coordinating amino acid residues. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the Escherichia coli nomenclature for each subunit. The primary electron acceptor of complex I is a noncovalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) located in the NuoF subunit. Electrons are believed to flow through seven Fe/S clusters. They are as follows: a tetranuclear [4Fe-4S] cluster N3 in NuoF, a binuclear [2Fe-2S] cluster N1b and two [4Fe-4S] clusters N4 and N5 in NuoG, two [4Fe-4S] clusters N6a and N6b in NuoI, and a [4Fe-4S] cluster N2 in NuoB (Fig. 1A) (5Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 6Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These seven Fe/S clusters are lined up to form the main electron transfer pathway, whereas a [2Fe-2S] cluster N1a in NuoE and a [4Fe-4S] cluster N7 in NuoG stick out from the main pathway. It has been suggested that clusters N1a and N7 may have different roles (5Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 7Pohl T. Bauer T. Dorner K. Stolpe S. Sell P. Zocher G. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6588-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis has confirmed that all of the Fe/S clusters except cluster N7 are conserved (8Yagi T. Yano T. Di Bernardo S. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).EPR spectroscopy has been most informative for the analysis of Fe/S clusters. However, because the sensitivity and resolution of EPR spectroscopy are much lower than those of spectrophotometry, considerable spectral overlaps exist. Therefore, to make a definitive assignment of the spectra to each of the specific Fe/S clusters is sometimes very difficult. In addition, some Fe/S clusters may not be detectable by EPR when the spin relaxation time is too short, or when the Fe/S cluster is not paramagnetic under certain chemical or electronic conditions. In fact, E. coli complex I contains at least six EPR-detectable Fe/S clusters as follows: N1a, N1b, N2, N3, N4, and N7. However, N5 signals have not been detected so far. Cluster N6a and N6b signals have not been characterized sufficiently. Another problem is that EPR identification of an Fe/S cluster residing in the overexpressed single subunit could be misleading, because its EPR signals may be altered from those in the intact complex I system (9Ohnishi T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EPR spectral properties of Fe/S clusters, such as the principal g values, line widths, and the spin-relaxation rates can be very sensitive to the micro-environment around the Fe/S cluster, especially in a delicate multicomponent membrane protein like complex I (9Ohnishi T. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, assigning the observed EPR signals to the structurally defined clusters has been an extremely difficult task.Cluster N5 has a very fast spin relaxation. Therefore, its EPR spectra are detectable only when an extremely low temperature and high microwave power are used (6Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). For these reasons, it has been most difficult to study cluster N5 among all Fe/S clusters in complex I. In fact, cluster N5 was detected only in several species such as pigeon (10Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 387: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), bovine heart (6Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), Yarrowia lipolytica (11Djafarzadeh R. Kerscher S. Zwicker K. Radermacher M. Lindahl M. Schagger H. Brandt U.

EPR characterization of cluster N5 was limited mostly to complex I from bovine heart mitochondria and Y. lipolytica. Cluster N5 has been assigned to the second binding motif in the N-terminal part of the 75-kDa subunit of mitochondrial complex I or the NuoG subunit in E. coli complex I (Fig. 1B). The unusual Fe/S binding motif “HXXXCXXCXXXXXC” that includes one His and three Cys residues is conserved in complex I in all species so far studied, and is also seen in other enzymes such as iron-only hydrogenases (14Peters J.W. Lanzilotta W.N. Lemon B.J. Seefeldt L.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ohnishi (15Ohnishi T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) already predicted as early as in 1993 that this mixed-ligand cluster N5 might have mixed ground states of S = 1/2 and 3/2. This could explain why its detected spin concentration at the S = 1/2 ground state was only 0.25 per complex I (16Ohnishi T. Capaldi R.A. Membrane Proteins in Energy Transduction. Marcel Dekker, New York1979: 1-87Google Scholar).Recently, Hirst and co-workers (17Yakovlev G. Reda T. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12720-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) raised controversial arguments that there were EPR “misassignments” among clusters N4, N5, and N6b by simply comparing EPR spectra observed in the overexpressed single NuoG subunit and in intact complex I. Here we challenge their misassignment claim on cluster N5. First, we identified the spectroscopic property of cluster N5 in Escherichia coli complex I, which had not been previously detected by EPR. Second, we designed experiments to determine whether cluster N5 has His(Cys)3 mixed ligands or regular four Cys ligands. By introducing mutations into the genomic DNA with homologous recombination, we constructed four different cluster N5 mutant strains that include single mutants H101A and H101C, a double mutant H101A/C114A, and a cluster N5 knock-out (ΔN5) mutant. As a result, without any chemical reconstitution, we were able to detect cluster N5 signals for the first time in the control but not in any cluster N5 mutant samples. These data suggest that the misassignment claim to clusters N4 and N5 and their proposal of a four-cysteine coordination to cluster N5 by Hirst and co-workers (17Yakovlev G. Reda T. Hirst J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A lysozyme from chicken egg white was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min. The cell suspension was briefly sonicated and then passed once through a French press (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY) at 15,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged again at 23,000 × g for 10 min.

Briefly, each competent E. coli mutant strain was transformed with pET16b/nuoCD, and the cells were grown in Terrific Broth at 37 °C until A600 nm reached ∼2.0. After the cells were cooled down to 20 °C followed by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were further incubated for 3 h. The harvested cells were suspended (10% w/v) in an ice-cooled 50 mm MOPS-OH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mm EDTA-2Na, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol (buffer A), which had been purged with oxygen-free argon. The cells were broken by two passages through a French press at 15,000 p.s.i. After unbroken cells and inclusion bodies were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min. The NuoCDEFG subcomplex was purified from the supernatant under anaerobic conditions (<1 ppm) at room temperature. All solutions were degassed and purged with oxygen-free argon and equilibrated in the chamber overnight before use. The sample was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (1.5 × 5.0 cm) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of the same buffer, and then the subcomplex NuoCDEFG protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm l-histidine and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After removing histidine with a desalting column (10-DG, Bio-Rad), the protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra filter (molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa; Millipore, Billerica, MA).EPR Spectroscopy—EPR samples were immediately prepared anaerobically after their purification. Redox mediators, methyl viologen and benzyl viologen, were added at 5 μm each. After the addition of 10 mm neutralized sodium dithionite solution, each sample was incubated for 5–10 min, transferred to an EPR tube, and then frozen immediately.

The mutations in the predicted binding motif for cluster N5 drastically affected the stability of complex I. We did not find any deamino-NADH dehydrogenase activity in the membrane preparations from any of those mutant strains. As shown in Fig. 2A, the NuoG subunit was mainly detected in soluble fractions from the H101A and H101C mutants. It was weakly detected in soluble fractions and not in the membrane fractions from the double mutant H101A/C114A and the ΔN5 mutant. Western blot analyses with anti-NuoE and anti-NuoF antibodies gave similar results (data not shown). These data suggest that the NADH dehydrogenase subcomplex (NuoEFG subcomplex) in those cluster N5 mutants was unstable and dissociated from the membrane. A similar destabilizing effect on the complex I assembly has been reported for the H129A mutant (corresponding to E. coli H101A) in the 75-kDa subunit of mitochondrial complex I from Y. lipolytica (32Waletko A.

Western blot analysis of membrane (M) fractions and soluble (S) fractions from each E. coli strain were carried out with affinity-purified anti-NuoG antibody. 10 μg of samples (except 1 μg for wild type) were applied to each lane of a Laemmli 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

We used the W221A mutant (Fig. 1B) to obtain the wild-type Fe/S clusters in the NuoG subunit for the following reasons. (i) The NuoEFG subcomplex was dissociated from the membrane in W221A as the cluster N5 mutants (Fig. 2A). (ii) Based on the crystal structure, Trp-221 is located away from all Fe/S clusters including cluster N5. (iii) A low level of complex I activity was detected in the membrane fraction of the W221A strain, where a trace amount of NuoG remained. (iv) Another Trp-221 mutation (W221F) had no effect at all on either complex I activity or on its integrity.We were able to partially purify the W221A and cluster N5 mutant subcomplexes from these cytoplasmic fractions with nickel chelation affinity column chromatography (Fig. 2B). In these preparations, the levels of NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, and NuoG subunits were basically similar according to the Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C), but neither NuoB nor NuoI was detected (data not shown). All samples exhibited the typical absorption spectra containing [4Fe-4S] clusters (data not shown). The absorption peaks around 420 nm were roughly proportional to non-heme iron contents in the preparations (79–420 μm).Cluster N5 Mutants Have EPR Signals from Other Fe/S Clusters Except N5—To characterize bound iron-sulfur clusters in the cluster N5 mutants, we performed EPR analysis. First, we examined EPR spectra of the [2Fe-2S] clusters in the dithionite-reduced samples in the g = 2 region at 40 K and 5 milliwatts (Fig. 3, left). We detected two sets of EPR signals, one with rhombic symmetry (gz,y,x = 2.00, ∼1.94, 1.92), and the other with axial symmetry (gz,y,x = 2.02, 1.94, 1.94) in W221A harboring wild-type iron-sulfur clusters. These two sets of signals arise from the S = 1/2 ground states of [2Fe-2S]+ clusters, N1a and N1b, respectively. The EPR line shapes and spin relaxation behaviors of these clusters are almost identical to those in the purified complex I from E. coli as reported previously (7Pohl T. Bauer T. Dorner K. Stolpe S. Sell P. Zocher G. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6588-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Leif H. Sled V.D. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Friedrich T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). As for cluster N1a, the EPR spectra of cluster N5 mutant subcomplexes showed similar intensities as in the control, although a small but significant shift in gz value was observed in H101C and H101A/C114A. In contrast, the signal intensity of cluster N1b varied among the mutants. According to simulation analysis, the ratio of N1b to N1a was 0.8 in W221A, 1.55 in H101C, 0.55 in H101A, 0.75 in H101A/C114A, and 0.83 in ΔN5 mutants. Because the amount of NuoG in the subcomplex was similar among the mutants as determined by Western blot analysis, these results indicate that the cluster N1b signal is very sensitive to its microenvironment as suggested previously (34Zickermann V. Zwicker K. Tocilescu M.A. Kerscher S. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3EPR spectra of the NuoCDEFG subcomplex from various cluster N5 mutants, W221A (a), H101C (b), H101A (c), H101A/C114A (d), and ΔN5 (e) at 40K (left) and 6K (right) in the presence of 10 mm sodium dithionite and 5 μm benzyl viologen and methyl viologen. The signals were normalized at 1 mg/ml protein concentration (left) or normalized based on the intensity of the cluster N7 signals (right). EPR spectra were recorded under the following conditions: microwave frequency, 9.45 GHz; microwave power, 5 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 8.034 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; time constant, 82 ms. The gz and gx values are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)At 6 K and 5 milliwatts, EPR signals arising from multiple [4Fe-4S]+ clusters were detected (Fig. 3, right). The EPR spectra from W221A displayed signals with g values of 2.07, 2.045, 2.02, 1.93, 1.89, and 1.88. Because our samples did not contain the NuoB and NuoI subunits, EPR signals from four different [4Fe-4S] clusters were expected. They are cluster N3 in NuoF and clusters N4, N5, and N7 in NuoG. By comparing published g values in E. coli complex I (7Pohl T. Bauer T. Dorner K. Stolpe S. Sell P. Zocher G. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6588-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Pohl T. Uhlmann M. Kaufenstein M. Friedrich T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10694-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it was concluded that the EPR signals with gz,y,x =∼2.04, ∼1.94, ∼1.88; gz,y,x = 2.07, ∼1.93, ∼1.88; and gz,y,x = 2.045, ∼1.94, ∼1.89 arose from three [4Fe-4S] clusters N3, N4, and N7, respectively. All of the mutant subcomplexes displayed EPR signals for these [4Fe-4S] clusters. This suggests that the mutations in the cluster N5-binding site did not lead to a drastic change in the characteristics of neighboring Fe/S clusters. However, there were some variations in signal intensities. For direct comparison among mutants, EPR data at 6 K (Fig. 3, right) were normalized based on the signal amplitude at g = 2.045 of the EPR signal from cluster N7. Cluster N7 is distant from the main electron transfer pathway and is unlikely to have significant paramagnetic interactions with other Fe/S clusters. We observed that the cluster N4 signals were increased in ΔN5 but decreased in H101C compared with the control. These changes of N4 signals seem to be caused by a loss of interactions between clusters N4 and N5 or by an altered interaction in these mutants. Almost no [3Fe-4S] signals were detected in the mutants.Cluster N5 Signals in Bovine Heart Complex I—Because it is extremely difficult to detect signals from cluster N5 in E. coli samples, we first reexamined EPR spectra in the bovine heart complex I where the cluster N5 signals were well characterized. As shown in Fig. 4, we measured EPR signals from the iron-sulfur clusters in the purified bo"
https://openalex.org/W2146512716,"The retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) plays an essential role in vision, including storing and converting retinyl esters of the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal. Retinyl ester storage structures (RESTs), specialized lipid droplets within the RPE, take up retinyl esters synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report studies of mice lacking exons 2 and 3 of the gene encoding adipose differentiation-related protein (Adfp), a structural component of RESTs. We found that dark adaptation was slower in Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) than in Adfp+/+ mice and that Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) mice had consistently delayed clearances of all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol from rod photoreceptor cells. Two-photon microscopy revealed aberrant trafficking of all-trans-retinyl esters in the RPE of Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) mice, a problem caused by abnormal maintenance of RESTs in the dark-adapted state. Retinyl ester accumulation was also reduced in Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) as compared with Adfp+/+ mice. These observations suggest that Adfp plays a unique role in vision by maintaining proper storage and trafficking of retinoids within the eye."

https://openalex.org/W1972228166,"The RecA and some related proteins possess a simple motif, called (KR)X(KR), that (in RecA) consists of two lysine residues at positions 248 and 250 at the subunit-subunit interface. This study and previous work implicate this RecA motif in the following: (a) catalyzing ATP hydrolysis in trans,(b) coordinating the ATP hydrolytic cycles of adjacent subunits, (c) governing the rate of ATP hydrolysis, and (d) coupling the ATP hydrolysis to work (in this case DNA strand exchange). The conservative K250R mutation leaves RecA nucleoprotein filament formation largely intact. However, ATP hydrolysis is slowed to less than 15% of the wild-type rate. DNA strand exchange is also slowed commensurate with the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The results reinforce the idea of a tight coupling between ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange. When a plasmid-borne RecA K250R protein is expressed in a cell otherwise lacking RecA protein, the growth of the cells is severely curtailed. The slow growth defect is alleviated in cells lacking RecFOR function, suggesting that the defect reflects loading of RecA at stalled replication forks. Suppressors occur as recA gene alterations, and their properties indicate that limited dissociation by RecA K250R confers the slow growth phenotype. Overall, the results suggest that recombinational DNA repair is a common occurrence in cells. RecA protein plays a sufficiently intimate role in the bacterial cell cycle that its properties can limit the growth rate of a bacterial culture."

IFNs are induced by several stimuli, such as LPS, lipoproteins, lipopeptides, double-stranded RNA, double-stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, or unmethylated CpG motifs mainly through Toll-like receptors (1Kaisho T. Akira S. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2006; 117: 979-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). ISG15 (UCRP) is one of the genes that is highly induced by IFNs (2Korant B.D. Blomstrom D.C. Jonak G.J. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol.

Besides ISG15 expression, ISG15 modification (ISGylation) and most enzymes involved in this modification are strongly activated by type I interferon IFN (4Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

IFNs are critical cytokines involved in innate immune responses (13Garcia-Sastre A. Biron C.A. Science. 2006; 312: 879-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that ISG15 modification may modulate certain immune responses related to pathogen infections and various stresses. ISG15-deficient mice show no obvious phenotype against vesicular stomatitis virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (14Osiak A. Utermohlen O. Niendorf S. Horak I. Knobeloch K.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar); however, they are more susceptible to influenza A/WSN/33 and influenza B/Lee/40 virus infections (15Lenschow D.J. Lai C.

Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS, NOS2) is a high-output NOS compared with NOS1 and NOS3. The Vmax of iNOS is ∼10-fold greater than that of NOS1 and NOS3 (16Lowenstein C.J. Padalko E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2865-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). iNOS is not expressed under normal conditions; however, it is induced in response to cytokines, microbes, or microbial products, resulting in the sustained production of nitric oxide (NO) (16Lowenstein C.J. Padalko E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2865-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As a result, reactive nitrogen intermediates, such as NO, nitrite, and nitrate, and the products of the interaction of NO with reactive oxygen species, such as peroxynitrite and peroxynitrous acid, are accumulated and utilized for the anti-bacterial or -viral effects (16Lowenstein C.J. Padalko E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2865-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Fang F.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2818-2825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). One of the most important molecular mechanisms mediating anti-bacterial or -viral effects is protein S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a NO moiety to the thiol of cysteine, a post-translational protein modification. So far, more than 100 proteins have been reported as substrates for protein S-nitrosylation (19Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). Protein S-nitrosylation regulates enzymatic activity, protein-protein interaction, and signal transduction (19Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). Given that some stimuli, such as type I IFN, can induce both iNOS and ISG15, we were interested in the relationship between nitrosylation and ISGylation. Here, we report that ISG15 is able to be nitrosylated. The nitrosylation of ISG15 prevents the dimerization of ISG15, and the cysteine residue of ISG15 contributes to stable dimerization. A mutant ISG15 in which the cysteine residue is replaced by a serine shows more effective ISGylation activity than wild-type ISG15, which indicates that the cysteine residue of ISG15 is an impediment to effective ISGylation.

Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), HA (Covance), iNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories™), and His6 (Clontech) were purchased from the respective manufacturers. Rabbit anti-mouse ISG15 polyclonal antibodies have been described previously (23Malakhova O.A. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-mUbcH8 antibodies were reported previously (7Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9592-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Anti-biotin antibody and the specific second antibody were from NitroGlo nitrosylation detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nitrosylation of ISG15 Prevents Dimer Formation by ISG15—To test whether ISG15 is able to be nitrosylated, we expressed FLAG-tagged mouse ISG15 in 293T cells with or without iNOS. The cell lysates were subjected to the biotin switch method followed by streptavidin-agarose pulldown and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. The biotin switch method (24Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Sci. STKE 2001. 2001; : L1Google Scholar) was widely used to detect protein nitrosylation. FLAG-ISG15 was pulled down in the presence of iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A), which indicates that ISG15 was nitrosylated by endogenously produced nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by iNOS. We further examined the nitrosylation of ISG15 using immunopurified ISG15. FLAG-ISG15 was expressed in 293T cells and purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and protein A-agarose. The lysates and immunoprecipitates were treated with the physiological NO donor SNOC (22Lei S.Z. Pan Z.H. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.S. Hartman J. Sucher N.J. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 25Uehara T. Nakamura T. Yao D. Shi Z.Q. Gu Z. Ma Y. Masliah E. Nomura Y. Lipton S.A. Nature. 2006; 441: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) for different periods to allow detection of nitrosylation of ISG15 by anti-biotin antibody. In this case nonreducing conditions are required to detect the nitrosylation, because Cys-S-NO was changed to Cys-S-S-biotin by the biotin switch method. Using this method, nitrosylation of ISG15 was detected after SNOC treatment (Fig. 1B). More interestingly, we also detected the dimerization of ISG15 in vivo (Fig. 1B). It was detected in input (lane 3) and more easily detected in immunopurified samples (lanes 9–12), which suggested that the dimerization of ISG15 depends on ISG15 concentration. In brief, the concentration of ISG15 was increased on the protein A-agarose by immunoprecipitation, and this resulted in a higher chance for interaction and dimer formation. Importantly, the dimerized form of ISG15 was decreased after SNOC treatment for 1 h (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 12). It has been previously reported that ISG15 forms homodimers (26Sorensen C.M. Rempel L.A. Nelson S.R. Francis B.R. Perry D.J. Lewis R.V. Haas A.L. Hansen T.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our results confirm these findings and indicate that nitrosylation of ISG15 prevents homodimer formation. We further confirmed that dimer formation was made by disulfide bonds (Fig. 1C). Cell lysates containing FLAG-ISG15 were subjected to either nonreducing or reducing SDS-PAGE followed by anti-FLAG immunoblotting. The dimer form was detected only in the nonreducing gel. Given that cysteine residues are targeted for nitrosylation, we mutated two cysteines of mouse ISG15 and checked the effect on dimerization and nitrosylation (Fig. 1D). We found that ISG15 (C76S and C76S/C143S) mutants did not show dimerization, which means that Cys-76 but not Cys-143 contributes to stable dimer formation, which is detectable by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The dimerization of ISG15 (wild-type (WT) and C143S) was inhibited by SNOC treatment (Fig. 1D, lanes 4, 8, 14, and 18). Nitrosylation was completely inhibited only by double mutation of two cysteines. Nitrosylation of ISG15 was also confirmed by another NO donor S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). iNOS Prevents ISG15-ISG15 Interaction—Next we investigated if ISG15 molecules interact with each other, as interaction is necessary for dimerization. Either FLAG-tagged wild-type or C76S/C143S mutant ISG15 was expressed with or without His6-wild-type ISG15 followed by Ni-NTA pulldown to check the interaction (Fig. 2). Both wild-type and C76S/C143S mutant ISG15 could interact with wild-type ISG15, which demonstrates that cysteine residues are not necessary for the interaction between individual ISG15 monomers. Interestingly, co-expression of iNOS prevented the interaction. Because we did not detect interaction between ISG15 and iNOS (data not shown), nitric oxide (NO) itself or nitrosylation of another protein might regulate ISG15-ISG15 interaction. Taken together, cysteine residues are required for disulfide bond-based dimerization but not for just interaction. Cysteine Residues of ISG15 Prevent ISGylation—Because dimerized ISG15 might have a different physiological effect from monomer ISG15, we investigated the effect of a Cys to Ser mutation of ISG15 on ISGylation. Wild-type, C76S, C143S, or C76S/C143S mutant mouse ISG15 was expressed with or without ISG15 activating enzyme UBE1L and ISG15 conjugating enzyme UbcH8 in 293T cells to assess ISGylation (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, ISG15(C76S) showed no difference in the level of ISGylation, although the C76S mutation inhibited the formation of stable ISG15 dimers (Fig. 1D). More importantly, double mutation of both cysteine residues of mouse ISG15 enhanced ISGylation (Fig. 3A), which suggests that both cysteine residues inhibit ISGylation. Cys-143 might result in unstable dimerization, which is not detectable by Western blotting in Fig. 1D. Together, these data suggest that Cys-76 and Cys-143 contributed to dimer formation (Figs. 1D and 3A) and decreased the availability of monomer ISG15 to be used for ISGylation. We also confirmed this result with human ISG15, which has only one Cys in mature form. Human ISG15(C78S) has higher ISGylation activity compared with wild-type ISG15 (Fig. 3B). We further checked this idea with ISG15-deficient lung fibroblasts, which have been immortalized with SV40 large T antigen (Fig. 3C). This cell line shows high endogenous ISGylation activity, which means that transfection to express exogenous ISG15-activating and -conjugating enzymes is not necessary to get ISGylation. This cell line was reconstituted with either FLAG-tagged wild-type mouse ISG15 or mutant mouse ISG15(C76S/C143S) followed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting ratio of ISG15 conjugates and free ISG15 were compared (Fig. 3, C and D). As a result, we found again that ISG15(C76S/C143S) has greater effective ISGylation activity than wild-type ISG15. Nitrosylation Contributes to Effective ISGylation—We next analyzed the relationship between ISGylation and nitrosylation. HeLa cells were stimulated with IFNα in the presence or absence of NOS inhibitor ETU. Endogenous ISG15 nitrosylation and total protein ISGylation were examined (Fig. 4A). The presence of ETU decreased ISG15 nitrosylation, which is shown in a biotin switch-streptavidin pulldown assay. Furthermore, total protein ISGylation was also substantially decreased in the presence of NOS inhibitor ETU. These results further support that nitrosylation promotes effective ISGylation. We also checked ISGylation by WT or C76S/C143S mutant ISG15 in the presence or absence of the expression of iNOS. As a result, we found that the expression of iNOS substantially increased ISGylation of WT ISG15 (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Although the expression of iNOS inhibited ISG15-ISG15 interaction of both WT and C76S/C143S mutant ISG15 (Fig. 2), iNOS expression did not increase ISGylation of C76S/C143S mutant ISG15 (Fig. 4B, lane 7). Overall these data indicate that nitrosylation enhances effective ISGylation. NO has been shown to act as an antibacterial and antiviral agent (16Lowenstein C.J. Padalko E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2865-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). iNOS-derived NO contributes to both early and late phases of antibacterial activity (27Benz D. Cadet P. Mantione K. Zhu W. Stefano G. Med. Sci. Monit. 2002; 8: 1-4Google Scholar). ISG15 itself and ISG15 modification also have been reported to have antiviral functions (15Lenschow D.J. Lai C. Frias-Staheli N. Giannakopoulos N.V. Lutz A. Wolff T. Osiak A. Levine B. Schmidt R.E. Garcia-Sastre A. Leib D.A. Pekosz A. Knobeloch K.P. Horak I. Virgin H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2006; 103: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), although the details of the molecular mechanism are not yet clear. Virus infection is one of the common stimuli which induce nitrosylation and ISGylation (Fig. 5), which suggests that there might be a correlation between nitrosylation and ISGylation to generate the maximum immune response. Here, we reported that nitrosylation of ISG15 prevented the dimerization of ISG15 and increased the availability of free ISG15 to be used for ISGylation. Given that ISG15 is able to form a homodimer through a disulfide bond (26Sorensen C.M. Rempel L.A. Nelson S.R. Francis B.R. Perry D.J. Lewis R.V. Haas A.L. Hansen T.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), it is also possible that ISG15 may form disulfide bonds with other unidentified proteins. As a result, the availability of free ISG15 to be used for ISGylation will be decreased. Furthermore, ISG15 activating enzyme Ube1L null mice, which lack protein ISGylation (29Kim K.I. Yan M. Malakhova O. Luo J.K. Shen M.F. Zou W. de la Torre J.C. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), showed the same antiviral defects as ISG15 knock-out mice. 4C. Lai, J. Schneider, J. J. Struckhoff, L. Martinez-Sobrido, A. Garcia-Sastre, T. Wolff, D.-E. Zhang and D. J. Lenschow, manuscript submitted. Taken together, these data suggest that nitrosylation might contribute to the ISGylation-dependent anti-viral pathway. In fact, NO has been found to affect infection by more than a dozen viruses (30Reiss C.S. Komatsu T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, iNOS-deficient mice were significantly more susceptible to herpes simplex virus-1 infection, displayed a delayed clearance of virus, and exhibited an increase in the frequency of virus reactivation in dorsal root ganglia compared with similarly infected heterozygous mice (31MacLean A. Wei X.Q. Huang F.P. Al-Alem U.A. Chan W.L. Liew F.Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Another example is that iNOS-deficient mice, which were infected by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), developed significantly higher titers of infectious MCMV compared with the wild-type mice (32Fernandez J.A. Rodrigues E.G. Tsuji M. Viral Immunol. 2000; 13: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Coxsackie B3 virus is also regulated by NO (33Zaragoza C. Ocampo C. Saura M. Leppo M. Wei X.Q. Quick R. Moncada S. Liew F.Y. Lowenstein C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Lowenstein C.J. Hill S.L. Lafond-Walker A. Wu J. Allen G. Landavere M. Rose N.R. Herskowitz A. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1837-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Coxsackievirus replicates to higher titers in iNOS-deficient mice, and the clearance of virus is delayed in these mice compared with wild-type mice (33Zaragoza C. Ocampo C. Saura M. Leppo M. Wei X.Q.

Lafond-Walker A. Thiemann D.R. Hruban R. Lowenstein C.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5497-5504PubMed Google Scholar). Mice lacking NOS have a severe, necrotizing pancreatitis, with elevated pancreatic enzymes in the blood and necrotic acinar cells (35Zaragoza C. Ocampo C.J. Saura M. Bao C. Leppo M. Lafond-Walker A. Thiemann D.R. Hruban R. Lowenstein C.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5497-5504PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that the mRNA cap structure binding protein eIF4E cognate 4EHP is modified by ISG15, resulting in higher cap structure binding activity and repression of protein translation (20Okumura F. Zou W. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Given that Drosophila 4EHP selectively inhibits Caudal and hunchback protein translation (36Cho P.F. Poulin F. Cho-Park Y.A. Cho-Park I.B. Chicoine J.D. Lasko P. Sonenberg N. Cell. 2005; 121: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 37Cho P.F. Gamberi C. Cho-Park Y.A. Cho-Park I.B. Lasko P. Sonenberg N. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2035-2041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), mammalian 4EHP is believed to inhibit mRNA-specific protein translation. These data suggest that ISGylation probably controls protein translation under particular conditions, for example during the immune response to bacterial or viral infection (Fig. 5). Given that the homodimerization of ISG15 or the formation of disulfide bonds with other proteins seems to inhibit ISGylation, it is possible that some factors which can inhibit the formation of disulfide bonds by ISG15 would enhance total ISGylation. Reducing agents, for example glutathione (GSH), are the other factors which might enhance ISGylation. On the other hand, it has been reported that hepatic glutathione synthesis is decreased 24 h after injection of LPS (38Payabvash S. Ghahremani M.H. Goliaei A. Mandegary A. Shafaroodi H. Amanlou M. Dehpour A.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1817-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They also showed that the ratio of GSH (reduced form)/GSSG (oxidative form) was decreased by LPS treatment, although there was no increase in absolute amount of GSSG, which suggests that LPS treatment generates oxidative conditions. In this case, ISG15 should easily form disulfide bonds with itself to form homodimers or with other proteins, and nitrosylation should prevent disulfide bond formation by ISG15 under these conditions. This evidence suggests that nitrosylation of ISG15 may be an emergency pathway to achieve effective ISGylation to generate a full immune response. ISG15 has been reported to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication (28Okumura A. Lu G. Pitha-Rowe I. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1440-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Interestingly, ISG15 has also been reported to be released from cells into the culture medium (39Knight Jr., E. Cordova B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2280-2284PubMed Google Scholar, 40D'Cunha J. Ramanujam S. Wagner R.J. Witt P.L. Knight Jr., E. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4100-4108PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of ISG15 into the culture medium of CD3+ cells induces the secretion of interferon-γ (41Recht M. Borden E.C. Knight Jr., E. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2617-2623PubMed Google Scholar). It also has been reported that ISG15 has neutrophil chemotactic activity (42Owhashi M. Taoka Y. Ishii K. Nakazawa S. Uemura H. Kambara H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that ISG15 has at least two physiological roles; one is post-translational protein modification under particular conditions to enhance the immune response; another is the use of ISG15 itself for the immune response as shown in Fig. 5. However, it is not yet clear whether monomer or dimer forms of ISG15 are important for these activities. Nitrosylation of ISG15 could be one of the important regulatory steps during the ISG15 and ISGylation-dependent immune responses. However, current available assays to study ISG15 function are limited. It is necessary to develop new approaches to further elucidate the biological function of ISG15.

Changes in expression were verified by Western blot and quantitative PCR for protein and message expression. In mouse and human kidney, Nup88 expression was substantial in the papilla, whereas it was nearly absent in the cortex. Furthermore, the expression of Nup88 increased 410.4 ± 22% in the papilla of mice after 36 h of thirsting. Nup88 protein expression in IMCD3 cells was significantly up-regulated in the first 8 h following exposure to acute osmotic stress, indicating that Nup88 is an early response protein. To define the function of Nup88 in the osmotic stress response, the transcription factor associated with hypertonicity, tonicity enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP), was cloned upstream of the green fluorescent protein. Employing this construct, we demonstrate that silencing Nup88 in IMCD3 cells acutely stressed to hypertonic conditions reduces nuclear retention of TonEBP, resulting in a substantial blunting in transcription of important osmotic stress response target genes and reduced cell viability. Finally, we show that in IMCD3 cells, nuclear export of TonEBP under isotonic conditions involves CRM-1 but under hypertonic stress is CRM1-independent. Our data, therefore, suggest that Nup88 is up-regulated in response to hypertonic stress and acts to retain TonEBP in the nucleus, activating transcription of critical osmoprotective genes.

Under isotonic conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O), TonEBP is mainly present in the cytosol with only minor localization in the nucleus.

Kehlenbach R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6772-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Roth P. Xylourgidis N. Sabri N. Uv A. Fornerod M. Samakovlis C. J.

It was previously demonstrated in Drosophila that Nup88 does not interfere in the nuclear import of NF-κB and instead acts as an inhibitor of CRM1-mediated protein export (20Roth P. Xylourgidis N. Sabri N. Uv A. Fornerod M. Samakovlis C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Xylourgidis N. Roth P. Sabri N. Tsarouhas V. Samakovlis C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4409-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In experiments with mutated (inactive) Nup88, CRM1 expression is mislocalized in the nucleus and is not present in the nuclear membrane. Interestingly, this mislocalization resulted in a continuous shuttling of the NF-κB Rel-like transcription factor Dorsal in and out of the nucleus (22Xylourgidis N. Roth P. Sabri N. Tsarouhas V. Samakovlis C. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4409-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data suggest that CRM1 and, therefore, Nup88 expression are necessary for regulating Dorsal nuclear export. The mechanism by which Nup88 functions is by sequestering CRM1 at the nuclear pore and thereby avoiding its recycling back to the nucleus for another round of export. Similarly, another Rel-like transcription factor, Dif, seems to be regulated by Nup88 expression in Drosophila (20Roth P. Xylourgidis N. Sabri N. Uv A. Fornerod M. Samakovlis C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Likewise, other members of the Rel-like transcription factor class, including TonEBP (10Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), may be controlled by the expression of Nup88. The up-regulation of Nup88 under hypertonic stress in the kidney has not been previously described. The present work was undertaken to confirm the observations made by antibody microarray analysis and further characterize the osmotic regulation of expression, half-life, cellular distribution, and in vivo expression. Furthermore, we identify a potential role for Nup88 in the nuclear retention of TonEBP in hypertonically stressed cells. Materials—Cell culture medium, FCS, and antibiotics were from Invitrogen. Antibodies to Nup88 and GS15 were obtained from Clontech, anti-AR antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Hsp70 was from Stressgen (Ann Arbor, MI), and anti-β-actin was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Antibody Microarray—Antibody microarrays and reagents were purchased from Clontech. Microarrays were processed as per the manufacturer's protocol and as previously described (17Lanaspa M.A. Almeida N.E. Andres-Hernando A. Rivard C.J. Capasso J.M. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13672-13677Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Antibody microarrays were analyzed using a ProScanArray HT scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culture—The established IMCD3 cell line originally developed by Rauchman et al. (23Rauchman M.I. Nigam S.K. Delpire E. Gullans S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Steve Gullans (Rx Gen, Hamden, CT). IMCD3 cells chronically adapted to 600 and 900 mosmol/kg H2O were previously established in our laboratory (24Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Enomoto L.M. Berl T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and were compared with cells grown at isotonic conditions. In experiments involving hypertonic stress, the media in culture dishes were exchanged for that with added NaCl to the specified osmolality, depending on the experiment. Osmolality was determined with a microosmometer (model 3300; Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA). Cell Viability and Growth Experiments—Cell viability in tissue culture stress experiments was determined by cell counts following exposure to sublethal osmotic stress. Experiments were initiated once cells reached confluence at isotonic conditions in 24-well flat bottom tissue culture plates (35-3047; Falcon BD Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ), with each experimental time point after exposure to the sublethal osmotic stress performed in triplicate. In cell growth studies, cell counts were initiated when cultures had reached ∼90% confluence and followed for an additional 80-h period with counts at 24 and 48 h. Growth curves were fit to linear regression using the Prism 4.0 software, and the slopes of the curves were compared for relative differences in growth rate. Stable Cell Lines Silenced for Nup88 Expression—IMCD3 cultures were transfected with the pSM2 empty vector (v2MM_173601) or the short hairpin RNA vector pSM2-Nup88 (v2HS_152407; Open Biosystems) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Stable transfectants (clones) were selected from colonies growing in plates from a 10-fold dilution series in media prepared with 10 μg/ml puromycin antibiotic (Sigma). The absence of Nup88 expression in silenced clones was verified by Western blot of cell lysates obtained from these clones grown in media adjusted to 500 mosmol/kg H2O for 48 h. Cloning and Transfection of the Construct TonEBP-GFP—The first 800 bp of mouse TonEBP, including the nuclear export signal, the auxiliary export domain, and the nuclear localization signal, was obtained by PCR using the following primers, which contained, respectively, XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites (both underlined) for directional cloning into pAcGFP-N1 vector (Clontech): sense, 5′-GAC CTC GAG ATG CCC TCG GAC TTC ATC TCA TTG CTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GAC GAA TTC GAG GTG CTT TGG CAC TGT CGG CAT CAA-3′. Transfection into IMCD3 cells or into the stable cell lines expressing pSM2-Nup88 vector or pSM2-Empty vector control was performed using Lipofectamine 2000. Mouse Kidney Tissues—C57/B6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were subjected to food and ad libitum water or deprived for water for 36 h. Urine samples were collected from the bladder for osmolality analysis. Mice were harvested by cervical dislocation, and kidneys were removed. Papilla and cortex tissues were dissected and homogenized with a glass tissue grinder on ice with mitogen-activated protein kinase lysis buffer for protein and analyzed as described (24Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human Kidney Tissues—Human kidney tissues from cortex and papilla were obtained under the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and National Institutes of Health Grant U19A10636030 from a kidney that was not suitable for transplantation. Tissues were processed for protein as described above. RNA Extraction, Analysis, and Message Quantification—Cytosolic RNA was isolated from confluent cell cultures using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Before quantitative PCR (QPCR), sample RNA concentration and integrity was assessed by UV spectrometry (absorbance at 260 nm) and by capillary electrophoresis using a bioanalyzer (model 210, Agilent, Foster City, CA; using the 28 S to 18 S rRNA ratio), respectively. RNA was converted to cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). QPCR was performed using primer pairs identified in supplemental Table 3, designed using Beacon Designer 7.0 (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). QPCR runs were performed using the SYBR green JumpStart Taq Readymix QPCR kit (Sigma) on an I-Cycler (Bio-Rad). QPCR runs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and melt curve to verify that the correct amplicon was produced. β-Actin RNA was used as internal control in all QPCRs, and the amount of RNA was calculated by the comparative CT method. Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Cell protein lysates were obtained from confluent cell culture dishes as previously described (24Capasso J.M. Rivard C.J. Berl T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F768-F776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Seventy micrograms of total protein was loaded per lane for SDS-PAGE (7.5%, w/v) analysis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibody and visualized by using an alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody and Lumi-Phos reagent (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Chemiluminescence was recorded with an Image Station 440CF (Kodak Digital Science), and results were analyzed with 1D Image Software (Kodak Digital Science). Blots were also analyzed for β-actin as a loading control. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—IMCD3 cells were seeded in 8-well chambers (Nunc) and stained using an anti-Nup88 antibody (1:50 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline; Clontech) or anti-TonEBP antibody (1:400 dilution in PBS) kindly provided by Dr. H. Moo Kwon (University of Maryland). Inmunofluorescence was carried out as previously described (17Lanaspa M.A. Almeida N.E. Andres-Hernando A. Rivard C.J. Capasso J.M. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13672-13677Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparations and TonEBP-GFP fusion protein transfections were imaged with a ×40 water immersion objective using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (model LSM510; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Data were analyzed with LSM Image analyzer postacquisition software (Zeiss). Statistics and Data Analysis—All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Data graphics and statistical analysis were performed using Instat (version 3.0) and Prism 4 (both from GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Independent replicates for each data point (n) are identified in figure legends. p < 0.05 was recognized as statistically significant. Nup88 Expression Is Up-regulated under Hypertonic Stress—Employing antibody microarray proteomics (Clontech, Mountain View, CA), we found that 5% of the 512 proteins analyzed were up-regulated (17Lanaspa M.A. Almeida N.E. Andres-Hernando A. Rivard C.J. Capasso J.M. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13672-13677Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) in IMCD3 cells chronically adapted to hypertonic stress (900 mosmol/kg H2O) as compared with cells grown under isotonic conditions. As shown in Fig. 1A, the Golgi vesicle soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor protein (GS15) is representative of the greater than 90% of the proteins whose expression did not change under hypertonic conditions. In contrast, Nup88 demonstrated a substantial increase in expression in hypertonically adapted cells. A statistical analysis of four spots for each protein (from two arrays; i.e. dye swap (Fig. 1B)) showed an internal normalization ratio for Nup88 signal intensity of 1.65 (p < 0.001) as compared with 1.05 for GS15. Validation of antibody microarray data was performed by QPCR and Western blot. Data shown in Fig. 1C indicate a substantial increase in Nup88 message levels (7-fold; p < 0.001) in cells adapted to 900 mosmol/kg H2O as compared with isotonic conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O). This up-regulation was also substantial for protein expression (12.9-fold; p < 0.001) under the same conditions. For comparison, Western blots prepared with anti-GS15 demonstrated equal protein expression in IMCD3 cells at isotonic and hypertonic conditions (Fig. 1D). Expression of Nup88 in Renal Cortex and Medulla from Rodents and Human Kidney—To assess whether the changes seen in cultured cells are also observed in vivo, we examined the renal tissues of mice and a human kidney. Western blot data shown in Fig. 2A reveal a near absence of Nup88 protein expression in the cortex of both species. In contrast, substantial Nup88 protein expression was determined in the papilla for both mice and human. These determinations were made in mice on ad libitum water intake. The difference between cortex and papilla is quantitatively depicted in Fig. 2B. We also examined the kidney tissues of mice subjected to 36 h of thirsting (urine osmolality increased from 1,424 ± 211 to 3,105 ± 524 mosmol/kg H2O; n = 6). As shown in Fig. 2B, thirsting increased Nup88 expression by 2-fold (107 ± 12%, p < 0.01) in the cortex and 5-fold (410 ± 22%, p < 0.01) in the papilla tissues. Immunocytochemical Localization of Nup88 in Cells Adapted to Hypertonicity—Immunofluorescence microscopy studies were undertaken to assess the presence and localization of Nup88 protein in IMCD3 cells at isotonic conditions and chronically adapted to hypertonicity (900 mosmol/kg H2O). Fig. 3 shows that Nup88 expression (green) is substantial in IMCD3 cells chronically adapted to 900 mosmol/kg H2Oas compared with isotonic conditions where no Nup88 signal is found. The presence of Nup88 in the nuclear membrane is confirmed by colocalization with the nuclear marker DAPI. Kinetics of Nup88 Message and Protein Expression with Acute Exposure to Hypertonicity—Nup88 protein expression in IMCD3 cells subjected to acute sublethal osmotic stress was evaluated to determine the timing of expression. To this end, we performed Western blot analysis for protein at numerous time points after exposure to acute sublethal hypertonicity (550 mosmol/kg H2O). Data shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate a significant increase in Nup88 protein expression after 4-6 h of hypertonic stress (p < 0.01). To assess the half-life for Nup88 message and protein, IMCD3 cells were returned to isotonic conditions. Data shown in Fig. 5 were curve-fit for exponential decay, and the half-life was calculated to be 2.8 and 18.4 h for message and protein, respectively. Separately, cells were treated with actinomycin D or cyclohexamide to evaluate potential changes in the stability of Nup88 message and protein. These data were essentially identical to the data shown in Fig. 5 indicating no significant changes in the stability of Nup88 message or protein (data not shown).FIGURE 5Estimation of half-life for Nup88 mRNA and protein in IMCD3 cells. A, QPCR and Western blot analysis were from three independent experiments performed in duplicate (n = 6). B, a representative Western blot including a β-actin loading control is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Studies on the Osmotic and Ionic Mediators of the Up-Regulation of Nup88 Expression to Hypertonic Stress—To assess whether the effects observed with increasing NaCl levels were unique to this solute, Nup88 protein expression was measured after exposure to other mediators added to the medium to reach the same osmolality (550 mosmol/kg H2O). As depicted in Fig. 6, replacement of sodium by choline or chloride by acetate does not affect the response (p < 0.01 versus isotonic). Other solutes, including sucrose, mannitol, and, interestingly, urea, also caused a marked increase in Nup88 protein expression (p < 0.01 versus isotonic). Development and Use of a TonEBP-GFP Construct to Study Trafficking in IMCD3 Cells under Changing Osmotic Stress—Primers for the N terminus of human TonEBP (amino acids 1-267) that include the nuclear export signal, auxiliary export domain, and nuclear localization signal were designed to amplify an 800-bp fragment from cDNA of murine IMCD3 cells chronically adapted at 900 mosmol/kg H2O. Sequence data for the amplicon and its translation are shown as supplemental data (supplemental Tables 1 and 2, respectively). The amplicon was cloned into pAcGFP-N1 (Clontech) upstream of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). To validate the utility of the TonEBP-GFP construct, a comparison was made with antibody labeling of fixed cells. Fig. 7 shows the results obtained from IMCD3 cells transfected with the TonEBP-GFP construct (columns 2 and 4) as compared with immunohistochemistry analysis (columns 1 and 3). In both cases, cells maintained at isotonic conditions (300 mosmol/kg H2O) demonstrated that the majority of the TonEBP signal is present in the cytosol (with some nuclear staining), whereas in cells acutely stressed to 550 mosmol/kg H2O for 30 min, TonEBP is rapidly shifted to the nucleus. Analysis of confocal images reveals that the TonEBP-GFP construct cells demonstrate a more profound and quantifiable image as compared with immunostained cells. The application of the TonEBP-GFP construct also, and more importantly, allows for live imaging of TonEBP trafficking in IMCD3 cells in response to changes in acute osmotic stress. We therefore employed the TonEBP-GFP construct in further experiments. TonEBP Is Exported from the Nucleus under Hypertonic Stress in Cells Silenced for Nup88 Expression—IMCD3 cells were silenced for expression of Nup88 employing a commercial vector pSM2-Nup88 (Open Biosystems). BLAST and alignment analysis were performed to ascertain the selectivity of the silencing sequence with other genes that may induce off-target responses. Analysis reveals a <70% homology of the silencing sequence with well known nucleoporins and exportins. In addition, message levels for nucleoporins and exportins reported to be involved with Nup88, including Nup153 (26Kodiha M. Tran D. Qian C. Morogan A. Presley J.F. Brown C.M. Stochaj U. Biochim.

Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), did not change significantly in Nup88-silenced cells as compared with empty vector controls (data not shown). Stable silenced clones using puromycin (10 μg/ml) were validated as depicted in supplemental Fig. 1A. Two clones (clones 3 and 6) were selected for further experiments, since they showed nearly complete silencing of Nup88 expression under hypertonic stress. Fig. 8A depicts a stable control cell line expressing pSM2-Empty Vector (left) or pSM2-Nup88 clone 3 (right) and transiently transfected with the TonEBP-GFP construct. In cells expressing the empty vector control, TonEBP (green) is present in the nucleus after 8 h of acute sublethal stress (550 mosmol/kg H2O), as demonstrated by its colocalization with DAPI (blue). In contrast, in Nup88-silenced cells (right), the TonEBP is mainly present in the cytosol under hypertonic conditions. Comparative fluorescence measurement of the TonEBP-GFP signal is shown in Fig. 8B and reveals that 80 ± 4% of the TonEBP signal remains in the nucleus of empty vector control cells, whereas only 25 ± 2% of TonEBP remains in nucleus of cells silenced for Nup88 expression (p < 0.001, n > 35 cells/condition). This finding is supported by a significant decrease in message levels of TonEBP target genes (p < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 9A, levels of AR, sodium-myoinositol transporter, BGT1, TauT, and Hsp70 are lower in Nup88 silenced cells (solid bars) as compared with empty vector control cells (open bars) (p < 0.001). Fig. 9B depicts a representative Western blot for AR and Hsp70 from these cells in which levels of AR protein expression are significantly blunted in cells silenced for Nup88 as compared with empty vector control cells. Interestingly, there is a complete absence of Hsp70 protein expression in cells silenced for Nup88, corroborating the data obtained by QPCR. In contrast, mRNA levels of non-TonEBP target genes, such as the α1 subunit of the Na/K-ATPase (ATP1a1) (29Capasso J.M. Rivard C. Berl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13414-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), did not change in Nup88-silenced cells as compared with the empty vector control cells (Fig. 9A). We also examined the expression of AR and Hsp70 in a clone that was partially silenced, clone 4, and a clone that had almost full Nup88 expression, clone 5 (see supplemental Fig. 1A). As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, B, C, and D, an intermediate phenotype was found for AR, and Hsp70 mRNA (Fig. 1C) and protein (Fig. 1D) expression were found in the partially silenced clone 4. In contrast, no significant difference was found between empty vector control cells and the nonsilenced clone 5.

https://openalex.org/W2039481540,"Mot1 is an essential, conserved TATA-binding protein (TBP)-associated factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a member of the Snf2/Swi2 ATPase family. Mot1 uses ATP hydrolysis to displace TBP from DNA, an activity that can be readily reconciled with its global role in gene repression. Less well understood is how Mot1 directly activates gene expression. It has been suggested that Mot1-mediated activation can occur by displacement of inactive TBP-containing complexes from promoters, thereby permitting assembly of functional transcription complexes. Mot1 may also activate transcription by other mechanisms that have not yet been defined. A gap in our understanding has been the absence of biochemical information related to the activity of Mot1 on natural target genes. Using URA1 as a model Mot1-activated promoter, we show striking differences in the way that both TBP and Mot1 interact with DNA compared with other model DNA substrates analyzed previously. These differences are due at least in part to the propensity of TBP alone to bind to the URA1 promoter in the wrong orientation to direct appropriate assembly of the URA1 preinitiation complex. The results suggest that Mot1-mediated activation of URA1 transcription involves at least two steps, one of which is the removal of TBP bound to the promoter in the opposite orientation required for URA1 transcription.

Such mobilization of TBP may be critical for clearance of TBP from inactive but high affinity sites, and may facilitate selection of appropriate TATA sequences among a collection of binding sites along accessible promoter DNA. Mot1 is a member of the Snf2/Swi2 ATPase family (19Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 20Davis J.L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Like NC2, it also interacts directly with TBP and regulates TBP binding. However, Mot1 uses a completely different mechanism; ATP hydrolysis by Mot1 catalyzes TBP-DNA dissociation (21Auble D.T. Hansen K.E. Mueller C.G.F. Lane W.S. Thorner J. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1920-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). TBP is unusual among DNA-binding proteins that bind duplex DNA with high affinity in that it binds both defined TATA boxes as well as repetitive TpA sequences (22Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.-H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Its high affinity results in a long lifetime that compensates for slow association (23Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of TBP binding to DNA is critical for nucleation of the pol II PIC at TATA-containing promoters, but the plethora of “TATA-like” sequences in the genome complicates the discrimination of bona fide core promoters from spurious sites. The solution to ensuring high TBP mobility in the face of the requirement for stable DNA binding apparently involves the combined action of NC2, which mobilizes TBP along DNA, and Mot1, which uses ATP to eject it. Many NC2- and Mot1-regulated promoters are repressed by these factors, but paradoxically, a great number of promoters require these factors for transcriptional activation (13Dasgupta A. Darst R.P. Martin K.J. Afshari C.A. Auble D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Geisberg J.V. Holstege F.C. Young R.A. Struhl K. Mol.

The ability of NC2 to facilitate TBP diffusion along the DNA length can in principle explain how it activates or represses transcription, depending on the sequence and chromatin context. Although TBP-DNA dissociation activity of Mot1 can explain how it represses transcription, how it activates transcription is much less well understood. We previously showed that a mutation in MOT1 increases TBP occupancy at Mot1-activated promoters in vivo (26Dasgupta A. Juedes S.A. Sprouse R.O. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1717-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This increase in TBP occupancy was in contrast to the decrease in occupancy observed for other PIC components, including TFIIB, TAFs, and pol II (26Dasgupta A. Juedes S.A. Sprouse R.O. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1717-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the idea that Mot1 is required to remove a transcriptionally inactive, kinetically trapped TBP-containing complex. Removal of such complexes would stimulate transcription by allowing additional cycles of TBP binding to occur in a timely fashion, with active TBP-containing complexes being stabilized against Mot1 action by binding of other PIC components. However, the results do not rule out the possibility that Mot1 functions as a co-activator, which facilitates PIC assembly subsequent to TBP binding in some novel way. In parallel to the in vivo studies, biochemical approaches have provided insight into the architecture of the Mot1-TBP-DNA complex and the mechanism of TBP-DNA dissociation catalyzed by the enzyme. Analyses of different DNA templates, Mot1 mutants, footprinting, and cross-linking have established that although Mot1 has no detectable DNA binding on its own, in the absence of ATP, it forms a ternary complex with TBP and DNA via interaction with residues in TBP and contact with base pairs within an ∼17-bp region upstream of the TATA box (27Darst R.P. Wang D. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2028-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Pereira L.A. van der Knaap J.A. van den Boom V. van den Heuvel F.A. Timmers H.T. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13216-13226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The length of the upstream DNA region is about what would be expected if the Mot1 ATPase docks onto DNA in a manner similar to that of a highly related ATPase, SsoRad54 (30Durr H. Korner C. Muller M. Hickmann V. Hopfner K.-P. Cell. 2005; 121: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis by Mot1 greatly accelerates the dissociation of TBP from DNA. Combined biochemical, mutational, and model building studies suggest that the ATPase catalytic mechanism involves translocation along DNA, and displacement of TBP by Mot1 may occur by translocation through the TBP-DNA interface (31Sprouse R.O. Brenowitz M. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1492-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One surprising observation was that even in the absence of ATP, almost half of the ternary complexes have stabilities that are much reduced compared with TBP-DNA alone, whereas the remaining ternary complexes were very stable, and ATP hydrolysis was required to disassemble them (31Sprouse R.O. Brenowitz M. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1492-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity in ternary complex stability was interpreted to reflect conformational heterogeneity in the Mot1 ATPase itself, which may be related to conformational changes driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis (31Sprouse R.O. Brenowitz M. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1492-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the existing biochemical data have provided insight into the Mot1 catalytic mechanism, what is missing is a link between the biochemical results and the function of Mot1 at natural, Mot1-activated target promoters. Most of the biochemical studies of Mot1 action have been performed using variants of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP), which was advantageous because it provides a unique, well characterized, high affinity TBP-binding site. However, it is clear that core promoters have different properties in vitro and in vivo (32Muller F. Demeny M.A. Tora L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14685-14689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the extent to which promoter sequence influences Mot1 activity, or perhaps even confers novel biochemical activity upon the enzyme, has not been investigated. Here we show that the basic biochemical understanding of Mot1 binding and catalytic activity obtained using TBP bound to AdMLP-derived templates is well supported by analyses of the activity of Mot1 on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae URA1 promoter, a natural Mot1-activated target promoter. However, the results also reveal multiple differences in Mot1 function at URA1, indicating that the core promoter sequence strongly influences Mot1 activity and suggesting that Mot1-mediated activation of URA1 transcription involves at least two separate activities of Mot1. Surprisingly, we show that TBP tends to bind to the URA1 TATA box with the wrong polarity to support URA1 PIC formation, suggesting that displacement of TBP bound to the promoter in the reverse orientation by Mot1 is one critical aspect of its activation function. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains used for the in vivo analyses are derivatives of YPH499 (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were described previously (13Dasgupta A. Darst R.P. Martin K.J. Afshari C.A. Auble D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MOT1 shuffling strains were transformed with plasmids carrying the indicated MOT1 alleles and plated on 5-FOA to select for loss of the URA3-marked MOT1 plasmid. For the experiments in Fig. 9, MOT1 shuffling strains were transformed with two plasmids, one carrying MOT1 and the other SPT15, prior to selection on 5-FOA. TBP plasmids (35Spencer J.V. Arndt K.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 8744-8755Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were obtained from Karen Arndt and are as follows: pJVS49 (TBP A100P), pJVS50 (TBP P191A), and pJVS54 (TBP A100P, P191A). A yeast plasmid expressing TBPm3 (36Strubin M. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 68: 721-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was obtained from Kevin Struhl. For growth assays, spots are 10-fold serial dilutions of the indicated strains grown at 30 °C for 2-3 days. For Northern blotting, cells were grown at 30 °C to an OD ∼1.0. The temperature was then rapidly switched to 35 °C by addition of an equal volume of pre-warmed 40 °C media and heat-shocked at 35 °C for 45 min. Cells were then harvested for isolation of total RNA as described below. RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated using hot acid-phenol extraction (37Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, 20 μg of total RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). DNA probes were generated by random priming of PCR products amplified from a portion of the indicated open reading frames. Blots were hybridized overnight in low stringency hybridization solution (30% formamide, 4× SSC, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml RNA, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's, 5% SDS) and washed twice for 15 min, followed by 1 h with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Bands were detected by autoradiography and visualized using a PhosphorImager. Quantitation was performed using ImageQuant software. In Vivo Site-directed Mutagenesis—Chromosomal mutations were performed by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides as described previously (38Storici F. Lewis L.K. Resnick M.A. Nature Biotech. 2001; 19: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In brief, the CORE cassette, containing the markers URA3 and KanMX, was recombined into the URA1 promoter in place of the TATA element. Integration was scored by G418 resistance. Oligonucleotides were designed with the desired sequence elements (TATAΔ, MLP-F, MLP-R, and TGTA) and 45 bases of homologous sequence on either side to allow for efficient recombination to take place. Double-stranded, completely overlapping sequences were annealed and transformed at varying concentrations (25-125 μg) to achieve the maximum recombination efficiency. Homologous recombinants were selected by growth on 5-FOA, and integration was confirmed by colony PCR using primers that flank the URA1 promoter region, as well as sensitivity to growth on media containing G418. Total genomic DNA was harvested from positive colonies, and the URA1 promoter was sequenced to verify the sequence change. Strains were transformed with LEU2-marked plasmids carrying MOT1 or mot1-42 prior to transformation with the double-stranded oligonucleotides so that growth on 5-FOA indicated colonies that had lost both the CORE cassette and the URA3 plasmid from the original MOT1 shuffling strain. Protein Purification—Full-length yeast Mot1 was isolated to apparent homogeneity from a yeast overexpression system as described previously (34Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 4842-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Full-length yeast TBP and TBP core domain (TBPc) were isolated to apparent homogeneity using bacterial overexpression systems as described previously (39Gupta S. Cheng H. Mollah A.K.M.M. Jamison E. Morris S. Chance M.R. Khrapunov S. Brenowitz M. Biochem. 2007; 46: 9886-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A bacterial expression plasmid for production of TBP E188C was constructed using standard procedures (40Li F. Mullins J.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar). TBP E188C was expressed and purified as described for the wild-type protein (39Gupta S. Cheng H. Mollah A.K.M.M. Jamison E. Morris S. Chance M.R. Khrapunov S. Brenowitz M. Biochem. 2007; 46: 9886-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Footprinting and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—These assays were performed as described (29Darst R.P. Dasgupta A.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 478-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the radiolabeled probes shown in Table 1. The DNA concentration in each reaction was < 1 nm, and the concentrations of TBP, Mot1, and ATP are indicated in the figure legends. DNA molecules were radiolabeled by the Klenow fill-in reaction using [α-32P]dCTP or [α-32P]dATP to label the top or bottom strand and to achieve the DNA fragment lengths shown in Fig. 5. Table 1 shows the annealed oligoduplexes with their names written above and below the annealed strands. In Table 1, T or B signifies the top (written 5′ to 3′) or bottom strand (written 3′ to 5′), respectively. The probes used in Fig. 5 were named as in Table 1 without the T or B designations; the probes with the suffix C indicate labeling was performed using [α-32P]dCTP, whereas those probes with no suffix were labeled with [α-32P]dATP. Footprinting was performed using the URA1 FP1 probe or, in the case of TATA box mutants, analogous probes with the indicated sequence changes. Kinetic analysis was performed by quantifying the change in the TATA box footprint as described (30Durr H. Korner C. Muller M. Hickmann V. Hopfner K.-P. Cell. 2005; 121: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).TABLE 1URA1 probes Open table in a new tab FIGURE 5DNA downstream of TATA is required for Mot1 binding and dissociation of TBP from URA1 DNA. A, representative electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiment performed as in Fig. 2A using either radiolabeled WT URA1 DNA or Δ2, a URA1 fragment truncated on the downstream site of the TATA box (see schematic in D). B and C, quantitation of gel mobility shift results for the indicated DNA probes. The bar height represents the relative free DNA in each reaction, ± S.D., determined from at least three independently performed experiments. F, free DNA; T, reaction containing 14 nm TBP; TM, reaction containing 14 nm TBP and 11.6 nm Mot1; TMA, reaction containing 14 nm TBP, 11.6 nm Mot1, and 25 μm ATP. D, schematic of the DNA probes used in the experiments in A-C, and summary of the results. The top set of nine probes was derived from the URA1 promoter. The open rectangle represents the TATA element sequence denoted above it, and the numbers above the flanking DNA segments indicate their lengths in base pairs. The Δ2-2C, Δ2, Δ6, Δ8, and Δ7 probes possess 30 bp of flanking DNA upstream of the TATA sequence and varying lengths of 3′-flanking DNA as indicated. The Δ5, Δ9, and Δ1 probes possess 60 bp of 3′-flanking DNA and varying lengths of 5′-flanking DNA as indicated. The bottom set of seven probes was derived by combining portions of the URA1 and AdMLP promoters, plus appropriate controls. MLP Δ3′ is derived entirely from the AdMLP promoter. In this and other probes in this series, the shaded rectangle represents the AdMLP TATA sequence, TATAAAAG, and the thick black bars indicate AdMLP upstream or downstream sequence. As in the first set of probes, the lengths of flanking DNA, in base pairs, are indicated above the DNA segments. Δ2-2C is shown twice in D simply to make comparison with other constructs easier. Δ4-2C and Δ4 probes possess the indicated lengths of AdMLP flanking DNA upstream of the URA1 TATA box and the indicated lengths of URA1 3′-flanking DNA. Probes Δ3-2C, Δ3-3C, and Δ3 possess the AdMLP TATA sequence but URA1 5′-flanking DNA. The 3′-flanking DNA for Δ3-2C was from the AdMLP promoter, whereas the 3′-flanking DNA for the Δ3-3C and Δ3 probes was derived from the URA1 promoter. A check mark indicates that TBP complexes formed on the indicated probe formed ternary complexes with Mot1 and were dissociated in the presence of Mot1 and ATP. An X indicates that Mot1 binding was poor or undetectable, and little or no catalysis of TBP-DNA dissociation was observed in reactions containing ATP. In no case was ternary complex formation observed without ATP-dependent catalytic activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting and Fe-BABE Cleavage Assays—DNA fragments of ∼100 nucleotides bearing approximately centered AdMLP or URA1 TATA elements were prepared by PCR amplification of plasmids pRW2 and pURA1 using the primers GCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGAT, TCGCAGACAGCGATGCGGAA and GGTGGCGGCCGCTCTAGAAT, TGTAATCCAAGGAAGAATA, respectively. A single 32P end label was introduced by kinasing one of the primers in each amplification. The products were purified on 5% native acrylamide gels; the full-length DNA was electroeluted from a gel slice. Changes in the solvent accessibility of the DNA as a function of TBP binding were probed by its reactivity to hydroxyl radicals (.OH) produced by the Fenton reaction (42Fenton H.J.H. J. Chem. Soc. 1894; 65: 899-910Crossref Google Scholar). Production of the .OH was initiated by simultaneous mixing of 0.9% of H2O2 and 7 mm Fe(II)-EDTA with the solutions of DNA or DNA-protein complex in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The footprinting reaction was terminated at 1 min by addition of thiourea to 30 mm. The [32P]DNA was ethanol-precipitated, and the fragments resulting from .OH cleavage were separated by denaturing PAGE. Autoradiograms of the gels were obtained by exposure to phosphor storage plates and quantitated with single band resolution using the SAFA software (52Roy A. Exinger F. Losson R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 5257-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The intensity of each band was normalized for the average intensity of resolved bands in the lane. Relative .OH reactivity was calculated as the difference in the normalized band intensities for the DNA-protein complex and the DNA alone. TBP E188C was labeled by FeBABE using the ProFound™ protein interaction mapping kit (Pierce). The labeling procedure described in the manufacturer's manual was followed exactly except for the condition for the conjugation of the FeBABE. TBP E188C was conjugated with FeBABE at 20 °C for 3 h to prevent protein denaturation. The 32P-end-labeled DNA fragment was incubated with FeBABE-labeled TBP E188C at 25 °C for 30 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The cleavage reaction was initiated by addition of ascorbic acid and the stable peroxide reagent provided in the kit (Pierce). The reaction was quenched after 30 s by the addition of 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol. The DNA fragments resulting from cleavage were separated and visualized as described above. A “DNA only” control lane contained all the reagents except for TBP E188C. Each band density was divided by an average density for all the analyzed bands in its lane. Presented is the difference between the normalized band densities in the TBP E188C-FeBABE-containing and DNA-only lanes. A Functional, Conserved TATA Element in the URA1 Promoter—The URA1 promoter was chosen for detailed analysis because our previous work showed that it is a direct target of Mot1-mediated activation (26Dasgupta A. Juedes S.A. Sprouse R.O. Auble D.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1717-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additionally, the URA1 transcription start sites were previously mapped (43Losson R. Fuchs R.P.P. Lacroute F. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 65-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the promoter harbors a well defined, phylogenetically conserved TATA element (Fig. 1, A and B). The TATA element is unusual in containing two overlapping potential TBP-binding sites oriented in opposite directions. Based on prior work (22Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.-H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 44Basehoar A.D. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Cell. 2004; 116: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), the top strand sequence TATATATG would be predicted to direct TBP binding in the appropriate orientation and distance for transcription initiation at the previously mapped URA1 start sites, whereas the overlapping bottom strand sequence, TATATAAA, would be predicted to bind TBP in the opposite orientation. The arrangement was intriguing because an inappropriately oriented TBP would interfere with PIC formation and might be a preferred substrate for Mot1-mediated displacement. To determine whether the TATA region of the URA1 promoter is functionally significant, we deleted it from the chromosomal copy of the gene. The 7-bp deletion removed both of the potential binding sites for TBP discussed above. Northern blotting showed that URA1 RNA was reduced about 10-fold in the TATAΔ strain compared with wild-type cells (WT) (Fig. 1C). The effect of TATAΔ was quantitatively similar to the decrease in URA1 RNA observed in mot1-42 cells bearing a WT URA1 promoter. The reduced expression of URA1 RNA driven by the TATAΔ promoter was further decreased in mot1-42 cells, indicating that the feeble expression driven by the TATAΔ promoter was still at least partially Mot1-dependent (Fig. 1C). In Vitro Analysis of TBP Binding to the URA1 Promoter—Having confirmed that this TATA element is critical for URA1 expression in vivo, we next tested whether TBP interacts with the TATA element in vitro"

We have recently demonstrated that ADP-ribosyl cyclases from Axinella polypoides, (Porifera, Demospongiae), Aplysia californica (Molluscs), and human CD38 can synthesize three adenylic dinucleotides from cyclic ADP-ribose and adenine (Ade): Ap2A and two isomers thereof, called P18 and P24, which are characterized by an unusual N-glycosidic bond between one adenine and the ribose (C1′-N1 in P18 and C1′-N3 in P24) (4Basile G.

These results prompted us to investigate the presence of P18 and P24 in human platelets; the effect of Ap2A, P18, and P24 on platelet aggregation; and possible synergistic or antagonistic effects of these adenylic dinucleotides with thrombin, ADP, or collagen, the most potent physiological platelet agonists. Materials—If not otherwise indicated, all chemicals were from Sigma and were of the highest purity grade available. Blood Collection and Platelet Preparation—Venous blood, freshly drawn from healthy volunteers, was collected in a 130 mm aqueous trisodium citrate anticoagulant solution (9:1). The donors declared not to have taken drugs known to interfere with platelet function during 2 weeks prior to blood collection. Washed platelets (WP) were prepared as described (8Leoncini G. Maresca M. Buzzi E. Piana A. Armani U. Eur. J. Hematol. 1990; 44: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelet-rich plasma, obtained by centrifugation of the whole blood at 100 × g for 25 min, supplemented with 2 μg/ml apyrase and 1 μm PGE1, was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min. The platelet pellet was washed once with ACD solution (75 mm trisodium citrate, 42 mm citric acid, and 136 mm glucose, pH 4.8), centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min, and then resuspended in Ca2+-free Hepes buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) or in Ca2+-free Tyrode's-Hepes buffer (134 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.9 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown on 24-well culture dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 m m l-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent 48 h prior to assay with either pcDNA 3.1 (empty vector), pcDNA3-hP2Y1, or pcDNA3-hP2Y12 together with pcDNA1-Gαq/i. pcDNA1-Gαq/i directs expression of a chimera of Gαq containing the last five amino acids of Gαi, which couples Gαi-coupled receptors to activation of phospholipase C (9Coward P.

Production and Purification of P18, P24, and Ap2A—P18 and P24, to be used for functional studies and as standards in the HPLC purification of the platelet dinucleotides, were produced with the purified ADP-ribosyl cyclase from A. polypoides and HPLC-purified as described by Basile et al.

HPLC Determination of P18, P24, and Ap2A Content in Human Platelets—The presence of the three adenylic dinucleotides was investigated both in resting and in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. In a typical experiment, 500-μl aliquots of WP suspension (5 × 108 platelets/ml) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C without or with 0.05 units/ml thrombin. Thereafter, aliquots were centrifuged, each supernatant was recovered, and pellets were sonicated twice for 15 s with an interval of 1 min. Lysed platelets were centrifuged (2600 × g for 5 min), and supernatants and pellets were recovered and deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid (5% final concentration). Trace amounts of 14C-labeled P18, P24, and Ap2A were added to the acid extracts to calculate the percentages of recovery of the various dinucleotides at the end of the purification procedure. Excess trichloroacetic acid was removed by diethylether extraction, and samples were analyzed by HPLC for the presence of the adenylic dinucleotides. All HPLC analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 instrument, equipped with a diode array spectrophotometric detector (HP 1040). Aliquots of 250 μl were subjected to the analytical phosphate HPLC (4Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Buzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14941-14942Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The column was a Delta Pak C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Waters). Solvent A was 0.1 m KH2PO4 containing 5 mm tetra-n-butylammonium, pH 5.0; solvent B was solvent A with 30% (v/v) methanol. The solvent program was a linear gradient starting at 100% A and increasing to 100% B in 30 min and then remaining at 100% B for 10 min. HPLC fractions containing P18, P24, or Ap2A were pooled, lyophilized, redissolved in deionized water, and injected into an analytical PLSAX column (50 × 4.6 mm, 8 μm; CPS). Solvent A was 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.6; solvent B was 500 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.6. The solvent program was the same as the one described above for reverse phase HPLC. The HPLC fractions containing the three dinucleotides were collected, dried, redissolved in deionized water, and reinjected into the analytical phosphate HPLC for final identification and quantitation (see Fig. 2 for representative chromatograms of the final purification step for each dinucleotide); P18, P24, and Ap2A were identified by comparison of their absorption spectra with computer-stored standards and were quantified by comparison of the computer-integrated peak areas with those of known amounts of the relevant dinucleotide standard. The percentage of recovery of the three adenylic dinucleotides at the end of the purification procedure was calculated from the yield of the corresponding radioactive tracer and was between 15 and 25% in the various purifications. Identification was confirmed by HPLC analysis of a nucleotide pyrophosphatase-digested parallel sample, showing conversion of the dinucleotide into the corresponding iso-AMP (or AMP for Ap2A) moiety (4Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Buzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

P18, P24, and Ap2A Production and Degradation by Human Platelets—WP suspensions (1.0 × 109 platelets/ml) were sonicated and incubated at 37 °C with 0.65 mm NAD+ and 6.5 mm Ade in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, for dinucleotide production, or with 0.02 mm Ap2A, P18, or P24, for dinucleotide degradation. At various times, aliquots of the suspension were withdrawn and deproteinized with 5% trichloroacetic acid, excess trichloroacetic acid was removed by diethylether extraction, and samples were injected into the analytical phosphate HPLC (4Basile G.

Measurement of Platelet Aggregation—Platelet aggregation, performed on a Menarini Aggrecoder PA-3210 aggregometer, was monitored according to Born's method (12Born G.V.R. Nature. 1962; 194: 927-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar) and quantified by light transmission for 3 min from the addition of the agonist. Platelet-rich plasma or WP (3.0 × 108 platelets/ml) were preincubated without (control) or with P18, P24, and Ap2A for 2 min at 37 °C before the addition of agonists (thrombin, ADP, or collagen). Measurement of Intraplatelet Calcium Levels—WP (3.0 × 108 platelets/ml), resuspended in Hepes buffer, were incubated with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 60 min at 37 °C. Prostaglandin E1 (2 μm final concentration) and EGTA (1 mm final concentration) were added before centrifugation of the Fura-2-loaded platelets for 15 min at 1100 × g. The platelet pellet was resuspended at 2.0 × 108 platelets/ml in Hepes buffer and preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with saline before the addition of the adenylic dinucleotides to be tested. When the effect of Ap2A, P18, and P24 was tested on platelets stimulated with thrombin, WP were preincubated with the adenylic dinucleotides for 5 min at 37 °C and then challenged with thrombin. Fluorescence of Fura-2-loaded platelets was measured at 37 °C in unstirred conditions in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence spectrometer model LS50B with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 509 nm. The fluorescence of fully saturated Fura-2 (Fmax) was obtained by lysing platelets with 50 μm digitonin in the presence of 2 mm Ca2+, whereas Fmin was determined by the subsequent addition of 20 mm EGTA. The fluorescence was fully quenched with 5 mm MnCl2 to yield the autofluorescence value. Dedicated software converted data into cytosolic Ca2+ concentration applying a Kd value for Fura-2 and Ca2+ of 135 nm. Inositol Phosphate Accumulation Assay in Transfected HeLa Cells—Cells were labeled overnight with 200 μl of serum-free, inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4 μCi/well 3H-labeled myo-inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). Assays were initiated with the addition of 5× concentrations of the indicated compounds in 50 μl of 50 mm LiCl, 250 mm Hepes, pH 7.25. Following incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the medium was removed by aspiration, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.75 ml of boiling 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. [3H]Inositol phosphates were isolated by Dowex column chromatography as described previously (13Nakahata N. Harden T.K. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Measurement of Nitric Oxide (NO) Production—WP (0.5 × 108 platelets/ml), resuspended in Hepes buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and prewarmed at 37 °C for 10 min with saline or additions, were incubated with 40 μm l-arginine and the various dinucleoside diphosphates (10 μm), alone or with thrombin (0.05 units/ml), for 15 min at 37 °C under mild horizontal shaking. The incubation was stopped by sonicating samples on ice. To measure the NO content, 0.55-ml aliquots of supernatant were added to equal volumes of glycine buffer (15 g/liter glycine NaOH, pH 9.7) containing activated cadmium beds (Fluka AG), which catalyze the chemical reduction of nitrate to nitrite (14Green L.C.

Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10796) Google Scholar), and incubated overnight at room temperature under horizontal shaking. Cadmium beds were activated immediately before each experiment by three subsequent washings with 0.2 n H2SO4, bidistilled water and glycine buffer, respectively. NO formation, determined by the Griess reagent (1% sulfanylamide in 2.5% H3PO4, 0.1% naphthylenediamine dihydrochloride), was measured at 540 nm using a sodium nitrite calibration curve (15Granger D.L.

Determination of cAMP Levels in 1321N1 Cells and Human Platelets—Control and hP2Y11-transfected 1321N1 cells were seeded in 35 × 10-mm dishes (0.5 × 106 cells/dish). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 0.6 ml of HBSS. P24, Ap2A, or buffer (control) were added at the indicated concentrations, and incubations were stopped after 0, 2.5, 5, or 15 min by removal of HBSS and the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid (PCA) (0.6 m). Cell extracts were collected and centrifuged to remove proteins; the cAMP content was measured on the neutralized cell extracts by radioimmunoassay ([3H]cAMP assay system; GE Healthcare). Aliquots (300 μl, 1 × 109 platelets/ml) of WP from different healthy donors were preincubated or not for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μm NF157 prior to incubation with 10 μm P18, P24, or Ap2A for 15 min. Incubations were stopped by the addition of 26 μl of 9 m PCA, and then each sample was sonicated in ice at 2.5 watts for 10 s and centrifuged at 2600 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from each sample was collected, and the PCA was removed as described by Graeff and Lee (16Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP content was measured on neutralized platelet extracts by radioimmunoassay ([3H]cAMP assay system; GE Healthcare). Determination of IP3 Levels in 1321N1 Cells and Human Platelets—Control and hP2Y11-transfected 1321N1 cells were seeded in 35 × 10-mm dishes (0.5 × 106 cells/dish). After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 0.6 ml of HBSS. 10 μm P24 or Ap2A or buffer (control) were then added, and at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 min after the addition, the incubation was stopped by the removal of HBSS, the addition of 300 μl of ice-cold 0.6 m PCA, and scraping of the cells. The IP3 content was measured on the supernatants of the neutralized cell extracts by radioimmunoassay ([3H]IP3 Biotrak Assay System; Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots (200 μl, 1 × 109 platelets/ml) of WP from different healthy donors resuspended in Hepes buffer were incubated at 37 °C for 30 s in the presence of 10 μm P24 or Ap2A or buffer (control). At the end of each incubation, the suspensions were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by adding 13 μl of 9 m PCA at 4 °C. PCA was removed as described (16Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular IP3 concentration was determined as described above. Statistical Analyses—All parameters were tested by paired t test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Production of P18, P24, and Ap2A by Human Platelets—Human CD38, along with the ADP-ribosyl cyclases from the sponge A. polypoides and from the mollusc A. californica, has been shown to produce P18, P24, and Ap2A from cyclic ADP-ribose (or NAD+) and Ade (Fig. 1) (4Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Buzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, we preliminarily tested whether platelets also produced these adenylic dinucleotides. Indeed, P18, P24, and Ap2A production was observed upon incubation of sonicated WP with NAD+ (precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose) and Ade (Table 1). Interestingly, dinucleotide production was higher in platelets stimulated with thrombin (0.05 units/ml) as compared with resting platelets (Table 1). In the presence of 20 mm nicotinamide, an inhibitor of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, production of the three adenylic dinucleotides was abrogated (Table 1). No degradation of P24 and Ap2A was detectable in lysed platelets, either resting or activated; conversely, P18 was hydrolyzed to ADPR and Ade, similarly to what was observed for recombinant human CD38 (4Basile G. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Damonte G. Armirotti A. Buzzone S. Guida L. Franco L. Usai C. Fattorusso E. De Flora A. Zocchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This observation, together with the ability of platelet CD38 to synthesize the Ap2A isomers P18 and P24, in addition to Ap2A (Table 1), prompted us to investigate whether P18 and P24 were also present in human platelets and whether they were released during aggregation. HPLC analysis of acid extracts of resting platelets confirmed the presence of Ap2A at a concentration (∼20 μm) similar to that already reported (1Jankowski J. Hagemann J. Tepel M. van Der Giet M.

Both Ap2A isomers were indeed detected at a similar intraplatelet concentration (∼40 and 60 μm for P18 and P24, respectively). Neither Ap2A nor its isomers were detectable in the supernatant from resting platelets (Table 2). The intraplatelet concentration of all three adenylic dinucleotides increased in thrombin-stimulated, as compared with resting, platelets (1.5-, 1.3-, and 3-fold for P18, P24, and Ap2A, respectively; see Fig. 2 for representative chromatograms of the final purification step). All adenylic dinucleotides were released into the supernatant, where they were present at ∼40, 50, and 15 μm for P18, P24, and Ap2A, respectively (Table 2), when platelets were suspended at a concentration similar to that present in whole blood.TABLE 2Presence of P18, P24, and Ap2A in platelets and supernatants from thrombin-stimulated plateletsResting plateletsThrombin-activated plateletsPelletSupPelletSupμmμmP1841.1 ± 3.2ND60.4 ± 4.7ap < 0.01 compared with the dinucleotide concentration in resting platelets.37.3 ± 2.5P2463.5 ± 5.8ND82.2 ± 6.3ap < 0.01 compared with the dinucleotide concentration in resting platelets.52.1 ± 4.4Ap2A18.3 ± 2.4ND55.1 ± 3.6ap < 0.01 compared with the dinucleotide concentration in resting platelets.15.6 ± 1.1a p < 0.01 compared with the dinucleotide concentration in resting platelets.

Pretreatment of platelets for 2 min at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of P18, P24, or Ap2A (1, 5, and 10 μm) had no effect on platelet aggregation, as observed during the following 3 min at 37 °C under stirring. Conversely, down-regulation of platelet aggregation was observed when platelets were pretreated with the adenylic dinucleotides and then challenged with ADP, thrombin, or collagen. As shown in Fig. 3, ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly reduced by all three adenylic dinucleotides, with IC50 values of 7.2, 7.9, and 6.3 μm for P18, P24, and Ap2A, respectively (Table 3). In platelets treated with suboptimal concentrations of thrombin (0.05 units/ml) or collagen (1.5 μg/ml), aggregation was also inhibited in a concentration-dependent way by each of the three dinucleotides, although IC50 values were slightly higher compared with those observed upon ADP-induced aggregation (Table 3).TABLE 3IC50 values of P18, P24, and Ap2A on platelet aggregation induced by ADP, thrombin, or collagenIC50ADPThrombinCollagenμmP187.2 ± 0.67.3 ± 0.712.8 ± 1.2P247.9 ± 0.99.8 ± 1.116.8 ± 1.8Ap2A6.3 ± 0.718.9 ± 1.711.1 ± 0.8 Open table in a new tab P18, P24, and Ap2A Reduce the Thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i Rise in Intact Platelets—During platelet aggregation, an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) is known to occur downstream of the activation by ADP-, thrombin-, or collagen-specific receptors (17Sage S.O.
