https://openalex.org/W2417476499,"Human observers combine multiple sensory cues synergistically to achieve greater perceptual sensitivity, but little is known about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. We recorded the activity of neurons in the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) area during a task in which trained monkeys combined visual and vestibular cues near-optimally to discriminate heading. During bimodal stimulation, MSTd neurons combined visual and vestibular inputs linearly with subadditive weights. Neurons with congruent heading preferences for visual and vestibular stimuli showed improvements in sensitivity that parallel behavioral effects. In contrast, neurons with opposite preferences showed diminished sensitivity under cue combination. Responses of congruent cells were more strongly correlated with monkeys' perceptual decisions than were responses of opposite cells, suggesting that the monkey monitored the activity of congruent cells to a greater extent during cue integration. These findings show that perceptual cue integration occurs in nonhuman primates and identify a population of neurons that may form its neural basis."
https://openalex.org/W1999644599,"Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is a hallmark of transcriptional silencing in many organisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, dimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9m2) is important in the silencing of transposons and in the control of DNA methylation. We constructed a high-resolution genome-wide map of H3K9m2 methylation by using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with whole genome Roche Nimblegen microarrays (ChIP-chip). We observed a very high coincidence between H3K9m2 and CHG methylation (where H is either A,T or C) throughout the genome. The coding regions of genes that are associated exclusively with methylation in a CG context did not contain H3K9m2. In addition, we observed two distinct patterns of H3K9m2. Transposons and other repeat elements present in the euchromatic arms contained small islands of H3K9m2 present at relatively low levels. In contrast, pericentromeric/centromeric regions of Arabidopsis chromosomes contained long, rarely interrupted blocks of H3K9m2 present at much higher average levels than seen in the chromosome arms. These results suggest a complex interplay between H3K9m2 and different types of DNA methylation and suggest that distinct mechanisms control H3K9m2 in different compartments of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2048756080,"Background It is now emerging that for vaccines against a range of diseases including influenza, malaria and HIV, the induction of a humoral response is insufficient and a substantial complementary cell-mediated immune response is necessary for adequate protection. Furthermore, for some diseases such as tuberculosis, a cellular response seems to be the sole effector mechanism required for protection. The development of new adjuvants capable of inducing highly complex immune responses with strong antigen-specific T-cell responses in addition to antibodies is therefore urgently needed. Methods and Findings Herein, we describe a cationic adjuvant formulation (CAF01) consisting of DDA as a delivery vehicle and synthetic mycobacterial cordfactor as immunomodulator. CAF01 primes strong and complex immune responses and using ovalbumin as a model vaccine antigen in mice, antigen specific cell-mediated- and humoral responses were obtained at a level clearly above a range of currently used adjuvants (Aluminium, monophosphoryl lipid A, CFA/IFA, Montanide). This response occurs through Toll-like receptor 2, 3, 4 and 7-independent pathways whereas the response is partly reduced in MyD88-deficient mice. In three animal models of diseases with markedly different immunological requirement; Mycobacterium tuberculosis (cell-mediated), Chlamydia trachomatis (cell-mediated/humoral) and malaria (humoral) immunization with CAF01-based vaccines elicited significant protective immunity against challenge. Conclusion CAF01 is potentially a suitable adjuvant for a wide range of diseases including targets requiring both CMI and humoral immune responses for protection."
https://openalex.org/W2098210944,"The transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1) channel is the molecular target for environmental irritants and pungent chemicals, such as cinnamaldehyde and mustard oil. Extracellular Ca2+ is a key regulator of TRPA1 activity, both potentiating and subsequently inactivating it. In this report, we provide evidence that the effect of extracellular Ca2+ on these processes is indirect and can be entirely attributed to entry through TRPA1 and subsequent elevation of intracellular calcium. Specifically, we found that in a pore mutant of TRPA1, D918A, in which Ca2+ permeability was greatly reduced, extracellular Ca2+ produced neither potentiation nor inactivation. Both processes were restored by reducing intracellular Ca2+ buffering, which allowed intracellular Ca2+ levels to become elevated upon entry through D918A channels. Application of Ca2+ to the cytosolic face of excised patches was sufficient to produce both potentiation and inactivation of TRPA1 channels. Moreover, in whole cell recordings, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by UV uncaging of 1-(4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-EDTA-potentiated TRPA1 currents. In addition, our data show that potentiation and inactivation are independent processes. TRPA1 currents could be inactivated by Mg2+, Ba2+, and Ca2+ but potentiated only by Ba2+ and Ca2+. Saturating activation by cinnamaldehyde or mustard oil occluded potentiation but did not interfere with inactivation. Last, neither process was affected by mutation of a putative intracellular Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif. In conclusion, we have further clarified the mechanisms of potentiation and inactivation of TRPA1 using the D918A pore mutant, an important tool for investigating the contribution of Ca2+ influx through TRPA1 to nociceptive signaling.

TRPA1 is also activated directly by a wide range of chemicals that cause painful sensations, including food additives, such as mustard oil (MO), cinnamaldehyde (Cin), onion, raw garlic, and thyme; environmental irritants, such as formaldehyde and acrolein (a component of automobile exhaust); and products of oxidative stress (4Jordt S.E.

Many of these chemicals activate TRPA1 by binding covalently to reactive cysteine residues in the amino terminus of the protein (17Hinman A. Chuang H.H. Bautista D.M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

TRPA1 currents that are activated by pungent chemicals are rapidly potentiated in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, an effect that may be mediated by Ca2 entry through TRPA1 (4Jordt S.E.

This mechanism is attractive, since it could also account for the observed activation of TRPA1 by some inflammatory mediators (5Bautista D.M. Jordt S.E. Nikai T. Tsuruda P.R. Read A.J. Poblete J.

For example, bradykinin, acting through its cognate receptor, stimulates a phospholipase C-based signaling pathway, leading to elevation of intracellular Ca2+, and it has been proposed that Ca2+ is the proximate stimulus that gates TRPA1 (4Jordt S.E.

Activation of TRPA1 by intracellular Ca2+ has been observed in experiments where Ca2+ is dialyzed into cells or applied to excised patches (20Zurborg S. Yurgionas B. Jira J.A. Caspani O. Heppenstall P.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 21Doerner J.F. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Wetzel C.H. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), although it is not known whether this is the mechanism for Ca2+ potentiation or receptor activation of TRPA1. The site for Ca2+ activation of TRPA1 has been proposed to be an EF-hand present in the N terminus of the protein (20Zurborg S. Yurgionas B. Jira J.A. Caspani O. Heppenstall P.A. Nat.

A second and equally important effect of extracellular Ca2+ is to inactivate TRPA1 (e.g. see Refs. 4Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D.

TRPA1 currents activated by pungent chemicals in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, decay within seconds when extracellular Ca2+ is introduced (24Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Inactivation may be mediated by binding of Ca2+ to the outside of the channel or could be mediated by elevation of intracellular Ca2+, which is known to cause desensitization of other TRP channels (25Cholewinski A. Burgess G.M. Bevan S. Neuroscience. 1993; 55: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Docherty R.J. Yeats J.C. Bevan S. Boddeke H.W.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Alternatively, inactivation of TRPA1 might simply reflect the stochastic and obligatory entry of the channel into the inactivated state, following Ca2+-dependent activation, similar to inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels (32Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1983; 306: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). By studying mutant TRPA1 channels in which Ca2+ permeability is reduced, we show that both the potentiating and inactivating effects of extracellular Ca2+ can be attributed to entry of Ca2+ through TRPA1 and the subsequent elevation of intracellular Ca2+. We also provide evidence that potentiation and inactivation are mediated by independent mechanisms, each with a distinct sensitivity and specificity for divalent cations. cDNAs and Expression in HEK-293 Cells—For most experiments, we used an N-terminal YFP fusion of rat TRPA1 generated by inserting a PCR fragment of YFP into an AgeI site at the 5′-end of a rat TRPA cDNA. To confirm that the YFP fusion did not alter function, in some experiments we used an unaltered clone of rTRPA1, which was co-transfected with green fluorescent protein (20:1). To assess whether some of our results could be attributed to species differences between rat and human variants of TRPA1, in some experiments, we used hTRPA1, co-expressed at a ratio of 20:1 with green fluorescent protein. Point mutations were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were verified by sequencing (Retrogen (San Diego, CA) or Macrogen (Rockville, MD)). All constructs were transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells using TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI), as suggested by the manufacturer, and cells were cultured at 37 °C. Prior to recording, cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin and 4 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 37 °C and replated in the recording chamber with Tyrode's solution. Transfected cells were identified under epifluorescence. Recordings were performed ∼24–48 h after transfection at room temperature. Patch Clamp Recording—Patch clamp electrophysiology was performed as previously described (27Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Zhao Z. Margolskee R. Liman E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5777-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In brief, recordings were made with an Axopatch 200B amplifier, sampled at 5 kHz, and filtered at 1 kHz. Data were digitized with a Digidata 1322a digitizer, acquired with pClamp 8.2, and analyzed with Clamp-fit 8.2 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Representative data shown in figures were exported into Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA) and CorelDRAW (Corel Corp., Eden Prairie, MN). Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass, fire-polished to a resistance of 2–3 megaohms. For whole-cell recordings, the membrane potential was ramped from −80 mV to +80 mV (1 V/s). Excised patch recording was performed as previously described (27Liu D. Liman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15160-15165Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Briefly, following formation of a gigaohm seal, the patch was excised into Ca2+-free solution and rapidly moved in front of a linear array of microperfusion pipes (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Solutions—Tyrode's solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm dextrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Ca2+-free bath solution was as follows: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm HEDTA. Ca2+-, Mg2+-, or Ba2+-containing bath solutions contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 200 μm, 2 mm, or 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Mg2+, or 2 mm Ba2+. For lower Ca2+ concentrations, 1.5 mm Ca2+ or 1.9 mm Ca2+ was added to Ca2+-free solution buffered by 2 mm HEDTA, to produce 12 or 50 μm free Ca2+, respectively. Low buffer internal Cs+-based solution (LB-Cs+) contained 0.02 mm EGTA, 145 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES, and high buffer internal Cs+-based solution (HB-Cs+) contained 5 mm EGTA, 3 mm CaCl2 (100 nm free Ca2+), 145 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with CsOH). For excised inside-out patch experiments, the pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES with either 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm HEDTA (pH 7.4). Ca2+-free solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, with either 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm HEDTA. Cytosolic solutions with nanomolar or micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+ were obtained by adding Ca2+ (1.22, 1.65, 1.77, 1.88, or 1.98 mm) to Ca2+-free solution buffered by 2 mm EGTA to obtain free Ca2+ concentrations of 100 nm, 300 nm, 500 nm, 1 μm, and 5.2 μm, respectively. 1 mm pentasodium tripolyphosphate hexahydrate (polyP3) was added to the cytoplasmic solution for excised patch experiments. All Ca2+ concentrations are reported as calculated with MaxChelator (available on the World Wide Web). For cell-attached recordings, bath KCl was substituted for NaCl to zero the membrane potential. For flash photolysis experiments, caged Ca2+ solution contained 120 mm cesium aspartate, 20 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm 2,6-dimethyl-4-nitropyridine-EDTA (DMNP-EDTA; Invitrogen), 0.75 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The bath solution in ion permeability experiments contained NaCl, KCl, CsCl, or N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (150 mm), 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm HEDTA, or CaCl2 (128 mm) with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For recordings during which intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured, the pipette solution contained 20 μm Fura-4F, 145 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgATP, 10 mm HEPES, with or without 5 mm EGTA, or 10 μm Fluo-5F in caged Ca2+ solution (with 2 mm MgATP and 3 mm Na2ATP). Flash Photolysis of Caged Compound—All experiments were performed on an Olympus IX71 microscope. To allow uniform dialysis of the cell with the caged compounds, we waited at least 100 s after breaking into whole cell recording mode before uncaging. UV light from a mercury arc lamp that was then passed through a ×350/50 band pass filter (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) was controlled by a Uniblitz shutter (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). The shutter was opened for 100 ms to uncage Ca2+. For experiments in which Ca2+ levels were measured, UV light from a xenon arc lamp was passed through a band pass filter (380xv1; Chroma Technology) that was part of a Ludl Electronic Products (Hawthorne, NY) filter wheel/shutter operated under computer control (Simple PCI; Compix Corp., Sewickley, PA). The shutter was opened for 1 s to uncage Ca2+. Ca2+ Imaging—Ca2+ imaging was performed as previously described (33Zhang Z. Zhao Z. Margolskee R. Liman E. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5777-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Images were acquired on an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a Ludl Electronic Products filter wheel and ORCA ER camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and were analyzed with simple PCI (Compix Corp.). The low affinity Ca2+ indicator Fluo-5F (10 μm) or Fura-4F (20 μm) was loaded through the patch pipette. The fluorescence emission from Fluo-5F was detected using a YFP filter set (Chroma Technology). The fluorescence emission from Fura-4F was detected with a Fura 2 filter set (Chroma Technology) using excitation alternately at 340 and 380 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence emission (r = F340/F380) was used to calculate the intracellular Ca2+ concentration as follows, [Ca2+] i=Kd×Q×(R−Rmin)(Rmax−R) (Eq. 1) where Kd is the Ca2+ dissociation constant of the indicator Fura-4F (770 nm), Q is emission ratio at 380 nm recorded at 0 Ca2+ and at a saturated Ca2+ concentration, and Rmax and Rmin are the ratios under saturating Ca2+ or 0 Ca2+ conditions, respectively. Rmin was measured from a separate set of cells in which intracellular solution was heavily buffered by 5 mm EGTA, and the extracellular solution was Ca2+-free (buffered with 2 mm HEDTA). To obtain Rmax and Q, at the end of each experiment, ionomycin was added to the bath, and the emission with 2 mm Ca2+ and 0 Ca2+ in the bath was measured. Ion Selectivity Measurements—TRPA1 currents were activated by brief exposure to Cin, and the current in the presence of different external cations was measured by rapidly exchanging the extracellular solution using a linear array of microperfusion pipes. The internal solution contained Cs+ (HB-Cs+), and the ion permeability relative to Cs+ was calculated from the reversal potential under bi-ionic conditions according to Equations 2 and 3, PCaPCs=[Cs+] i4[Ca2+] o×exp(Erev×FRT)×(exp(Erev×FRT)+1) (Eq. 2) PXPCs=exp(Erev×FRT) (Eq. 3) where PCa/PCs and PX/PCs are the Ca2+ and monovalent cation permeability relative to Cs+, respectively, Erev is the reversal potential, F is Faraday's constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature (34Owsianik G. Talavera K. Voets T. Nilius B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 685-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Erev was corrected for the liquid junction potentials measured under the conditions of our experiments. Chemicals—Cinnamaldehyde, menthol, mustard oil, and polyP3 were purchased from Sigma. Fluo-5F, Fura-4F, and ionomycin were from Invitrogen Molecular probes (Eugene, OR). HC-030031 was from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA). For stock solutions, Cin, HC-030031, mustard oil, and ionomycin were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, menthol was in ethanol, and other chemicals were in water. Prior to use, the stock solution was diluted in the appropriate bath solution. The final dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol concentration was <0.2%. A Dual Effect of Extracellular Ca2+; Potentiation and Inactivation of TRPA1—To study Ca2+ regulation of TRPA1 channels, we expressed rTRPA1 fused to YFP in HEK 293 cells and recorded responses to TRPA1 agonists with patch clamp electrophysiology. Bath perfusion of Cin (100 μm) for ∼40 s in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ strongly activated a nonselective cation current of 3.9 ± 0.4 nA at +80 mV (n = 10) in TRPA1-expressing cells (Fig. 1A) but not in untransfected cells. The TRPA1 current persisted following washout of the agonist (Fig. 1A), consistent with the observation that Cin binds covalently to cysteine residues in the N terminus of the channel, and therefore its binding is not readily reversible (17Hinman A. Chuang H.H. Bautista D.M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19564-19568Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 18Macpherson L.J. Dubin A.E. Evans M.J. Marr F. Schultz P.G. Cravatt B.F. Patapoutian A. Nature. 2007; 445: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The addition of 2 mm Ca2+ to the bath caused a strong potentiation, which was followed by a rapid decay of the current, as previously noted (4Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D. Nature. 2004; 427: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 24Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We quantitated the degree of potentiation by the -fold increase in the current after introduction of Ca2+, where 1 indicates no increase and 2 indicates a doubling of the current. Note that this analysis underestimates the full degree of potentiation, which is partly masked by the concomitant process of inactivation. In these experiments, the addition of 2 mm Ca2+ potentiated the currents by 1.85 ± 0.06-fold at +80 mV and 3.98 ± 0.50-fold at −80 mV (n = 10). The greater potentiation of the currents at negative voltages reflects a decrease in the outward rectification of the currents (from 6.56 ± 0.79 to 3.58 ± 0.76, measured as the current at +80 mV divided by the current at −80 mV), as is commonly observed during strong activation of many TRP channels (35Nilius B. Talavera K. Owsianik G. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. J. Physiol. 2005; 567: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The currents subsequently decayed to 50% of their peak value (T50) in 4.8 ± 0.5 s (measured at +80 mV; n = 10). Similar results were obtained with MO as the agonist, indicating that as previously noted, Ca2+ potentiation and inactivation are independent of the specific agonist used to activate TRPA1 (21Doerner J.F. Gisselmann G. Hatt H. Wetzel C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13180-13189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Ca2+ potentiation and inactivation appeared to be unaffected by fusion of YFP to the N terminus of TRPA1, since there was no difference in the degree of potentiation or rate of inactivation when an unfused rTRPA1 cDNA was used (2.52 ± 0.45-fold and 4.85 ± 1.29-fold potentiation at +80 and −80 mV, respectively; T50 = 4.7 ± 0.9 s, n = 3; see supplemental Fig. 1). To confirm that the decay of TRPA1 currents upon the addition of external Ca2+ represents inactivation rather than a return to the resting state, we determined whether TRPA1 currents could be reactivated following exposure to external Ca2+. For these experiments, we used a low concentration of menthol, which does not bind covalently to TRPA1 and can be used to repeatedly activate TRPA1 currents in the absence of external Ca2+ (36Karashima Y. Damann N. Prenen J. Talavera K. Segal A. Voets T. Nilius B. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 9874-9884Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Following activation of TRPA1 by menthol, the addition of external Ca2+ caused a rapid potentiation and subsequent decay of the current similar to that observed when the channels had been activated by Cin (Fig. 1B). Following decay of the current, no additional responses to menthol could be evoked for a period up to 20 min (Fig. 1B; n = 5). Thus, external Ca2+ promotes the entry of TRPA1 channels into a long lasting inactivated state. Complete Activation of TRPA1 by Cin Occludes Ca2+ Potentiation—For both practical and theoretical reasons, it was important to understand whether extracellular Ca2+ and Cin act independently or in concert to regulate gating of TRPA1. Toward this end, we determined whether TRPA1 currents could be potentiated by Ca2+ when the currents had been maximally activated by Cin. Because Cin binds covalently to TRPA1, the fraction of channels activated by a fixed concentration of the agonist is expected to be sensitive to the duration of the exposure. Consistent with this prediction, we found that a prolonged exposure (156 ± 17 s) to 100 μm Cin in the absence of external Ca2+ activated an average current of 7.7 ± 1.1 nA (at +80 mV, n = 4), which was twice as large as the average current measured in response to an exposure of ∼40 s (Fig. 1, C and D; see above). After exposure to Cin for ∼120 s, the currents reached a plateau, presumably reflecting the full activation of TRPA1 channels (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, when fully activated, the currents were significantly less rectifying than when they were partially activated (Fig. 1C; rectification ratio was 1.32 ± 0.20; n = 4). At this point, the addition of extracellular Ca2+ only slightly potentiated the currents (Fig. 1, C and D; -fold increase in current was 1.07 ± 0.04 and 1.12 ± 0.05 at +80 and −80 mV, respectively, n = 4), whereas inactivation was slightly slowed (T50 = 10.5 ± 3.0 s; p < 0.05 compared with brief exposure). Therefore, Ca2+ potentiation and Cin activation are not independent and may share a final common mechanism (23Cavanaugh E.J. Simkin D. Kim D. Neuroscience. 2008; 154: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for MO activation of hTRPA1 (supp"
https://openalex.org/W2079243247,"Malate is involved in mediating plant stomatal responses to high CO2. By acting as a malate importer, the ABC transporter AtABCB14 controls stomatal movements by increasing their osmotic pressure. Carbon dioxide uptake and water vapour release in plants occur through stomata, which are formed by guard cells. These cells respond to light intensity, CO2 and water availability, and plant hormones1,2. The predicted increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is expected to have a profound effect on our ecosystem. However, many aspects of CO2-dependent stomatal movements are still not understood3. Here we show that the ABC transporter AtABCB14 modulates stomatal closure on transition to elevated CO2. Stomatal closure induced by high CO2 levels was accelerated in plants lacking AtABCB14. Apoplastic malate has been suggested to be one of the factors mediating the stomatal response to CO2 (Refs 4,5) and indeed, exogenously applied malate induced a similar AtABCB14-dependent response as high CO2 levels. In isolated epidermal strips that contained only guard cells, malate-dependent stomatal closure was faster in plants lacking the AtABCB14 and slower in AtABCB14-overexpressing plants, than in wild-type plants, indicating that AtABCB14 catalyses the transport of malate from the apoplast into guard cells. Indeed, when AtABCB14 was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and HeLa cells, increases in malate transport activity were observed. We therefore suggest that AtABCB14 modulates stomatal movement by transporting malate from the apoplast into guard cells, thereby increasing their osmotic pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2087261765,"SNP genotyping has emerged as a technology to incorporate copy number variants (CNVs) into genetic analyses of human traits. However, the extent to which SNP platforms accurately capture CNVs remains unclear. Using independent, sequence-based CNV maps, we find that commonly used SNP platforms have limited or no probe coverage for a large fraction of CNVs. Despite this, in 9 samples we inferred 368 CNVs using Illumina SNP genotyping data and experimentally validated over two-thirds of these. We also developed a method (SNP-Conditional Mixture Modeling, SCIMM) to robustly genotype deletions using as few as two SNP probes. We find that HapMap SNPs are strongly correlated with 82% of common deletions, but the newest SNP platforms effectively tag about 50%. We conclude that currently available genome-wide SNP assays can capture CNVs accurately, but improvements in array designs, particularly in duplicated sequences, are necessary to facilitate more comprehensive analyses of genomic variation."

https://openalex.org/W2153650805,"Throughout molecular evolution, organisms create assorted chemicals in response to varying ecological niches. Catalytic landscapes underlie metabolic evolution, wherein mutational steps alter the biosynthetic properties of enzymes. Here we report the first systematic quantitative characterization of the catalytic landscape underlying the evolution of sesquiterpene chemical diversity. On the basis of our previous discovery of a set of nine naturally occurring amino acid substitutions that functionally interconverted orthologous sesquiterpene synthases from Nicotiana tabacum and Hyoscyamus muticus, we created a library of all possible residue combinations (2(9) = 512) in the N. tabacum enzyme. The product spectra of 418 active enzymes revealed a rugged landscape where several minimal combinations of the nine mutations encode convergent solutions to the interconversions of parental activities. Quantitative comparisons indicated context dependence for mutational effects--epistasis--in product specificity and promiscuity. These results provide a measure of the mutational accessibility of phenotypic variability in a diverging lineage of terpene synthases."

FUT2 encodes α,1,2-fucosyltransferase and is the classic human secretor locus that determines the secretion status of ABO blood group antigens. We identified a strong association (P = 5.36 × 10−17) between rs492602 in FUT2 and plasma vitamin B12 levels in a genome-wide scan (n = 1,658) and an independent replication sample (n = 1,059) from the Nurses' Health Study. Women homozygous for the rs492602[G] allele had higher B12 levels. This allele is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the FUT2 nonsecretor variant encoding W143X, suggesting a plausible mechanism for altered B12 absorption and plasma levels."
https://openalex.org/W2030257970,"Proteins essential for vesicle formation by the Coat Protein I (COPI) complex are being identified, but less is known about the role of specific lipids. Brefeldin-A ADP-ribosylated substrate (BARS) functions in the fission step of COPI vesicle formation. Here, we show that BARS induces membrane curvature in cooperation with phosphatidic acid. This finding has allowed us to further delineate COPI vesicle fission into two sub-stages: 1) an earlier stage of bud-neck constriction, in which BARS and other COPI components are required, and 2) a later stage of bud-neck scission, in which phosphatidic acid generated by phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is also required. Moreover, in contrast to the disruption of the Golgi seen on perturbing the core COPI components (such as coatomer), inhibition of PLD2 causes milder disruptions, suggesting that such COPI components have additional roles in maintaining Golgi structure other than through COPI vesicle formation."

We show that GAPDH physically associates with APE1, an essential enzyme involved in the repair of abasic sites in damaged DNA, as well as in the redox regulation of several transcription factors. This interaction allows GAPDH to convert the oxidized species of APE1 to the reduced form, thereby reactivating its endonuclease activity to cleave abasic sites. The GAPDH variants C152G and C156G retain the ability to interact with but are unable to reactivate APE1, implicating these cysteines in catalyzing the reduction of APE1.

It uses the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and converts glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate with the concomitant release of NADH in an oxido-reduction reaction (1Tatton, W.

GAPDH is also a key redox-sensitive protein that possesses an active site cysteine sulfhydryl that is susceptible to oxidation (2Brodie A.E. Reed D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Under oxidative stress, GAPDH rapidly undergoes disulfide bond formation leading to reduction in its enzymatic activity (2Brodie A.E. Reed D.J. Arch. Biochem.

GAPDH has the propensity to interact with several proteins that are vulnerable to aggregation and are associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as in the case of the pro-oxidant amyloid β peptide involved in Alzheimer disease (4Schulze H. Schuler A. Stuber D. Dobeli H. Langen H. Huber G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1915-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recent studies have documented that GAPDH is also involved in several other nuclear processes that include histone H2B gene expression, nuclear RNA export, apoptosis, and cellular response to DNA damage (5Sirover M.A. Biochim.

For example, GAPDH can translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus when cells are challenged with the potent chemical oxidant and DNA-damaging agent H2O2, although it is not clear what is the function executed by GAPDH under this stress condition (10Dastoor Z. Dreyer J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a more recent study documented that nitric oxide can also induce nuclear localization of GAPDH where it is acetylated by the acetyltransferase p300/CBP via direct protein interaction, which in turn causes stimulation of the catalytic activity of p300/CBP, resulting in the activation of downstream targets such as p53 (11Sen N.

Other studies have shown that GAPDH is associated with DNA-containing genotoxic lesions such as thioguanylated DNA generated by the chemotherapeutic agent mercaptopurine used for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (12Krynetski E.Y.

In this study, we report that human GAPDH directly interacts with APE1, an essential enzyme that functions in the base excision DNA repair pathway to process spontaneous and drug-induced abasic or apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, as well as to regulate the redox state of a number of transcriptional factors such as p53, AP-1, c-Jun, c-Fos, and NF-κB (14Fung H.

Using recombinant proteins, we show that the active site cysteine 152 of GAPDH is not required for the interaction with APE1 but indispensable for converting the oxidized forms of APE1 to its reduced form. The catalytic action of GAPDH on oxidized APE1 re-establishes a key biological function of the protein, that is, the ability to cleave AP sites, indicating that the redox-sensitive cysteine of GAPDH can function to reduce APE1. Concomitantly, this reduction process greatly enhanced the detection of APE1 by anti-APE1 antibodies consistent with the oxidized form of the protein undergoing a structural change. We further demonstrate that siRNA knockdown of GAPDH in HCT116 cells caused sensitivity to agents known to create DNA lesions that are processed by APE1, including the alkylating DNA-damaging agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), which produces AP sites, but not to 254 nm of UVC (19Demple B.

The unbound proteins were then loaded onto a 500-μl single-stranded DNA agarose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The proteins were eluted by a step gradient of 100, 200, 300, and 500 mm NaCl in buffer A in fraction sizes of 250 μl.

The concentrated fraction was diluted 10-fold in buffer B and loaded onto a 200 μl of MonoQ column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in buffer B. The flow-through fraction was concentrated and exchanged with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm EDTA), as above.

Protein Sequencing—The enriched polypeptide band (37-kDa) from the 400 mm NaCl MonoS fraction was excised from preparative 12% SDS-PAGE, washed with 50% acetonitrile in water, and sequenced by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (Harvard Microchemistry). Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—PCR was used to amplify the entire GAPDH cDNA from the plasmid template (ATCC no. 817954R, accession number M33197, NCBI), digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the E. coli expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to produce the plasmid pGST-GAPDH. Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to mutate the three cysteines to glycine in GAPDH using pGST-GAPDH as the template and the following primers C152G-F1 (5′-CATCAGCAATGCCTCCGGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC-3′), GAPDH C156G-F2 (5′-GCCTCCTGCACCACCAACGGCTTAGCACCCCTGGC-3′), and GAPDH C247G-F3 (5′-GTGGTGGACCTGACCGGCCGTCTAGAAAAACCTGCC-3′). The resulting plasmids were pGST-GAPDH C152G, pGST-GAPDH C156G, and pGST-GAPDH C247G, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Purification of GST and His-tagged Proteins—GST-GAPDH fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BW528 strain and purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B mini columns as previously described (23Jilani A. Vongsamphanh R. Leduc A. Gros L. Saparbaev M. Ramotar D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6436-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the His6-APE1 was purified using Talon affinity beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). APE1 Pulldown Assay—One ml of matrix slurry (Talon beads) was placed in a plastic disposable 10-ml gravity-flow column (Bio-Rad). The beads were equilibrated with 10 ml of buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 300 mm NaCl). At least 10 μg of purified His-APE1 protein was then incubated with the beads for 30 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. The beads were washed with 30 ml of buffer B, and 100-μl aliquots with the equivalent of ∼400 ng of bound His-APE1 were mixed with either 2 μg of purified GST-PNKP, GST-GAPDH, GST-GAPDH C152G, GST-GAPDH C156G, or GST-GAPDH C247G and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with 3 ml of buffer B, and the aliquots were analyzed directly for bound proteins by Western blot. GST Pulldown Assays—Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (100 μl) alone or bound to 10 μg of the indicated GST-tagged proteins were mixed with purified N-terminal His-tagged APE1 (1 μg) in 0.5 ml of buffer A and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rotation. The beads were washed three times with buffer A, and aliquots were analyzed for bound proteins by Western blots probed with either anti-His or anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed on whole cell lysates prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (24Azam S. Drobetsky E. Ramotar D. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Following preclearing with 30 μl of Aminolink beads plus coupling gel (Pierce), 1.5 mg of total protein was incubated with anti-APE1 antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with 50 μl of Aminolink beads for another 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Extract Preparation and Immunodetection—Total cells extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blots as previously described (24Azam S. Drobetsky E. Ramotar D. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in this study were monoclonal anti-His (Santa Cruz), anti-GAPDH (Chemicon), anti-APE1 (R & D Systems), polyclonal anti-GST (Sigma), and anti-APE1 (kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Demple, Harvard University and subsequently purchased from Santa Cruz). Oxidation of APE1 Protein with H2O2—The His-APE1 protein bound to the TALON metal affinity column (1 ml; BD Biosciences) was treated with H2O2 (5 μm for 5 min), washed three times with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 300 mm NaCl), and then eluted using buffer B containing 150 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed in a Spectra/Por 1 dialysis tube (molecular weight cut-off of 6,000–8,000; Spectrum) by repeated concentration and dilution with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl for five times. The concentrations of the proteins were estimated on a Coomassie Blue-stained 12% SDS-PAGE gel. siRNA-mediated GAPDH Silencing—siRNA (Ambion) was used to knock down the expression of GAPDH in DLD1 and HCT116 cells. The cells were seeded on Petri plates and transfected with 75 nm of GAPDH siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Negative control (75 nm) that has no significant homology to any known gene sequences from mouse or human was also included. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, after which the complete growth medium was added, and the cells were processed as indicated. Drug Exposure and Clonogenic Assay—The siRNA transfected cells (1 × 106) were plated in 60-mm × 15-mm Petri plates and incubated for 24 h before exposure to different drugs. The adherent cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of either bleomycin for 1 h or methyl methane sulfonate for 30 min in fetal bovine serum-free incomplete medium. The colony-forming unit assay was performed as described previously (24Azam S. Drobetsky E. Ramotar D. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). UV Irradiation—The cells were irradiated with monochromatic 254-nm UV (UVC from G25T8 germicidal lamp (Sankyo Denki) at a dose ranging from 0–20 J/m2 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. UVC 254-nm UV fluorescence was measured with a Spectroline DRC 100× digital radiometer (Spectronics, Westbury, NY) equipped with 254 sensors (25Mathonnet G. Leger C. Desnoyers J. Drouin R. Therrien J.P. Drobetsky E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7219-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DNA Extraction and DNA Damage Quantification—Briefly, ∼5.0 × 106 of the indicated cells transfected with either the control or GAPDH-siRNA were subjected to genomic DNA extraction as previously described (25Mathonnet G. Leger C. Desnoyers J. Drouin R. Therrien J.P. Drobetsky E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7219-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Formation of AP sites was measured by using the DNA damage quantification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biovison Inc.). A Minor AP Endonuclease Activity Is Associated with the Glycolytic Enzyme GAPDH—We initially set out to examine whether mammalian cells contained a Mg2+-independent AP endonuclease(s) belonging to the E. coli endonuclease IV family, because such an activity has not been previously identified. Using total cell extracts derived from cultured human lung fibroblast, we detected a weak Mg2+-independent AP endonuclease activity that cleaved a 42-mer double stranded γ-32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide substrate containing a single AP site at position 21 to produce a 20-mer product (22Shatilla A. Ramotar D. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 547-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity was enriched by subjecting the total extract to a 6-step column chromatography purification scheme, followed by a NaCl discontinuous gradient on a MonoS column (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fractions from the MonoS column yielded a single major polypeptide of ∼37 kDa as visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue dye (Fig. 1A). The fraction (0.4 m NaCl) with the most protein exhibited the highest level of Mg2+-independent AP endonuclease activity (data not shown). Moreover, increasing the amount of this fraction resulted in an increase production of the 20-mer product that was identical to that generated by Endo IV (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–7 versus lane 2) but not the more slowly migrating 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde 20-mer product created by endonuclease III (data not shown), suggesting that the purified protein may contain AP endonuclease activity. The protein cannot cleave the 42-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the U·G mismatch, unless the uracil is removed, consistent with the notion that the purified protein fraction has associated AP endonuclease and no hint of uracil-DNA glycosylase activity nor trace amounts of other enzymes that belong to the base-excision DNA repair pathway such as AP lyases, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase (data not shown). We next determined the identity of the 37-kDa purified protein by excising the Coomassie-stained polypeptide from the SDS-PAGE and subjecting it to sequencing using microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to a nano-electrospray ionization source of an ion trap mass spectrometer. Unexpectedly, of 59 individual sequences analyzed, all showed 95–100% identity to the human GAPDH enzyme. This finding suggests that the Mg2+-independent AP endonuclease activity is likely the result of a minor protein that copurified with GAPDH. To ascertain that the purified protein preparation indeed contained GAPDH, we tested for the enzyme activity by monitoring the reduction of NAD+. As anticipated, the purified protein displayed a significant level of GAPDH activity when compared with a commercial preparation or a recombinant form (GST-GAPDH) of the human GAPDH expressed and purified from E. coli (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Because APE1 is the major AP endonuclease present in mammalian cells and the recombinant source of human GAPDH (GST-GAPDH) lacked AP endonuclease activity (see Fig. 5), we considered that a minor fraction of APE1 with a different mobility might be copurifying with GAPDH. This copurification might indicate a link between the two proteins. GAPDH and Its Variants Interact with APE1—To directly test whether GAPDH is associated with APE1, we used Talon affinity beads consisting of functionally active APE1 tagged at the N-terminal end with the His tag and examined for retention of the purified GST-GAPDH (see “Experimental Procedures”). When purified GST-GAPDH (Fig. 2A, lane 4) was mixed with the His-APE1 affinity beads (Fig. 2B, lane 4), followed by extensive washing, a significant amount of the protein was pulled down by the beads as detected by Western blot probed with anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2C, lane 4). Likewise, three cysteine variants of GST-GAPDH: the presumed active site cysteine 152 (C152G), the adjacent cysteine 156 (C156G), and cysteine 247 (C247G) with no documented role in the redox function of GAPDH (Fig. 2A), were also retained by the His-APE1 affinity beads (Fig. 2C). In controls, the purified DNA repair protein GST-PNKP (Fig. 2A, lane 2) was not retained by the His-APE1 affinity beads (Fig. 2C, lane 2). In these experiments, a very minute amount of either GST-GAPDH or the variants (Fig. 2A) was pulled down by the empty beads (Fig. 2B), suggesting a possible weak and nonspecific interaction of the fusion proteins with the beads. Of note, the fragmented forms of GST-GAPDH (∼35–40 kDa), and not those of GST-PNKP, were enriched by the His-APE1 affinity beads, suggesting that the lower molecular mass forms of GST-GAPDH may contain a possible interacting region with His-APE1. Several additional control experiments revealed that GST-GAPDH was not pulled down by beads carrying a different protein His-protein phosphatase 2A activator, a peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase (data not shown). Moreover, the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate dehydro-genase and 6-phosphofructokinase obtained from a commercial source were not retained by the His-APE1 affinity beads (data not shown). Thus, these combined data support the notion that GAPDH may interact with APE1 and that none of the three cysteine residues of GAPDH is essential for the association, contrasting the interaction of GAPDH with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors requiring the cysteine residues of both proteins (26Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Kaplin A.I. Barrow R.K. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1357-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To further confirm the GAPDH-APE1 interaction, we conducted the reciprocal experiment by preparing GST-GAPDH affinity beads (Fig. 2D, lane 3) and examined for the retention of His-APE1. As shown in Fig. 2D, purified His-APE1 was pulled down by the GST-GAPDH affinity beads as detected by Western blot probed with anti-His monoclonal antibodies (lane 6). In contrast, neither GST-PNKP nor GST beads (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2) pulled down the His-APE1 protein (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the serendipitous isolation of GAPDH with AP endonuclease activity is due to the interaction of GAPDH with APE1. It is therefore not surprising that commercial preparations of GAPDH, but not pyruvate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphofructokinase obtained from mammalian sources, contained AP endonuclease activity (data not shown). To assess whether GAPDH is associated with APE1 in vivo, an immunoprecipitation reaction was performed with total cell extracts derived from HCT116 cells using anti-APE1 polyclonal antibodies. After eliminating the nonspecific interaction by washing, the immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blot using anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2E, the endogenous GAPDH was coimmunoprecipitated with anti-APE1 antibodies (lane 4), but not by the mock reaction lacking anti-APE1 antibodies (lane 3). We note that anti-GAPDH antibody did not cross-react with APE1, nor did anti-APE1 antibody cross-reacted with GAPDH (supplemental Fig. S3). Because GAPDH is also localized to the mitochondria and can interact with many proteins, for example, the voltage-dependent anion channel of the mitochondrial membrane and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor involved in the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (26Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Kaplin A.I. Barrow R.K. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1357-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Tarze A. Deniaud A. Le Bras M. Maillier E. Molle D. Larochette N. Zamzami N. Jan G. Kroemer G. Brenner C. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2606-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), it raises the possibility that GAPDH interaction with APE1 could be the result of a “sticky” nature. As such, we checked whether GAPDH could be coimmunoprecipitated with a subunit COX IV of the membrane-associated cytochrome c oxidase complex of the mitochondria. Anti-COX IV antibodies did not coimmunoprecipitate GAPDH (Fig. 2E, lane 4), dismissing the possibility of a generalized sticky feature of this protein and underscoring a relevant physiological interaction with APE1, as reported recently for the GAPDH-p300/CBP interaction (11Sen N. Hara M.R. Kornberg M.D. Cascio M.B. Bae B.I. Shahani N. Thomas B. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Snyder S.H. Sawa A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In other controls, neither PNKP nor protein phosphatase 2A activator (with cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution) (24Azam S. Drobetsky E. Ramotar D. Apoptosis. 2007; 12: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was coimmunoprecipitated with GAPDH (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the data from whole cell extracts is consistent with the in vitro observation with purified proteins that GAPDH interacts with APE1. Native GAPDH, and Not the Variant C152G or C156G, Activates the AP Endonuclease Activity of APE1—It has been shown that APE1 can exist in the oxidized and reduced forms and that the reduced form is necessary to activate transcription factors including p53, NF-κB, and c-Jun and c-Fos, subunits of AP-1 (16Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T.

Moreover, thioredoxin is required to physically interact with APE1, and this association potentiates AP-1 transcriptional activity (29Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). We therefore explored whether GAPDH could function to activate the AP endonuclease activity of APE1. In this experiment, we first determined the minimal amount of purified His-APE1 that showed no detectable AP endonuclease activity. Purified His-APE1 in the range of 0–0.4 pmol showed no measu"
https://openalex.org/W2050011974,"Polarity is an essential feature of many cell types, including neurons that receive information from local inputs within their dendrites and propagate nerve impulses to distant targets through a single axon. It is generally believed that intrinsic structural differences between axons and dendrites dictate the polarized localization of axonal and dendritic proteins. However, whether extracellular cues also instruct this process in vivo has not been explored. Here we show that the axon guidance cue UNC-6/netrin and its receptor UNC-5 act throughout development to exclude synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins from the dendrite of the Caenorhabditis elegans motor neuron DA9, which is proximal to a source of UNC-6/netrin. In unc-6/netrin and unc-5 loss-of-function mutants, presynaptic components mislocalize to the DA9 dendrite. In addition, ectopically expressed UNC-6/netrin, acting through UNC-5, is sufficient to exclude endogenous synapses from adjacent subcellular domains within the DA9 axon. Furthermore, this anti-synaptogenic activity is interchangeable with that of LIN-44/Wnt despite being transduced through different receptors, suggesting that extracellular cues such as netrin and Wnts not only guide axon navigation but also regulate the polarized accumulation of presynaptic components through local exclusion."
https://openalex.org/W2039958325,"Treg based immunotherapy is of great interest to facilitate tolerance in autoimmunity and transplantation. For clinical trials, it is essential to have a clinical grade Treg isolation protocol in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. To obtain sufficient Treg for immunotherapy, subsequent ex vivo expansion might be needed.Treg were isolated from leukapheresis products by CliniMACS based GMP isolation strategies, using anti-CD25, anti-CD8 and anti-CD19 coated microbeads. CliniMACS isolation procedures led to 40-60% pure CD4(pos)CD25(high)FoxP3(pos) Treg populations that were anergic and had moderate suppressive activity. Such CliniMACS isolated Treg populations could be expanded with maintenance of suppressive function. Alloantigen stimulated expansion caused an enrichment of alloantigen-specific Treg. Depletion of unwanted CD19(pos) cells during CliniMACS Treg isolation proved necessary to prevent B-cell outgrowth during expansion. CD4(pos)CD127(pos) conventional T cells were the major contaminating cell type in CliniMACS isolated Treg populations. Depletion of CD127(pos) cells improved the purity of CD4(pos)CD25(high)FoxP3(pos) Treg in CliniMACS isolated cell populations to approximately 90%. Expanded CD127(neg) CliniMACS isolated Treg populations showed very potent suppressive capacity and high FoxP3 expression. Furthermore, our data show that cryopreservation of CliniMACS isolated Treg is feasible, but that activation after thawing is necessary to restore suppressive potential.The feasibility of Treg based therapy is widely accepted, provided that tailor-made clinical grade procedures for isolation and ex vivo cell handling are available. We here provide further support for this approach by showing that a high Treg purity can be reached, and that isolated cells can be cryopreserved and expanded successfully."

Endoglin is a co-receptor predominantly expressed in endothelial cells that participates in TGFβ-mediated signaling with ALK-1 and ALK-5 and regulates critical aspects of cellular and biological responses. The embryonic lethal phenotype of knock-out mice because of defects in angiogenesis and disease-causing mutations resulting in human vascular diseases both support essential roles for endoglin, ALK-1, and ALK-5 in the vasculature. However, the mechanism by which endoglin mediates TGF-β signaling through ALK-1 and ALK-5 has remained elusive. Here we describe a novel interaction between endoglin and GIPC, a scaffolding protein known to regulate cell surface receptor expression and trafficking. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confocal studies both demonstrate a specific interaction between endoglin and GIPC in endothelial cells, mediated by a class I PDZ binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin. Subcellular distribution studies demonstrate that endoglin recruits GIPC to the plasma membrane and co-localizes with GIPC in a TGFβ-independent manner, with GIPC-promoting cell surface retention of endoglin. Endoglin specifically enhanced TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of Smad 1/5/8, increased a Smad 1/5/8 responsive promoter, and inhibited endothelial cell migration in a manner dependent on the ability of endoglin to interact with GIPC.

However, a recent report in murine and zebrafish models suggests that ALK-1 has a ALK-5/TβRII-independent role in HHT1, lending further support for a role of BMP-9/10 as physiological ALK-1 ligands (22Park S.O.

Endoglin, while unable to bind TGF-β superfamily ligands besides BMP-9 directly, associates with a number of TGF-β superfamily receptors, including TβRII, ALK1, and ALK5, and binds TGF-β1 and -β3, Activin A, BMP-2, and BMP-7 in the context of their respective ligand-binding receptors (4Barbara N.P.

Although the mutation of endoglin in HHT1 and the embryonic lethal phenotype of endoglin-null mice both support an essential role for endoglin in the vasculature, the mechanisms by which endoglin exert its influence on TGF-β superfamily signaling, or its role in cardiovascular development is poorly understood. In particular, the capacity for TGF-β to propagate two distinct signaling pathways in endothelial cells has been the subject of intense investigation. While endoglin has been characterized as a mediator of TGF-β-dependent activation of two opposing pathways in endothelial cells, there have been conflicting views on the nature of its actions. For instance, Lebrin et al. demonstrated that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of endoglin resulted in the reduction of TGF-β-induced Smad1 activation, suggesting a role of endoglin in enhancing ALK-1/Smad1 signaling, whereas Pece-Barbara et al. demonstrated an enhancement of ALK-1/Smad1 signaling in endoglin-null cell lines, suggesting a role of endoglin in inhibiting ALK-1/Smad1 signaling (24Pece-Barbara N.

Determining how endoglin participates in TGF-β superfamily signaling at the molecular level may help reconcile these disparate reports. In our effort to characterize endoglin function we have investigated how the association between endoglin and specific intracellular scaffolding proteins influence TGF-β superfamily signaling in endothelial cells. Recently, we reported a novel interaction between endoglin and β-arrestin2, an association that resulted in their internalization in endocytic vesicles (27Lee N.Y. Blobe G.C. J. Biol.

While the endoglin-β-arrestin2 complex had little impact on either Smad1/5/8 or Smad 2/3 activation, the endoglin-β-arrestin2 complex regulated ERK activation, localization, and endothelial cell migration in a TGF-β1-dependent manner. Here we report a novel interaction between endoglin and the scaffolding protein GAIP-interacting protein C terminus (GIPC), and the impact on TGF-β-induced Smad signaling and endothelial cell migration. Cell Culture and Antibodies—HMEC-1s were grown in MCDB-131 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml EGF (Sigma) and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Endoglin-null (endo-/-) and control (endo+/+) MEECs were grown in MCDB-131 supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 100 μg of heparin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) (Sigma). Both HMEC-1s and MEECs were cultured in flasks coated with 0.05% gelatin. Endoglin antibody, P3D1, which recognizes the extracellular domain, was obtained from Chemicon. Phosphospecific Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3, as well as their respective total Smad antibodies, were all purchased from Cell Signaling. Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin was obtained from Pierce. GIPC antibody (H-55) and the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Promega, respectively. Protein Expression and Knockdown—Endo-/- and endo+/+ MEECs were nucleofected with cDNA constructs using Amaxa nucleofection system as described previously. HMEC-1s were infected with either a non-targeting vector control or shRNA endoglin-expressing adenovirus (targeting intracellular sequence) at 50 MOI and incubated for 72 h before harvest. All constructs used in nucleofection were PCR-amplified and inserted into pDispay vector. Adenoviral expression required the PCR cloning of cDNA into pDNR vector supplied by Clonetech BD Bioscience. Subsequent generation and amplification of adenoviruses were as directed by the manufacturer's protocols. shRNA-mediated GIPC knockdown was achieved by nucleofection of MEECs with a plasmid (generous gift from Dr. Jeffrey Rathmell) encorporating the shRNAi mouse sequence: GCATCAAGGAAGGCAGTGTGATTCCTCGAGCAATCAACTGCCTTCCTTGATGC. Immunofluorescence—MEECs and HMEC-1s were serum-starved for 2 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Endoglin-L and endoglin-DEL, and GIPC expressions were detected using P3D1 and GIPC antibodies, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with appropriate secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, then mounted with Prolong Anti-fade (Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation—MEECs expressing GIPC with either endoglin-L or endoglin-DEL were washed with PBS, then lysed on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10% w/v glycerol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails). The lysates were precleared by centrifugation and incubated with either P3D1 or GIPC antibody and protein G-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, pellets washed with lysis buffer, and stored in 2× sample buffer prior to Western blot analyses. Cell Surface Biotinylation—MEECs expressing endoglin-L, endoglin-Del, shRNA against GIPC or a non-targeting vector control were washed with PBS prior to treatment with 0.5 mg/ml Biotin-LC (Pierce) on ice for 30 min. Upon extensive washes with PBS, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10% w/v glycerol) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails), lysates normalized for total protein content via Bradford, then immunoprecipitated with P3D1 as described. HMEC-1s expressing GIPC via adenovirus infection were subjected to biotinylation as described previously. Lysates were normalized for protein levels by Bradford assay prior to immunoprecipitation of endoglin using P3D1 antibody. All biotinylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for biotinylated endoglin with streptavidin-HRP. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Dual reporter luciferase assays were performed as described by manufacturer (Promega). TGFβ-responsive vectors used as reporters for ALK5/Smad2 and ALK1/Smad1/5 signaling were PE2.1 and 3GC2, respectively. MEECs were nucleofected with GIPC and either endoglin-L or endoglin-DEL, along with either PE2.1 or 3GC2. The expression plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene served as an internal control to correct for transfection efficiency. Briefly, 106 cells were subjected to nucleofection with ∼2 μg of endoglin-L, or endoglin-Del, with 2 μg of either PE2.1 or 3GC2 vectors and 50 ng of Renilla vector. 24 h postnucleofection, cells were subjected to serum starvation or treatment with 100 pm TGFβ1 in serum-free media for 12–16 h prior to cell lysis and subsequent luciferase activity analyses. Transwell Migration Assay—Transwells (Costar Corning Inc. 8 μm polycarbonate membrane 6.5 mm insert, 24-well plate) were coated with 0.02% gelatin prior to plating. Approximately 30,000 cells were plated onto the top of each of the 24-well membrane and allowed to migrate for 12 h prior to cell fixation and staining of the nuclei of the migrated cells on the bottom side of the membrane. The transwell membrane containing the stained cells were digitally imaged, then counted using image J software to tabulate cells as they were manually identified. Interaction Between Endoglin and GIPC—The endoglin cytoplasmic domain contains several potential binding sites for signal transducing proteins, including zyxin, zyxin related protein-1, and the recently reported recognition motif for β-arrestin2 (27Lee N.Y. Blobe G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21507-21517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 28Conley B.A. Koleva R. Smith J.D. Kacer D. Zhang D. Bernabéu C. Vary C.P. J.

In addition, the extreme C terminus contains a conserved type I PDZ binding domain with a consensus sequence of X(S/T)X(V/L), which is shared by the closely related TGF-β superfamily co-receptor, the type III TGF-β receptor (TβRIII) (30Blobe G.C.

In these receptors this motif has been demonstrated to mediate the interaction with the PDZ domain-containing protein, GIPC, which functions to regulate, at least in part, their cell surface expression. To investigate whether endoglin might interact with GIPC in endothelial cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in endoglin-null mouse embryonic endothelial cell line (MEECs, denoted endo-/-). HA epitope-tagged wild-type endoglin (endoglin-L) and an HA epitope-tagged endoglin mutant in which the last three C-terminal residues are truncated (ΔSMA, denoted endoglin-Del, Fig. 1A) were tested for their ability to bind GIPC. While immunoprecipitation of GIPC resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of endoglin-L, endoglin-Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with of GIPC (Fig. 1B, compare lane 3 versus lane 2). In a reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation of endoglin-L, but not endoglin-Del, resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of GIPC (Fig. 1C, compare lane 3 versus lane 2). Taken together, these studies support an interaction between endoglin and GIPC mediated by the class I PDZ binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin. Subcellular Distribution of Endoglin and GIPC—The interaction between endoglin and GIPC was examined next in the context of their subcellular distribution. In endo-/- MEECs, a GFP fusion protein of GIPC was diffusely localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A), while endoglin-L had more prominent steady-state membrane localization (Fig. 2B) than endoglin-Del (Fig. 2C). When GIPC was co-expressed with endoglin-L, some of the GIPC localized to distinct clusters at or near the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D, compared with panels A or G), where it co-localized with endoglin-L (Fig. 2, E and F) irrespective of TGFβ1 stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, when GIPC was co-expressed with endoglin-Del, there was no alteration in GIPC localization (Fig. 2G, compared with 2A) and no co-localization of GIPC with endoglin-Del (Fig. 2, H and I, merged image). These studies suggest that endoglin recruits GIPC to distinct parts of the plasma membrane through its PDZ binding motif in its cytoplasmic domain in a TGFβ-independent manner. Effect of GIPC on Endoglin Expression—GIPC has been proposed to mediate the cell surface stabilization and/or subcellular trafficking of interacting receptors (30Blobe G.C. Liu X. Fang S.J. How T. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39608-39617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 32Katoh M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 9: 585-589PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether GIPC stabilizes endoglin at the cell surface, endo-/- MEECs expressing either endoglin-L or endoglin-Del were cell surface-biotinylated to assess their steady-state expression at the cell surface. While endoglin-L and endoglin-Del were expressed at approximately equal levels (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 3, bottom panel), more endoglin-L was expressed at the cell surface compared with endoglin-Del (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 3, top panel), suggesting that GIPC might mediate cell surface retention of endoglin. To gain further support for GIPC in regulating endoglin cell surface expression, the expression of endogenous GIPC was knocked down via shRNA and levels of endogenous endoglin were assessed. When GIPC expression was decreased (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus lane 2, lower panel), cell surface endoglin expression decreased (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus lane 2, top panel), while total cellular levels, if anything, increased (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus lane 2, middle panel). We also investigated the ability for GIPC to promote cell surface retention of endoglin in another endothelial cell line, human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1s). Here, GIPC expression was increased by infection with adenovirus (Fig. 3C, bottom panel), with increasing GIPC expression correlating with increased cell surface endoglin expression (Fig. 3C, top panel), without altering total cellular endoglin levels (Fig. 3C, middle panel). Taken together, these results support a role for GIPC in stabilizing endoglin on the cell surface through interactions mediated by the type I PDZ binding domain in the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin. Effect of the Endoglin GIPC Interaction on Smad Signaling—The precise role of endoglin in regulating TGF-β signaling to the Smad pathways in endothelial cells has been elusive. To gain insight into how the endoglin-GIPC interaction might contribute to regulating Smad signaling the levels of Smad activation were assessed upon TGF-β1 treatment in the presence and absence of endoglin competent to bind GIPC (endoglin-L) and endoglin unable to bind GIPC (endoglin-Del) in endo-/- MEECs. We initially assessed the effects of TGF-β1 on endo-/- MEECs relative to endo+/+ MEECs. In both endo+/+ and endo-/- MEECs, TGF-β1 increased the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). In endo+/+ MEECs, TGF-β1 more potently activated Smad1/5/8 relative to endo-/- MEECs, suggesting that endoglin might be necessary for full activation of the Smad 1/5/8 pathway. A similar pattern was observed in time course experiments, where TGF-β1 promoted greater and more sustained Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation in endo+/+ MEECs than in endo-/- MEECs (Fig. 4B). In contrast, while TGF-β1 stimulated Smad2/3 phosphorylation was slightly greater in endo+/+ MEECs than in endo-/- MEECs, these effects were modest when compared with the effects on Smad1/5/8. To investigate whether these differences were endoglin-mediated and the effect of the endoglin-GIPC interaction, endoglin-L and endoglin-Del were expressed in endo-/- MEECs. In endo-/- MEECs expression of endoglin-L increased TGF-β1-stimulated Smad1/5/8 and restored sustained Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, while endoglin-Del expression had no effect (Fig. 5). In a reciprocal experiment, we used shRNA against GIPC to markedly decrease GIPC expression in endo+/+ and endo-/- MEECs (Fig. 6A, upper panel), and examine its effect on Smad signaling. GIPC knockdown sharply reduced Smad 1/5/8 activation in endo+/+ MEECs, whereas minimal changes were observed in endo-/- MEECs (Fig. 6B).FIGURE 6GIPC knockdown attenuates Smad 1/5/8 activation. A, both endo+/+ and endo-/- MEECs were nucleofected with either non-targeting vector control (lanes 1 and 3) or shRNA against GIPC (lanes 2 and 4), and the expression of GIPC assessed by Western blot (upper panel) with β-actin assessed as a loading control (lower panel). B, 48 h post-nucleofection with either the non-targeting vector (NTV) or GIPC shRNA, cells were serum-starved for 6 h prior to 100 pm TGF-β1 treatment for the indicated time (hours (h)). Upper panels, immunoblot of phospho-Smad1/5/8 levels. Lower panels, immunoblot of total Smad 1 levels. Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the main intracellular mediators of TGF-β signaling, the Smad effectors accumulate in the nucleus upon their phosphorylation to engage in the transcriptional responses of target genes. To further examine the effect of the endoglin-GIPC interaction we next examined Smad-dependent transcriptional responses, using two promoter-reporter constructs, 3GC2, which requires Smad1/5/8 signaling, and PE2.1, which requires Smad3 signaling. Consistent with the results with Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, the relative luciferase activity for 3GC2 in endo+/+ MEECs cells was higher than endo-/- MEECs both in the absence and presence of TGF-β treatment (Fig. 7A). Ectopic expression of endoglin-L in endo-/- MEEC yielded a significant enhancement of basal and TGF-β1-stimulated 3GC2 luciferase activity, while ectopic expression of endoglin-Del had minimal impact (Fig. 7A). In the case of Smad2/3-mediated transcriptional activity, the basal luciferase activity for PE2.1 in endo+/+ MEECs and endo-/- MEECs was equivalent; however, endo-/- MEECs failed to respond to TGF-β1 relative to endo+/+ MEECs (Fig. 7B). In addition, in contrast to the results with the 3GC2 reporter, ectopic expression of endoglin-L of endoglin-DEL in endo-/- MEEC failed to increase basal or TGF-β1-stimulated PE2.1 luciferase activity (Fig. 7B). Taken together, these results indicate that endoglin specifically promotes ALK1/Smad1/5/8 signaling, in part through its interaction with GIPC. To determine whether the observed effect of endoglin on Smad1/5/8 signaling was cell-type specific, we examined Smad activation in another endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. In addition as the endo-/- MEECs could have adapted to the chronic loss of endoglin expression, we used adenoviral vector-based shRNA to effectively and acutely knockdown endogenous endoglin expression (Fig. 8A). Compared with the non-targeting vector control (NTV), the endoglin-knockdown cells displayed reduced levels of TGF-β1-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation (Fig. 8B), while Smad2/3 activation remained comparable irrespective of endoglin expression. Taken together, these results support a specific role for endoglin in TGF-β1-mediated activation of the Smad1/5/8 pathway, and a role for endoglin interacting with GIPC to mediate this effect. Effect of the Endoglin GIPC Interaction on Endothelial Cell Migration—Endoglin has an established role in inhibiting endothelial cell migration and this function has been reported to require the entire cytoplasmic domain of endoglin (28Conley B.A. Koleva R. Smith J.D. Kacer D. Zhang D. Bernabéu C. Vary C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27440-27449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether endothelial cell migration might be regulated by the interaction between endoglin and GIPC. Consistent with previous reports endo+/+ MEECs migrated slower than endo-/- MEECs in transwell assays (Fig. 9A). When endoglin-L was transiently expressed in endo-/- MEECs, their migration was inhibited to a level comparable to endo+/+ MEECs, confirming a negative role for endoglin in endothelial cell migration (Fig. 9B). In contrast, transient expression of endoglin-Del in endo-/- MEECs failed to inhibit the migration of endo-/- MEECs (Fig. 9B), supporting an important role for the Class I PDZ binding motif of endoglin in interacting with GIPC to mediate this endoglin function. To further test this hypothesis, GIPC expression was knocked down in endo+/+ and endo-/- MEECs and monitored for their cell motility. As expected, silencing GIPC expression up-regulated the cell motility of endo+/+ MEECs while exerting little impact on endo-/- MEECs (Fig. 9C). These results support a role for endoglin in regulating endothelial cell migration through its ability to interact with GIPC. While the mutation of endoglin in the human vascular disease HHT1 and the embryonic lethal phenotype of endoglin-null mice due to defects in angiogenesis both support an essential role for endoglin in endothelial cell biology, how endoglin regulates endothelial cell function is poorly understood. Genetic evidence support a role for TGF-β-superfamily signaling in the pathogenesis of HHT, as mutations in the TGF-β superfamily type I receptor ALK-1 result in HHT2, and mutation in the common TGF-β superfamily transcription factor Smad4, have also been implicated in HHT. We have been investigating how intracellular signal transducing proteins might impact TGF-β signaling and endoglin-mediated endothelial cell biology upon their interaction with endoglin. Indeed, we recently reported a novel interaction of endoglin with β-arrestin2, an association that resulted in their co-internalization, attenuation of ERK activation and inhibition of endothelial cell migration. In the present study, we examined the ability of endoglin to interact with GIPC, and its impact on the Smad signaling pathways. An interaction between endoglin and GIPC is supported by the ability of endoglin-L but not endoglin-Del to co-immunoprecipitate GIPC and for GIPC to co-immunoprecipitate endoglin but not endoglin-Del. Moreover, GIPC was shown to co-localize with endoglin-L but not endoglin-Del near the plasma membrane. Functionally, GIPC stabilized endoglin on the cell surface, as evidenced by cell surface biotinylation assays comparing endoglin-L with endoglin-Del, as well as GIPC knockdown studies. GIPC-interacting motif of endoglin, in particular, was essential for endoglin-mediated stimulation of sustained Smad1/5/8 activation and endoglin-mediated inhibition of endothelial cell migration. In contrast with the effects on Smad1/5/8 activation, endoglin-L expression did not result in sustained Smad2 phosphorylation or Smad2 responsive reporter activation despite the modestly higher Smad2 phosphorylation observed for endo+/+ than endo-/- MEECs. Moreover, endoglin knockdown in HMEC-1 cells did not significantly alter Smad2/3 activation. These observations suggest a specific role for endoglin and its interaction with GIPC in mediating signaling through the Smad1/5/8 pathway. There are several possible underlying mechanisms for this effect. One the one hand, GIPC could facilitate cell surface retention of endoglin to promote its interaction with ALK-1, thereby enhancing TGF-β1-induced recruitment and activation of Smad 1/5/8 at the plasma membrane. Endoglin, and perhaps its interaction with GIPC, might also modulate the intermediate mechanisms that regulate Smad phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation. While our studies do not address these issues directly, we have observed more potent nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad 1/5/8 upon expression of endoglin-L than endoglin-Del in endo-/- MEECs (data not shown), argue against this latter case. We examined endothelial cell migration as a biological response. Our results indicate an inhibitory role for endoglin, in part facilitated by its interaction with GIPC. An inhibitory role for endoglin on endothelial cell migration is consistent with most reports in the literature. However, the role of the ALK-1/Smad1/5/8 on endothelial cell migration has been controversial, as TGF-β-induced activation of ALK-1 has been reported to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and migration (6Goumans M.J.

On the other hand, the role of endoglin and ALK-1 may depend on the ligand utilized to stimulate these pathways. Furthermore, while the Smad signaling pathways have been characterized to play integral roles in endothelial cell migration, other non-Smad pathways influencing these processes have been reported. Given our findings, it is an attractive possibility that the endoglin-GIPC interaction orchestrates one or several Smad-dependent and Smad-independent signaling pathways to influence TGF-β and BMP-mediated cellular responses. Precisely how endoglin, through interacting with GIPC, responds to TGF-β superfamily ligands to regulate cell motility is likely to be complex, involving distinct signaling receptor complexes, and remains an area of active investigation. The novel interaction between endoglin and GIPC reported here further expands the role of endoglin in TGF-β-mediated signaling in endothelial cells. Thus far, several proteins have been identified to target the intracellular domain of endoglin: zyxin, zyxin-related protein, and the recently reported scaffolding protein, β-arrestin2. While the precise structural determinants mediating the interaction between endoglin and zyxin or ZRP-1 remains to be defined, β-arrestin2 has been demonstrated to bind endoglin near the C terminus that incorporates the PDZ binding motif. These findings raise an interesting possibility that endoglin is subjected to regulation by opposing scaffolding mediators: GIPC that anchors endoglin and promotes its cell surface retention and promotes Smad 1/5/8 activation, while β-arrestin2 internalizes the co-receptor and attenuates ERK signaling. As the critical structural determinants for their binding to endoglin reside within a few residues apart, whether β-arrestin2 and GIPC compete for binding to endoglin, and what mechanisms, if any, determine their interaction remain to be defined. Efforts are underway to address these questions and to characterize how endoglin modulates downstream Smad and non-Smad-dependent signaling as result of its interaction with β-arrestin2, GIPC. In summary, we have demonstrated a novel association between endoglin and GIPC. Our findings indicate that the endoglin-GIPC interaction is necessary promote Smad1/5/8 activation and ALK-1-mediated TGF-β1 signaling downstream at the transcriptional level in endothelial cells, as well as for endoglin to mediate its inhibitory effect on migration in endothelial cells.

However, how such stability is supported at the molecular level remains largely elusive. Here we show that Xenopus ONT1, an Olfactomedin-class secreted protein, stabilizes axial formation by restricting Chordin activity on the dorsal side. When ONT1 function is attenuated, the embryo becomes hyperdorsalized by a normally subeffective dose of Chordin. ONT1 binds Chordin and BMP1/Tolloid-class proteinases (B1TP) via distinct domains and acts as a secreted scaffold that enhances B1TP-mediated Chordin degradation by facilitating enzyme-substrate association. ONT1 is indispensable for fine-tuning BMP signaling in the axial tissue, and a similar role has been suggested for dorsally expressed BMPs such as ADMP. Simultaneous inhibition of ONT1 and dorsally expressed BMPs (ADMP and BMP2) synergistically caused drastic dorsalization. These results indicate that stable axial formation depends on two compensatory regulatory pathways involving ONT1/B1TP and dorsally expressed BMPs.

These results indicate that stable axial formation depends on two compensatory regulatory pathways involving ONT1/B1TP and dorsally expressed BMPs. In Xenopus, once the dorsal-ventral (DV) polarity of the embryo is first determined by canonical Wnt signaling (reviewed in Heasman, 2006Heasman J. Patterning the early Xenopus embryo.Development. 2006; 133: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), an orchestrated regulation of BMP activity then plays a central role in tissue patterning along the DV axis in the Xenopus gastrula. The level of local BMP signaling provides the ventral positional value in the embryonic field: high and low BMP signaling, respectively, specify the ventral and dorsal identities. These BMP signaling levels are finely controlled along the DV axis by positive (e.g., BMP ligands) and negative (e.g., BMP antagonists such as Chordin and Noggin) factors, which are interactively regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels (Khokha et al., 2005Khokha M.K. Yeh J. Grammer T.C. Harland R.M. Depletion of three BMP antagonists from Spemann's organizer leads to a catastrophic loss of dorsal structures.Dev.

Kuroda H. Dorsal-ventral patterning and neural induction in Xenopus embryos.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). However, although many regulatory molecules have been identified, our understanding of their dynamic regulation as a network system is still limited. For example, although the organizer factor/neural inducer Chordin inactivates the major ventralizing factor BMP4 by binding to it in the extracellular space (Piccolo et al., 1996Piccolo S. Sasai Y. Lu B. De Robertis E.M. Dorsoventral patterning in Xenopus: inhibition of ventral signals by direct binding of Chordin to BMP-4.Cell. 1996; 86: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), their functional and transcriptional relationships are not simple. For instance, in the reverse direction, BMP4 suppresses Chordin expression (Reversade and De Robertis, 2005Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Regulation of ADMP and BMP2/4/7 at opposite embryonic poles generates a self-regulating morphogenetic field.Cell. 2005; 123: 1147-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This mutual regulation, if working alone, would cause a problem in the graded pattern formation of the embryo, because such a double-inhibitory relationship functions as a positive-feedback loop, which is unstable by nature and tends to cause catastrophic changes (Gardner et al., 2000Gardner T.S. Cantor C.R. Collins J.J. Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli.Nature. 2000; 403: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (2905) Google Scholar). In this imaginary situation, a small increase in Chordin would cause reduced BMP activity, which in turn would desuppress (increase) Chordin expression. As a result of such a chain reaction, the dorsal signal (Chordin) would eventually predominate. Contrary to such theoretical instability, the embryonic dorsal axial pattern exhibits substantial resistance (or robustness) to quantitative change in the level of patterning signals such as Chordin (Reversade and De Robertis, 2005Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Regulation of ADMP and BMP2/4/7 at opposite embryonic poles generates a self-regulating morphogenetic field.Cell. 2005; 123: 1147-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, classic studies in experimental embryology provide several lines of evidence for the robustness of dorsal axial patterning. First, the Spemann organizer differentiates into the notochord (the original fate of dorsal axial mesoderm) even after it is grafted to the ventral-most part of the marginal zone (Spemann and Mangold, 1924Spemann H. Mangold H. Induction of embryonic primordia by implantation of organizers from a different species.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1924; 45: 13-38Google Scholar), where the highest level of ventralizing signals is supposedly present. In addition, normal development of the Xenopus tadpole is observed even after a substantial ablation or addition of organizer tissue at the early gastrula stage (Cooke, 1973Cooke J.

Morphol. 1975; 33: 147-157PubMed Google Scholar). In the avian embryo, the dorsal axis is restored even after total ablation of the node (Gallera and Nicolet, 1974Gallera J. Nicolet G. Regulation in nodeless chick blasoderms.Experientia. 1974; 30: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, Joubin and Stern, 1999Joubin K. Stern C.D. Molecular interactions continuously define the organizer during the cell movements of gastrulation.Cell. 1999; 98: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Another example is the bisection experiment in amphibian embryos. When an amphibian blastula is bisected into dorsal and ventral halves, the dorsal half (which supposedly lacks ventral information) develops into a small but normally patterned embryo that contains both dorsal and ventral structures, whereas the ventral half develops only into pattern-less ventral tissues called belly pieces (Reversade and De Robertis, 2005Reversade B.

Developmental physiological studies on Triturus part III.Archiv für Entwicklingsmechanik. 1903; 16: 551-631Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that a self-regulating fail-safe system exists on the dorsal side of the amphibian embryo. Recent studies have implicated a BMP ligand, ADMP (antidorsalizing morphogenetic protein), in the feedback regulation of the Chordin/BMP system on the dorsal side (Dosch and Niehrs, 2000Dosch R. Niehrs C. Requirement for anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein in organizer patterning.Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Joubin and Stern, 1999Joubin K.

ADMP expression is found in dorsal axial tissues in a manner similar to Chordin, and is negatively regulated by BMP signals (Dosch and Niehrs, 2000Dosch R. Niehrs C.

Conversely, the BMP ligand ADMP contributes to the sum of ventralizing BMP signals, which reduce the gene expression of the organizer factors (Moos et al., 1995Moos Jr., M. Wang S. Krinks M. Anti-dorsalizing morphogenetic protein is a novel TGF-β homolog expressed in the Spemann organizer.Development. 1995; 121: 4293-4301PubMed Google Scholar, Reversade and De Robertis, 2005Reversade B.

This feedback loop is thought to contribute to the stabilization of DV patterning by preventing the unlimited expansion of dorsal axial mesoderm. However, ADMP by itself can only account for part of the feedback regulation, because the knockdown of ADMP by MO injection causes only moderate (noncatastrophic) dorsalization (Reversade and De Robertis, 2005Reversade B.

In this study, we introduce Xenopus ONT1 as a key molecule for fine-tuning of the Chordin/BMP system, and show its essential role for the posttranslational regulation of Chordin. ONT1 belongs to a newly identified group of secreted proteins, called the Olfactomedin family (Zeng et al., 2005Zeng L.C. Han Z.G. Ma W.J. Elucidation of subfamily segregation and intramolecular coevolution of the olfactomedin-like proteins by comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and gene expression pattern assessment.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; see Figure S1A available online), whose biological roles remain largely elusive. Olfactomedin-family proteins have a coiled-coil domain (which is relatively diverse in its amino acid sequence) in the amino-terminal half and a conserved Olfactomedin domain in the carboxy-terminal half (Tsuda et al., 2002Tsuda H. Sasai N. Matsuo-Takasaki M. Sakuragi M. Murakami Y. Sasai Y. Dorsalization of the neural tube by Xenopus Tiarin, a novel patterning factor secreted by the flanking nonneural head ectoderm.Neuron. 2002; 33: 515-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Two Olfactomedin-related factors were previously reported to play a regulatory role in neural development. Noelin is expressed in the neural crest and prolongs the generation period of neural crest production (Barembaum et al., 2000Barembaum M. Moreno T.A. LaBonne C. Sechrist J. Bronner-Fraser M. Noelin-1 is a secreted glycoprotein involved in generation of the neural crest.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Tiarin is expressed in the nonneural ectoderm adjacent to the anterior neural plate and induces dorsalization of the nervous tissues (Tsuda et al., 2002Tsuda H. Sasai N. Matsuo-Takasaki M. Sakuragi M. Murakami Y. Sasai Y. Dorsalization of the neural tube by Xenopus Tiarin, a novel patterning factor secreted by the flanking nonneural head ectoderm.Neuron. 2002; 33: 515-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We recently isolated a chick Olfactomedin-family factor, ONT1, which is distantly related to Noelin and Tiarin (Sakuragi et al., 2006Sakuragi M. Sasai N. Ikeya M. Kawada M. Onai T. Katahira T. Nakamura H. Sasai Y. Functional analysis of chick ONT1 reveals distinguishable activities among olfactomedin-related signaling factors.Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Chick ONT1 is expressed in the axial and paraxial mesoderm during early chick embryogenesis (Sakuragi et al., 2006Sakuragi M. Sasai N. Ikeya M. Kawada M. Onai T. Katahira T. Nakamura H. Sasai Y. Functional analysis of chick ONT1 reveals distinguishable activities among olfactomedin-related signaling factors.Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To explore the possible roles of the Olfactomedin family in axial patterning, we isolated a homolog in Xenopus (GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ accession number AB440138 ; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), an animal model that allows detailed molecular analysis of DV patterning (Heasman, 2006Heasman J. Patterning the early Xenopus embryo.Development. 2006; 133: 1205-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, De Robertis and Kuroda, 2004De Robertis E.M. Kuroda H. Dorsal-ventral patterning and neural induction in Xenopus embryos.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 285-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that ONT1 is a unique pro-BMP factor that acts as a secreted scaffold for the B1TP-mediated degradation of Chordin. We show that ONT1 functions as a key player in the dynamic control of Chordin protein levels. Finally, we propose that ONT1, together with dorsally expressed BMPs, plays an indispensable role in Chordin activity regulation and ensures stable DV patterning in the embryo. Xenopus ONT1 encodes a secreted protein (392 amino acids long) that contains a coiled-coil domain and an Olfactomedin domain (Figure 1A; these domains have 72% and 75% amino acid identity, respectively, to those in the chick homolog). The Olfactomedin domain of ONT1 shows moderate homology with those of Noelin and Tiarin, whereas the coiled-coil domain is less conserved. Recombinant ONT1 protein was efficiently secreted into the culture medium by HEK293T cells overexpressing it and also by dissociated cells of ONT1-injected Xenopus embryos (Figure S1B; most secreted ONT1 appeared as a dimer; lanes 4 and 8). In whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses, ONT1 expression appeared at the late blastula stage with diffuse labeling in the animal region (Figure S1C). At the early gastrula stage, ONT1 was expressed in the deep dorsal mesoderm (not in the superficial zone) whereas its diffuse expression in the animal cap was fading (Figure 1B). The expression in the dorsal mesoderm continued during the mid-to-late gastrula stages (Figure 1C). During the late gastrula and neurula stages, ONT1 expression was observed in the axial and paraxial mesoderm (Figures 1D, S1D, and S1E), including the head mesoderm, consistent with ONT1 expression in early chick embryos (Sakuragi et al., 2006Sakuragi M. Sasai N. Ikeya M. Kawada M. Onai T. Katahira T. Nakamura H. Sasai Y. Functional analysis of chick ONT1 reveals distinguishable activities among olfactomedin-related signaling factors.Mech. Dev. 2006; 123: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To elucidate the in vivo function of ONT1, we performed loss-of-function experiments in Xenopus using ONT1-MO (see Figures S2A–S2C for the design and specificity of this test). Injection of ONT1-MO induced the typical signs of dorsalization such as a larger head and short body with thick dorsal structures in the late tailbud embryo (73%, n = 70; Figure 1F). During the mid-to-late gastrula stages, ONT1-MO caused expansion of the dorsal axial marker Goosecoid (Gsc; 100%, n = 20; Figures 1G and 1K), whereas injection of the control MO with five-base mismatches had no effect (n = 14; Figures S2F and S2G). ONT1-MO injection also expanded the expression of the dorsal axial markers Chordin (100%, n = 12; Figures 1H and 1L) and Shh (93%, n = 14; Figures 1I and 1M) as well as the expression of the anterior neural plate markers Xanf and Otx2 (90%, n = 20 and 95%, n = 20, respectively; Figures S2D and S2E and not shown; in Xenopus, augmentation of early organizer activity causes both dorsalization and anteriorization due to head organizer induction). In contrast, ONT1-MO reduced Sizzled (Szl; a ventral marker) expression (83%, n = 18) on the ventral side (Figures 1J and 1N). The ONT1-MO-induced dorsalization phenotypes (expansion of Gsc, Chd, and Shh, and suppression of Szl) were reversed by coinjecting a small amount (4 pg) of MO-resistant ONT1 RNA (with silent mutations; Figures 1O–1R). The expansion of dorsal gene expression (Gsc) was observed when ONT1-MO was injected into the dorsal blastomeres of four-cell embryos (88%, n = 17; Figure 1S), but not into the ventral ones (n = 19; Figure 1T), indicating that dorsally expressed ONT1 is required for proper axial patterning. These findings suggest that ONT1 is required for regulating the level of dorsalization in dorsal embryonic tissues. In the zygotic control of DV patterning in the amphibian embryo, local BMP activity plays a decisive role in creating positional information along the axis. To explore the possible role of ONT1 as a modulator of BMP signals, we next examined in vitro the physical interactions of epitope-tagged ONT1 protein (overexpressed by HEK293T cells) with extracellular components of BMP signaling: BMPs, BMP receptors (BMPRs; extracellular domains), and BMP modulators. In in vitro immunoprecipitation assays (Figures 2 and S3), we observed no substantial association between ONT1 and BMP4, ADMP, BMPRs (Ia, Ib, II), Crossveinless2 (Cv2), Sizzled (Szl), Twisted gastrulation (Tsg), Follistatin, or Noggin protein (Figures S3A–S3I). In addition, ONT1 did not show physical interactions with Wnt or Nodal proteins (Figures S3J and S3K), which can induce dorsalization in Xenopus, either. In contrast, ONT1 protein was efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with Chordin in vitro (Figure 2A, lane 5), and this interaction was mediated by the CR2–4 region of Chordin (Figures S4A and S4B). Interestingly, physical interactions of ONT1 were also observed between ONT1 and the BMP1/Tolloid-class proteinases (B1TP) BMP1 (Figure 2B, lane 5) and Xolloid-related (Xlr; Figure 2C, lane 5), which are known to degrade Chordin protein (Blitz et al., 2000Blitz I.L. Shimmi O. Wunnenberg-Stapleton K. O'Connor M.B. Cho K.W. Is chordin a long-range- or short-range-acting factor?

Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cleavage of Chordin by Xolloid metalloprotease suggests a role for proteolytic processing in the regulation of Spemann organizer activity.Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Importantly, the coimmunoprecipitation of ONT1 with Chordin (Figure 2E, lane 3) or BMP1 (Figure 2F, lane 3) was also observed using the secreted fraction from a dissociation culture of RNA-injected Xenopus embryonic cells. Analyses using deletion mutants (Figure 2G) revealed that the Olfactomedin domain of ONT1 (Figure 2A, lane 7), but not its coiled-coil domain (Figure 2A, lane 6), bound to Chordin, indicating that ONT1 physically interacts with Chordin in a domain-specific manner. In contrast, the coiled-coil domain of the ONT1 protein interacted with the two B1TP proteins (Figures 2B and 2C, lane 6). ONT1 also binds to the Chordin-BMP4 complex in vitro (Figure S4C), and the association between ONT1 and Chordin is not strongly affected by the addition of BMP4 and/or Tsg protein (at an equimolar dose to Chordin; Figure S4D). These observations show that ONT1 binds to Chordin and B1TP via distinct domains (Figure 2H). The physical association between Chordin and its proteolytic enzymes raised the possibility that ONT1 plays a role in modulating extracellular BMP signaling via Chordin. Interestingly, embryonic DV patterning shows substantial resistance to quantitative changes in Chordin protein. The blastocoele injection of recombinant Chordin protein in the Xenopus blastula causes minimal change in the axial pattern (Reversade and De Robertis, 2005Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Regulation of ADMP and BMP2/4/7 at opposite embryonic poles generates a self-regulating morphogenetic field.Cell. 2005; 123: 1147-1160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We examined whether the depletion of ONT1 would affect this robust resistance of DV patterning to increased Chordin (Figure 3A). Consistent with the previous report, injected recombinant Chordin protein (44 fmol/blastocoele; which is sufficient to reverse the strong ventralizing effect of 22 fmol BMP4; Figures S5A and S5B) at stage 9 caused only weak dorsalization, if any, at this dose: a marginal increase in Gsc expression and little change in the expression pattern of the anterior forebrain marker Rx (compare Figures 3D and 3H with Figures 3B and 3F). In contrast, when ONT1-MO was injected in advance, the Chordin protein injection caused a dramatic increase in Gsc expression (96%, n = 26; Figure 3E) and a marked expansion of Rx expression (extending even to the ventral and posterior side; 96%, n = 26; Figure 3I). Similar hyperdorsalization phenotypes in ONT1-MO-injected embryos were observed when Chordin was injected at stage 11 (Figures S5C–S5F). Coinjection of MO-resistant ONT1 RNA (silent mutation) inhibited hyperdorsalization caused by Chordin and ONT1-MO (no drastic Gsc expansion in 87%, n = 15; Figure S5H). ONT1-MO injection experiments into dorsal- or ventral-specific blastomeres showed that the loss of ONT1 function on the dorsal side caused severe hypersensitivity to injected Chordin protein (Figures S5I and S5K), whereas ventral injection sensitized the embryo to only a minor extent (Figures S5J and S5L). These findings indicate that ONT1 function is indispensable for the robustness of dorsal patterning with respect to the Chordin-regulated mechanism. Because the in vivo expression of ONT1 overlaps with the expression of Chordin and the B1TP genes (BMP1 and Xlr; Figure S6), we became interested in the possibility that ONT1 might promote BMP1-mediated Chordin degradation by acting as a secreted scaffold (or an adaptor protein; reviewed in Burack and Shaw, 2000Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Signal transduction: hanging on a scaffold.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Ferrell, 2000Ferrell Jr., J.E. What do scaffold proteins really do?.Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: PE1Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) of the proteinase and its substrate, Chordin. In the in vivo experiment, we coinjected Chordin RNA with a moderate dose of BMP1 RNA that is sufficient for only a partial reduction of the Chordin protein in the extracellular fraction (Figures 4A and 4B, lanes 2 and 3). If the scaffold model is correct, the appropriate doses of ONT1 should promote Chordin degradation. In contrast, excessively high doses of ONT1 should inhibit degradation because the ONT1 proteins would bind individually to each protein, leading to the segregation of Chordin and BMP1 (Figure 4D). Consistent with these predictions, the coinjection of ONT1 (up to 100 pg/embryo) reduced the Chordin level in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B, lanes 3–7; Figure 4C), whereas the injection of higher doses of ONT1 dose-dependently increased undigested Chordin, resulting in Chordin levels comparable to those of the BMP1-uninjected control (Figure 4B, lanes 2 and 8–10; Figure 4C). Similar biphasic effects (dose-dependent facilitation and inhibition) of ONT1 on B1TP-mediated Chordin degradation were also observed in the in vitro assay using HEK293T-produced proteins (Figure 4E; Xlr was used in this assay by the reasoning described in Experimental Procedures). Importantly, when a low-molecular-weight peptide ligand for B1TP was used (Lee et al., 2006Lee H.X. Ambrosio A.L. Reversade B. De Robertis E.M. Embryonic dorsal-ventral signaling: secreted frizzled-related proteins as inhibitors of tolloid proteinases.Cell. 2006; 124: 147-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), the addition of ONT1 protein did not affect the enzymatic activity (Figure 4F), indicating that the enhancement of cleavage is a substrate- (Chordin) specific phenomenon. Another prediction from this scaffold model is that a higher dose of the enzyme should shift the window for the optimal ONT1 doses. To test this, we titrated ONT1 in the in vitro digestion assay of Chordin using three different doses of Xlr (Figure 4G; the amounts of the digested amino-terminal fragment were quantified; Figure S7A). In the presence of higher doses of Xlr (green and red), facilitation of Chordin digestion was observed even at higher concentrations of ONT1 (Figure 4G, lanes 5 and 6), at which the inhibition of proteolysis was seen when a low dose of Xlr (blue) was used (Figure 4H illustrates the ratios to the zero-ONT1 control shown in lane 2), showing that the optimal range of ONT1 was shifted (or widened) to the higher direction. Consistent with the binding data (Figure S4D), the presence of BMP4 and/or Tsg protein does not substantially affect the enhancement of Xlr-mediated Chordin degradation by ONT1 in vitro (Figure S4E). To obtain direct molecular evidence for the scaffold model, we attempted to isolate and analyze the enzyme-substrate complex (so-called Michaelis complex) of Chordin and B1TP, but it was not detectable in western blots (data not shown), presumably because of the low abundance of the transient intermediate complex. To stabilize the enzyme-substrate complex by preventing its hydrolysis, we next used a dominant-negative BMP1 (dnBMP1; mutated BMP1 according to tolloid mutation; following Piccolo et al., 1997Piccolo S. Agius E. Lu B. Goodman S. Dale L. De Robertis E.M. Cleavage of Chordin by Xolloid metalloprotease suggests a role for proteolytic processing in the regulation of Spemann organizer activity.Cell. 1997; 91: 407-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged ONT1, Chordin, and dnBMP1 proteins were separately overproduced in HEK293T cells and purified with Ni-NTA beads from conditioned medium. Immunoprecipitation assays of dnBMP1 (using a Flag antibody) showed that the association of dnBMP1 and Chordin substantially increased when a small amount of ONT1 was present (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Figures 4I and 4J). In contrast, as predicted from the model in Figure 4D, excessive amounts of ONT1 interfered with the binding of dnBMP1 and Chordin (Figures 4I and 4J, lanes 8 and 9). These observations demonstrate that, at an appropriate dose, ONT1 indeed functions as a binding scaffold that promotes enzyme- (B1TP) substrate (Chordin) association. We further confirmed the secreted scaffold model in the in vivo context. First, if the model in Figure 4D is correct, a simultaneous partial reduction of ONT1 and B1TP proteins should synergistically reduce Chordin degradation and thereby promote dorsalization in the embryo. We therefore performed coinjection experiments of BMP1-MO and ONT1-MO. When each MO was injected separately at a low dose (half of the effective dose), no substantial expansion of Gsc expression was seen (Figures S7C and S7D). However, when the two MOs were combined, they strongly increased Gsc expression in the injected embryo (92%, n = 12; Figure S7E) to a level greater than that seen with ONT1-MO or BMP1-MO alone at higher doses, indicating that ONT1 and B1TP cooperatively regulate Chordin levels. Second, this scaffold model predicts that the presence of excessive ONT1 (which causes the sequestration of Chordin and B1TP) should result in dorsalization, instead of ventralization, due to the reduction of B1TP-mediated Chordin degradation. Indeed, overexpression of ONT1 caused dorsalization in the embryo instead of ventralization (100%, n ="

In addition to the two liganded structures of ChoX, we were also able to solve the crystal structure of ChoX in a closed, substrate-free conformation that revealed an architecture of the ligand-binding site that is superimposable to the closed, ligand-bound form of ChoX.

The quaternary amine choline is commonly found in soil and the rhizosphere (1Kortstee G.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1970; 71: 235-244Google Scholar) where it can be utilized by microorganisms for various physiological processes. The plant root-associated soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, which is involved in the fixation of nitrogen and its delivery to its host plant Medicago sativa (2Long S.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 203-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), uses choline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source (1Kortstee G.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1970; 71: 235-244Google Scholar). Furthermore it also uses choline as the precursor for the synthesis of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine (3Bernard T. Pocard J.A. Perroud B. Lerudulier D. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 143: 359-364Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4Osteras M. Boncompagni E. Vincent N. Poggi M.C. Le Rudulier D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Besides S. meliloti forms phosphatidylcholine, a membrane lipid normally found in low amounts in prokaryotes, from choline and CDP-diacylglyceride by the phosphatidylcholine synthase (5de Rudder K.E.E.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 2003; 16: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In light of these diverse physiological functions of choline in S. meliloti, this soil bacterium has developed several systems for choline uptake (7Pocard J.A. Bernard T. Smith L.T. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of these is the choline-inducible transport system ChoVWX (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a member of the superfamily of microbial substrate-binding protein (SBP) 3The abbreviations used are: SBP, substrate-binding protein; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ACh, acetylcholine; Se-Met, selenomethionine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; GGBP, galactose/glucose-binding protein; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; BLAST, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool. 3The abbreviations used are: SBP, substrate-binding protein; ABC, ATP-binding cassette; ACh, acetylcholine; Se-Met, selenomethionine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; GGBP, galactose/glucose-binding protein; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; BLAST, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.-dependent ABC transporters (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In the case of the ABC importer ChoVWX from S. meliloti, ChoV serves as the nucleotide-binding domain that provides energy for the transport process via ATP hydrolysis, ChoW is the integral cytoplasmic membrane protein that forms the substrate translocation pathway, and ChoX is the substrate-binding protein located in the periplasm (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Binding assays with 14C-labeled choline and competition studies with compounds structurally related to choline have demonstrated that ChoX recognizes both choline (KD = 2.7 μm) and acetylcholine (KD = 145 μm) as ligands (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the substrate-binding protein confers specificity and directionality to a given microbial binding protein-dependent ABC transport system (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 10Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Doeven M.K. Poolman B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These binding proteins are either located in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria or are anchored at the cell surface in Gram-positive bacteria or archaea. The binding protein serves to capture the ligand with high affinity (mostly in the nm or low μm range) from substrate-depleted environments and delivers the ligand to the transmembrane domains of the ABC system. Upon ATP binding and hydrolysis by the cytoplasmically located nucleotide-binding domain, the substrate is released into the translocation complex and finally imported into the cell (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 10Biemans-Oldehinkel E. Doeven M.K. Poolman B. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently structural insight into the interactions of substrate-binding proteins with the cognate transmembrane domains of bacterial ABC transporters have been obtained for the putative molybdate importer ModABC from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (11Hollenstein K. Frei D.C. Locher K.P. Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), the vitamin B12 importer BtuCDF (12Hvorup R.N. Goetz B.A. Niederer M. Holenstein K. Perozo E. Locher K.P. Science. 2007; 317: 1387-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the maltose importer MalKEFG from Escherichia coli (13Oldham M.L. Khare D. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Nature. 2007; 450: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Structural studies of a substantial number of bacterial substrate-binding proteins revealed a general bilobal fold for this class of proteins (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 14Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 15Wilkinson J. Verschueren K.H.G. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press (Elsevier Science), London2003: 178-208Google Scholar). The substrate-binding site lies within a cleft that is dynamically formed by the two domains of the SBP upon capturing of the substrate. The two lobes of the binding protein are subjected to an opening and closing movement relative to each other, thereby opening and closing the path to the substrate-binding site (15Wilkinson J. Verschueren K.H.G. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press (Elsevier Science), London2003: 178-208Google Scholar). A flexible linker connects the two domains and permits a hinge-bending movement (16Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that leads to rigid-body motions conducted by both domains of the SBP. The ligand is thereby trapped deep within the binding protein and thus is largely occluded from the surrounding solvent (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 14Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 15Wilkinson J. Verschueren K.H.G. Holland I.B. Cole S.P.C. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: from Bacteria to Man. Academic Press (Elsevier Science), London2003: 178-208Google Scholar). In the absence of substrate, the two physical states of the binding protein, unliganded-open and unliganded-closed, are in equilibrium, and it is thought that the binding of the ligand shifts this ratio toward the liganded-closed state (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 14Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol.

Academic Press (Elsevier Science), London2003: 178-208Google Scholar). Crystal structures of SBPs both in the open (without a ligand) and the closed (with a ligand) forms have been determined for a substantial number of microbial SBPs (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 317-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 14Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol.

Academic Press (Elsevier Science), London2003: 178-208Google Scholar). In addition, crystal structures of the ribose and allose sugar-binding proteins from E. coli in various unliganded forms have been analyzed that allow tracing the path of the conformational changes occurring in the binding protein during ligand capturing and the formation of the liganded, closed structure (17Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Bjorkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Remarkably it has also been possible, although for only a single SBP, to elucidate the crystal structure of the unliganded-closed state (19Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8931-8936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these structural and other biochemical and biophysical data have given considerable support to the so-called “Venus fly trap mechanism” of substrate binding by SBPs (14Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 20Mao B. Pear M.R. McCammon J.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1131-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because no crystal structures of substrate-binding proteins with either choline or acetylcholine as ligand are available, we set out to determine the structure of the S. meliloti ChoX protein in complex with its substrates. This structural analysis revealed a ligand binding pocket and mode of substrate binding similar to that previously reported for several microbial glycine betaine/proline betaine-compatible solute-binding proteins (21Horn C. Sohn-Bosser L. Breed J. Welte W. Schmitt L. Bremer E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 592-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Schiefner A. Breed J. Bosser L. Kneip S. Gade J. Holtmann G.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5663-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore we were able to solve the crystal structure of ChoX in a substrate-free closed conformation with an architecture of the ligand-binding site that is superimposable for the closed ligand-bound and closed-unliganded forms of ChoX. This obviously raises the question of how the cognate transporter is capable to distinguish between these two states of the SBP. Growth Studies of S. meliloti Strain 2011 on Different Carbon Sources—A preculture of S. meliloti strain 2011 grown in LB media supplemented with 2.5 mm MgSO4 and 2.5 mm CaCl2 was harvested and inoculated in M9 minimal medium (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with either the sugar mannitol or the trimethylammonium compounds choline or ACh (0.2% (w/v)) as the sole carbon sources. Growth behavior of the S. meliloti strain 2011 in the presence of the different carbon sources was followed by measuring the absorbance (A600) over time. Protein Expression and Purification—Expression and purification of ChoX were performed as described previously (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, choX was overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the pET20b vector-derived expression plasmid pETNx (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal medium with glucose as the carbon source to avoid the capturing of chemically undefined ligands by ChoX from components of rich medium. 5 liters of minimal medium in a 10-liter flask was inoculated from an overnight-grown preculture of strain BL21(pLysS pETNx) to an absorbance (A578) of 0.1, and the cells were grown with rapid stirring of the culture at 37 °C. Expression of the pETNx encoded choX gene was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) when the culture reached an A578 of about 0.5. After choX induction, the bacterial culture was grown for an additional 2 h, and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation. The choX gene encodes a protein with a signal sequence to properly target it into the periplasm of the E. coli host strain. To release the periplasmically located proteins, the ChoX-overproducing cells were subjected to a rapid osmotic shock by resuspending them in ice-cold buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 500 mm sucrose) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was applied on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column for affinity purification of the His-tagged ChoX protein. Buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) was used for washing of the columns. His-tagged ChoX protein retained by the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was eluted from the affinity matrix by using a gradient from 10 to 250 mm imidazole, utilizing Buffer A and Buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). To exchange the buffer of the eluted ChoX protein-containing fractions, the protein was dialyzed at 4 °C against 5 liters of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0 buffer for crystallization experiments or against 5 liters of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl buffer for substrate binding assays using an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence-based assay. To obtain selenomethionine (Se-Met)-substituted ChoX protein, cells of strain BL21(pLysS pETNx) were grown in glucose minimal medium that was supplemented with 100 mg each of Lys, Phe, and Thr (10 mg/ml) and 50 mg each of Ile, Leu, and Val (5 mg/ml) just prior to the induction of choX expression to inhibit methionine biosynthesis. Incorporation of Se-Met was achieved by the subsequent addition of 60 mg of l-Se-Met (6 mg/ml). The Se-Met-substituted ChoX protein was purified as described above for the unmodified ChoX protein and used after dialysis for crystallization trials. Ligand Binding Experiments—The affinity of the purified ChoX protein for the different ligands was determined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Upon binding of the ligand to the tryptophan/tyrosine box (see Fig. 4), the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan is quenched. The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm, and fluorescence was monitored from 310 to 370 nm using a FluoroMax (Jobin Yvon, Horiba, Edison, NJ) with slit widths of 3 nm at 22 ± 1 °C. Different amounts of ligands in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 (from 0.5, 2.5, 5, 50, 100, and 500 mm stocks) were titrated to ChoX (600 nm) in 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. To account for background fluorescence, spectra with and without protein were subtracted from each other. All data were averaged from two independent measurements and analyzed according to Equation 1 in the case of acetylcholine and glycine betaine. % quenching = Fq,max×[S]KD+[S] (Eq. 1) Here Fq,max is the maximal quenching observed, [S] is the substrate concentration, and KD is the affinity constant of the ChoX-choline complex. In the case of choline, spectra were background-corrected and analyzed according to Equation 2, which corrects for the high protein concentrations used (26Abele R. Keinanen K. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21355-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). T represents the protein concentration, Kd represents the dissociation constant, Bmax represents the maximum amount of bound substrate, and [S] represents the substrate concentration. F/F0=(Kd+T+[S])−(Kd+T+[S]) 2−4T[S]/(2/TBmax)(Eq. 2) Crystallization of ChoX in the Presence and Absence of a Ligand—Purified ChoX protein (10 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 mm choline and incubated on ice for at least 30 min prior to crystallization. Crystals were obtained using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K against a reservoir solution of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8-5.0, 15-25% polyethylene glycol 3350. Protein was mixed with mother liquor 1:1 to a final volume of 2 μl. Crystals of wild type as well as the Se-Met-incorporated ChoX protein with choline were obtained after 4 weeks and had a size of 50 × 20 × 200 μm. To obtain crystals in the unliganded state, streak seeding at 277 K, utilizing ChoX-choline microcrystals, was established (27Oswald C. Smits S.H.J. Bremer E. Schmitt L. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2008; 9: 1131-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Crystals grew in less than 1 day and were immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. In all cases the mother liquor supplemented with 20-25% ethylene glycerol was used as cryoprotectant. Data Collection, Refinement, and Structure Analysis—All data sets were collected at the Max Planck beam line BW6 or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory beam line BW7A (Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany). Data statistics are given in Table 1. A three-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment using an Se-Met-incorporated ChoX-choline crystal was collected at a resolution of 2.9 Å. All data sets were processed with DENZO (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, London1997: 307-325Google Scholar) or XDS (29Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystrallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar). To obtain initial phases, SOLVE/RESOLVE was utilized (30Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). Eleven of the 14 Se-Met sites present in ChoX were detected leading to a mean figure of merit of 0.49. The model was further refined using REFMAC5 (31Murshudov G. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) with additional rounds of manual rebuilding using COOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22527) Google Scholar), resulting in a model for one of the two monomers present in the asymmetric unit. This model was used as a template for the high resolution data set of ChoX-choline at 1.9 Å utilizing the molecular replacement program MOLREP (33Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), resulting in two monomers in the asymmetric unit. The same model was used as a template for molecular replacement for the ChoX unliganded-closed (2.0 Å) and ChoX-acetylcholine (1.8 Å) structures. For the last two data sets the algorithm of Padilla and Yeates revealed a perfect twin (twinning factor α >0.479) (55Padilla J.E. Yeates T.O. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1124-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These structures were further refined using SHELXL97-2 (34Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 277. Academic Press, London1997: 319-343Google Scholar) with (h,-k,-l) as twinning operator. Water molecules were first detected using ARP/wARP (35Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (threshold of 3.2σ) and further manually checked. Data set and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. As analyzed with Molprobity (36Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J. Wang X. Murray L.W. Arendall III, W.B. Snoeyink J.

However, these residues are taking part in crystal contacts, explaining this rather high percentage.

Data Bank Searches and Sequence Alignments—Protein homologues of the S. meliloti ChoX protein were searched via the Web server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI BLAST) (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of ChoX-related proteins were performed using ClustalW (38Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54899) Google Scholar) as implemented in the Vector NTI 10.0 software package (Invitrogen). An alignment of the ChoX protein from S. meliloti with the OpuAC protein from Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 7) was performed by applying an “in-domain” cut in the OpuAC sequence between amino acid residues 168 and 169 and by inverting the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the OpuAC protein for the sequence alignment to ChoX as described previously (24Smits S.H. Hoing M. Lecher J. Jebbar M. Schmitt L. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5663-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Hanekop N. Hoing M. Sohn-Bosser L. Jebbar M. Schmitt L. Bremer E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 1237-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Protein Data Bank Accession Numbers—Coordinates and structure factors for the various crystal structures of ChoX described in this study have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the following accession codes: ChoX-choline (2REG), ChoX closed (2RF1), and ChoX-acetylcholine (2RIN). Choline and ACh Serve as Sole Carbon Sources for S. meliloti Strain 2011—The S. meliloti strain 2011 grows in minimal medium (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) mannitol as the sole carbon source. Both choline and ACh can also serve as carbon sources for this microorganism, although growth was considerably reduced in comparison with the mannitol-supplemented culture (Fig. 1). It is thus apparent that S. meliloti can utilize both trimethylammonium compounds for nutritional purposes although with reduced efficiency. The data reported by Dupont et al. (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) already suggested that the ChoVWX ABC transporter is capable of catalyzing the uptake of both choline and ACh. Binding Activity of the Purified ChoX Protein—To obtain the S. meliloti ChoX protein for biochemical and structural analysis, we expressed the choX gene in E. coli from plasmid pETNx and overproduced ChoX as an N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein. ChoX was then purified by affinity chromatography to apparent homogeneity essentially as described by Dupont et al. (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To assess the functionality of the purified ChoX protein, we performed a fluorescence-based equilibrium binding assay by exploiting the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of ChoX upon substrate binding. From this type of experiment, the KD value for choline was calculated to be 2.3 ± 1.0 μm (Fig. 2A). These data are in excellent agreement with the KD value of 2.7 μm reported previously by Dupont et al. (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that was based on a binding assay with radiolabeled choline. Using the fluorescence-based equilibrium binding assays, we also determined the KD for ACh; a value of 100 ± 12 μm was derived (Fig. 2B). This KD agrees reasonably well with that reported by Dupont et al. (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (KD = 145 μm) based upon binding studies with radiolabeled ACh and competition experiments. Hence the data reported by Dupont et al. (8Dupont L. Garcia I. Poggi M.C. Alloing G. Mandon K. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5988-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the results reported here clearly establish ChoX as a binding protein for both choline (high affinity ligand) and ACh (medium affinity ligand), respectively. Crystallization of ChoX and the Overall Fold of the Ligand-bound Protein—Crystals of the ChoX-choline complex were obtained by the hanging drop method at 277 K as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The crystal structure was solved at 2.9-Å resolution by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of an Se-Met derivative crystal. The structure of native ChoX in complex with choline was subsequently solved by molecular replacement at a resolution of 1.9 Å. Data statistics, refinement details, and model content are summarized in Table 1. The asymmetric unit contained two protomers. Because the r.m.s.d. of the two protomers is smaller than 0.5 Å for 288 Cα atoms, we will restrict the description of the overall ChoX structure and the architecture of the ligand-binding site to only one protomer. The overall structure of ChoX with bound choline (Fig. 3) shows a protein fold that is typical for bacterial SBPs (9Davidson A.L. Dassa E. Orelle C. Chen J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1970755788,"The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin caused growth arrest in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells; however, long-term treatment induced resistance to the drug. The aim of this study was to investigate methods that can overcome this resistance. Here, we show that rapamycin treatment stimulated androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, whereas suppression of AR activity with the antiandrogen bicalutamide sensitized androgen-dependent, as well as AR-sensitive androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, to growth inhibition by rapamycin. Further, the combination of rapamycin and bicalutamide, but not the individual drugs, induced significant levels of apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The net effect of rapamycin is determined by its individual effects on the mTOR complexes mTORC1 (mTOR/raptor/GbetaL) and mTORC2 (mTOR/rictor/sin1/GbetaL). Inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by rapamycin-induced apoptosis, whereas rapamycin-stimulation of AR transcriptional activity resulted from the inhibition of mTORC1, but not mTORC2. The effect of rapamycin on AR transcriptional activity was mediated by the phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, which also partially mediated apoptosis induced by rapamycin and bicalutamide. These results indicate the presence of two parallel cell-survival pathways in prostate cancer cells: a strong Akt-independent, but rapamycin-sensitive pathway downstream of mTORC1, and an AR-dependent pathway downstream of mTORC2 and Akt, that is stimulated by mTORC1 inhibition. Thus, the combination of rapamycin and bicalutamide induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by simultaneously inhibiting both pathways and hence would be of therapeutic value in prostate cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2010326322,"The Janus-associated kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. We have characterized a novel small molecule JAK2 inhibitor, AZ960, and used it as a tool to investigate the consequences of JAK2 V617F inhibition in the SET-2 cell line. AZ960 inhibits JAK2 kinase with a K(i) of 0.00045 microm in vitro and treatment of TEL-JAK2 driven Ba/F3 cells with AZ960 blocked STAT5 phosphorylation and potently inhibited cell proliferation (GI(50)=0.025 microm). AZ960 demonstrated selectivity for TEL-JAK2-driven STAT5 phosphorylation and cell proliferation when compared with cell lines driven by similar fusions of the other JAK kinase family members. In the SET-2 human megakaryoblastic cell line, heterozygous for the JAK2 V617F allele, inhibition of JAK2 resulted in decreased STAT3/5 phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation (GI(50)=0.033 microm) predominately through the induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. We provide evidence that JAK2 inhibition induces apoptosis by direct and indirect regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. Inhibition of JAK2 blocked BCL-XL mRNA expression resulting in a reduction of BCL-xL protein levels. Additionally, inhibition of JAK2 resulted in decreased PIM1 and PIM2 mRNA expression. Decreased PIM1 mRNA corresponded with a decrease in Pim1 protein levels and inhibition of BAD phosphorylation at Ser(112). Finally, small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of BCL-xL resulted in apoptotic cell death similar to the phenotype observed following JAK2 inhibition. These results suggest a model in which JAK2 promotes cell survival by signaling through the Pim/BAD/BCL-xL pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2020639373,"De-Xue Fu et al. present a novel approach to radiotherapy of herpesvirus-associated tumors by first inducing the expression of viral thymidine kinase by pretreatment with bortezomib and then by administering a radiopharmaceutical that targets the viral enzyme. The authors show that this approach is effective in lymphoid and epithelial malignancies in several xenograft mouse models of human tumors. We investigated the possibility of using a pharmacologic agent to modulate viral gene expression to target radiotherapy to tumor tissue. In a mouse xenograft model, we had previously shown targeting of [125I]2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-β-D-5-iodouracil-arabinofuranoside ([125I]FIAU) to tumors engineered to express the Epstein-Barr virus thymidine kinase (EBV-TK). Here we extend those results to targeting of a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical [131I]FIAU to slow or stop tumor growth or to achieve tumor regression. These outcomes were achieved in xenografts with tumors that constitutively expressed the EBV-TK. With naturally infected EBV tumor cell lines (Burkitt's lymphoma and gastric carcinoma), activation of viral gene expression by pretreatment with bortezomib was required. Marked changes in tumor growth could also be achieved in naturally infected Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus tumors after pretreatment with bortezomib. Bortezomib-induced enzyme-targeted radiation therapy illustrates the possibility of pharmacologically modulating tumor gene expression to result in targeted radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2041875417,"Anti-HIV microbicides are being investigated in clinical trials and understanding how promising strategies work, coincident with demonstrating efficacy in vivo, is central to advancing new generation microbicides. We evaluated Carraguard and a new generation Carraguard-based formulation containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) MIV-150 (PC-817). Since dendritic cells (DCs) are believed to be important in HIV transmission, the formulations were tested for the ability to limit DC-driven infection in vitro versus vaginal infection of macaques with RT-SHIV (SIVmac239 bearing HIV reverse transcriptase). Carraguard showed limited activity against cell-free and mature DC-driven RT-SHIV infections and, surprisingly, low doses of Carraguard enhanced infection. However, nanomolar amounts of MIV-150 overcame enhancement and blocked DC-transmitted infection. In contrast, Carraguard impeded infection of immature DCs coincident with DC maturation. Despite this variable activity in vitro, Carraguard and PC-817 prevented vaginal transmission of RT-SHIV when applied 30 min prior to challenge. PC-817 appeared no more effective than Carraguard in vivo, due to the limited activity of a single dose of MIV-150 and the dominant barrier effect of Carraguard. However, 3 doses of MIV-150 in placebo gel at and around challenge limited vaginal infection, demonstrating the potential activity of a topically applied NNRTI. These data demonstrate discordant observations when comparing in vitro and in vivo efficacy of Carraguard-based microbicides, highlighting the difficulties in testing putative anti-viral strategies in vitro to predict in vivo activity. This work also underscores the potential of Carraguard-based formulations for the delivery of anti-viral drugs to prevent vaginal HIV infection."

However, the extent to which these changes persist and the role they have in the expression of memory remain unclear. We found that in vitro analogs of operant conditioning produced a long-term (24 h) increase in the excitability of an identified neuron (B51) that is critical for the expression of feeding in Aplysia. This increase in excitability, which was cAMP dependent, contributed to the associative modification of the feeding circuitry, providing a mechanism for long-term memory."

https://openalex.org/W2033898397,"Trimethylguanosine synthase (Tgs1) is the enzyme that converts standard m(7)G caps to the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) caps characteristic of spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs. Fungi and mammalian somatic cells are able to grow in the absence of Tgs1 and TMG caps, suggesting that an essential function of the TMG cap might be obscured by functional redundancy. A systematic screen in budding yeast identified nonessential genes that, when deleted, caused synthetic growth defects with tgs1Delta. The Tgs1 interaction network embraced proteins implicated in small nuclear ribonucleoprotein function and spliceosome assembly, including Mud2, Nam8, Brr1, Lea1, Ist3, Isy1, Cwc21, and Bud13. Complementation of the synthetic lethality of mud2Delta tgs1Delta and nam8Delta tgs1Delta strains by wild-type TGS1, but not by catalytically defective mutants, indicated that the TMG cap is essential for mitotic growth when redundant splicing factors are missing. Our genetic analysis also highlighted synthetic interactions of Tgs1 with proteins implicated in RNA end processing and decay (Pat1, Lsm1, and Trf4) and regulation of polymerase II transcription (Rpn4, Spt3, Srb2, Soh1, Swr1, and Htz1). We find that the C-terminal domain of human Tgs1 can function in lieu of the yeast protein in vivo. We present a biochemical characterization of the human Tgs1 guanine-N2 methyltransferase reaction and identify individual amino acids required for methyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1993532741,"The 5′ ends of all picornaviral RNAs are linked covalently to the genome-encoded peptide, VPg (or 3B). VPg linkage is thought to occur in two steps. First, VPg serves as a primer for production of diuridylylated VPg (VPg-pUpU) in a reaction catalyzed by the viral polymerase that is templated by an RNA element (oriI).

The picornavirus family of viruses causes a wide variety of diseases in humans and animals (1Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses.

Poliovirus (PV), 3The abbreviations used are: PV, poliovirus; NTR, nontranslated region; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide; CRE, cis-acting replication element. 3The abbreviations used are: PV, poliovirus; NTR, nontranslated region; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide; CRE, cis-acting replication element. the causative agent of poliomyelitis, is the most extensively studied member of this family and has proven to be a useful model system for understanding picornavirus molecular biology, including genome replication (1Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2002Crossref Google Scholar). PV is a nonenveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity that is ∼7500 nt in length. As shown in Fig. 1A, the genome encodes a single open reading frame flanked by 5′- and 3′-nontranslated regions (NTRs). The genome contains a 22-amino acid peptide (referred to as either VPg, 3B or primer for RNA synthesis) covalently linked to its 5′ end and is polyadenylated at its 3′ end. Translation of the genome is initiated from an internal ribosome entry site located in the 5′-NTR, producing a 247-kDa polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally processed by the virus-encoded 2A, 3C, and 3CD proteases (1Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC2002Crossref Google Scholar). Although polyprotein processing ultimately yields a set of processed end products, processing intermediates will form during the course of an infection, greatly increasing the functional proteome of the virus. Processing intermediates located in the P2 (e.g. 2ABC, 2BC, etc.) and P3 regions of the polyprotein are likely important for genome replication. Our laboratory has been quite interested in defining the molecular details of VPg attachment to the 5′ end of picornaviral RNAs (2Pathak H.B. Ghosh S.K. Roberts A.W. Sharma S.D. Yoder J.D.

This reaction is thought to occur in two independent half-reactions catalyzed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3Dpol. First, VPg is uridylylated to produce VPg-pUpU; second, VPg-pUpU serves as a primer for full-length RNA synthesis (1Semler B.L. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses.

In the presence of UTP, Tyr-3 hydroxyl of VPg is used as a nucleophile to form VPg-pU, the 3′-OH of which, in turn, serves as the nucleophile to form VPg-pUpU (step 5) (13Paul A.V. Yin J. Mugavero J.

However, VPg uridylylation occurs 10–50-fold slower in vitro than necessary to support the rate constant (∼0.1/s) for initiation calculated from biological data (see Ref. 21Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, this model assumes that the processed VPg peptide is the primer employed in vivo, which may not be the case. Finally, this model does not provide any hints of how a VPg-pUpU molecule produced in the middle of the genome could be transferred to the 3′ end of plus- and/or minus-strand RNA for production of the complementary RNA strand. Because the end products of polyprotein processing may not be the forms of the protein employed for assembly and/or function of the genome-replication complexes in vivo, it is possible that the use of polyprotein processing intermediates may be essential to recapitulate VPg uridylylation in vitro that occurs on a biologically relevant time scale, providing additional insight into the mechanism of this reaction that is absolutely essential for picornavirus genome replication. In this study, we show that P3 precursor proteins containing VPg at the amino terminus (3BC and 3BCD) can be uridylylated in vitro. 3BC-containing precursors bind to oriI more efficiently than processed proteins and serve as VPg donors that can be recruited to and/or retained in the uridylylation complex better than processed VPg. We demonstrate an optimal affinity of precursor binding to oriI for maximal accumulation of uridylylated product in the steady state, suggesting formation and/or collapse as a rate-limiting step for uridylylation in vitro. The use of precursor proteins during replication in cells was queried by preventing the production of processed VPg. Preventing VPg formation in cells is not lethal and leads to production of 3BC-linked RNA. Therefore, processed VPg is not essential for uridylylation and/or full-length plus- and/or minus-strand RNA synthesis in vivo. Analysis of the polyprotein processing profile of the VPg-processing-defective mutant in cell-free extracts uncovered two pathways of P3 precursor processing, major and minor, and only the major pathway was perturbed. We propose that the minor pathway is responsible for production of proteins (processing intermediates) required for uridylylation and RNA synthesis. These studies provide new insight into the mechanism of VPg uridylylation and suggest mechanisms for transfer of the diuridylylated protein primer from the middle of the genome to the 3′ end of plus- and/or minus-strand RNA.

Western Blot Analysis of Replicon Proteins—Cells were transfected with replicon RNA and incubated at 34 °C for 20 h. Cells were harvested and lysed, and Western blot analysis was performed as described in the supplemental material. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA isolation for Northern blot analysis was performed as follows. HeLa cells (6 × 106) were transfected by using electroporation as described above with 25 μg of the indicated subgenomic RNAs (5 μg/1.2 × 106 cells). Cells were suspended in 30 ml of normal growth media and incubated at 34 °C. Total RNA was then isolated from the cells at the indicated times post-transfection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 ml), and lysed in TRIzol reagent (1 ml). Lysed cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and chloroform (0.2 ml) was added. The samples were vortexed vigorously (15 s) and incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Isopropyl alcohol (0.5 ml) was added to the aqueous phase for each sample and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethyl alcohol (1 ml) and then dissolved in water (50 μl). Concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The quality of the RNA was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration of all of the RNAs was normalized to the 18 S rRNA band by using the Typhoon 8600 scanner in the fluorescence mode. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (5 μg) was separated on a 0.6% agarose gel containing 0.8 m formaldehyde. The gel was then washed twice in water for 30 min each and then in 20× SSC (3 m sodium chloride, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.2) for 30 min. RNA was transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond XL, GE Healthcare) by using overnight capillary blotting using 10× SSC as the transfer buffer. RNA was cross-linked to the membrane by using a Stratalinker 2400 UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The membrane was dried and washed twice in wash buffer (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 65 °C for 30 min each. Prehybridization was performed in modified Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) for 4 h at 65°C. Hybridization probes were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice for 1 min prior to addition to the membrane (1 × 107 cpm). Hybridization was performed in the modified Church buffer for 16 h at 65 °C. The membrane was washed twice in wash buffer for 20 min at 65 °C and one time at room temperature. The membrane was dried, wrapped in plastic wrap, and exposed to a phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon 8600 scanner in the storage phosphor mode and quantified by using ImageQuant software. Hybridization probes were made by PCR using oligonucleotides 16 and 18 (supplemental Table S1) and pRLuc as template. [α-32P]dATP (1 mCi/ml and 3000 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) was included in the PCR; the concentration of cold dNTPs was 3 mm for dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP and 500 μm for dATP. The quality of the PCR product was assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Scintillation counting was performed to determine the counts/min for the probe. Immunoprecipitation of RNA—Total RNA was prepared, and concentration was measured as described above from HeLa cells transfected with the wild-type, Gly-Gly mutant, or Y3F/Gly-Gly mutant RNA. Total RNA was aliquoted equally into three microcentrifuge tubes (30 μg per aliquot), and IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) was added to a final volume of 500 μl. Purified polyclonal anti-VPg, anti-3C, or anti-NS5A sera were added to each tube. The mixtures were rotated at room temperature for 45 min. Protein A magnetic beads (New England Biolabs, 50 μl) were conditioned by washing twice in IP buffer and then suspended in IP buffer (50 μl). These conditioned beads were added to total RNA and anti-sera mixture and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. The beads were collected by a magnetic stand (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) and washed four times with IP buffer followed by two times with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). For Northern blotting, 5 μl of water and 15 μl of formaldehyde loading dye (20 mm MOPS, 63.3% formamide, 23.3% formaldehyde, 5 mm sodium acetate, 4.3 mm EDTA, 0.066% bromphenol blue, 0.066% xylene cyanol) were added to the beads and incubated for 15 min at 65 °C. The beads were then pelleted and the entire volume loaded on a denaturing gel for Northern blot analysis as described above. Generation and Purification of Polyclonal PV VPg, PV 3C, PV 3D, and HCV NS5A Antisera—Polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against viral proteins PV VPg, PV 3C-His, PV 3D, and HCV NS5A-His were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Affi-Gel blue (Bio-Rad) column purification as described in detail in the supplemental material. HeLa/S10 Translation/Replication Reactions—Reactions were performed as described previously (22Barton D.J. Black E.P. Flanegan J.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5516-5527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (method 3) with the following modifications. Nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (10% v/v) was used rather than initiation factors for both the translation and replication reactions. [α-32P]UTP rather than [α-32P]CTP was used for the replication reactions. Radioimmunoprecipitations were performed as follows. A 100-μl in vitro translation reaction set up in the presence of 1 mm guanidine HCl containing 50 μCi of [35S]methionine was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 3 h after which 8 μl were removed into 80 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer to serve as the translation control. 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) was then added to the remainder of the reaction, and 100 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-G-agarose in RIPA buffer was added to preclear the lysate. This was rotated at room temperature for 15–30 min. Th"
https://openalex.org/W2055222402,"Raf kinases are essential for regulating cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which Raf is activated are still incompletely understood. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in Raf activation in response to mitogens. The present study characterizes phosphorylation of Ser338, a crucial event for Raf-1 activation. Here we report that mutation of Lys375 to Met diminishes phosphorylation of Ser338 on both wild type Raf-1 in cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and a constitutively active mutant in which Tyr340/Tyr341 are replaced by 2 aspartic acids, a conserved substitution present in natural B-Raf. The loss of Ser338 phosphorylation in these Raf mutants is not engendered by a mutation-induced conformational change, inasmuch as mutation of another site (Ser471 to Ala) in the activation segment also abolishes Ser338 phosphorylation, whereas both the kinase-dead mutants of Raf-1 are phosphorylated well by active Pak1. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser338 is inhibited by Sorafenib, a Raf kinase inhibitor, but not by the MEK inhibitor U0126. Interestingly, a kinase-dead mutation and Sorafenib also markedly reduce phosphorylation of Ser445 on B-Raf, a site equivalent to Raf-1 Ser338. Finally, our data reveal that Ser338 is phosphorylated on inactive Raf-1 by an active mutant of Raf-1 when they are dimerized in cells and that artificial dimerization of Raf-1 causes Ser338 phosphorylation, accompanied by activation of ERK1/2. Altogether, our data suggest that Ser338 on Raf-1 is autophosphorylated in response to mitogens."
https://openalex.org/W1978518472,"Substantial evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction plays a critical role in atherogenesis. We previously demonstrated that apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a); the distinguishing protein component of the atherothrombotic risk factor lipoprotein(a)) elicits rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, characterized by increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation via a Rho/Rho kinase-dependent signaling pathway. Apo(a) contains kringle (K)IV and KV domains similar to those in plasminogen: apo(a) contains 10 types of plasminogen KIV-like sequences, followed by sequences homologous to the plasminogen KV and protease domains. Several of the apo(a) kringles contain lysine-binding sites (LBS) that have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenicity of Lp(a). Here we demonstrate that apo(a)-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction is mediated via a Rho/Rho kinase-dependent signaling pathway that results in increased MYPT1 phosphorylation and hence decreased MLC phosphatase activity, thus leading to an increase in MLC phosphorylation, stress fiber formation, cell contraction, and permeability. In addition, studies using recombinant apo(a) variants indicated that these effects of apo(a) are dependent on sequences within the C-terminal half of the apo(a) molecule, specifically, the strong LBS in KIV(10). In parallel experiments, the apo(a)-induced effects were completely abolished by treatment of the cells with the lysine analogue epsilon-aminocaproic acid and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632. Taken together, our findings indicate that the strong LBS in apo(a) KIV(10) mediates all of our observed effects of apo(a) on human umbilical vein endothelial cell barrier dysfunction. Studies are ongoing to further dissect the molecular basis of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1991459080,"The abundance of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor is regulated through hydroxylation of its α-subunits by a family of prolyl-hydroxylases (PHD1–3). Enzymatic activity of these PHDs is O<sub>2</sub>-dependent, which enables PHDs to act as cellular O<sub>2</sub> sensor enzymes. Herein we studied endogenous PHD activity that was induced in cells grown under hypoxia or in the presence of nitric oxide. Under such conditions nuclear extracts contained much higher PHD activity than the respective cytoplasmic extracts. Although PHD1–3 were abundant in both compartments, knockdown experiments for each isoenzyme revealed that nuclear PHD activity was only due to PHD2. Maximal PHD2 activity was found between 120 and 210 μm O<sub>2</sub>. PHD2 activity was strongly decreased below 100 μm O<sub>2</sub> with a half-maximum activity at 53 ± 13 μm O<sub>2</sub> for the cytosolic and 54 ± 10 μm O<sub>2</sub> for nuclear PHD2 matching the physiological O<sub>2</sub> concentration within most cells. Our data suggest a role for PHD2 as a decisive oxygen sensor of the hypoxia-inducible factor degradation pathway within the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2085312956,"Osteoporosis, the most prevalent metabolic bone disease among older people, increases risk for low trauma hip fractures (HF) that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Hip bone size (BS) has been identified as one of the key measurable risk factors for HF. Although hip BS is highly genetically determined, genetic factors underlying the trait are still poorly defined. Here, we performed the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hip BS interrogating approximately 380,000 SNPs on the Affymetrix platform in 1,000 homogeneous unrelated Caucasian subjects, including 501 females and 499 males. We identified a gene, PLCL1 (phospholipase c-like 1), that had four SNPs associated with hip BS at, or approaching, a genome-wide significance level in our female subjects; the most significant SNP, rs7595412, achieved a p value of 3.72x10(-7). The gene's importance to hip BS was replicated using the Illumina genotyping platform in an independent UK cohort containing 1,216 Caucasian females. Two SNPs of the PLCL1 gene, rs892515 and rs9789480, surrounded by the four SNPs identified in our GWAS, achieved p values of 8.62x10(-3) and 2.44x10(-3), respectively, for association with hip BS. Imputation analyses on our GWAS and the UK samples further confirmed the replication signals; eight SNPs of the gene achieved combined imputed p values<10(-5) in the two samples. The PLCL1 gene's relevance to HF was also observed in a Chinese sample containing 403 females, including 266 with HF and 177 control subjects. A SNP of the PLCL1 gene, rs3771362 that is only approximately 0.6 kb apart from the most significant SNP detected in our GWAS (rs7595412), achieved a p value of 7.66x10(-3) (odds ratio = 0.26) for association with HF. Additional biological support for the role of PLCL1 in BS comes from previous demonstrations that the PLCL1 protein inhibits IP3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-mediated calcium signaling, an important pathway regulating mechanical sensing of bone cells. Our findings suggest that PLCL1 is a novel gene associated with variation in hip BS, and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of HF."
https://openalex.org/W2074411498,"The tumor suppressor BRCA1 is mutated in a high percentage of familial breast and ovarian cancer, but our understanding of its mechanisms of action remains incomplete. We report here that glucose-regulated protein (GRP)-78, a critical regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a novel downstream target of BRCA1. We showed that overexpression of wild-type BRCA1 suppressed the expression of GRP78, whereas expression of mutant BRCA1 gene or targeted inhibition of endogenous BRCA1 using small-interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced GRP78 expression. Knockdown of BRCA1 also led to induction of other components of UPR, such as GRP94 and CHOP. Consistent with a role of BRCA1 knockdown in mediating cell survival, forced expression of GRP78 stimulated cell proliferation and prevented apoptosis, including that induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and chemotherapy, in ovarian OVCAR-3 and breast MCF-7 cancer cells. Overexpression of wild-type BRCA1 could increase the apoptosis of GRP78-overexpressing cells. Conversely, knockdown GRP78 by siRNA sensitized ovarian and breast cancer cells to apoptosis. This effect was reduced when the expression of BRCA1 was simultaneously knockdown by siRNA, indicating that BRCA1 also negatively regulates GRP78-mediated cell survival and resistance to apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2158780885,"A double mutant cycle (DMC) approach was employed to estimate the effect of temperature on the contribution of two highly conserved salt bridges to protein stability in the hyperthermophilic protein Ssh10b. The coupling free energy were 2.4 ± 0.4 kJ/mol at 298 K and 2.2 ± 0.4 kJ/mol at 353 K for Glu-54/Arg-57, and 6.0 ± 0.2 kJ/mol at 298 K and 5.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol at 353 K for Glu-36/Lys-68. The stability free energy of Ssh10b decrease greatly with increasing temperature, while the direct contribution of these two salt bridges to protein stability remain almost constant, providing evidence supporting the theoretical prediction that salt bridges are extremely resilient to temperature increases and thus are specially suited to improving protein stability at high temperatures. The reason for the difference in coupling free energy between salt bridges Glu-54/Arg-57 and Glu-36/Lys-68 is discussed. Comparing our results with published DMC data for the contribution of salt bridges to stability in other proteins, we found that the energy contribution of a salt bridge formed by two charged residues far apart in the primary sequence is higher than that of those formed between two very close ones. Implications of this finding are useful for engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability. A double mutant cycle (DMC) approach was employed to estimate the effect of temperature on the contribution of two highly conserved salt bridges to protein stability in the hyperthermophilic protein Ssh10b.

The stability free energy of Ssh10b decrease greatly with increasing temperature, while the direct contribution of these two salt bridges to protein stability remain almost constant, providing evidence supporting the theoretical prediction that salt bridges are extremely resilient to temperature increases and thus are specially suited to improving protein stability at high temperatures. The reason for the difference in coupling free energy between salt bridges Glu-54/Arg-57 and Glu-36/Lys-68 is discussed. Comparing our results with published DMC data for the contribution of salt bridges to stability in other proteins, we found that the energy contribution of a salt bridge formed by two charged residues far apart in the primary sequence is higher than that of those formed between two very close ones. Implications of this finding are useful for engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability. Hyperthermophiles are a group of microorganisms with an optimum growth temperature between 80 and 100 °C. Remarkably, hyperthermophilic proteins and their mesophilic homologues typically show 40–85% sequence similarity, and their three-dimensional structures are highly superimposable (1Ladenstein R. Antranikian G. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 37-85PubMed Google Scholar, 2Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These facts indicate that the molecular basis of their extreme thermal tolerance is associated with the delicate balance of non-covalent interactions. Considerable efforts have been invested in recent years to understand how proteins from hyperthermophiles can maintain stability at high temperatures. Several factors, such as improvement in packing density, strengthening of hydrophobic cores, and decreased length of surface loops, are thought to correlate with the increased thermostability of hyperthermophilic proteins (5Britton K.L.

The most commonly cited feature, however, is an increased number of salt bridges and salt bridge networks distributed over the protein surface (10Yip K.S. Stillman T.J. Britton K.L. Artymiuk P.J.

A comparison of 13 structural parameters derived from the tertiary structures of 64 proteins from mesophiles and 29 proteins from thermophiles and hyperthermophiles revealed that the only feature shared in common is an increase in the number of salt bridges with increasing growth temperatures (16Szilágyi A. Závodszky P. Structure. 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, experimental estimates of the free energy contribution of salt bridges to protein stability have led to conflicting conclusions, ranging from them having a stabilizing, insignificant, or even a destabilizing effect (17Marqusee S.

Biol. 1995; 2: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The association of two charged residues to form a salt bridge is thought to incur a substantial desolvation penalty that is seldom completely compensated for by favorable interactions within the salt bridge and the rest of the protein (24Hendsch Z.S. Tidor B. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 25Elcock A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 26Thomas A.S. Elcock A.H. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A continuum solvation model was used to investigate how this same argument applies at the high temperatures hyperthermophiles experience and predicted that at such high temperatures the desolvation penalty for the formation of a salt bridge is markedly reduced (25Elcock A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, molecular simulations suggest salt bridges are extremely resilient to temperature increases and thus are specially suited to promoting protein stability at high temperatures (26Thomas A.S. Elcock A.H. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, attempts to obtain thermodynamic information at high temperature have been plagued by irreversibility of unfolding and/or inaccessibility of the unfolding transition to physical measurements. So far there are no reports of experiments to measure the stability contribution of salt bridges at high temperatures and to provide evidence for these theoretical predictions. The DNA-binding protein Ssh10b from the archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae is a member of the Sac10b family that is thought to be involved in chromosomal organization or DNA repair/recombination. Ssh10b is a highly thermostable dimeric protein composed of two identical subunits, each monomer consisting of 97 amino acid residues with no disulfide bonds (27Xue H. Guo R. Wen Y. Liu D. Huang L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3929-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Xu S. Qin S. Pan X.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ssh10b constitutes about 4–5% of total cellular protein, and binds dsDNA without apparent sequence specificity. Ssh10b is also capable of constraining negative DNA supercoils in a temperature-dependent fashion (29Cui Q. Tong Y. Xue H. Huang L. Feng Y. Wang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51015-51022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of Ssh10b reveals that the monomer is a mixed α/β structure comprised of four β-strands and two α-helices (Fig. 1), each monomer containing four isolated salt bridges: Glu-36/Lys-68, Glu-54/Arg-57, Asp-63/Lys-97, Glu-66/Arg-95, and an ion-pair network, Lys-40/Glu-91/Arg-71/Glu-69 (30Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), evidently more than the average of about 5 salt bridges per 150 amino acid residues (31Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 867-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). However, only the Glu-36/Lys-68 and Glu-54/Arg-57 salt bridges are highly conserved across the Sac10b family (Fig. 2). All of these salt bridges and ion-pair networks are surface-exposed, located on the back of the Ssh10b dimer and thought to play an important role in bracing and stabilizing the structure (30Wardleworth B.N.

A particularly useful approach is to employ a method called double mutant cycle (DMC) 2The abbreviation used is: DMC, double mutant cycle. analysis to obtain quantitative information about the stability contribution of a salt bridge by mutating the residues involved separately and concurrently (32Serrano L.

A DMC gives the so-called coupling free energy of a salt bridge associated with the direct interaction between the two charged residues under ideal conditions. In the present work, we analyzed the net strength of the two highly conserved salt bridges, Glu-36/Lys-68 and Glu-54/Arg-57, by DMC analysis. The coupling free energy were 2.4 ± 0.4 kJ/mol at 298 K and 2.2 ± 0.4 kJ/mol at 353 K for Glu-54/Arg-57, and 6.0 ± 0.2 kJ/mol at 298 K and 5.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol at 353 K for Glu-36/Lys-68. The stability free energy of Ssh10b decrease greatly with increasing temperature, while the direct contribution of these two salt bridges to protein stability remain almost constant, providing evidence supporting the theoretical prediction that salt bridge interactions are extremely resilient to temperature increases and thus are specially suited to improving protein stability at high temperatures (26Thomas A.S. Elcock A.H. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Ssh10b and Its Variants—All expression plasmids of Ssh10b variants were constructed from the parental plasmid pET11a-ssh10b. All mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis through overlap extension PCR. The construct for each variant was verified by DNA sequencing. Expression plasmids of Ssh10b and its variants were transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) host strain. For protein expression, a single colony was grown in 100 ml of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin by shaking (∼220 rpm) at 37 °C overnight. Cultures were diluted 1:50 in fresh LB antibiotic-containing media and shaken for about 3 h at 37 °C. Target protein expression was then induced at A600 = 0.8–1.0 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm, and growth was allowed to continue for about 5 h at 37 °C with constant shaking. After harvesting by centrifugation (4,000 rpm for 30 min), cell pellets from 1-liter cultures were re-suspended in 25 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and then disrupted by ultrasonication on ice. The lysate was maintained at 60 °C for 20 min to precipitate the E. coli proteins, and then centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 20-ml Source 30S column, which had been equilibrated with buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a 0–50% gradient (120 ml) of buffer B (1.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5). Fractions containing the target protein were identified by 15% SDS-PAGE and dialyzed overnight against buffer A. After centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a 6-ml Resource-S column, which had been equilibrated with buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a 0–50% gradient (60 ml) of buffer B. Fractions containing the target protein were identified by 15% SDS-PAGE, dialyzed overnight against deionized water, and then lyophilized. Unfolding Studies—Unfolding of Ssh10b and its variants was studied by taking circular dichroism (CD) measurements with a π*-pistar 180 spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd, UK), performed in buffer H (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), at a protein monomer concentration of about 25 μm. The CD signal was monitored using a rectangular quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. For urea-induced unfolding, the urea solution was freshly prepared on the day of use. The samples containing various concentrations of urea were equilibrated at 25 °C overnight and then measured by far-UV CD at 222 nm. For heat-induced unfolding, each sample was heated from 40 to 98 °C and then cooled from 98 to 40 °C using stepwise changes of 2 °C, and the CD signal was recorded after equilibration for 2 min at each temperature point. All unfolding experiments were repeated 3–4 times. Analysis of the Denaturation Data—Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that both denaturant- and heat-induced unfolding of Ssh10b are fully reversible and follow a two-state mechanism involving a native dimer and two denatured monomers (28Xu S. Qin S. Pan X.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this work the thermodynamic properties of Ssh10b and its variants were calculated assuming a two-state denaturation process in Reaction 1. N2Kobs↔2 U REACTION 1 The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) and the corresponding free energy change (ΔG) at temperature T or denaturant concentration [D] were calculated according to Equations 1 and 2 (28Xu S. Qin S. Pan X.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Kobs=2×PtyN+mNT[D]−yU+mUT[D]×[yN+mNT[D]−y]2y−yU+mUT[D](Eq. 1) ΔG=−RT ln Kobs (Eq. 1) where Pt is the total protein concentration in monomer units; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; y is the experimentally measured signal value at a given temperature (T) or given denaturant concentration ([D]); yN and yU are the intercepts; and mN and mU are the slopes of the native and unfolded baselines, respectively. According to the linear free energy model (37Schellman J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 115-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 38Chen B.L. Schellman J.A.

For thermal unfolding, assuming that the heat capacity change (ΔCp) between the native and unfolded states of the system is relatively independent of temperature, gives us Equation 4 (41Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 42Freire E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 144-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), ΔG(T)=−RT ln(Kobs)=ΔHm−TΔSm+ΔCp((T−Tm)+T ln(1−T−TmT)) (Eq. 4) where ΔHm and ΔSm are the enthalpy and entropy changes, respectively, of the protein at the transition midpoint, where T = Tm. Within the transition range, where T × ln(1 - (T-Tm)/T) ∼ Tm - T, Equation 4 can be simplified to the van't Hoff plot in Equation 5. ΔG(T)=−RT ln(Kobs)=ΔHm−TΔSm(Eq. 5) The temperature of the transition midpoint (Tm) can be calculated according to Equation 6. Tm=ΔHmΔSm−R×ln(Pt)(Eq. 6) The uncertainties of the data were represented as two-sided 95% confidence intervals, which are given by Equation 7, b±tv,0.975×se(b)(Eq. 7) where b is the data (ΔG, ΔH, and Tm, etc.), se(b) is the standard error, tv,0.975 is the value of the t distribution with the number of degrees of freedom v for the two-sided 95% confidence interval. The direct stability contribution of each salt bridge was represented by using the average values of the coupling free energy of the four different DMCs and uncertainties estimated by Equation 7. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Ssh10b and Its Variants—Eight mutants for each salt bridge (Ala-36/Lys-68, Gln-36/Lys-68, Glu-36/Ala-68, Glu-36/Leu-68, Ala-36/Ala-68, Ala-36/Leu-68, Gln-36/Ala-68, and Gln-36/Leu-68 for salt bridge Glu-36/Lys-68; Ala-54/Arg-57, Gln-54/Arg-57, Glu-54/Ala-57, Glu-54/Leu-57, Ala-54/Ala-57, Ala-54/Leu-57, Gln-54/Ala-57, and Gln-54/Leu-57 for salt bridge Glu-54/Arg-57) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type Ssh10b and its variants were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified to homogeneity. Protein purity was higher than 95% as confirmed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Unfolding Studies—Ssh10b is resistant to urea-induced denaturation in phosphate buffer (28Xu S. Qin S. Pan X.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but is more susceptible to urea-induced denaturation in monovalent ion buffers (43Mao Y.J. Sheng X.R. Pan X.M. BMC Biochemistry. 2007; 8: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). And for any one of above proteins, when the urea-denatured protein solution was diluted to a lower concentration of denaturant, the CD spectrum of the renatured protein was identical to that of the native protein, indicating that the urea-induced unfolding processes of Ssh10b and its variants are fully reversible (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows representative urea-induced unfolding profiles for Ssh10b and its partial variants in buffer H. The linear free energy model was used to analyze the urea-induced unfolding profiles. Results are presented in Table 1 and reveal that the difference in stability between different variants is marked: relative to the Ssh10b wild-type, some variants show an increase in stability free energy at 298 K (ΔG(298)) of up to 7 kJ/mol, while others show a decrease in ΔG(298) of more than 10 kJ/mol.TABLE 1Parameters obtained from the analysis of unfolding experiments ΔG(298) was calculated from the results of urea-induced unfolding, and other parameters were calculated from the results of heat-induced unfolding.

Qin S. Pan X.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but we found that its thermostability decrease greatly in a monovalent ion buffer resulting in accessibility of the heat-induced unfolding transition to physical measurement. The heat-induced unfolding and refolding curves of Ssh10b and its variants in buffer H monitored by far-UV CD at 222 nm are nearly superimposable, and for each one the CD spectrum of the refolded protein is nearly identical to that of the native protein (data not shown), indicating that the processes of heat-induced unfolding of Ssh10b and its variants are fully reversible. Fig. 4 shows representative heat-induced unfolding profiles for Ssh10b and its partial variants in buffer H. The heat-induced unfolding profiles of Ssh10b and its variants were analyzed by using the two-state denaturation model described under “Experimental Procedures”: the parameters ΔHm and ΔSm were obtained by fitting Kobs to the van't Hoff plot, the parameter Tm was then obtained by substituting ΔHm and ΔSm into Equation 6. The Tm values of these variants were all around 353 K, and so the stability free energy values of these proteins at 353 K (ΔG(353)) were calculated using the van't Hoff plot (Table 1). As with the results for urea-induced unfolding, the difference between different variants in stability free energy at 353 K was also marked: the difference in ΔG(353) between mutants and the wild-type ranged from -8.3 to 7.5 kJ/mol. Estimating the Contribution of Salt Bridges to Stability by Using DMC Analysis—DMC analysis was used to estimate the strength of the two conserved salt bridges (Glu-36/Lys-68 and Glu-54/Arg-57) in protein Ssh10b. Fig. 5 shows a general scheme for a DMC consisting of two single and one double mutant. A thermodynamic cycle is set up between the wild type, each of the single mutants, and the double mutant. The effects of single amino acid substitutions of each residue involved in the salt bridge and the effect of simultaneous replacement at both positions on the stability of the protein were measured. If the two charged residues do not interact with each other, the effect of substitution of either of the two residues will be independent of the replacement of the other, in other words, the effect on protein stability resulting from their simultaneous replacement will be equal to the sum of the effects of the two single mutations. By contrast, if the two residues do interact with each other, the effect of substituting either of the two residues will depend on the substitution of the other. By using the DMC method, the so-called coupling free energy of a salt bridge can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 5, the coupling free energy (ΔΔGcoup) is defined in Equations 8, 9, 10, 11 (44Bosshard H.R. Marti D.N. Jelesarov I. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). ΔΔGCoup=ΔΔGwt→dm−ΔΔGwt→m1−ΔΔGwt→m2 (Eq. 8) where, ΔΔGwt→dm=ΔGdm−ΔGwt(Eq. 9) ΔΔGwt→m1=ΔGm1−ΔGwt(Eq. 10) ΔΔGwt→m2=ΔGm2−ΔGwt(Eq. 11) So Equation 8 can be simplified to Equation 12. ΔΔGCoup=ΔGdm−ΔGm1−ΔGm2+ΔGwt(Eq. 12) Here, because Ssh10b is a homodimer, the coupling free energy for each salt bridge in the molecule can be represented as Equation 13. ΔΔGCoup=12(ΔGdm−ΔGm1−ΔGm2+ΔGwt)(Eq. 13) Fig. 6, a and b shows the results of different DMCs for the two conserved salt bridges (Glu-36/Lys-68 and Glu-54/Arg-57) in protein Ssh10b at 298 K. For each salt bridge, four different DMCs were constructed to evaluate the interaction strength between the two charged residues involved in the salt bridge. For Glu-36/Lys-68, the reference proteins (doubly substituted variants) for the four DMCs were Ala-36/Ala-68, Ala-36/Leu-68, Gln-36/Ala-68, and Gln-36/Leu-68. Though the reference protein for each DMC has a different stability, all four DMCs gave identical, within the experimental error, values for the coupling free energy of the salt bridge Glu-36/Lys-68 (5.9, 6.0, 6.2, and 5.8 kJ/mol, respectively) at 298 K. For Glu-54/Arg-57, the reference proteins for the four DMCs were Ala-54/Ala-57, Ala-54/Leu-57, Gln-54/Ala-57, and Gln-54/Leu-57. The four DMCs of Glu-54/Arg-57 also gave identical, within the experimental error, coupling free energy values (2.1, 2.7, 2.3, and 2.5 kJ/mol, respectively) at 298 K. Thus, we can assign favorable Gibbs free energy of 6.0 ± 0.2 kJ/mol and 2.4 ± 0.4 kJ/mol to the salt bridges Glu-36/Lys-68 and Glu-54/Arg-57, respectively, at 298 K. Fig. 6, c and d shows the results of different DMCs for the two conserved salt bridges in protein Ssh10b at 353 K. For Glu-36/Lys-68, the four coupling free energy values at 353 K were 5.4, 5.9, 6.3, and 5.9 kJ/mol, and for Glu-54/Arg-57, the coupling free energy values of the four DMCs at 353 K were 2.0, 2.6, 2.1, and 2.1 kJ/mol. We can assign favorable Gibbs free energy of 5.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol and 2.2 ± 0.4 kJ/mol to the salt bridges Glu-36/Lys-68 and Glu-54/Arg-57, respectively at 353 K. Remarkably, these results were highly consistent with those at 298 K. Experimental estimates of the energy contribution of a salt bridge to protein stability have led to conflicting conclusions, ranging from them having stabilizing, insignificant, or even destabilizing effects (17Marqusee S. Sauer R.T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Lounnas V. Wade R.C.

Biol. 1995; 2: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In some reports, electrostatic interactions of salt bridges were measured by mutating a charged residue to a non-charged residue and measuring the impact of this change on protein stability. This type of approach is unsuitable as such mutations not only remove charge-charge interactions but also alter a number of other interactions, including the desolvation penalty and the background interactions of the residue within the protein. However, DMC analysis provides an elegant method to estimate the strength of a salt bridge. The contribution of a salt bridge (ΔΔGbri) to protein stability involving two charged residues can be represented as Equation 14, ΔΔGbri=ΔΔGdir+ΔΔGdesol+ΔΔGbackg(Eq. 14) where ΔΔGdir is the direct contribution of the salt bridge to protein stability. In most situations, it is the direct charge-charge interaction, but it sometimes also includes other direct interactions, e.g. van der Waals interactions between atoms of the two charged residues. The other two components are all indirect contributions of the salt bridges: ΔΔGdesol is the desolvation penalty of the two charged residues, and ΔΔGbackg is the stability contributions due to background interactions of the two charged residues with other components of the protein. Generally, the desolvation penalty is regarded as the dominant component of the indirect contributions (44Bosshard H.R. Marti D.N. Jelesarov I. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). DMC analysis is designed to cancel all interactions except the direct interactions between the two residues involved in the salt bridge. However, the validity of the method is subject to the following two assumptions. First, all indirect interactions are simply additive in nature from the single to the double mutation. Secondly, there is no interaction between the two residues in the doubly substituted mutant. Then, in an ideal DMC, according to Equations 12 and 13, indirect contributions are first removed for each residue (-ΔGm1 -ΔGm2) and then added back again by (+ΔGwt). Hence, in an ideal DMC, the coupling free energy is the direct contribution of the salt bridge. To test the above assumptions, some DMC analyses have been carried out alongside structural studies (34Vaughan C.K. Harryson P. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 591-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Luisi D.L. Snow C.D. Lin J.J. Hendsch Z.S. Tidor B. Raleigh D.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7050-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Another effective method is to construct several independent DMCs for a specific salt bridge. If the coupling free energy is independent of different DMCs, the assumptions described above are likely to be correct (36Makhatadze G.I. Loladze V.V. Ermolenko D.N. Chen X. Thomas S.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 1135-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 44Bosshard H.R. Marti D.N. Jelesarov I. J. Mol. Recognit. 2004; 17: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Here, we used the DMC approach to estimate the net strength of the two highly conserved salt bridges, Glu-54/Arg-57 and Glu-36/Lys-68 in protein Ssh10b. Four independent DMCs were generated for each salt bridge to test the feasibility of this method. The coupling free energies were 2.4 ± 0.4 kJ/mol at 298 K and 2.2 ± 0.4 kJ/mol at 353 K for Glu-54/Arg-57, and 6.0 ± 0.2 kJ/mol at 298 K and 5.9 ± 0.6 kJ/mol at 353 K for Glu-36/Lys-68. Our results demonstrate that, though the stability free energy of Ssh10b decrease greatly with increasing temperature, the direct stability contribution of these two salt bridges remain almost constant, providing evidence supporting the theoretical prediction that salt bridge interactions are extremely resilient to temperature increases and thus are specially suited to promoting protein stability at high temperatures (26Thomas A.S. Elcock A.H. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This may be the reason why thermophilic and hyperthermophilic proteins have increasing numbers of salt bridges with increasing growth temperature. It has been shown that a higher transition temperature in a hyperthermophilic protein can be obtained in three theoretical ways: 1) by shifting the stability curve to increase the overall unfolding free energy at any temperature, 2) by decreasing the ΔCp between the folded and unfolded states to flatten the stability curve, or 3) by shifting the stability curve toward higher temperatures (45Nojima H. Ikai A. Oshima T. Noda H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 46Nojima H. Ikai A. Noda H. Hon-nami K. Oshima T. Friedman S.M. Biochemistry of Thermophily. Academic Press, New York1978: 305-323Crossref Google Scholar). The Ssh10b structure is stabilized by eight isolated salt bridges and two ion-pair networks (each involves three salt bridges). Because salt bridge interactions are extremely resilient to temperature increases, increasing the number of salt bridges in Ssh10b should decrease ΔCp between the folded and unfolded states of the protein and thus flatten its stability curve. According to a previous report, Glu-54/Arg-57 and Glu-36/Lys-68 form two salt bridges, which are located on the surface of the Ssh10b molecule (30Wardleworth B.N. Russell R.J. Bell S.D. Taylor G.L. White M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4654-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However according to solvent accessible surface area (ASA) calculations, the four residues involved in these salt bridges are only partially solvent exposed. The solvent ASA of side chains of these residues are: Glu-54: 5%, Arg-57: 28%, Glu-36: 40%, and Lys-68: 58%. The two residues of the Glu-54/Arg-57 salt bridge are both located in the second α-helix, while those of the Glu-36/Lys-68 salt bridge are far apart in primary sequence and located in two separate β-strands (Fig. 1). Because the dielectric constant inside a protein is lower than that of the protein surface, it is generally accepted that the direct stability contribution of a salt bridge buried in a protein should be higher than that of a salt bridge located on the surface (47Tissot A.C. Vuilleumier S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6786-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, though the residues involved in the Glu-36/Lys-68 salt bridge are more exposed than those of the Glu-54/Arg-57 salt bridge, the coupling free energies of Glu-36/Lys-68 (6.0 kJ/mol at 298 K and 5.9 kJ/mol at 353 K) are much higher than those of Glu-54/Arg-57 (2.4 kJ/mol at 298 K and 2.2 kJ/mol at 353 K). The contribution of a salt bridge to protein stability is defined as the free energy of unfolding the protein containing the salt bridge minus that of unfolding the protein without the salt bridge (26Thomas A.S. Elcock A.H. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2208-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If a salt bridge interaction could exist in both a native and unfolded state, the stability contribution of this salt bridge would be lower than that if the salt bridge only existed in the native state. In the primary sequence of Ssh10b, the Glu-54 and Arg-57 residues are separated by two hydrophobic residues, Val-55 and Ile-56. In the unfolded state, the most energy favorable conformation should arise when Glu-54 and Arg-57 interact with water, while residues Val-55 and Ile-56 bind to hydrophobic areas of the protein. This conformation would increase the frequency of salt bridge contacts formed by Glu-54 and Arg-57. However, the situation for the Glu-36/Lys-68 salt bridge is different: the two residues are far apart in the primary sequence, so the frequency of salt bridge contacts formed by Glu-36 and Lys-68 in the unfolded state is much lower. To determine whether conclusions reached from our experiments on salt bridges in Ssh10b are applicable to other proteins, we analyzed published DMC experimental data for the contribution of salt bridges to protein stability in other proteins (Table 2). This confirmed that the average coupling free energy of intrahelical salt bridges (typically formed by two very close charged residues) is lower than that of salt bridges formed between residues far apart in sequence. Five of the proteins included in Table 2 have intrahelical salt bridges; coupling free energies (ΔΔGcoup) for these salt bridges determined by DMC experiments are: 0.3 and 0.9 kJ/mol for Asp-12/Arg-16 and Glu-28/Lys-32 respectively in Barnase, 3.4 kJ/mol for Asp-14/Arg-17 in λ Repressor, 0.4 kJ/mol for Asp-116/Arg-119 in T4 lysozyme, 1.2 and 2.1 kJ/mol for Lys-8/Glu-11 and Glu-11/Lys-15, respectively, in GCN4-p1, and 2.4 kJ/mol for Glu-54/Lys-57 in Ssh10b as reported in this work. The average coupling free energy of salt bridges located in an α-helix is only about 1.5 kJ/mol, much lower than that of salt bridges found in other structures (about 5.4 kJ/mol). This finding provides further insight into how to engineer proteins for improved stability at high temperatures; salt bridges introduced between two residues, which are close to each other in tertiary structure but far from each other in primary structure will make a greater contribution to protein stability. Further experimental evidence is required to substantiate these findings.TABLE 2The contribution of salt bridges to protein stability (DMC experimental data)Salt bridgeΔΔGcoup kJ mol–1Intrahelix (yes/no)Barnase (32,47–49)D8/R1103.5NoD12/R1101.4NoD12/R160.9YesE28/K320.3YesR69/D9314.3NoRubredoxin (50Strop P.

https://openalex.org/W2026762823,"Intrinsic structural disorder is a prevalent feature of proteins with chaperone activity. Using a complementary set of techniques, we have structurally characterized LjIDP1 (intrinsically disordered protein 1) from the model legume Lotus japonicus, and our results provide the first structural characterization of a member of the Lea5 protein family (PF03242). Contrary to in silico predictions, we show that LjIDP1 is intrinsically disordered and probably exists as an ensemble of conformations with limited residual beta-sheet, turn/loop, and polyproline II secondary structure. Furthermore, we show that LjIDP1 has an inherent propensity to undergo a large conformational shift, adopting a largely alpha-helical structure when it is dehydrated and in the presence of different detergents and alcohols. This is consistent with an overrepresentation of order-promoting residues in LjIDP1 compared with the average of intrinsically disordered proteins. In line with functioning as a chaperone, we show that LjIDP1 effectively prevents inactivation of two model enzymes under conditions that promote protein misfolding and aggregation. The LjIdp1 gene is expressed in all L. japonicus tissues tested. A higher expression level was found in the root tip proximal zone, in roots inoculated with compatible endosymbiotic M. loti, and in functional nitrogen-fixing root nodules. We suggest that the ability of LjIDP1 to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation may play a significant role in tissues, such as symbiotic root nodules, which are characterized by high metabolic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000587999,"TRPV1 receptors are polymodal cation channels that open in response to diverse stimuli including noxious heat, capsaicin, and protons. Because Ca2+ is vital for TRPV1 signaling, we sought to precisely measure its contribution to TRPV1 responses and discovered that the Ca2+ current was tuned by the mode of activation. Using patch clamp photometry, we found that the fraction of the total current carried by Ca2+ (called the Pf%) was significantly smaller for TRPV1 currents evoked by protons than for those evoked by capsaicin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we discovered that the smaller Pf% was due to protonation of three acidic amino acids (Asp646, Glu648, and Glu651) that are located in the mouth of the pore. Thus, in keeping with recent reports of time-dependent changes in the ionic permeability of some ligand-gated ion channels, we now show for the first time that the physiologically important Ca2+ current of the TRPV1 receptor is also dynamic and depends on the mode of activation. This current is significantly smaller when the receptor is activated by a change in pH, owing to atomic scale interactions of H+ and Ca2+ with the fixed negative charge of side chains in the pore."

https://openalex.org/W2114580309,"In terms of background, the solution structure of monomeric peptide P1 (residues 649-683), located in the conserved membrane proximal region (MPER) of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41, is first reported here in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. P1 is the minimal MPER region that permits interaction with the mucosal galactosyl ceramide HIV-receptor; it also contains epitopes recognized by major gp41-specific, broadly neutralizing immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs), 2F5 and 4E10, determinant in HIV fusion/infection. Our principal findings were as follows: the structural stability of P1 is pH dependent, as the alpha-helix comprising Q653 I682, present at pH 3.3, is destabilized at higher pH values. At pH 6, the E-rich N-terminal half of P1 (residues 650-666), partially overlapping the 2F5-specific epitope, becomes fully disordered, while the W-rich C-terminal half conserves two shorter helices (W666-W670 and W672-W680), separated by a well-defined bend overlapped by the 4E10-specific epitope. The two IgGs bind to P1 on DPC micelles with binding parameters (K(d)) in the nanomolar range. Next, P1 was derivatized with phosphatidylethanolamine at its C terminal and inserted into liposomes of varied lipid composition, thereby enabling P1 to move laterally. Alternatively, an infectious virus-binding assay was established. The K(d) of both 2F5 and 4E10 IgGs measured on viral liposome and virus are similar and much lower than for the binding of the free peptide. In conclusion, P1, in a lipid environment, is an optimized MPER-derived peptide suitable for designing an immunogen inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV."

In addition, these cytokines promoted proliferation (20 times) and an increase in the Gr-1-Mac-1+ population with participation of gap junctions (GJ). Nevertheless ATP, ADP, and UTP promoted a large increase in [Ca2+]i, moderate proliferation (6 times), a reduction in the primitive Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ population, and differentiation into macrophages without participation of GJ. It is likely that Ca2+i participates as a regulator of hematopoietic signaling: moderate increases in [Ca2+]i would be related to cytokine-dependent proliferation with participation of GJ, whereas high increases in [Ca2+]i would be related to macrophage differentiation without maintenance of the primitive population.

Time, intensity, and localization of Ca2+i events control its effects. Several intracellular proteins and ionic channels are sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i, translating these changes into cellular physiological effects. The major family of kinases associated with Ca2+i signaling are the classical Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) and calmodulins, which activate the calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs). Intracellular Ca2+ stores such as those in endoplasmic and nuclear reticula and mitochondria have an important role in Ca2+i signaling. Many types of agonists promote Ca2+i release from cellular stores, e.g. agonists that bind to Gq/11-coupled receptors, which activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), or agonists that operate receptors with tyrosine phosphorylation, which can be recognized by PLCγ. Both PLCβ and PLCγ catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (1Wahl M.I. Daniel T.O. Carpenter G. Science. 1988; 241: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol and InsP3 act as second messengers; diacylglycerol activates PKC on the cellular membrane, whereas InsP3 is spread in the cytoplasm releasing Ca2+i from the endoplasmic and nuclear reticula. Cytokines are the most important regulators in hematopoiesis. They activate distinct cytokine receptors with intrinsic kinase activity such as receptor of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and stem cell factor (SCF), which bind to c-Kit receptor; moreover cytokines also activate receptors without intrinsic kinase activity that are Janus kinase-dependent receptors. Janus kinases catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation on a great variety of cytokine receptors such as receptor of IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulator factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony stimulator factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony stimulator factor (M-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), etc. Some studies have described that some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, and SCF are able to promote Ca2+i increase in chondrocytes, neutrophils, and CD34+ cells (3Tonon R.

P2 receptors are divided into ionic channel P2X receptors and G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors; they are activated by ATP and its analogs, and in most cases they increase [Ca2+]i to promote the effects of P2 receptors. Thus, cytokine and P2 receptor activation may promote Ca2+i release through PLCγ or PLCβ activation, respectively, or by Ca2+i influx through P2X receptors. Therefore, Ca2+i is likely to participate in hematopoiesis. In this study, we have shown participation of Ca2+i in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in long term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC), which support myelopoiesis. A modest increase in Ca2+ concentration by IL-3 and GM-CSF may act mainly on proliferation with participation of GJ, whereas large [Ca2+]i increases by ATP and analogs promote weak proliferation and induce differentiation of hematopoietic cells into macrophages without participation of GJ. Extraction of Bone Marrow and LTBMC—To establish the stroma layer, femur bones were excised from mice (C57Bl/6), and the medullary cavities were aseptically flushed with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM; Invitrogen). The cells so obtained were seeded and incubated (37 °C in 5% CO2) in a humidified incubator. Half of the medium in each flask was replaced weekly with an equal amount of fresh medium. IMDM was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cultilab), 20% horse serum (StemCell Technologies), and 10-6m hydrocortisone (Sigma). At the end of the 8th week, after stroma formation, the remaining hematopoietic cells were removed. New bone marrows from other mice were collected in supplemented IMDM (10 ml) and cultured (2 h) in tissue culture flasks (75 cm2). Non-adherent cells were collected by removing the medium, and 106 cells/well (12-well plates) were added to precultured stroma. After 1-week co-culture, the cells were further cultured in 0.5% FBS, IMDM for 24 h. Subsequently LTBMC were stimulated with IL-3 (Sigma) or GM-CSF (Sigma) in 12-well plates in 0.5% FBS, IMDM (1 ml) to evaluate the proliferation and cell populations. Inhibitor was added 1 h before stimulation with cytokine. The number of cells present in the supernatant was evaluated every 24 h by using a Neubauer chamber. Cell counts were normalized by the number of cells present before stimulation. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of São Paulo (1464/03). Calcium Measurements in LTBMC—Bone marrow cells were seeded on cover glass slides (25 mm) in 6-well plates. For [Ca2+]i measurements, the cells were incubated (40 min at room temperature) with fluo-4/AM (10 μm) and pluronic acid (0.01%) and washed with Tyrode's solution. Images were captured in two Z planes with a microscope (Axiovert 100 M, Zeiss, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a laser scanner (LSM 510 META, Zeiss) and using an objective (Plan-Neofluor, 63×, 1.4 numerical aperture) under oil immersion. The fluo-4 probe was excited with argon laser (λEx = 488 nm), and light emission was detected by using a bypass filter (λEm = 500-550 nm). The pinhole device was not used for [Ca2+]i measurements. Images were collected at ∼4.5-s intervals for about 2 min. Fluorescence intensity was normalized with reference to the basal fluorescence by using Examiner 3.2 (Zeiss) and Spectralyzer softwares (Spectralyzer, Philadelphia, PA). Max refers to the value of maximal intensity per pixel after stimulation by the agonists, and Basal refers to the maximal value per pixel obtained before stimulation. The mean intensity by Basal and Max images (8 bits = 256 levels) in supplemental Fig. S1 was obtained using the Image J software. Confocal Microscopy—Bone marrow cells were seeded on cover glass slides (13 mm) under conditions described above. These cells were cultured previously in 0.5% FBS (24 h) and stimulated with GM-CSF or IL-3 (5 min). Subsequently the cells were fixed with formaldehyde (2%; 30 min), washed with glycine (0.1M), permeabilized with saponin (0.01%; 15 min), and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated for 2 h with rabbit anti-connexin 43 (Cx43) (4 μg/ml; Chemicon) or anti-P-panPKC (4 μg/ml; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) or with goat anti-P-PLCγ (4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-P-CaMKII (4 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-P-MEK (4 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); all of them were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% albumin. Rabbit or goat anti-IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) were used for 40 min as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 20 μg/ml; Sigma) for 20 min. Light microscopy analyses were performed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss). Flow Cytometry Analysis—To determine the hematopoietic populations present in LTBMC, whole cells where collected after 3 days of stimulation with IL-3, GM-CSF, ATP (Sigma), ADP (Sigma), and UTP (Calbiochem). The cells (106) were fixed and labeled with anti-Gr-1-fluorescein isothiocyanate (1 μg/ml), anti-Mac-1-phycoerythrin (1 μg/ml), and anti-c-Kit-allophycocyanin (1.5 μg/ml). Data analyses were performed in a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer by using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Statistical Analysis—The fluo-4 fluorescence intensity were normalized with reference to basal intensity and were shown to be representative pseudocolored images according to a fluorescence intensity scale ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Data were expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed by using Student's t test or analysis of variance. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Hematopoietic Cytokines Promote Increase in [Ca2+]i of Hematopoietic Cells—LTBMC reproduce myelopoiesis, the formation of granulocytic, monocyte/macrophage, and erythroid cells, although erythrocyte formation depends on external erythropoietin (9Dexter T.M. Allen T.D. Lajtha L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 91: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). In this kind of culture, a visible formation of cobblestones is observed where hematopoietic progenitor cells can be found in close relationship with stromal cells (9Dexter T.M. Allen T.D. Lajtha L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 91: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 10Quesenberry P.J. Crittenden R.B. Lowry P. Kittler E.W. Rao S. Peters S. Ramshaw H. Stewart F.M. Blood Cells. 1994; 20: 97-106PubMed Google Scholar). LTBMC are composed of stromal cells and hematopoietic cells that grow in the stroma. LTBMC were incubated in IMDM supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h before any stimulus to synchronize the cellular cycle; hematopoietic cells were sensitive to lower concentrations of FBS (data not shown). To determine participation of Ca2+i in hematopoiesis, Ca2+i concentration was monitored in cobblestone areas of LTBMC after addition of agonists. In the first step it was determined which cytokines promoted an increase in [Ca2+]i in cobblestone areas. Thus, measurements of [Ca2+]i were obtained in two planes: from the inferior Z plane (down) where more stromal and some hematopoietic progenitor cells were found and on the superior Z plane (up) where more hematopoietic cells were observed (Fig. 1). Because hematopoietic cells are smaller cells with circular shape and stromal cells are bigger with variable shape, these morphological features were used in their identification. EC50 values for cytokines range from 0.05 to 3 ng/ml as informed by Sigma-Aldrich. These values were confirmed by cellular proliferation assays with IL-3 and GM-CSF, and maximum proliferation efficacy for these agonists occurred at about 10-50 ng/ml (supplemental Fig. S2A). All cytokines tested (SCF, IL-3 (supplemental Video S1), IL-6, GM-CSF, EPO, and IL-7) promoted an increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1) in hematopoietic and stromal cells in the two Z planes evaluated. This cytokine-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i was not easily observed and was lower than the ATP-dependent [Ca2+]i increase (see supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly cytokines that activated hematopoietic progenitor cells such as SCF or specific cytokines such as IL-7 and EPO were able to produce an increase in [Ca2+]i in stromal and hematopoietic cells. Ca2+i Signaling Inhibitors Decrease IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent Proliferation—Because all cytokine tested promote an increase in [Ca2+]i it is likely that Ca2+i participates in cell proliferation and differentiation. To evaluate the role of Ca2+i in these processes we used two important hematopoietic cytokines, IL-3 and GM-CSF, which promote proliferation and differentiation in hematopoietic cells. IL-3 and GM-CSF promoted proliferation in LTBMC that was about 20 times the initial cell number after 3 days (Fig. 2, A and B). Proliferation was followed for 3 days (supplemental Fig. S2B); in addition, cell cycle analysis also revealed a proliferation state in the primitive population Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ (supplemental Fig. S2C). All stimuli by agonists were performed in IMDM, 0.5% FBS. Lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and remaining cells of bone marrow co-culture can be found in the Gr-1-Mac-1- population, and the primitive population c-Kit+ corresponds to 1% of the total cells of the culture. The c-Kit+ population present in LTBMC after stimulus with cytokines was still able to form either colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage or colony-forming unit granulocyte-erythroblast-macrophage-megakaryocyte colonies (supplemental Fig. S3). Participation of Ca2+i in proliferation was evaluated by using Ca2+i signaling inhibitors. LTBMC were incubated with the signaling inhibitors, and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM for 1 h before stimulation with IL-3 and GM-CSF. Because all inhibitors were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), stimulus by IL-3 and GM-CSF in DMSO were used as controls in statistical analysis. Supernatant cells in LTBMC stimulated by IL-3 and GM-CSF were counted for 3 days in the presence or absence of signaling inhibitors. InsP3 receptor (2APB), PLC (U73122), CaMKII (KN-62), and MEK (PD98059) inhibitors and BAPTA significantly decreased IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 2A). PKC inhibitors (GF109203 and chelerythrine) partly blocked IL-3-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 2A) but did not promote a decrease in GM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 2B). The concentration of inhibitors is shown in supplemental Fig. S2B. The signaling inhibitor was also able to decrease the percent fraction of cells in phase S/G2/M (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). These results confirm the role of PKC in the effect of IL-3 described previously in hematopoietic lineages (11Whetton A.D. Vallance S.J. Monk P.N. Cragoe E.J. Dexter T.M. Heyworth C.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Carroll M.P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1249-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the fraction of apoptotic cells in LTBMC was not altered by the presence of inhibitors, their specific effect in intracellular signaling is inferred (supplemental Fig. S4, C and D). Quantification of cell populations in LTBMC was assessed by flow cytometry after the 3rd day of stimulation with cytokines. As expected, LTBMC stimulated by IL-3 and GM-CSF produced myeloid cells. IL-3 and GM-CSF produced an increase in the Gr-1-Mac-1+ population as compared with its control (0.5% FBS). Proliferation and flow cytometry analyses were performed by using the same samples. When LTBMC were stimulated by IL-3, a significant increase in the Gr-1-Mac-1+ population occurred in the presence of 2APB and KN-62 (Fig. 2C). When cells were stimulated by GM-CSF in the presence of the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 a significant difference was observed with an increase in the Gr-1-Mac-1+ population (Fig. 2D). PD98059, an MEK inhibitor, promoted an increase in the Gr-1+Mac-1+ population when cells were stimulated with GM-CSF. The statistic analysis is described in detail in supplemental Table S1. The inhibitors used in this study can inhibit cell proliferation and act at distinct moments of myeloid differentiation. The fraction of progenitor Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ cells in the presence of cell signaling inhibitors was not altered (Fig. 2, E and F). IL-3 and GM-CSF Activate Intracellular Ca2+-dependent Kinases—Because Ca2+ signaling inhibitors were able to inhibit IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent cell proliferation, antibodies to active forms related to Ca2+i signaling such as PLCγ, PKC, and CaMKII were tested. Anti-P-MEK antibody, a protein that acts on cytokine signaling by activating MAPKs, was used as a positive control. The cells were stimulated by IL-3 and GM-CSF in Tyrode's solution (37 °C for 5 min). Under this condition, an increase in the expression of P-MEK and P-PLCγ was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). Participation of PKC in the IL-3 response was shown previously by using PKC inhibitors (Fig. 2A), and Fig. 3C confirms participation of PKC in IL-3-dependent proliferation. Activation of CaMKII may be associated mainly with GM-CSF (Fig. 3D); however, CaMKII does not act exclusively in GM-CSF signaling because IL-3 partially activated P-CaMKII (Fig. 3D), and IL-3-dependent proliferation was also decreased by KN-62 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, cytokines IL-3 and GM-CSF promote high cell proliferation with participation of Ca2+i and activation of kinases without a decrease in the primitive population. As a negative control, a secondary antibody, rabbit or goat anti-IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate, was used (supplemental Fig. S5). Activation of P2 Receptors Produces Both a Higher Increase in [Ca2+]i and Macrophage Differentiation of Hematopoietic Cells in LTBMC—[Ca2+]i increase induced by the P2 receptor agonists ATP, ADP, and UTP was transient and higher than the cytokine-induced [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1). Oscillatory increases were observed in stromal and hematopoietic cells (supplemental Video S2). To know the ability of P2 receptors to promote proliferation in hematopoietic cells, LTBMC were stimulated with ATP and analogs. Maximal cell proliferation in LTBMC was obtained with 1 mm ATP and its analogs (supplemental Fig. S6A). P2 agonists induced a significant proliferation on the 1st day (Fig. 4B); however, such proliferation was transient, and its efficacy was lower than that of the cytokine-dependent proliferation (Fig. 2, A and B). Of note, daily stimulation with 1 mm ATP did not cause a higher proliferative effect compared with that induced by a single stimulation (data not shown). However, the possibility that the transient effect of P2 agonists on hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation is because of their faster degradation deserves further investigation. Interestingly evaluation of populations of LTBMC showed that stimulation with ATP, ADP, and UTP induced an increase in the Gr-1+Mac-1+ population (Fig. 4C) and a decrease in the Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ immature population (Fig. 4D). Stimulus of LTBMC by ATP and analogs produced mainly macrophages as revealed by Giemsa/May-Grünwald stain (Table 1). Reduction in the Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ population by ATP and its analogs can account for the transient proliferation observed. In addition, BAPTA blocked the P2 agonist-dependent effects (Fig. 4, C and D). Another compound used to promote Ca2+ increase was the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, which was able to induce an increase in the Gr-1+Mac-1+ population (supplemental Fig. S6B).TABLE 1Giemsa/May-Grünwald stain of hematopoietic cells was obtained 3 days after stimulation of LTBMCMacrophagesMonocytoidNeutrophilsImmature formsBlastsIL-346 ± 812 ± 214 ± 323 ± 35 ± 1GM-CSF48 ± 432 ± 610 ± 37 ± 13 ± 1ATP92 ± 17 ± 10 ± 01 ± 0.50 ± 0ADP86 ± 34 ± 21 ± 16 ± 23 ± 1UTP64 ± 47 ± 411 ± 516 ± 32 ± 0 Open table in a new tab Participation of P2Y Receptors in Maturation of Hematopoietic Cells—In hematopoietic cells, P2Y receptors are activated mainly by ADP and UTP. The presence of P2Y receptors seems to be a characteristic on hematopoietic cells (7Rossi L. Manfredini R. Bertolini F. Ferrari D. Fogli M. Zini R. Salati S. Salvestrini V. Gulinelli S. Adinolfi E.

However, the presence of P2X receptors has also been described in macrophages, platelets, and granulocytic cells (14Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A. Torboli M. Bolognesi G. Baricordi O.R. Blood. 2001; 97: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 16Clifford E.E. Parker K. Humphreys B.D. Kertesy S.B. Dubyak G.R.

Only ATP, the agonist that promotes less proliferation, was unable to promote a significant decrease in apoptosis. Among P2Y receptors, ADP-activated P2Y1 receptor is expressed in the human CD34+ progenitor cell population (8Lemoli R.M. Ferrari D. Fogli M. Rossi L. Pizzirani C. Forchap S. Chiozzi P. Vaselli D.

BMC Immunol. 2004; 5: 16Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and murine HSCs (Lin-c-Kit+Sca1+) and is expressed in lesser amounts in mature hematopoietic cells (data not shown). Thus, it is likely that this receptor is involved in hematopoiesis. For these reasons, participation of P2Y1 receptor in the ADP-dependent response was evaluated by using its specific inhibitor, MRS2179, which was able to block both the increase of Gr-1+Mac-1+cells (Fig. 5B) and the decrease of immature Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ cells (Fig. 5C). MRS2365 (10-5 m), a specific P2Y1 agonist, also induced [Ca2+]i increase (supplemental Fig. S7D). The primitive Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ population expressed the P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y12, and P2Y14 receptors (Fig. 5D) similarly to the short term HSC (c-Kit+Sca-1+Linlow) population (data not shown). Participation of P2X receptors in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells was not tested; however, α,β-methylene ATP and benzoyl ATP promoted a higher [Ca2+]i increase in stromal and hematopoietic cells (supplemental Fig. S7). ADP and UTP induced similar effects, although they bind to different receptors. Intercellular Communication of Cytokine-dependent Ca2+Signaling Occurs through Connexins—When LTBMC were stimulated with cytokines, Ca2+i events such as Ca2+i waves (Fig. 6A and supplemental Video S3), frequently associated with the presence of GJ, oscillating [Ca2+]i increases, and cell mobility were observed (Fig. 6B). In Fig. 6B, a hematopoietic cell with an oscillating [Ca2+]i increase is shown; after the third recorded elevation, neighbor cells (arrow) started moving toward the oscillating cell (supplemental Video S4). When this cell contacted another hematopoietic cell, an increase in [Ca2+]i occurred (circle at 216 s). This suggests the presence of cellular structures that allow cellular movement and intercellular communication. Spontaneous oscillating [Ca2+]i increases were seldom observed in hematopoietic cobblestone. Because 4 s are required for a 512 × 512-pixel image to be acquired, a line scan was used to reduce the scanning time. Thus, an increase in [Ca2+]i between stromal (cell 1, adherent) and hematopoietic (cell 2, upper) cells was observed; a contact area can be seen in these images suggesting interchange of molecules (Fig. 6C) (supplemental Video S5). GJ are among distinctive structures related to intercellular communication. GJ comprise two hemichannels, the connexons, each of them composed of six connexin molecules that are transmembrane proteins. Previously the presence of Cx43 has been described in hematopoietic tissue (19Cancelas J.A. Koevoet W.L. de Koning A.E. Mayen A.E. Rombouts E.J. Ploemacher R.E. Blood. 2000; 96: 498-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 7A, the presence of Cx43 in a cobblestone area (i) and in detail (ii) between two hematopoietic cells is shown. Participation of GJ in Ca2+i signaling was tested by the presence of carbenoxolone (100 μm), an inhibitor of GJ. Cells were incubated for 2 h with carbenoxolone and stimulated with IL-3 or GM-CSF, as described above, followed by addition of ATP, and the rate of cells responsive to agonists was calculated. As shown in Fig. 7B, the IL-3-dependent [Ca2+]i increase was lower than the ATP-induced increase observed; moreover the [Ca2+]i increase was higher in hematopoietic than in stromal cells. Carbenoxolone was able to decrease the number of cells responsive to IL-3 and GM-CSF; however, alteration of the ATP response was not observed (Fig. 7C). Cells with increases in Ft/F0 higher than 0.2 above the resting level after stimulus were considered responsive. Carbenoxolone was also able to block IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent proliferation showing the important role of connexins in hematopoietic proliferation (Fig. 7D). However, carbenoxolone was not able to significantly block ADP-dependent proliferation (Fig. 7D). Cytokines are the main controllers in the hematopoietic system; these agonists bind to specific receptors (cytokine receptors) that are classified in many families. The intracellular pathways Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK and Janus kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription are the two main pathways triggered by cytokines (20Bradley H.L. Hawley T.S. Bunting K.D. Blood. 2002; 10: 3983-3989Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Wandzioch E. Edling C.E. Palmer R.H. Carlsson L. Hallberg B. Blood. 2004; 104: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown participation of other intracellular pathways that control proliferation, differentiation, and the cell death process in hematopoietic stem cells. For example, participation of the Wnt and Notch pathways in HSC maintenance and differentiation was reported recently (22Reya T. Duncan A.W. Ailles L. Domen J. Scherer D.C. Willert K. Hintz L. Nusse R. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar, 23Duncan A.W. Rattis F.M. DiMascio L.N. Congdon K.L. Pazianos G. Zhao C. Yoon K. Cook J.M. Willert K. Gaiano N. Reya T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the role of Ca2+i pathway; Ca2+i is an important second messenger associated with many intracellular processes in murine myelopoiesis. We demonstrate that low increases in [Ca2+]i are related to high IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent proliferation because the cytokine effects were sensitive to the PLC (U73122) and InsP3 receptor (2APB) inhibitors, which are active components in the Ca2+i release process (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, activation of PLCγ, which recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine in cytokine receptors, was demonstrated by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3B). Release of Ca2+i induced activation of Ca2+-dependent proteins (PKC and CaMKII) that translate their signals into physiological responses (Fig. 3, C and D). Participation of PKC in hematopoietic proliferation was partial and restricted to responses to IL-3 (Fig. 2A). Participation of PKC was described previously in the differentiation process of hematopoietic precursors. High concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induced myelomonocyte differentiation, whereas low concentrations induced eosinophil differentiation (24Rossi F. McNagny M. Smith G. Frampton J. Graf T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1894-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whetton et al. (11Whetton A.D. Vallance S.J. Monk P.N. Cragoe E.J. Dexter T.M. Heyworth C.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) also showed that IL-3 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate are able to promote proliferation, an increase in [Ca2+]i, and PKC activation in factor-dependent cell established at the Paterson Institute with mixed differentiation potential (FDCP-Mix), an IL-3-dependent stem cell line. CaMKII, another Ca2+-dependent kinase expressed in most cells, apparently acts on IL-3 and GMCSF responses because KN-62 partly inhibited IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent proliferation and induced an increase in the Gr-1-Mac-1+ population. Other CaMKIIs such as CaMKIV, related to quiescence of murine HSCs, also can control hematopoiesis by cyclic AMP response element-binding protein activation (25Kitsos C.M. Sankar U. Illario M. Colomer-Font J.M. Duncan A.W. Ribar T.J. Reya T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33101-33108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ca2+i ion is a very versatile messenger, and it is not necessary that the intensity of Ca2+i release be directly proportional to the observed effect. For example, in many processes, Ca2+ evokes a biphasic response like that in InsP3 and ryanodine receptors. An initial increase in [Ca2+]i induces a positive feedback and opens Ca2+ channels. Inversely high Ca2+ concentrations induce a negative feedback and block Ca2+ channels (26Thrower E.C. Hagar R.E. Ehrlich B.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 580-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ca2+ sparks released between the cell plasma membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum can produce relaxation in vascular smooth muscle by opening of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, whereas a global [Ca2+]i increase in the same cell can induce contraction (27Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 270: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). This versatility of Ca2+i signaling allows these ions to act on hematopoiesis in distinct ways depending on stimulus duration, amount of Ca2+ released, and type of protein activated. In the hematopoietic system, cytokines and P2 receptor agonists altered the proportion of Gr-1, Mac-1, and c-Kit populations by different [Ca2+]i increases. IL-3 and GM-CSF induced a low increase in [Ca2+]i, high proliferation, and an increase in the Gr-1-Mac-1+ population without a change in the percent value for the primitive Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ cells and with participation of GJ. However, ATP, ADP, and UTP induced a large [Ca2+]i increase and low proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells (macrophage differentiation and a decrease of the primitive Gr-1-Mac-1-c-Kit+ populations). Thus, low [Ca2+]i release may induce proliferation with normal differentiation, whereas high [Ca2+]i release can induce preferential rapid cell differentiation of the primitive population. In human CD34+, monocyte, and HL-60 cells, a large Ca2+i increase by Ca2+ ionophores induces differentiation in dendrocytes (28Czerniecki B.J. Carter C. Rivoltini L. Koski G.K. Kim H.I. Weng D.E. Roros J.G. Hijazi Y.M. Xu S. Rosenberg S.A. Cohen P.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3823-3837PubMed Google Scholar, 29Engels F.H. Koski G.K. Bedrosian I. Xu S. Luger S. Nowell P.C. Cohen P.A.

J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 82-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Participation of GJ is another distinctive characteristic of cytokines and P2 agonist response. A high [Ca2+]i increase by ATP and its analogs was independent of GJ, whereas the IL-3- and GM-CSF-dependent [Ca2+]i increase was partly inhibited by carbenoxolone (Fig. 7C). The function of GJ in hematopoiesis is not clear, but it is known that Cx43 is highly expressed in bone marrow of neonatal animals and decreases after birth (31Rosendaal M. Green C.R. Rahman A. Morgan D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 29-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression of Cx43 can be increased in regeneration processes (32Krenács T. Rosendaal M. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 993-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Montecino-Rodriguez et al. (33Montecino-Rodriguez E. Leathers H. Dorshkind K. Blood. 2000; 96: 917-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Cx43-/+ heterozygote animals have problems with myeloid and lymphoid regeneration. GJ also act on the maintenance of primitive human CD34+ cells co-cultivated with L87/4 stromal fibroblasts (34Dürig J. Rosenthal C. Halfmeyer K. Wiemann M. Novotny J. Bingmann D. Duhrsen U. Schirrmacher K. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 111: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the stroma regulates quiescence of primitive cells through GJ by keeping more CD34+ cells quiescent in the stromal cell line S17, whereas higher proliferation occurs in the stroma of leukemia patients, who have fewer GJ (35Paraguassú-Braga F.H. Borojevic R. Bouzas L.F. Barcinski M.A. Bonomo A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Proliferation inhibition by carbenoxolone shows the important role of GJ in proliferation (Fig. 7D). Participation of GJ in Ca2+i release by cytokines explains how stromal cells are also responsive to specific cytokines such as SCF, IL-7, and EPO. Consequently primitive cells may conduct Ca2+i signals to stromal cells that trigger others effects, like cytokine release, modification of extracellular matrix, and cellular mobilization. These effects have not yet been investigated. In the supplemental Video S3, a Ca2+ wave is clearly observed in the stromal cell showing the functional presence of intercellular communication. Ca2+ waves without stimulation were seldom observed; however, movements between hematopoietic and stromal cells are often observed and would occur by pseudopodia, which have been described previously in murine hematopoietic primitive cells (36Frimberger A.E. McAuliffe C.I. Werme K.A. Tuft R.A. Fogarty K.E. Benoit B.O. Dooner M.S. Quesenberry P.J. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The action of purinergic receptors is not clear. Herein we propose that these receptors promote differentiation in the primitive population. In another study, action of ATP was shown to be synergic with cytokines, increasing the number of progenitor cells (8Lemoli R.M. Ferrari D. Fogli M. Rossi L. Pizzirani C. Forchap S. Chiozzi P. Vaselli D. Bertolini F. Foutz T. Aluigi M. Baccarani M. Di Virgilio F. Blood. 2004; 104: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The source of ATP in the hematopoietic system is another intriguing fact. The release of ATP in the bone marrow microenvironment may occur with other neurotransmitters such as adrenergic transmitters that regulate the attraction of stem cells to their niches (37Katayama Y. Battista M. Kao W.M. Hidalgo A. Peired A.J. Thomas S.A. Frenette P.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) or by either release of endothelial cells or release of cytoplasm in bone fracture (38Bodin P. Burnstock G. Neurochem. Res. 2001; 26: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 39Hoebertz A. Arnett T.R. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol.

These results allowed us both to show an important role for Ca2+i in hematopoiesis and to evidence how Ca2+ signaling contributes to this process. Temporal changes in Ca2+ signals and intercellular communication should be further investigated to better understand the role of Ca2+ in the hematopoietic system. The low cytoplasm volume and the small size of hematopoietic cells raise difficulties in better evaluating subcellular aspects associated to Ca2+i signaling. In this study, redundancy in Ca2+ signaling was evidenced for all agonists used. Although distinct effects were induced, Ca2+ was utilized as the coordinator of their functions. Participation of different subtypes of Ras, MAPK, PLCγ, PLCβ, PKC, and CaMK proteins have to be investigated. A cross-talk between Ca2+i signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathways are under investigation in murine and human HSCs. It may be stated that Ca2+i participates in hematopoiesis depending on signal intensity, type of kinase activated, and participation of GJ. Herein we report results of an ongoing study aimed at the understanding of Ca2+ signal translators and other factors that control the development of murine hematopoiesis.

https://openalex.org/W2034633799,"Mathematical models that describe the global spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) often consider a sample of international airports as a network supporting disease spread. However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation."
https://openalex.org/W2050603083,"Mass spectroscopy, microsequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis studies have been performed to identify in human matrix metalloelastase (hMMP-12) residues covalently modified by a photoaffinity probe, previously shown to be able to covalently label specifically the active site of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Results obtained led us to conclude that photoactivation of this probe in complex with hMMP-12 affects a single residue in human MMP-12, Lys241, through covalent modification of its side chain ϵ NH2 group. Because x-ray and NMR studies of hMMP-12 indicate that Lys241 side chain is highly flexible, our data reveal the existence of particular Lys241 side-chain conformation in which the ϵ NH2 group points toward the photolabile group of the probe, an event explaining the high levels of cross-linking yield between hMMP-12 and the probe. Lys241 is not conserved in MMPs, thus differences in cross-linking yields observed with this probe between MMP members may be linked to the residue variability observed at position 241 in this family.

MMPs are considered to be critical mediators of both normal and pathological tissue remodeling processes (3Page-McCaw A. Ewald A.J. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). MMPs form a group of 23 proteins in humans containing a catalytic domain belonging to the metzincin superfamily (4Nagase H.

Des. 2007; 13: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), including cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, has stimulated impressive effort over the past 20 years to develop synthetic inhibitors able to block potently the uncontrolled activity of these potential therapeutic targets (10Babine R.E. Bender S.L. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1359-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 11Whittaker M. Floyd C.D. Brown P. Gearing A.J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2735-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Extremely potent inhibitors of MMPs have been developed, but with the exception of MMP-2 (12Rosenblum G. Meroueh S.O. Kleifeld O.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11152-11160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), most of these inhibitors act as broad-spectrum inhibitors of MMPs. Clinical trials based on the use of these broad-spectrum inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers have failed to reach their end points, with severe side effects observed (16Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M. Science. 2002; 295: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). Some reasons for this failure, as discussed in recent studies, suggest that some MMP members promote tumor progression, but others provide a protective effect in different stages of cancer progression (17Lopez-Otin C. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). This highlights the need to use in clinical setting highly selective inhibitors able to target only the MMPs responsible for tumor progression (18Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 657-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 19Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar, 20Overall C.M. Kleifeld O.

Similar trends have been observed in atherosclerosis, in which some MMP members have opposite effects on plaque stability. In this pathology, MMP-12 has been reported to promote both lesion and plaque extension (22Johnson J.L. George S.J. Newby A.C. Jackson C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15575-15580Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), justifying our current efforts in developing selective MMP-12 inhibitors (15Devel L. Rogakos V. David A. Makaritis A. Beau F.

To further progress on our understanding of the complex roles played by MMPs, probes able to detect and identify which MMPs are expressed under active forms in a complex biological environment have recently been developed (23Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10000-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24Chan E.W. Chattopadhaya S. Panicker R.C. Huang X.

Engl. 2007; 46: 3275-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To be informative, such activity-based probes (ABPs) should covalently and exclusively modify the free form of the protease active site, but not the pro-form or the active form in complex with natural TIMP inhibitors. ABPs for serine and cysteine proteinases have been successfully developed by exploiting the presence of highly conserved nucleophiles in the active site of these enzymes and selecting appropriate reactive groups to provide covalent modification of the targeted enzymes (27Cravatt B.F. Wright A.T. Kozarich J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 383-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 28Kato D. Boatright K.M. Berger A.B. Nazif T. Blum G. Ryan C. Chehade K.A. Salvesen G.S. Bogyo M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2005; 1: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). For zinc metalloproteinases, like MMPs, the lack of conserved active-site nucleophiles requires the use of photolabile groups to covalently label the enzyme active site (23Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10000-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24Chan E.W. Chattopadhaya S. Panicker R.C. Huang X. Yao S.Q. J.

Engl. 2007; 46: 3275-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Following this strategy, we recently developed a selective MMP probe that consists of a phosphinic peptide core able to block potently and selectively a large set of MMPs, to which an azido photolabile group has been grafted onto the inhibitor P1′ side chain (probe 1, Scheme 1) (26David A. Steer D. Bregant S. Devel L. Makaritis A. Beau F. Yiotakis A. Dive V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 3275-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The choice of the photolabile group and position of its incorporation in the inhibitor structure were based on the x-ray structure of phosphinic peptide inhibitor in complex with MMP-9 (29Tochowicz A. Maskos K. Huber R. Oltenfreiter R. Dive V. Yiotakis A. Zanda M. Bode W. Goettig P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 989-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Based on these structural considerations, the azido group of probe 1 is expected to enter into the deep S1′ cavity of MMPs, in a position that should favor covalent modification of residues lining this cavity. While probe 1 was shown to covalently modify only the active site of MMPs, high variation in cross-linking yield was observed between different MMPs (26David A. Steer D. Bregant S. Devel L. Makaritis A. Beau F. Yiotakis A. Dive V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 3275-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Indeed, the covalent modification of hMMP-12 by probe 1 resulted in a cross-linking yield of ≈45%, whereas this yield decreased to a few percents for human MMP-8. To understand the molecular determinant of this difference and improve the design of better ABPs that covalently modified all MMPs with high cross-linking yields, the identification of the hMMP-12 residues covalently modify by probe 1 has been carried out. Chemicals—Commercial reagents were used without additional purification. Buffers and salts were purchased from Sigma. Synthesis and tritium radiolabeling of probe 1 were carried out as previously reported (26David A. Steer D. Bregant S. Devel L. Makaritis A. Beau F. Yiotakis A. Dive V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 3275-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Mca-Mat) was purchased from Novabiochem and TIMP-1 inhibitor from R&D Systems. Proteins—Synthetic gene encoding the catalytic domain of the MMP-12 (Met98-Lys266) was obtained from Geneart (Geneart-AG, Germany). This gene was inserted into the pET24a vector, between the NdeI and BamHI site, for expression under the PT7 promoter. A Lys → Ala mutant was produced from 5′-ccgtaatgttccccacctacGCatatgttgacatcaacaca-3′ and 5′-tgtgttgatgtcaacatatGCGtaggtggggaacattacgg-3′ oligonucleotides, using the Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All plasmids were propagated in the Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue at 37 °C, and all constructions were verified by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3 star) cells carrying the MMP-12 catalytic domain-encoding plasmids. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml). At an absorbance (600 nm) of 0.6, protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. Five hours after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm benzamidinochloride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with lysozyme for 1 h at 4 °C. The suspension was then passed through a cell disruption system at 4 °C (Constant Systems Ltd., Daventry Northants, England) and was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min (8000 × g). The pellets were washed three times with buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 m urea, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and dissolved in buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 m urea). Refolding and purification steps were carried out as previously described (30Lang R. Kocourek A. Braun M. Tschesche H. Huber R. Bode W. Maskos K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Refolded proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and found to migrate as a single band. Protein molecular weights were determined by electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry and the presence of the Lys → Ala mutation was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, after tryptic digestion. Enzyme Assays—Enzyme assays and inhibition and titration experiments were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, 10 mm CaCl2, at 25 °C, in flat-bottomed 96-well nonbinding surface plates (Corning-Costar, Schiphol-RijK, The Netherlands), using the Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Mca-Mat) substrate, as described before (15Devel L. Rogakos V. David A. Makaritis A. Beau F. Cuniasse P. Yiotakis A. Dive V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11152-11160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were monitored using a Fluoroscan Ascent photon counter spectrophotometer (Thermo-Labsystems) equipped with a temperature control device and a plate shaker. Titration experiments using a calibrated TIMP-1 solution were performed to determine the exact enzyme concentration for each MMP batch: for these experiments, MMP concentrations were set at ∼20 nm. Values for kcat/Km were determined from first-order full-time course reaction curves obtained at [S] ≪ Km ([S] = 0.5 mm) and 5 nm final enzyme concentration. These progress curves were monitored by following the increase in fluorescence at 400 nm (λex = 340 nm) induced by the cleavage of the Mca-Mat substrate. kcat/Km values were obtained by fitting these progress curves (three independent experiments) with the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression. The Ki values of probe 1 were determined using the method proposed by Horovitz and Leviski (31Horovitz A. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6654-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—MS experiments were performed on an Ion Trap mass spectrometer (Bruker, Esquire-HCT). Ion trap parameters were set as follows: electrospray potential, ± 4000 V; skimmer voltage, ± 40 V; capillary exit, 226 V; and a source temperature of 365 °C. The MS survey scan was m/z 400-3000 Da with a target mass fixed at m/z 1800 Da and a 5-spectrum scan average. Nano-RP-HPLC—Peptide separation was carried out on an Ultimate LC Packings/DIONEX UltiMate™ Capillary/Nano-LC System apparatus, using an Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 3 μm, 100 Å (150 mm × 75 μm) column at a flow rate of 200 nl·min-1 and with detection at 214 nm. Solvent systems were: (A) 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.04% FA and (B) 5% water, 95% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, and 0.04% FA. The following gradient was used: t = 0 min, 100% A; t = 3 min, 100% A; t = 73 min 70% B; t = 74 min 100% B; and t = 80 min 100% B. μ-RP-HPLC—Peptide separation was carried out on an Agilent 1100 series apparatus and using a X-Bridge (Waters) C18 5-μm, 300-Å column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min and with detection at 214 nm. Solvent systems were: (A) 100% water, 0.1% FA and (B) 100% acetonitrile, 0.09% FA. The following gradient was used: t = 0 min, 10% B; t = 5 min, 10% B; and t = 45 min 100% B. Photoaffinity Labeling—MMPs (1 μm) were incubated with 2 μm of 3H probe 1 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij35, for 10 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction mixture was irradiated using a 1000-watt mercury lamp (Orsam) for 2 min (10 °C). All irradiation experiments were performed under inactinic light (sodium light) at 310 nm (50 microwatts·cm-2) on an apparatus equipped with an aperture and a series of lenses focusing the polychromatic light to a monochromator (Jobin-Yvon), a series of lenses to focus the monochromatic light to a thermostat support, in which the Eppendorf tube containing the mixture to irradiate is inserted. Light intensity was measured with a radiometer IL1700 (International Light, Newburyport, MA). After irradiation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer followed by boiling (5 min, 95 °C). These samples were immediately processed for subsequent SDS gel analysis. Electrophoresis—Radiolabeled proteins were diluted in Laemmli loading buffer (final concentration, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 100 mm dithiothreitol) and were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis in a 12% 1 mm-thick SDS gel, using a mini-protean III apparatus (Bio-Rad). Silver staining was performed as classically described. In-gel Digestion—Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250. Gel pieces containing proteins were excised and destained by adding 50 μl of 25 mm NH4 HCO3 in 50% acetonitrile. After a 10-min incubation with occasional vortexing, the liquid phase was discarded. This procedure was repeated three times. Gel peaces were then rinsed (10 min) with acetonitrile and dried under vacuum. Gel pieces were reswelled in 25 mm NH4 HCO3 buffer containing trypsin (12 ng/μl, modified porcine trypsin sequence grade, Promega, Madison, WI). After the trypsin digestion (37 °C, 18 h), the solution was transferred in into an Eppendorf tube, and tryptic peptides were isolated by extraction with 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile in water with 1% FA (2 × 10 min) at room temperature. Peptide extracts were pooled, concentrated under vacuum, and solubilized in 50% acetonitrile in water with 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Blotting—Transfer of proteins onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane was achieved using a semi-dry transfer blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Gels were rinsed in a 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 20% methanol, 40 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS in distilled water (Transfer Buffer). The PVDF membrane was activated in a bath of methanol, rinsed with water, and then equilibrated in the transfer buffer. We formed a membrane sandwich for protein transfer between the cathode and the anode: this included, from anode to cathode, a sheet of extra thick blot paper (Bio-Rad), wetted with transfer buffer, then the activated PVDF membrane, the gel, and finally 2 sheets of extra thick blot paper wetted with transfer buffer. After transfer, membranes were dried before radioactivity analysis or were stained using a Coomassie Blue solution (0.1% R250, 50/49/1 water/ethanol/acetic acid). Radioimaging—Radioactivity imaging and counting of the PVDF membranes were performed with the beta-Imager™ 2000 from Biospace (Paris, France). This apparatus allows an absolute counting of the tritium β particles, with a detection threshold of 0.007 cpm/mm2 for tritium. Trypsin Digestion of PVDF Membranes—Pieces of PVDF membranes containing labeled or unlabeled hMMP-12 were excised and destained using a 50/50 water/ethanol solution to remove excess of R250. PVDF pieces were incubated in a solution of 50 mm NH4 HCO3, pH 8/acetonitrile (50/50) with trypsin (12.5 ng/μl). Digestion was continued for 18-20 h at 50 °C. PVDF pieces were then rinsed with a solution of 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide Mapping—Eluant from the μ-HPLC column was split out into two flows: one at 160 μl/min for UV monitoring (214 nm and 280 nm using a diode array detector) and radioactivity measurements; the remaining flow was directed to an electrospray mass spectrometer for MS. A volume of 0.5 μl of each fraction was spotted onto a glass plate for counting tritium radioactivity using the beta-Imager™ 2000. On-line μ-HPLC/ESI/MS experiments were performed on an ion trap mass spectrometer, with the parameters as described above. Edman Sequencing—N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automated Edman degradation using an ABI Model 477A/120A Protein-Peptide Sequencing/Analysis System and Analysis Software System, Model 920A (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). Radioactive fractions eluted from the μ-HPLC column were pooled and loaded onto a trifluoroacetic acid-treated cartridge filter, previously conditioned with BioBrene Plus™. Prior to each sequence analysis, calibration was performed using a PTH-amino acid standard solution. MS/MS Sequencing of Covalently Modified Peptides—Radioactive fractions containing covalent adduct peptides were concentrated by using a reverse phase pipette tip (C18 ZipTip). Off-line nanoelectrospray ionization-mass spectrometry/MS experiments were performed on a ion trap mass spectrometer. Ion trap parameters for MS were set as follows: nano-electrospray potential, 1000 V; skimmer voltage, 40 V; capillary exit, 226 V; and source temperature, 150 °C. The scan number was increased to 20 spectra over an m/z of 250-2000 Da, the isolation width was set to 1 Da, and the collision energy to 0.65 V in the MS/MS-mode. MS/MS spectra were recorded for double-charged molecular peptide ions. Molecular Modeling—Model of probe 1 interacting with hMMP-12 was obtained as previously described (15Devel L. Rogakos V.

NMR structures in Fig. 7 (a and b) where selected from an ensemble of 20 NMR structures of the hMMP-12 catalytic domain deposited in Rutgers Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics PDB under access code 2POJ. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE Ingel Digestion—Efficient cross-linking experiments were shown to rely on the presence of detergent in sample buffer, a requirement preventing direct analysis of the photo-adduct by MS. In addition, previous work has demonstrated that light excitation of probe 1 in the presence of hMMP-12 catalytic domain produced two protein species that could be resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the upper band corresponding to the covalently labeled hMMP-12 and the lower band to unmodified hMMP-12 (26David A. Steer D. Bregant S. Devel L. Makaritis A. Beau F. Yiotakis A. Dive V. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007; 46: 3275-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These considerations led us to use first electrophoresis to separate the unmodified from modified forms of hMMP-12 and then proceed to the analytical characterization of these protein species. After electrophoresis, gel pieces containing these protein forms were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and the corresponding soluble tryptic fragments were resolved by nano-HPLC and analyzed online by MS. Nano-HPLC-MS analyses of the tryptic fragments from unlabeled (Fig. 1b) hMMP-12 showed a good overlapping with its catalytic domain sequence (Fig. 1a). Among the 12 expected tryptic fragments, 8 fragments were detected in the nano-HPLC profile (Fig. 1, b and d). Based on mass criteria, two peptides co-eluting at the same retention time were shown to result from the S1′ loop cleavage by trypsin (peak 6: MH+ = 956.6 and 7: MH+ = 1027.5; through this report, the S1′ loop sequence corresponds to the fragment Ala234 to Arg249). The nano-HPLC profile (Fig. 1c) for the covalently modified form of hMMP-12 (upper band) was characterized by an absence of peaks 6 and 7. This suggests that the covalent modification of hMMP-12 by the probe targets residues of the S1′ loop. No additional signals corresponding to modified peptides were observed in this nano-HPLC profile, thus the corresponding peptides should remain in the gel. An absence of radioactivity in the sample buffer (probe 1 incorporates a tritium radioactive atom, Scheme 1) supports this conclusion. To overcome this drawback, proteins were transferred from the gel onto PVDF membranes, prior to trypsin treatment. Micro Liquid Chromatography-MS Analysis of Tryptic Digest Containing Radioactive Species—Analysis of PVDF membranes after gel transfer by radioimaging indicated a quantitative protein transfer. When peaces of PVDF membrane containing hMMP-12 covalently labeled by probe 1 were incubated in buffer, no signal of radioactivity was detected in solution, a result showing that labeled hMMP-12 remains on/in the membrane. By contrast, when these membranes were incubated in buffer containing trypsin, radioactivity was released, suggesting the presence of hMMP-12 tryptic fragment(s) labeled by probe 1 in buffer sample. This tryptic fragment mixture, including those obtained from unmodified hMMP-12, were analyzed by μ-HPLC, MS, and radioactivity counting. Comparison of the corresponding μ-HPLC profiles (Fig. 2a unlabeled hMMP-12 and 2b labeled hMMP-12) revealed the presence of three additional radioactive peaks in the labeled sample. S1′ loop tryptic fragments (peaks 6 and 7 in Fig. 2a) were detected in the unlabeled hMMP-12 sample, but were no longer detected in the labeled sample, suggesting again a covalent modification of the S1′ loop by the photoaffinity probe. MS Analysis of the Three Radioactive Peptides—Measure of mass-to-charge ratio using a negative detection mode of the above three μ-HPLC peaks (F1, F2, and F3) indicated that the mass of the fragment contained in F3 corresponds approximately to the expected mass (observed mass 2712.3 Da, expected mass 2713.3 Da, see “Discussion”) of the S1′ loop peptide of hMMP-12 (residues Ala234 to Arg249,Mw = 1964.99) covalently modified by probe 1 (Mw = 776.27 Da, minus 28 Da due to loss of N2 after irradiation of the azide group) (Fig. 3). Thus, the covalent modification of hMMP-12 by probe 1 prevents cleavage of the S1′ loop peptide by trypsin, a result explaining why the corresponding tryptic fragments are no longer detected after covalent modification. Furthermore, this absence of trypsin cleavage suggests that the site of covalent modification occurs at the Lys241 level or at a residue near Lys241 (the S1′ loop fragment contains only one internal tryptic site). The mass-to-charge ratio of the two other species (F1 and F2 in Fig. 3) corresponds to F3-oxidized forms, with one (+16, F2) and two (+32, F1) degrees of oxidation, respectively. The presence of Met236 in the S1′ loop sequence may explain the observation of oxidized forms (see below). Edman Sequencing—The three purified radioactive fractions (F1, F2, and F3), containing the covalently modified hMMP-12 S1′ loop peptide, were pooled and subjected to Edman degradation to further characterize the site of covalent modification. N-terminal sequencing of this peptide started at Ala234 and ended at to Tyr240, with no sequencing cycle detected at the Lys241 position (Fig. 4). The next sequencing step indicated a Tyr residue at position 242, and sequencing identified all subsequent S1′ loop residues up to Arg249. Therefore, the site of covalent modification occurs in the S1′ loop, and Lys241 is the only residue modified by probe 1 in this loop. MS/MS Analysis—The MS/MS analysis of the purified and photo-cross-linked tryptic fragments corresponding to the S1′ loop was carried out for further confirmation and to characterize the chemical structure of the covalent adduct. MS/MS (collision induced dissociation) experiments were performed on the double-charged precursor ion at m/z [M+2H]2+ = 1373.1 Da, corresponding to the double oxidized modified tryptic peptide (Mw(F1) = 2744,3 Da, Fig. 3). Fragment ions were assigned according to the nomenclature described by Biemann et al. (32Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 886-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Experimental C-terminal y3 to y8 ion masses were consistent with those predicted, indicating that the C-terminal part of the S1′ loop from Tyr242 to Arg249 is not modified by probe 1 (Fig. 5). All these ions possess the expected theoretical mass, thus no oxidation takes place in the Tyr242-Arg249 sequence. By contrast, the mass shift observed from ion y9 to y12, corresponding exactly to the mass increment expected for the covalent addition of probe 1 to the S1′ loop fragment, including one degree of oxidation, demonstrated that the covalent modification occurs at the Lys241 level. Because this part of the S1′ loop does not contain a methionine or amino acids that could be the target of oxidation (Pro239-Arg249), the oxidation site in this case is expected to occur inside the probe structure.

Wright and colleagues now report that LTD in response to developmental deprivation depends on the GluR1 subunit in barrel cortex layers 2/3 and 4. Several synaptic depression mechanisms have been described for the hippocampus, cerebellum and neocortex in vitro, but little is known about which, if any, are engaged during experience-dependent depression (EDD). We found that EDD in the mouse barrel cortex depends on the AMPA subunit GluR1 in layers II/III and IV, but not in layer V, and that long-term depression is also GluR1 dependent in the IV-II/III, but not II/III–V, pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2017033386,"Background Whether vexing clinical decision-making dilemmas can be partly addressed by recent advances in genomics is unclear. For example, when to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during HIV-1 infection remains a clinical dilemma. This decision relies heavily on assessing AIDS risk based on the CD4+ T cell count and plasma viral load. However, the trajectories of these two laboratory markers are influenced, in part, by polymorphisms in CCR5, the major HIV coreceptor, and the gene copy number of CCL3L1, a potent CCR5 ligand and HIV-suppressive chemokine. Therefore, we determined whether accounting for both genetic and laboratory markers provided an improved means of assessing AIDS risk. Methods and Findings In a prospective, single-site, ethnically-mixed cohort of 1,132 HIV-positive subjects, we determined the AIDS risk conveyed by the laboratory and genetic markers separately and in combination. Subjects were assigned to a low, moderate or high genetic risk group (GRG) based on variations in CCL3L1 and CCR5. The predictive value of the CCL3L1-CCR5 GRGs, as estimated by likelihood ratios, was equivalent to that of the laboratory markers. GRG status also predicted AIDS development when the laboratory markers conveyed a contrary risk. Additionally, in two separate and large groups of HIV+ subjects from a natural history cohort, the results from additive risk-scoring systems and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis revealed that the laboratory and CCL3L1-CCR5 genetic markers together provided more prognostic information than either marker alone. Furthermore, GRGs independently predicted the time interval from seroconversion to CD4+ cell count thresholds used to guide HAART initiation. Conclusions The combination of the laboratory and genetic markers captures a broader spectrum of AIDS risk than either marker alone. By tracking a unique aspect of AIDS risk distinct from that captured by the laboratory parameters, CCL3L1-CCR5 genotypes may have utility in HIV clinical management. These findings illustrate how genomic information might be applied to achieve practical benefits of personalized medicine."

The peptides are converted from inactive 8.5-kDa precursors to membrane-disruptive forms by post-translational proteolytic events. Because rhesus myeloid pro-α-defensin-4 (proRMAD-4(20–94)) lacks bactericidal peptide activity in vitro, we tested whether neutrophil azurophil granule serine proteinases, human neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G (CG), and proteinase-3 (P3) have in vitro convertase activity. Only NE cleaved proRMAD-4(20–94) at the native RMAD-4 N terminus to produce fully processed, bactericidal RMAD-4(62–94). The final CG cleavage product was RMAD-4(55–94), and P3 produced both RMAD-4(55–94) and RMAD-4(57–94). Nevertheless, NE, CG, and P3 digests of proRMAD4 and purified RMAD-4(62–94), RMAD-4(55–94), and RMAD-4(57–94) peptides had equivalent in vitro bactericidal activities. Bactericidal peptide activity assays of proRMAD-4(20–94) variants containing complete charge-neutralizing D/E to N/Q or D/E to A substitutions showed that (DE/NQ)-proRMAD-4(20–94) and (DE/A)-proRMAD-4(20–94) were as active as mature RMAD-4(62–94). Therefore, proregion Asp and Glu side chains inhibit the RMAD-4 component of full-length proRMAD-4(20–94), perhaps by a combination of charge-neutralizing and hydrogen-bonding interactions. Although native RMAD-4(62–94) resists NE, CG, and P3 proteolysis completely, RMAD-4(62–94) variants with disulfide pairing disruptions or lacking disulfide bonds were degraded extensively, evidence that the disulfide array protects the α-defensin moiety from degradation by the myeloid converting enzymes.

These in vitro analyses support the conclusion that rhesus macaque myeloid pro-α-defensins are converted to active forms by serine proteinases that co-localize in azurophil granules. α-Defensins are effectors of mammalian innate immunity in phagocytic leukocytes of myeloid origin and in small intestine following secretion by epithelial Paneth cells (1Selsted M.E.

Myeloid and Paneth cell α-defensins are synthesized as ∼10-kDa pre-propeptides that have canonical signal sequences, acidic proregions, and a 3.5–4.5-kDa mature α-defensin peptide component in the C-terminal moiety of the precursor molecule (1Selsted M.E.

In human small bowel, evidence shows that the Paneth cell pro-α-defensin pro-HD5(20–94) is activated after secretion by anionic and meso trypsin isoforms that cleave the precursor at Arg-62 ↓ Ala-63 to produce HD5(62–94), the predominant form of HD5 in the ileum (4Ghosh D.

RMADs 1–3 and 8 have similar primary structures that resemble human neutrophil HNPs 1–3, but RMADs 4/5 and 6/7 are very different from HNP-1, yet differ from each other only by a S28F polymorphism (10Tang Y.Q. Yuan J. Miller C.J. Selsted M.E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6139-6144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). proRMAD primary structures deduced from cDNA sequences predict that RMADs 4 and 5 and RMADs 6 and 7 arise by alternative post-translational processing, consistent with the N-terminal Arg in RMADs 4 and 6. Although RMAD-3 and RMAD-4 are both highly bactericidal in vitro, RMAD-4 has anti-HIV activity that RMAD-3 lacks (8Tanabe H. Ouellette A.J. Cocco M.J. Robinson Jr., W.E. J.

The activating proteinases of human and mouse Paneth cell pro-α-defensins co-localize with their substrates in secretory granules (1Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat.

Immunol. 2006; 306: 1-25PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that rhesus myeloid pro-α-defensins may be activated by proteinases that also occur in neutrophil azurophil granules. Human neutrophil granules form sequentially during myeloid cell differentiation with azurophilic, myeloperoxidase-positive granules being the first to appear at the myeloblast and promyelocyte stage of neutrophil development (12Bainton D.F. Ullyot J.L. Farquhar M.G. J. Exp. Med. 1971; 134: 907-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Myeloid pro-α-defensins are synthesized and accumulate coincidentally with neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G (CG), or proteinase-3 (P3) serine proteases in pro-myelocytes during myelopoiesis and are localized to the azurophil granules (13Borregaard N.

Leukemia. 1998; 12: 1789-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that the co-localizing serine proteinases could function as convertases for myeloid pro-α-defensins. That hypothesis was tested by exposing recombinant myeloid proRMAD-4(20–94) to human NE, CG, or P3 to test for evidence of proteolysis and in vitro activation of RMAD-4(62–94) bactericidal peptide activity. Each proteinase converted inactive proRMAD-4(20–94) to bactericidal peptides, but only NE cleaved the proRMAD-4(20–94) molecule at the known RMAD-4 N terminus, RMAD-4(62–94).

https://openalex.org/W2062346745,"Pre-steady state, stopped flow analysis of Escherichia coli D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was performed by following the fluorescence of protein tryptophan and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer from protein tryptophan to bound NADH. The results indicate that binding of substrates is ordered, with coenzyme, NADH, binding first. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that there are two sets of sites on the tetrameric enzyme that can be differentiated by their kinetic behavior. NADH binding was consistent with an initial binding event followed by a slow conformational change for each site. The slow conformational change is responsible for the apparent tight binding of NADH to the apoenzyme but is too slow to participate in the catalytic cycle when the enzyme is rapidly turning over. Subsequent binding of the substrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, was characterized by a rapid equilibrium binding event followed by a conformational change for each site. Catalysis in the direction of NAD(+) reduction showed a distinct burst of activity followed by a slow rate of turnover, indicating that the rate-limiting step is after hydride transfer. Catalysis in the direction of NADH oxidation did not display burst kinetics, indicating that the rate-limiting step is at or before the hydride transfer step. The burst data indicated that the rate of NAD(+) reduction (3.8 s(-1)) is similar to the k(cat) of the enzyme (2-3 s(-1)) in that direction. However, analysis of the reaction with deuterated NADH failed to show an effect on the velocity of the reaction with a V(H)/V(D)=1.07+/-0.06. None of the other rates determined by stopped flow analysis could account for the k(cat) of the enzyme in either direction (forward k(cat)=0.01 s(-1), reverse k(cat)=2-3 s(-1)), suggesting that the rate-limiting step in both directions is a conformational change in the enzyme that is not detected optically."
https://openalex.org/W1978504166,"Background Receptor associated protein (RAP) functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to assist in the maturation of several membrane receptor proteins, including low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and lipoprotein receptor 11 (SorLA/LR11). Previous studies in cell and mouse model systems have demonstrated that these proteins play roles in the metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), including processes involved in the generation, catabolism and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice transgenic for mutant APPswe and mutant presenilin 1 (PS1dE9) were mated to mice with homozygous deletion of RAP. Unexpectedly, mice that were homozygous null for RAP and transgenic for APPswe/PS1dE9 showed high post-natal mortality, necessitating a shift in focus to examine the levels of amyloid deposition in APPswe/PS1dE9 that were hemizygous null for RAP. Immunoblot analysis confirmed 50% reductions in the levels of RAP with modest reductions in the levels of proteins dependent upon RAP for maturation [LRP trend towards a 20% reduction ; SorLA/LR11 statistically significant 15% reduction (p<0.05)]. Changes in the levels of these proteins in the brains of [APPswe/PS1dE9](+/−)/RAP(+/−) mice correlated with 30–40% increases in amyloid deposition by 9 months of age. Conclusions/Significance Partial reductions in the ER chaperone RAP enhance amyloid deposition in the APPswe/PS1dE9 model of Alzheimer amyloidosis. Partial reductions in RAP also affect the maturation of LRP and SorLA/LR11, which are each involved in several different aspects of APP processing and Aβ catabolism. Together, these findings suggest a central role for RAP in Alzheimer amyloidogenesis."
