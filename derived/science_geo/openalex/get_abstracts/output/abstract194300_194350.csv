Any one of the branched-chain saturated acids, isobutyric, isovaleric, or dl-α-methyl- n -butyric acid can be used as one component. Any one of a number of straight-chain saturated fatty acids can be used as the second component. These include C 5 to C 8 acids. Some activity for the second component was found in stearic and palmitic acid but none in lauric acid. Minimum concentrations for good growth when n -valeric and isovaleric acids were used were about 3 and 1.5 μM, respectively, per 10ml. of medium. All available strains of Bact. succinogenes require these acids. After this work was submitted for publication, Bentley et al. reported that the volatile acids, n -valeric, isovaleric, isobutyric, and caproic, or their amino acid precursors, stimulated cellulose digestion and the conversion of urea nitrogen into protein by rumen microorganisms as measured by the artificial rumen technique (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 76: 5000. 1954)."

This indicates that the diminution of the nuclear volumle after ligature of the excretory duct is not the result of cellular degeneration, since the nuclei respond to the same extent to pharmacological stiinulation. It may be admitted that this diminution is related to the lowering of secretory activity. In conclusion, the preseint study (10) reveals that an increase in the size of the nuclei of the submaxillary gland occurs after stimulation of glandular activity induced by testosterone propionate administration. This has been observed in controls and in glands in which the excretory duct was ligated. Ligature of the excretory duct significantly reduces the nuclear volumue. This diminution is not related to cellular degeneration and is attributed to the lowering of secretory activity by the initerruption of the salivary flow."
