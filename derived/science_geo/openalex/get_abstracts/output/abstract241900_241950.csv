https://openalex.org/W2108970342,"The two largest earthquakes of the past 40 years ruptured a 1600-kilometer-long portion of the fault boundary between the Indo-Australian and southeastern Eurasian plates on 26 December 2004 [seismic moment magnitude (Mw) = 9.1 to 9.3] and 28 March 2005 (Mw = 8.6). The first event generated a tsunami that caused more than 283,000 deaths. Fault slip of up to 15 meters occurred near Banda Aceh, Sumatra, but to the north, along the Nicobar and Andaman Islands, rapid slip was much smaller. Tsunami and geodetic observations indicate that additional slow slip occurred in the north over a time scale of 50 minutes or longer."

https://openalex.org/W2120970538,"The 26 December 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake initiated slowly, with small slip and a slow rupture speed for the first 40 to 60 seconds. Then the rupture expanded at a speed of about 2.5 kilometers per second toward the north northwest, extending 1200 to 1300 kilometers along the Andaman trough. Peak displacements reached approximately 15 meters along a 600-kilometer segment of the plate boundary offshore of northwestern Sumatra and the southern Nicobar islands. Slip was less in the northern 400 to 500 kilometers of the aftershock zone, and at least some slip in that region may have occurred on a time scale beyond the seismic band."
https://openalex.org/W2154988431,"Current models for protrusive motility in animal cells focus on cytoskeleton-based mechanisms, where localized protrusion is driven by local regulation of actin biochemistry1,2,3. In plants and fungi, protrusion is driven primarily by hydrostatic pressure4,5,6. For hydrostatic pressure to drive localized protrusion in animal cells7,8, it would have to be locally regulated, but current models treating cytoplasm as an incompressible viscoelastic continuum9 or viscous liquid10 require that hydrostatic pressure equilibrates essentially instantaneously over the whole cell. Here, we use cell blebs as reporters of local pressure in the cytoplasm. When we locally perfuse blebbing cells with cortex-relaxing drugs to dissipate pressure on one side, blebbing continues on the untreated side, implying non-equilibration of pressure on scales of approximately 10 µm and 10 s. We can account for localization of pressure by considering the cytoplasm as a contractile, elastic network infiltrated by cytosol. Motion of the fluid relative to the network generates spatially heterogeneous transients in the pressure field, and can be described in the framework of poroelasticity11,12."
https://openalex.org/W2012808888,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a human pathogen affecting nearly 3% of the world's population1. Chronic infections can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. The RNA replication machine of HCV is a multi-subunit membrane-associated complex. The non-structural protein NS5A is an active component of HCV replicase2,3, as well as a pivotal regulator of replication2,4 and a modulator of cellular processes ranging from innate immunity to dysregulated cell growth5,6. NS5A is a large phosphoprotein (56–58 kDa) with an amphipathic α-helix at its amino terminus that promotes membrane association7,8,9. After this helix region, NS5A is organized into three domains10. The N-terminal domain (domain I) coordinates a single zinc atom per protein molecule10. Mutations disrupting either the membrane anchor7,8 or zinc binding10 of NS5A are lethal for RNA replication. However, probing the role of NS5A in replication has been hampered by a lack of structural information about this multifunctional protein. Here we report the structure of NS5A domain I at 2.5-Å resolution, which contains a novel fold, a new zinc-coordination motif and a disulphide bond. We use molecular surface analysis to suggest the location of protein-, RNA- and membrane-interaction sites."
https://openalex.org/W2126425139,"Our understanding of the earthquake process requires detailed insights into how the tectonic stresses are accumulated and released on seismogenic faults. We derive the full vector displacement field due to the Bam, Iran, earthquake of moment magnitude 6.5 using radar data from the Envisat satellite of the European Space Agency. Analysis of surface deformation indicates that most of the seismic moment release along the 20-km-long strike-slip rupture occurred at a shallow depth of 4-5 km, yet the rupture did not break the surface. The Bam event may therefore represent an end-member case of the 'shallow slip deficit' model, which postulates that coseismic slip in the uppermost crust is systematically less than that at seismogenic depths (4-10 km). The InSAR-derived surface displacement data from the Bam and other large shallow earthquakes suggest that the uppermost section of the seismogenic crust around young and developing faults may undergo a distributed failure in the interseismic period, thereby accumulating little elastic strain."

https://openalex.org/W2045165049,"Red coloration is a sexually selected, testosterone-dependent signal of male quality in a variety of animals, and in some non-human species a male's dominance can be experimentally increased by attaching artificial red stimuli. Here we show that a similar effect can influence the outcome of physical contests in humans--across a range of sports, we find that wearing red is consistently associated with a higher probability of winning. These results indicate not only that sexual selection may have influenced the evolution of human response to colours, but also that the colour of sportswear needs to be taken into account to ensure a level playing field in sport."
https://openalex.org/W2052583546,"Here we demonstrate that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is phosphorylated in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. We show that S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), but not Akt, directly phosphorylates mTOR in cell-free in vitro system and in cells. Expression of a constitutively active, rapamycin- and wortmannin-resistant S6K1 leads to constitutive phosphorylation of mTOR, whereas knock-down of S6K1 using small inhibitory RNA greatly reduces mTOR phosphorylation despite elevated Akt activity. Importantly, phosphorylation of mTOR by S6K1 occurs at threonine 2446/serine 2448. This region has been shown previously to be part of a regulatory repressor domain. These sites are also constitutively phosphorylated in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 carrying an amplification of the S6K1 gene, but not in a less tumorigenic cell line, MCF10a. Many models for Akt signaling to mTOR have been presented, suggesting direct phosphorylation by Akt. These models must be reconsidered in light of the present findings."

https://openalex.org/W1997928390,"In mice, the Ter mutation causes primordial germ cell (PGC) loss in all genetic backgrounds. Ter is also a potent modifier of spontaneous testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) susceptibility in the 129 family of inbred strains, and markedly increases TGCT incidence in 129-Ter/Ter males. In 129-Ter/Ter mice, some of the remaining PGCs transform into undifferentiated pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells, and after birth differentiate into various cells and tissues that compose TGCTs. Here, we report the positional cloning of Ter, revealing a point mutation that introduces a termination codon in the mouse orthologue (Dnd1) of the zebrafish dead end (dnd) gene. PGC deficiency is corrected both with bacterial artificial chromosomes that contain Dnd1 and with a Dnd1-encoding transgene. Dnd1 is expressed in fetal gonads during the critical period when TGCTs originate. DND1 has an RNA recognition motif and is most similar to the apobec complementation factor, a component of the cytidine to uridine RNA-editing complex. These results suggest that Ter may adversely affect essential aspects of RNA biology during PGC development. DND1 is the first protein known to have an RNA recognition motif directly implicated as a heritable cause of spontaneous tumorigenesis. TGCT development in the 129-Ter mouse strain models paediatric TGCT in humans. This work will have important implications for our understanding of the genetic control of TGCT pathogenesis and PGC biology."
https://openalex.org/W1828062431,"The nature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies >10(20) eV remains a mystery. They are likely to be of extragalactic origin, but should be absorbed within approximately 50 Mpc through interactions with the cosmic microwave background. As there are no sufficiently powerful accelerators within this distance from the Galaxy, explanations for UHECRs range from unusual astrophysical sources to exotic string physics. Also unclear is whether UHECRs consist of protons, heavy nuclei, neutrinos or gamma-rays. To resolve these questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple detection techniques are needed. Radio emission from UHECRs, on the other hand, is unaffected by attenuation, has a high duty cycle, gives calorimetric measurements and provides high directional accuracy. Here we report the detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the geosynchrotron effect. Our results show that it should be possible to determine the nature and composition of UHECRs with combined radio and particle detectors, and to detect the ultrahigh-energy neutrinos expected from flavour mixing."

https://openalex.org/W2138803884,Satellite radar altimetry measurements indicate that the East Antarctic ice-sheet interior north of 81.6 degrees S increased in mass by 45 +/- 7 billion metric tons per year from 1992 to 2003. Comparisons with contemporaneous meteorological model snowfall estimates suggest that the gain in mass was associated with increased precipitation. A gain of this magnitude is enough to slow sea-level rise by 0.12 +/- 0.02 millimeters per year.
https://openalex.org/W2130562970,"At periods greater than 1000 seconds, Earth's seismic free oscillations have anomalously large amplitude when referenced to the Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor fault mechanism, which is estimated from 300- to 500-second surface waves. By using more realistic rupture models on a steeper fault derived from seismic body and surface waves, we approximated free oscillation amplitudes with a seismic moment (6.5 × 10 22 Newton·meters) that corresponds to a moment magnitude of 9.15. With a rupture duration of 600 seconds, the fault-rupture models represent seismic observations adequately but underpredict geodetic displacements that argue for slow fault motion beneath the Nicobar and Andaman islands."
https://openalex.org/W2086781637,"Two distinct forms of consolidated associative memory are known in Drosophila : long-term memory and so-called anesthesia-resistant memory. Long-term memory is more stable, but unlike anesthesia-resistant memory, its formation requires protein synthesis. We show that flies induced to form long-term memory become more susceptible to extreme stress (such as desiccation). In contrast, induction of anesthesia-resistant memory had no detectable effect on desiccation resistance. This finding may help to explain why evolution has maintained anesthesia-resistant memory as another form of consolidated memory, distinct from long-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W1973629646,"At interfaces of metal oxide and water, partially hydrated or “wet-electron” states represent the lowest energy pathway for electron transfer. We studied the photoinduced electron transfer at the H 2 O/TiO 2 (110) interface by means of time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy and electronic structure theory. At ∼1-monolayer coverage of water on partially hydroxylated TiO 2 surfaces, we found an unoccupied electronic state 2.4 electron volts above the Fermi level. Density functional theory shows this to be a wet-electron state analogous to that reported in water clusters and which is distinct from hydrated electrons observed on water-covered metal surfaces. The decay of electrons from the wet-electron state to the conduction band of TiO 2 occurs in ≤15 femtoseconds."

https://openalex.org/W2033493613,"The 26 December 2004 Sumatra earthquake produced static offsets at continuously operating GPS stations at distances of up to 4500 kilometers from the epicenter. We used these displacements to model the earthquake and include consideration of the Earth's shape and depth-varying rigidity. The results imply that the average slip was &gt;5 meters along the full length of the rupture, including the ∼650-kilometer-long Andaman segment. Comparison of the source derived from the far-field static offsets with seismically derived estimates suggests that 25 to 35% of the total moment release occurred at periods greater than 1 hour. Taking into consideration the strong dip dependence of moment estimates, the magnitude of the earthquake did not exceed M w = 9.2."
https://openalex.org/W2019937643,"Claudins are integral membrane proteins essential in the formation and function of tight junctions (TJs). Disruption of TJs, which have essential roles in cell permeability and polarity, is thought to contribute to epithelial tumorigenesis. Claudin-3 and -4 are frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer, but the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of these proteins are unclear. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of TJ complexes, although evidence for claudin phosphorylation is scarce. Here, we showed that claudin-3 and -4 can be phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cells. In vitro phosphorylation assays using glutathione S-transferase fusion constructs demonstrated that the C terminus of claudin-3 is an excellent substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a PKA phosphorylation site at amino acid 192 in the C terminus of claudin-3. Overexpression of the protein containing a T192D mutation, mimicking the phosphorylated state, resulted in a decrease in TJ strength in ovarian cancer cell line OVCA433. Our results suggest that claudin-3 phosphorylation by PKA, a kinase frequently activated in ovarian cancer, may provide a mechanism for the disruption of TJs in this cancer.

Considering that TJs are typically lost in neoplasia, these findings are somewhat surprising, and the exact role of these proteins in ovarian cancer remains unclear. There is, however, some evidence that claudin overexpression may actually lead to increased cell survival and invasion. 2R. Agarwal, T. D'Souza, and P. J. Morin, unpublished observations. A better understanding of the regulation of claudin proteins in ovarian cancer cells may help clarify their roles in this disease. Several lines of evidence suggest that TJs are involved in various cell signaling pathways, providing a possible link between cell polarity/cell contact and downstream signaling events (4Matter K.

Furthermore, the involvement of kinases in the biogenesis and regulation of several tight junction components has been established (16Kale G. Naren A.P. Sheth P. Rao R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, only a few studies have clearly demonstrated phosphorylation of claudins. For example, phosphorylation of claudin-1 by mitogen-activated protein kinases (21Fujibe M. Chiba H. Kojima T. Soma T. Wada T. Yamashita T. Sawada N. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (22Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Machleidt T. Ogris E. Bellotto D. White III, C.L. Sontag E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), as well as phosphorylation of claudin-5 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (23Ishizaki T.

Yamashita T. Kojima T. Sawada N. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), has been reported. Also, WNK4 kinase has been shown to phosphorylate claudin-3 and -4 (25Yamauchi K. Rai T. Kobayashi K. Sohara E. Suzuki T. Itoh T. Suda S. Hayama A. Sasaki S. Uchida S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To address the issue of claudin regulation in ovarian cancer, we have investigated phosphorylation as a possible modulatory mechanism of claudin function. We first show that both claudin-3 and -4 are phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cells, although probably by different kinases. Indeed, whereas claudin-3 is a target of PKA, claudin-4 appears to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C. For this report, we have focused on PKA-mediated phosphorylation of claudin-3. We show that claudin-3 is phosphorylated at threonine 192 in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region. Mimicking the phosphorylated state by mutating this site to an aspartic acid decreases TJ strength in ovarian cancer cells. Our data provide the first evidence for the phosphorylation of claudin-3 and -4 in ovarian cancer cells and suggest that phosphorylation of claudin-3 by PKA, a kinase frequently activated in ovarian cancer, may provide a mechanism for the disruption of TJs in this cancer. Cell Culture—Ovarian cell lines BG-1, CAOV3, HEY, IGROV-1, UCI101, 2008, A2780, OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, OVCA433, OVCAR-2, OVCAR-3, OVCAR-4, and OVCAR-5 were cultured in McCoy's 5A growth medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). HOSE-B, an ovarian surface epithelial cell line immortalized with E6 and E7 (26Gregoire L. Munkarah A. Rabah R. Morris R.T. Lancaster W.D. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1998; 34: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 300 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were maintained in McCoy's growth medium with the supplements described above. To establish stable clones of OVCA433, plasmid vectors were transfected using Lipofectamine plus reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Clones were selected and maintained in McCoy's growth medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal claudin-3 and mouse monoclonal claudin-4 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Mouse monoclonal PKAc was part of a sampler kit obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal PKAc α was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and sheep anti-mouse IgG horseradish antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa fluor antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Immunohistochemistry—Expression of claudin-3 and PKAc α was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of normal ovarian tissue and an ovarian cancer tissue array constructed in our laboratory (10Rangel L.B. Agarwal R. D'Souza T. Pizer E.S. Alo P.L. Lancaster W.D. Gregoire L. Schwartz D.R. Cho K.R. Morin P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2567-2575PubMed Google Scholar). Antigen-bound primary antibody was detected using streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase complex (Ultravision detection system; Labvision). For negative controls, absence of primary antibodies processed in parallel showed no positive staining. Images were acquired by Axiovision 3.1 software on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 microscope under ×40 objective lens (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Tris-glycine gels; Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v) and incubated overnight with primary antibody (claudin-3, 1:200; claudin-4, 1:250, PKAc, 1:1000; β-actin, 1:2000; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1:4000). Following the washes in Tris-buffered saline, membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, 1:10,000). ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used for visualization of the positive bands. In Vivo Phosphorylation and Immunoprecipitation—Ovarian cancer cell lines HEY, OVCA432, and OVCA433 were plated at 80–90% confluence in 60-mm dishes. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in phosphate-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with forskolin (FSK; 30 μm; Sigma) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 50 ng/ml; Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C. When used, H89 (30 μm; Sigma) was added 30 min prior to the addition of FSK. HEK293 cells were plated at 70–80% confluence in 100-mm dishes and transfected with plasmid pCMV PKAc (Clontech), together with a plasmid encoding either human claudin-3 or the T192A mutant using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents. After 18 h of transfection, cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml). Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 700 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated overnight with 2 μg of primary antibody and 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer without inhibitors, with the final elution in 2× sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated on SDS-PAGE. The gels were either dried, exposed to film for autoradiography, or transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotted as described above. Generation of Claudin-3 and -4 WT and Mutant Constructs—The coding sequence of human CLDN3 and CLDN4 was amplified by PCR from cDNA obtained from ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR5 and cloned into pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. DNA fragments of the GST fusion constructs were generated by PCR using the claudin plasmids described above. GST fusion proteins were constructed with the C-terminal areas of claudin-3 (amino acids 185–220) and claudin-4 (amino acids 181–209). The fragments were designed to contain EcoRI/SalI restriction sites allowing them to be subcloned in-frame with the GST fragment in pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Point mutations of the serine or threonine residues in the consensus PKA site were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of GST-claudin Fusion Proteins— Recombinant constructs of pGEX-CLDN3C, pGEX-CLDN3C-T192A, pGEX-CLDN3C-S199A, and pGEX-CLDN4C were transformed in BL-21 Escherichia coli (Stratagene) for protein expression. Purification was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. Briefly, cultures were grown overnight, and protein expression was initiated with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. Bacterial pellets obtained after centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C were resuspended in cold PBS with Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After sonication, the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. Fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatograpy using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The Sepharose beads were washed three times with PBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with glutathione Elution Buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl/5 mm reduced glutathione). In Vitro Phosphorylation—Purified GST, GST-fusion proteins, and immunoprecipitated claudin-3 (WT and T192A) proteins were incubated with kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5.1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP. Catalytic subunit of PKA (5U; Promega) was added to the reaction to a final volume of 20 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 5× sample buffer. The proteins was separated on SDS-PAGE (14% Tris-glycine gels), dried, and exposed for autoradiography. Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblot were used to confirm equal loading of proteins. TER Measurements and Calcium Switch Assay—OVCA433 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 on 12-mm polycarbonate transwell clear membranes (0.4-μm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA). TER was measured using a Millicell-ERS V-ohm meter (WPI, New Haven, CT). The values were normalized for the area of the filter and obtained after subtraction of blank values (filter and bath solution). For experiments with drugs, DMSO (vehicle) and FSK (30 μm) were added at time 0, with measurements taken every hour thereafter. For the calcium switch assay, the calcium in the medium was chelated using EGTA at a final concentration of 4 mm (27Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed 7 days after seeding, after the TER had reached an optimal value. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and replaced with normal medium or low calcium medium. TER readings were taken for 4–5 h followed by replacement of low calcium medium with normal medium, and measurements were taken the following day. Permeability Assay—OVCA433 clones were plated at 5 × 105 cells/transwell and grown for 7 days to confluence and optimal TER development. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, with an average molecular mass of 4 kDa (Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in McCoy's media to a concentration of 1 mg/ml was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber was replaced with fresh media. At the 0, 4, and 24 h time points, 50-μl aliquots were collected from the lower chamber and assayed by luminescence spectrometer using excitation at 485 nm and emission at 530 nm (Cytofluor; PerSeptive Biosystems). The value for vector-transfected OVCA433 was used for normalization and set at 100%. Immunofluorescence—OVCA433 clones were washed with PBS, followed by fixation with cold methanol:acetone (1:1) for 4 min. OVCA433 cells treated with DMSO (vehicle), FSK (30 μm), or FSK+H89 were fixed in a similar fashion. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin, followed by incubation with claudin-3 (1:100) at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, the cells were stained with Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by using repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc test (28Zar J.H. Biostatistcal Analysis. 4th Ed. Prentice Hall Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ1999Google Scholar) (using SAS software version 9), with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Claudin-3 and -4 Are Phosphorylated in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines—We first sought to determine whether claudin-3 and -4 could be phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cells. We used in vivo phosphorylation assays in which we stimulated metabolically labeled ovarian cancer cell lines with FSK and PMA, a PKA and a protein kinase C activator, respectively (Fig. 1A). Compared with unstimulated cells, claudin-3 phosphorylation was significantly increased in both OVCA432 and OVCA433 cells. In addition, some of the claudin-3 protein seems to be constitutively phosphorylated in the unstimulated OVCA432 cells. HEY cells, which do not express endogenous claudin-3, were included as a negative control, and the phosphorylated bands observed in these cells were nonspecific, with molecular masses slightly different from those of the claudin bands. Similar results were obtained with claudin-4 (Fig. 1B). Indeed, treatment of cells with the agonists induced phosphorylation of claudin-4 in both OVCA432 and OVCA433 cell lines. The increase in claudin-4 phosphorylation is particularly apparent in OVCA433 cells, in which phosphorylation is essentially absent without activation but highly elevated after FSK/PMA treatment. HEY cells were again used as negative control because they lack endogenous claudin-4 protein as well. To determine which of the agonists increased the phosphorylation of claudin-3 and -4 proteins, an in vivo phosphorylation assay was performed in OVCA433 cells in the presence of either FSK or PMA. Fig. 1C shows that claudin-3 was strongly phosphorylated following FSK treatment, whereas PMA increased the phosphorylation of claudin-4 in OVCA433 cells. Similar results were obtained in OVCA432 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that, in these cells, claudin-3 is phosphorylated by PKA, whereas claudin-4 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C. Moreover, FSK-dependent phosphorylation of claudin-3 was inhibited by H89, a PKA inhibitor, bringing it back to basal phosphorylation level (Fig. 1D). This experiment further strengthens our conclusion that claudin-3 is phosphorylated in vivo by PKA in these cells. Expression of PKA Catalytic and Claudin-3 Proteins in Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines and Cancer Tissues—Because of the findings above suggesting that claudin-3 is a likely target for PKA in ovarian cancer cells, we decided to examine endogenous protein levels of PKAc α in a panel of ovarian cancer cells. PKAc α was prominently present in all cell lines examined except HEY, which also fails to express claudin-3 (Fig. 2A). Combined expression of the catalytic subunit with the various regulatory subunits can generate various physiological consequences in different cells (29Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Most of the cell lines in Fig. 2A also expressed regulatory subunits (data not shown), indicating the existence of functional PKA complexes in these cells. This is in agreement with previous reports showing a frequent activation of PKA in ovarian cancer (30McDaid H.M. Cairns M.T. Atkinson R.J. McAleer S. Harkin D.P. Gilmore P. Johnston P.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 79: 933-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Alper O. Hacker N.F. Cho-Chung Y.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4999-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Claudin-3 expression was absent in non-malignant HOSE-B cells but found in most of the ovarian cancer lines. Overall, 11 of 16 cell lines expressed both claudin-3 and PKAc α. This is consistent with our earlier finding demonstrating expression of claudin-3 protein in the vast majority of ovarian cancers (10Rangel L.B. Agarwal R. D'Souza T. Pizer E.S. Alo P.L. Lancaster W.D. Gregoire L. Schwartz D.R. Cho K.R. Morin P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2567-2575PubMed Google Scholar). Staining of normal ovarian tissue with PKAc α and claudin-3 indicated the presence of PKAc α in the epithelium and stroma of the tissue, but claudin-3 was clearly absent (Fig. 2B, a and d), similar to what we observed for the expression of these proteins in the HOSE-B non-maligant ovarian epithelial cells (Fig. 2A). Staining of our ovarian cancer tissue array with PKAc α antibody showed that this protein was present in all the ovarian cancer tissues and that the areas of PKAc staining overlapped with areas of claudin-3 staining (Fig. 2B, b, c, e, and f). These proteins were found both at the membrane and cytoplasm. The insets of Fig. 2B, c and f, which are shown at higher magnification, verify the localization of PKAc α and claudin-3. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that claudin-3 may be a target for PKA phosphorylation in ovarian cancer cells. Recombinant Claudin-3 Protein Is Phosphorylated in Vitro by PKA—We next wished to determine the exact PKA phosphorylation site(s) in claudin-3. We performed an in vitro phosphorylation assay with GST fusion proteins containing the C terminus of claudin-3 and -4 (Fig. 3A). PKA strongly phosphorylated the claudin-3 C-terminal region, whereas claudin-4 was very weakly phosphorylated compared with claudin-3 (Fig. 3B). The GST protein without claudin sequences was not phosphorylated in these assays. These in vitro findings are consistent with the in vivo observations, showing that claudin-3 is strongly phosphorylated by a PKA activator compared with claudin-4 (Fig. 1). To determine which of the serine/threonine residues in the C-terminal region of claudin-3 is phosphorylated, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on putative sites that met the minimal consensus sequence for PKA (R/KXT/S) (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3C shows that a single threonine to alanine substitution at position 192 of the C-terminal region of claudin-3 abolished the phosphorylation signal. Mutation at another putative phosphorylation residue (Ser-199), although leading to a slight reduction in signal, did not prevent strong phosphorylation of the claudin-3 C terminus. In addition, various GST fusions with other regions of claudin-3 (N-terminal, loop, and transmembrane regions) were not phosphorylated in these in vitro assays (data not shown). Claudin-3 Is Phosphorylated in Vitro and in Vivo by PKA at Thr-192—We next asked whether full-length claudin-3 could be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo at Thr-192. Because a theoretical tryptic digest analysis of claudin-3 showed that the fragment containing Thr-192 would be out of the detection range for mass spectrometry, we resorted to genetic approaches to answer this question. Full-length claudin-3 WT and mutant (T192A) were overexpressed in two cell lines, HEY and HEK293, both of which were devoid of endogenous claudin-3. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with PKAc along with radiolabeled ATP for a kinase assay. Immunoprecipitates of claudin-3 WT from both HEY and HEK293 exhibited phosphorylated claudin-3, whereas no phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing the mutant T192A (Fig. 3D). In addition, we co-expressed claudin-3 WT or its mutant T192A with PKAc in HEK293 cells. Fig. 3E shows that, in the presence of the active PKAc, claudin-3 WT was phosphorylated, whereas the mutant T192A was not. Interestingly, the phosphorylated claudin-3 was more prominent in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction than in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 3F). Claudin-3 Phosphorylation Affects Barrier Function—To evaluate the functional role of PKA phosphorylation in the barrier function of TJs, we overexpressed claudin-3 WT, mutant T192A (non-phosphorylatable), and mutant T192D (mimicking the phosphorylated state of the residue) in ovarian cancer cells. For this analysis, we chose the OVCA433 cell line because, among the ovarian cancer cell lines tested, these cells had the highest TJ function as evaluated by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) measurements. Non-transfected cells, as well as cells expressing claudin-3 WT or the T192A mutant, developed relatively high TER over a period of ∼7 days (Fig. 4A). However, expression of the T192D mutant, mimicking the phosphorylated state, led to a significant inhibition of TER with at least a 6- or 4-fold reduction compared with the values of vector or claudin-3 WT, respectively (F3,16 = 14, p < 0.0001) at day 7, suggesting that the TJs could not form properly. The data shown here are from one set of OVCA433 clones, but comparable results were obtained with another series of clones, as well as with pools of transfectants (data not shown). We carried out similar experiments with Madin-Darby canine kidney I cells, which have high TER and are commonly used in TJ studies. Similar to what we observed for OVCA433 cells, expression of the mutant T192D in Madin-Darby canine kidney I cells decreased the TER 4- or 2-fold compared with vector or claudin-3 WT, respectively (data not shown). We also assessed permeability changes of OVCA433 stable clones using the paracellular tracer fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (4 kDa) across the established monolayers. Compared with vector-transfected cells, cells expressing claudin-3 T192D mutant had significantly increased paracellular flux of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran. Indeed, the transported dextran was increased by 30% after 4 h of incubation and by 150% after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 4B). The other two stable transformants expressing claudin-3 WT and mutant T192A exhibited permeability properties similar to the vector-transfected control. Recovery of Barrier Function is Normal in Claudin-3-overexpressing Cells after Ca2+ Switch—Removal of extracellular calcium results in a PKA-dependent disruption of TJs (32Klingler C. Kniesel U. Bamforth S.D. Wolburg H. Engelhardt B. Risau W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PKA has also been shown to affect the resealing of TJs following the replenishment of calcium, possibly via vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a direct substrate for PKA, impl"
https://openalex.org/W2008424177,"Helicases are molecular motors that use the energy of nucleoside 5'-triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis to translocate along a nucleic acid strand and catalyse reactions such as DNA unwinding. The ring-shaped helicase of bacteriophage T7 translocates along single-stranded (ss)DNA at a speed of 130 bases per second; however, T7 helicase slows down nearly tenfold when unwinding the strands of duplex DNA. Here, we report that T7 DNA polymerase, which is unable to catalyse strand displacement DNA synthesis by itself, can increase the unwinding rate to 114 base pairs per second, bringing the helicase up to similar speeds compared to its translocation along ssDNA. The helicase rate of stimulation depends upon the DNA synthesis rate and does not rely on specific interactions between T7 DNA polymerase and the carboxy-terminal residues of T7 helicase. Efficient duplex DNA synthesis is achieved only by the combined action of the helicase and polymerase. The strand displacement DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase depends on the unwinding activity of the helicase, which provides ssDNA template. The rapid trapping of the ssDNA bases by the DNA synthesis activity of the polymerase in turn drives the helicase to move forward through duplex DNA at speeds similar to those observed along ssDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1968632529,"The human tragedy caused by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (moment magnitude 9.3) on 26 December 2004 and its companion Nias earthquake (moment magnitude 8.7) on 28 March 2005 is difficult to comprehend. These earthquakes, the largest in 40 years, have also left seismologists searching for the words and tools to describe the enormity of the geological processes involved. Four papers in this issue discuss aspects of a rupture process of surprising complexity, the first such event to test the sensitivity and range of many new technologies. A surprising feature of the earthquake is that after the initial rapid rupture, subsequent slip of the plate interface occurred with decreasing speed toward the north."
https://openalex.org/W2064896694,"As surface waves from the 26 December 2004 earthquake in Sumatra swept across Alaska, they triggered an 11-minute swarm of 14 local earthquakes near Mount Wrangell, almost 11,000 kilometers away. Earthquakes occurred at intervals of 20 to 30 seconds, in phase with the largest positive vertical ground displacements during the Rayleigh surface waves. We were able to observe this correlation because of the combination of unusually long surface waves and seismic stations near the local earthquakes. This phase of Rayleigh wave motion was dominated by horizontal extensional stresses reaching 25 kilopascals. These observations imply that local events were triggered by simple shear failure on normal faults."
https://openalex.org/W2056381504,Previous evidence suggested that transfer RNAs (tRNAs) cross the nuclear envelope to the cytosol only once after maturing in the nucleus. We now present evidence for nuclear import of tRNAs in yeast. Several export mutants accumulate mature tRNAs in the nucleus even in the absence of transcription. Import requires energy but not the Ran cycle. These results indicate that tRNAs shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol.
https://openalex.org/W2140040255,"A G protein-coupled receptor agonist, angiotensin II (AngII), induces epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) transactivation possibly through metalloprotease-dependent, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) shedding. Here, we have investigated signal transduction of this process by using COS7 cells expressing an AngII receptor, AT1. In these cells AngII-induced EGFR transactivation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with a selective HB-EGF inhibitor, or with a metalloprotease inhibitor. We also developed a COS7 cell line permanently expressing a HB-EGF construct tagged with alkaline phosphatase, which enabled us to measure HB-EGF shedding quantitatively. In the COS7 cell line AngII stimulated release of HB-EGF. This effect was mimicked by treatment either with a phospholipase C activator, a Ca2+ ionophore, a metalloprotease activator, or H2O2. Conversely, pretreatment with an intracellular Ca2+ antagonist or an antioxidant blocked AngII-induced HB-EGF shedding. Moreover, infection of an adenovirus encoding an inhibitor of Gq markedly reduced EGFR transactivation and HB-EGF shedding through AT1. In this regard, AngII-stimulated HB-EGF shedding was abolished in an AT1 mutant that lacks Gq protein coupling. However, in cells expressing AT1 mutants that retain Gq protein coupling, AngII is still able to induce HB-EGF shedding. Finally, the AngII-induced EGFR transactivation was attenuated in COS7 cells overexpressing a catalytically inactive mutant of ADAM17. From these data we conclude that AngII stimulates a metalloprotease ADAM17-dependent HB-EGF shedding through AT1/Gq/phospholipase C-mediated elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species production, representing a key mechanism indispensable for EGFR transactivation.

Iwao H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 11-34PubMed Google Scholar, 2Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 639-672PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely believed that AngII promotes these diseases by inducing vascular remodeling that involves hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (3Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 366-373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yin G. Yan C. Berk B.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 780-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that AngII promotes these cellular effects by “trans”-activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through the AT1 receptor (5Eguchi S. Frank G.D. Mifune M. Inagami T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Saito Y. Berk B.C. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Similar to EGF stimulation, AngII transactivates EGFR, which recruits the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2, leading to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade (7Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. Utsunomiya H. Motley E.D. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Moreover, EGFR transactivation by AngII also leads to critical signaling responses such as activation of Akt/protein kinase B, p70 S6 kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in VSMCs (5Eguchi S.

These data suggest that EGFR transactivation is one of the main points of convergence by which AngII induces several pathophysiological functions in its target organs (10Suzuki H. Motley E.D. Frank G.D. Utsunomiya H. Eguchi S. Curr. Med. Chem. Cardiovasc. Hematol. Agents. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several interesting observations have been made regarding the possible components involved in EGFR transactivation by GPCRs. First, EGFR transactivation by GPCRs appears to require a second messenger directly and/or signal transduction pathways operated by second messengers, such as elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (11Zwick E. Daub H. Aoki N. Yamaguchi-Aoki Y. Tinhofer I. Maly K. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24767-24770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), activation of protein kinase C (12Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4597-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (13Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Standley T. Turkson J. Kraker A.J. Fry D.W. Jove R. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14468-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this regard, the EGFR transactivation by AngII seems to involve elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and production of ROS in VSMCs (7Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H. Matsumoto T.

Both kinases have been shown to be activated by AngII in VSMCs (19Ishida M. Ishida T. Thomas S.M. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Sabri A.

Third, an attractive mechanism for the EGFR transactivation by a GPCR was proposed recently that involves metalloprotease-dependent EGFR ligand production from its membrane-bound precursor (9Eguchi S.

Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The EGF ligand family consists of EGF, heparin binding-EGF like growth factor (HB-EGF), transforming growth factor-α, epiregulin, amphiregulin, epigen, neuregulins, and betacellulin (23Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5633) Google Scholar). Among these, HB-EGF has been most implicated in vascular remodeling because it is a potent mitogen and chemotactic factor for VSMCs and its expression is enhanced in vascular lesions such as atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty (24Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar, 25Berk B.C. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 999-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Like other members of the EGF ligand family, HB-EGF is synthesized as a transmembrane precursor “pro-HB-EGF” that is proteolytically cleaved (“shedding”) to release a biologically active soluble growth factor (26Nanba D. Higashiyama S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, many GPCR agonists appear to mediate EGFR transactivation through this metalloprotease-dependent HB-EGF shedding (27Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). We and others also showed the requirement of HB-EGF for EGFR transactivation through the AT1 receptor (9Eguchi S.

However, the identity of the metalloprotease as well as the detailed signaling mechanisms of HB-EGF shedding by AngII in relation to G protein coupling, second messengers, and upstream kinases are largely unknown. In this study we established a COS7 cell line expressing alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated HB-EGF that enabled us to measure the HB-EGF shedding activity quantitatively. By using this system together with molecular and pharmacological tools including several AT1 receptor mutants, we have elucidated the involvement of heterotrimetric G protein coupling and second messengers (Ca2+ and ROS) in a critical step of a metalloprotease-dependent HB-EGF production. The findings presented here will provide a novel molecular insight by which AngII contributes to cardiovascular diseases.

However, our subsequent findings demonstrated the ability of BiPS to inhibit EGFR transactivation by AngII that was not mediated by matrix metalloproteases (31Saito S. Frank G.D. Motley E.D.

For retroviral infection, 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and cultured for 24 h prior to infection. Cells were incubated with 5 ml of virus stock for 12 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene and then replenished with fresh media.

COS7 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmids by using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) for 24 h with 10% serum, and then the cells were serum-starved for 24 h before stimulation. HB-EGF Shedding Assay—48 h after AT1 receptor transfection, COS7-HBEGF-AP cells were pre-incubated in fresh phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min in the presence or absence of inhibitors and then stimulated by agonists up to 60 min. The HB-EGF-AP secreted into the medium was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (33Frank G.D. Mifune M. Inagami T. Ohba M. Sasaki T. Higashiyama S. Dempsey P.J.

The membranes were then exposed to primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with the peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, the immunoreactive proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescence reaction kit (Chemicon). Intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) Measurements—[Ca2+]i was measured as described previously (43Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu E. Le Dun S. Dun N.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). VSMCs subcultured on coverslips were loaded in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 3 μm fura 2/AM at room temperature for 45 min in the dark and then washed three times with fura 2-free Hanks' balanced salt solution to allow for complete de-esterification of the dye for 15-60 min. Under these conditions, compartmentalization of the dye was minimal. The coverslips were mounted in a custom-designed bath in the stage of a S300 Axiovert Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a C & L Instruments fluorometer system. The fura 2 fluorescence was acquired at a frequency of 1 Hz, and [Ca2+]I values were then obtained as described (43Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu E. Le Dun S. Dun N.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Statistic—Data were analyzed by using the Student's t test. The mean ± S.E. was determined with a significance level of p < 0.05. Results are representative of at least three separate experiments. Metalloprotease and HB-EGF-dependent EGFR Transactivation by AngII in COS7 Cells—Using COS7 cells, we have established a system to examine the mechanism of EGFR transactivation through a GPCR, AT1. For this purpose, COS7 cells were infected with an adenovirus encoding AT1. Compared with the COS7 cells infected with the control adenovirus encoding LacZ, AngII stimulation resulted in marked phosphorylation of the EGFR at Tyr1068, a Grb2-binding site, in COS7 cells expressing AT1 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To determine the involvement of metalloprotease activation in AngII-induced EGFR transactivation in COS7 cells, the effect of a metalloprotease inhibitor, BiPS, on EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr1068 was examined. As we observed previously in VSMCs (31Saito S. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Dempsey P.J. Utsunomiya H. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), BiPS completely inhibited AngII-induced EGFR transactivation in COS7 cells (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate the critical involvement of HB-EGF in AngII-induced EGFR transactivation, the effect of a diphtheria toxin analogue, CRM197, which acts as a specific inhibitor against primate HB-EGF was examined in regard to EGFR phosphorylation. Pretreatment of CRM197 markedly inhibited AngII-induced EGFR transactivation in COS7 cells expressing AT1 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, both BiPS and CRM197 did not affect JAK2 phosphorylation at Tyr1007-Tyr1008 stimulated by AngII. These results clearly demonstrated that COS7 cells expressing AT1 provide an interesting model for studying the mechanism of AngII-induced EGFR transactivation involving metalloprotease-dependent HB-EGF production. To examine the detailed mechanism of metalloprotease-dependent HB-EGF shedding, we took advantage of a reporter assay system using transfection of the HB-EGF-AP plasmid, an established assay for HB-EGF shedding (34Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J.I. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H. Yoshino K. Shirakata Y. Matsuzawa Y. Hashimoto K. Taniguchi N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In COS7 cells permanently expressing this plasmid, we evaluated the shedding activity of HB-EGF by measuring AP activity secreted into the medium. In these cells, there is a gradual but statistically significant accumulation of AP activity in a non-stimulated condition during pre-incubation, suggesting a presence of basal shedding activity of HB-EGF. However, basal shedding was not further enhanced up to 60 min, suggesting a saturated nature of the basal shedding activity. In contrast, a marked and time-dependent enhancement of AP activity was observed when cells were treated with AngII, thus demonstrating the ability of AngII to stimulate HB-EGF shedding. In addition, AngII-induced HB-EGF shedding was completely inhibited by BiPS (data not shown). These findings further indicated that the HB-EGF-AP assay system in a cell line expressing AT1 would be an ideal tool to study the signal transduction mechanism of metalloprotease-dependent HB-EGF shedding and subsequent EGFR transactivation by AngII. AngII Stimulates HB-EGF Shedding through Intracellular Ca2+ Elevation and ROS Production—Previous studies have shown the involvement of Ca2+ and ROS as critical signal intermediates in EGFR transactivation through AT1 in VSMCs (7Eguchi S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Also, protein kinase C may exist upstream of the ROS production (16Seshiah P.N. Weber D.S. Rocic P. Valppu L. Taniyama Y. Griendling K.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In COS7 cells, AngII-induced HB-EGF shedding was completely blocked by pretreatment with TMB-8, an intracellular Ca2+ antagonist, as well as by NAC, a potent antioxidant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, a protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203X, had no significant effect on AngII-induced HB-EGF shedding (Fig. 2B), whereas it markedly inhibited 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced HB-EGF shedding in the COS7 cells (data not shown). Stimulation with a metalloprotease activator, APMA, a Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, and H2O2 resulted in enhanced HB-EGF shedding that was inhibited by pretreatment with BiPS. The basal shedding activity was also partially inhibited by BiPS (Fig. 2C). In addition, we confirmed that APMA and A23187 as well as H2O2 induced EGFR transactivation in COS7 cells (data not shown). Moreover, HB-EGF shedding stimulated by A23187 was completely blocked by NAC (Fig. 2D), whereas H2O2-induced HB-EGF shedding was minimally affected by TMB-8 (data not shown). These results suggest that, in COS7 cells, intracellular Ca2+ elevation and subsequent ROS production are required for a metalloprotease activation that is responsible for EGFR transactivation through AT1. Requirement of Gq Coupling for HB-EGF Shedding through AT1—In addition to Gq,AT1 has been shown to couple Gi,G12, and/or G13, depending on cell type (44Ushio-Fukai M. Griendling K.K. Akers M.

Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although intracellular Ca2+ elevation through AT1 is primarily believed to require Gαq/PLC-β, additional mechanisms involving Gα12/13, Gβγ, PLC-γ, and/or l-type Ca2+ channel have been proposed (44Ushio-Fukai M.

Activation of Gq has been proposed to participate in a GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation (46Seo B. Choy E.W. Maudsley S. Miller W.E. Wilson B.A. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, we examined the contribution of Gq signaling in HB-EGF shedding induced by AngII by using an adenovirus encoding the C-terminal fragment of Gαq termed GqI, a selective Gq inhibitor (48Akhter S.A.

When fibroblasts attach to collagen, Akt becomes phosphorylated, providing a survival signal. In contrast, in response to mechanical forces generated during collagen contraction, Akt is dephosphorylated and fibroblasts undergo apoptosis. The kinase(s) responsible for regulating Akt phosphorylation in response to matrix-derived mechanical signals are unclear. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is associated with the β1 integrin in the focal adhesion complex and as such is a candidate kinase that may regulate Akt phosphorylation and fibroblast viability.

In contrast, enforced activation of β1 integrin by activating antibody preserved ILK and Akt activity during collagen matrix contraction, and this is associated with protection from collagen contraction-induced apoptosis. Knock-down of ILK by small, interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated Akt phosphorylation in response to ligation of β1 integrin by collagen or activating antibody and enhanced fibroblast apoptosis in response to collagen contraction. Kinase dead ILK attenuated Akt phosphorylation and enhanced fibroblast apoptosis, whereas hyperactive and wild type ILK augmented Akt phosphorylation and protected fibroblasts from apoptosis.

During tissue development and repair, cells respond to cues derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM), 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PI, phosphatidylinositol; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase. and in the process such cellular functions as cell viability may be modulated. As an example, in the early phase of tissue repair, proliferating fibroblasts deposit type I collagen in the wound space. However, during resolution of tissue repair fibroblasts contract the type I collagen matrix and subsequently undergo apoptosis (1Desmouliere A. Redard M. Darby I. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 46: 56-66Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism governing the removal of fibroblasts during tissue repair is unclear, because fibroblasts are removed upon wound contraction biophysical signals derived from the ECM have been implicated as an important determinant (2Grinnell F.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ability of the cell to detect alterations in the ECM and respond accordingly is mediated through integrins. Integrins are cell surface receptors that link the ECM with intracellular signaling molecules and the actin cytoskeleton (4Ruoslahti E.

ECM-integrin interaction may influence cell viability via at least two basic mechanisms. First, direct ligation of integrin by the ECM promotes anchorage-dependent cell survival (4Ruoslahti E.

Mirroring the physiologic elimination of fibroblasts upon wound contraction, fibroblasts in three-dimensional collagen gels undergo apoptosis in response to collagen matrix contraction (1Desmouliere A.

We have employed the three-dimensional collagen gel model to study the molecular mechanism by which collagen matrix contraction regulates fibroblast viability. We have found that in response to mechanical forces generated during collagen matrix contraction, a β1 integrin/PI 3-kinase/Akt signal pathway regulates fibroblast viability (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). During collagen matrix contraction FAK and Akt become dephosphorylated, and fibroblasts subsequently undergo apoptosis (11Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Modulation in FAK and Akt activity are mediated through the β1 integrin, as enforced activation of β1 integrin by activating β1 integrin antibody up-regulates FAK and Akt activity and protects fibroblasts from contraction-induced apoptosis (11Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Within the type I collagen matrix, FAK functions as an integrin-associated signaling molecule that is upstream of PI 3-kinase/Akt. FAK transduces type I collagen-β1 integrin viability signals that modulate PI 3-kinase and Akt activity. The identities of β1 integrin-associated signaling molecule(s) downstream of PI 3-kinase that are responsible for directly modulating Akt phosphorylation in response to collagen contraction-derived mechanical signals are not known. It has been demonstrated that ligation of β1 integrin by type I collagen or enforced activation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin-activating antibody phosphorylates serine 473 of Akt corresponding to full activation of the kinase (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the precise kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt remain unclear. One such candidate kinase that has been implicated in direct phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt is integrin-linked kinase or ILK (13Persad S.P. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ILK is a serine-threonine kinase that couples integrins to downstream signaling pathways that regulate a variety of cellular functions including cell viability. In this respect, in some systems ILK has been shown to function downstream of PI 3-kinase in promoting phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt (14Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Delcommenne M. Troussard A. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ILK may facilitate Akt phosphorylation is controversial. Several studies suggest that ILK activity may be responsible for phosphorylating serine 473 of Akt (13Persad S.P. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, other studies indicate that ILK functioning as an adapter protein rather than a kinase may facilitate activation of Akt (17Sakai T. Li S. Docheva D. Grashoff C. Sakai K. Kostka G. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Yurcheno P.D. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Lynch D.K. Ellis C.A. Edwards P.A. Hiles I.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 8024-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent report found that ILK was capable of regulating endothelial cell survival in an Akt-independent manner (19Friedrich E.B. Emerson L. Sumita S. Cook S. Milstone D.S. MacRae C.A. Mariotti M. Kuhlencordt P.J. Force T. Rosenzweig A. St.-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Gerszten R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8134-8144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of ILK in regulating cell survival appears to be complex and, depending on the cell system being analyzed, may involve Akt-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Multiple exogenous stimuli have been shown to activate ILK; these include direct integrin ligation by the ECM and growth factor and chemokine activation (20Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 21Friedrich E.B. Sinha S. Ling L. Dedhar S. Force T. Rosenzweig A. Gerszten R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although these data suggest a possible link between ILK activity and the regulation of Akt phosphorylation, currently there is no direct evidence that matrix-derived mechanical forces sensed by integrin receptors modulate ILK activity and cell viability in an Akt-dependent manner. In the present study, we present data establishing that collagen matrix contraction-derived mechanical signals sensed by β1 integrin are capable of modulating ILK activity, which regulates fibroblast viability through an Akt-dependent mechanism. Cell Culture—Human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and used between passages 9 and 11. Antibodies and Reagents—TS2/16 β1 integrin-activating antibody was produced from hybridoma cell culture (ATCC, HB-243). Mouse monoclonal antibody P5D2 (raised against the human β1 integrin sub-unit) was provided by Dr. Leo Furcht (University of Minnesota). Anti-polyclonal Akt antibody, anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody, the cleaved form of caspase-9 antibody, GSK3β antibody, and ILK antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-monoclonal ILK for immunoprecipitation was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Wortmannin was from Sigma-Aldrich, and anti-monoclonal β1 integrin antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Myc-His-tagged Akt1 (activated), hyperactive ILK cDNA (S343D mutation), and kinase dead ILK (E359K) in pUSE amp vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology; FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for the transfection of ILK and Akt (activated) constructs to fibroblasts. Collagen Gel Assay—Collagen gels were prepared as described previously (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human lung fibroblasts (1.2 × 105) were resuspended in 2.0 ml of 1.5× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Vitrogen (3 mg/ml; Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) was added to the cell suspension to achieve a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The cell/collagen solution was incubated in a water bath for 10 min at 37 °C, poured into 3.5-cm uncoated plastic dishes, and placed in a cell culture incubator at 10% CO2 and 37 °C, where the gels polymerized in ∼30-60 min. ILK and Control siRNA—siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon (Germantown, MD). Twenty-one base sequences of the human ILK gene targeting the pleckstrin homology domain of ILK (ILK-H) were chosen as described previously with minor modifications (22Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A. St.-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22374-22378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ILK sense siRNA sequence is 5′ GCU CAA CGA GAA UCA CUC UdTT 3′; ILK antisense siRNA sequence is 5′ AGA GUG AUU CUC GUU GAG CdTT 3′. A control non-silencing siRNA was derived from bacteria, Thermotoga maritima. Control sense sequence is 5′ UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTT 3′; control antisense sequence is 5′ ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTT 3′. Transient transfection of HLF-210 fibroblasts was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Fibroblasts were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm Na2P2O7, 1 mm glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein G-coupled agarose beads and immunoprecipitated overnight (16 h) at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody. Western analysis of human lung fibroblasts was performed as described previously (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were subjected to 8-10% SDS-PAGE and transferred (45 min, 24 V) to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 containing 6% nonfat dry milk, incubated with the primary antibody, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The membranes were developed using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro ILK Assay—Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with ILK or control siRNA. Alternatively, cells were transfected with hyperactive ILK or kinase dead ILK. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-ILK antibody. 1 μg of GSK3β fusion protein (Cell Signaling) was then added to the immunoprecipitated lysates in 1× kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) followed by incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. After reaction, 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03% bromphenol blue) was added to terminate reaction. Samples were analyzed by Western analysis with phospho-GSK3β and total GSK3β antibodies. Anoikis Assay—Anoikis assays were performed as described by Frisch and Francis (23Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Tissue culture plates were coated twice with poly-HEME (4 mg/ml in ethanol; Sigma) and rinsed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Fibroblasts resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were plated on the PolyHeme plates. At the indicated times, the cells in suspension were recovered and analyzed by fluorescence TUNEL assay. TUNEL Assay—Fibroblasts recovered from anoikis assays and type I collagen gels were analyzed for apoptosis using an in situ cell death detection kit (fluorescence TUNEL assay; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, recovered cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 60 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in TUNEL reaction mixture, incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (24Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Experiments were performed three times. For assessment of the percentage of apoptotic cells within collagen gels or on dishes coated with PolyHeme using the TUNEL assay, microscopic analysis of at least 200 cells/slide was performed. Paired evaluations were made for experimental and control conditions within each experiment, and significance was determined by Student's t test. Significance level was set at p < 0.05. ILK and Akt Activity Decrease during Collagen Matrix Contraction—When fibroblasts are cultured in three-dimensional contractile collagen matrices, they initially attach and spread. This is associated with phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, subsequently with the onset of collagen matrix contraction, the fibroblasts become progressively round in appearance, which correlates with dephosphorylation of Akt and induction of apoptosis (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To begin to assess whether changes in ILK activity modulate Akt activity and fibroblast viability, we first examined ILK activity as a function of time during collagen matrix contraction. Fibroblasts incorporated into contractile collagen gels were lysed directly in the gels at various times during contraction. ILK was immunoprecipitated, and phosphorylation of GSK3β and total GSK3β were examined by Western analysis. ILK phosphorylates serine 9 of GSK3β and therefore has been used as a surrogate marker of ILK activity (22Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A. St.-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22374-22378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25Persad S. Troussard A.A. McPhee T.R. Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Within the first hour of fibroblast incorporation into collagen gels, both ILK and Akt activity increased slightly (Fig. 1A). This correlated with initial fibroblast attachment and spreading within the matrix. However, within 3 h, ILK activity had begun to decline; this decline correlated with the onset of collagen matrix contraction (Fig. 1B). Akt activity was still preserved at the 3-h time point. Moreover, as collagen matrix contraction progressed, ILK activity became markedly suppressed, and this was associated with a progressive decline in Akt activity. Note that by 22 h, a time point at which we had previously found that collagen matrix contraction is mostly completed and fibroblast apoptosis is triggered (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), both ILK and Akt activity were largely abrogated. In contrast, ILK and Akt activity increased in non-contractile collagen gels as a function of time (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with our previous finding that Akt activity does not decrease under non-contractile conditions and that fibroblasts remain viable (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These data indicate that collagen contraction down-regulates ILK activity. The correlation between the decline in ILK and Akt activity, with decreases in ILK activity preceding Akt, was consistent with a causal role for ILK in regulating fibroblast viability in contractile collagen matrices via modulation of Akt activity. Ligation of β1 Integrin by Type I Collagen or by β1 Integrin-activating Antibody Phosphorylates Serine 473 of Akt in a PI 3-Kinase-dependent Fashion—We have previously shown that fibroblast viability in type I collagen matrices is regulated by the β1 integrin and involves a PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Upon ligation of β1 integrin by type I collagen or by β1 integrin-activating antibody, serine 473 of Akt becomes phosphorylated in a PI 3-kinase-dependent fashion indicating full activation of the kinase (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Xia H. Nho R.S. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33024-33034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). For these experiments, lung fibroblasts were plated on type I collagen-coated dishes, and phosphorylation of Akt was examined by Western analysis at the indicated times. Akt phosphorylation increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The increase in Akt activity was inhibited by β1 integrin-blocking antibody (data not shown) or wortmannin pretreatment (Fig. 2A). Similarly, Akt activity increased when lung fibroblasts were treated with β1 integrin-activating antibody (Fig. 2B). Ligation of β1 Integrin by Type I collagen or by β1 Integrin-activating Antibody Increases ILK Activity—Because ILK has been implicated in the phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt downstream of PI 3-kinase, we examined the effect of ligation of β1 integrin by collagen or activating antibody on ILK activity. Serum-starved fibroblasts were plated on type I collagen dishes, and phosphorylation of serine 9 of GSK3β and total GSK3β levels were examined. We found that phosphorylation of serine 9 of GSK3β increased as a function of time as fibroblasts spread and adhered on type I collagen (Fig. 3A, left panel). Total GSK3β levels did not change. The increase in phosphorylation of serine 9 of GSK3β could be inhibited by blocking β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction by preincubating the cells with β1 integrin-blocking antibody (Fig. 3A, right panel). These data indicate that ILK activity increases as fibroblasts adhere to type I collagen and that the increase in ILK activity is dependent on β1 integrin-type I collagen interaction. As shown in Fig. 2, enforced activation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin-activating antibody promotes phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt (3Tian B. Lessan K. Kahm J. Kleidon J. Henke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24667-24675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine the effect of ligation of β1 integrin by activating antibody on ILK activity. In these experiments serum-starved fibroblasts were plated in suspension culture, β1 integrin-activating antibody was added to the cells in suspension, and GSK3β phosphorylation was measured. Similar to ligation of β1 integrin with type I collagen, we found that enforced activation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin antibody increased phosphorylation of serine 9 of GSK3β (Fig. 3B, left panel). To determine whether this increase in ILK activity was dependent upon PI 3-kinase, the cells were preincubated with wortmannin prior to ligation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin-activating antibody. Wortmannin effectively inhibited the increase in ILK activity in response to enforced activation of β1 integrin-activating antibody (Fig. 3B, right panel). These data suggested that ILK may be down-stream of PI 3-kinase in mediating phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt in response to ligation of β1 integrin by type I collagen or enforced activation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin-activating antibody. Ligation of β1 Integrin with β1 Integrin-activating Antibody Promotes Association of ILK with β1 Integrin and Akt—Following ligation of β1 integrin, ILK can be found in the focal adhesion complex associated with β1 integrin. Therefore, we sought to determine whether enforced activation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin-activating antibody would promote the association of ILK with β1 integrin. Serum-starved fibroblasts were treated with β1 integrin-activating antibody, ILK was immunoprecipitated, and β1 integrin was immunoblotted. The physical association of ILK with β1 integrin increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that ILK is recruited to β1 integrin in response to ligation with β1 integrin-activating antibody. We next investigated the effect of ligation of β1 integrin by activating antibody on the association of ILK with Akt. The association of ILK with Akt increased in a time-dependent fashion, and this interaction correlated with the degree of phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that ligation of β1 integrin by activating antibody promotes the interaction of ILK with β1 integrin and the association of ILK with Akt, and this correlates with phosphorylation of Akt. Therefore, these results, combined with our previous data demonstrating that enforced activation of β1 integrin by β1 integrin-activating antibody promotes both an increase in ILK activity and the phosphorylation of serine 473 of Akt, suggested a link between the increase in ILK activity"

Here we report a novel function of ALDH3A1 as a negative cell cycle regulator. We noticed a reduction in ALDH3A1 gene expression in actively proliferating primary human corneal epithelium explant cultures, indicating that ALDH3A1 expression is inversely correlated with replication. To examine this further, a human corneal epithelial cell line (HCE) lacking endogenous ALDH3A1 was stably transfected to express ALDH3A1 at levels similar to those found in vivo. ALDH3A1-transfected cells exhibited an elongated cell cycle, decreased plating efficiency, and reduced DNA synthesis compared with the mock-transfected cells. These effects were associated with reduced cyclin A- and cyclin B-dependent kinase activities and reduced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) as well as decreased protein levels of cyclins A, B, and E, the transcription factor E2F1, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. These observations were further expanded and confirmed on human keratinocyte cells (NCTC-2544) overexpressing ALDH3A1. Consistent with a protective role of an elongated cell cycle, ALDH3A1-transfected cells exhibited increased resistance to the cytotoxic effects of the DNA-damaging agents mitomycin C and Vp-16. Immunohistochemistry and biochemical fractionation revealed that ALDH3A1 is localized both in the nucleus and cytosol of ALDH3A1-transfected cells, implying a possible association between the nuclear localization of the enzyme and its proliferation-suppressive functions. In conclusion, these results suggest that ALDH3A1 may protect corneal epithelial cells against oxidative damage not only through its metabolic function but also by prolonging the cell cycle.

The corneal epithelium is a self-renewing stratified epithelial tissue that maintains transparency and protects the underlying structures of the eye. It is characterized by continuous cell turnover and contains proliferating basal cells and differentiating suprabasal and intermediate cells as well as terminally differentiated superficial squamous cells that eventually desquamate. The corneal epithelium is maintained by the centripetal migration of proliferating basal corneal epithelial cells derived from the stem cells located in the limbal epithelium (1Kruse F.E. Eye. 1994; 8: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The proliferating basal corneal epithelial cells give rise to transient amplifying cells that can undergo a limited number of cell divisions before following a pathway of terminal differentiation (2Cotsarelis G.

The intermediate cells of the corneal epithelium are post-mitotic and, together with the terminally differentiated cells, are incapable of cell division (4Lehrer M.S. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The superficial epithelial cells are finally removed into the tear pool by a variety of mechanisms including apoptosis (5Ren H. Wilson G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1017-1025PubMed Google Scholar). The cornea serves as barrier between the external environment and the internal ocular tissues, protecting them against oxidative stimuli that include solar radiation and molecular oxygen. Mammalian corneal epithelial cells express high levels of ALDH3A1 1The abbreviations used are: ALDH3A1, aldehyde dehydrogenase 3A1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HCE, human corneal epithelial cell line; NCTC-2544, human skin keratinocyte cell line; 4-HNE, 4-hydroxynonenal; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because this enzyme represents nearly half of the total soluble protein in the corneal epithelium, levels that exceed those required for normal metabolism, it has been proposed to be a corneal crystallin, mimicking the situation in the lens (6Piatigorsky J. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Piatigorsky J. Kozmik Z. Horwitz J. Ding L. Carosa E. Robison Jr., W.G. Steinbach P.J. Tamm E.R. J. Biol.

Additional functions have been hypothesized regarding the role of ALDH3A1 in corneal epithelium. These include direct absorption of UV radiation, scavenging of UV-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and a chaperone-like function preventing aggregation of partially denatured proteins (10Manzer R. Pappa A. Estey T. Sladek N. Carpenter J.F. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143-144: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that ALDH3A1 protects corneal epithelial cells against oxidative damage induced by either UV radiation or the highly reactive product of lipid peroxidation 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) (7Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, we have reported that ALDH3A1 is expressed mainly in the suprabasal cells of the corneal epithelium (8Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which are known to be post-mitotic (4Lehrer M.S. Sun T.T. Lavker R.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible function of ALDH3A1 as a modulator of proliferation in the corneal epithelium. We report here a novel role of ALDH3A1 in retarding corneal epithelial cell cycle progression that might contribute to its ocular protective effects. ALDH3A1 Stably Transfected Cell Lines—The SV-40-transformed corneal epithelial cell lines (HCE, ATCC CRL-11135) stably transfected with the mammalian expression vector ΔpCEP4 alone (Mock-HCE) or with the human ALDH3A1 cDNA (ALDH3A1-HCE) along with tissue culture conditions have been described elsewhere (7Pappa A.

NCTC-2544 keratinocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 25 mm Hepes, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. NCTC-2544 cells were transfected with the same expression vectors used in the HCE cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable cell populations were selected by incubation in media containing hygromycin (0.4 mg/ml) (Invitrogen), and allowed to form colonies that were further expanded. ALDH3A1 expression was screened using Western blot analyses, enzyme activity assays, and immunofluorescence (as described below). Primary Explant Cultures of Human Corneal Epithelium—A normal corneal rim was obtained after the central cornea had been removed by a surgeon from patients presenting with penetrating keratoplasty (Institutional Review Board protocol 2004-3543). The remnant was trimmed in the laboratory after locating the scleral/corneal junction to 3 mm either side of this border. This was then cut into 16 equal-sized wedges and placed onto gelatin-coated plates. Media/keratinocyte-serum-free medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor (5 ng/ml) and bovine pituitary extract (50 μg/ml) containing penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) was placed into each dish and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Half of the dishes received the same media with the further addition of cholera toxin (0.1 μg/ml) and Me2SO (0.5%). The media were changed every other day, and the outgrowth of epithelial cells was monitored by microscopy. On day 5 the residual tissue was removed, and cultures continued until confluence was reached (∼2 weeks). On days 5, 6, and 7 and at confluence cells were harvested and processed for RNA isolation, Western blot analysis, and immunofluorescence. Reverse transcription was performed using 100 ng of total RNA and random hexamers followed by PCR with primers designed from the ALDH3A1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_000691) and spanning 3 exons. Primers were 5′-TGTTCTCCAGCAACGACAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGACCTTCAGGCCTTCATC-3′. Primer specificities were confirmed by a BLAST Internet software-assisted search of the non-redundant nucleotide sequence data base. PCRs were carried out with 5-25 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA, Taq polymerase buffer (200 μm deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, 1.25 units of Taq polymerase, and 200 nm forward and reverse primers), in a total volume of 50 μl. PCR controls without reverse transcriptase or with normal human genomic DNA (as a template) were routinely negative. Western Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotted according to previously described methods (7Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used included monoclonal anti-ALDH3A1 (8Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), antibodies to cyclin A (sc-751), cyclin B (sc-245), cyclin E (sc-481), retinoblastoma (sc-102; recognizes both the unphosphorylated (pRb) and phosphorylated form (ppRb)), E2F1 (sc-193), and SV-40 large T antigen (obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-β-tubulin (Sigma), anti-lamin B1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Franscisco, CA). Anti-chicken, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-conjugated horseradish peroxidase antibodies were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Jackson, West Grove, PA). When necessary, the antibodies were stripped from the membrane with stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 6 μl/ml 2-mercaptoethanol) and re-probed with an alternate antibody. Labeled proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. ALDH3A1 Enzymatic Assay—ALDH3A1 activity was determined using 0.5 mm benzaldehyde (substrate) and 2.5 mm NADP+ (coenzyme) as described previously (7Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). ALDH3A1 activity was normalized to total cytosolic or nuclear protein concentration measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Growth Curves and BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—Cells (1 × 104) of each clone were plated in a 12-well dish. The growth rate of cells was determined by counting the number of cells with a hemocytometer as a function of time. Cell growth curves were plotted, and cell population doubling times and length of cell cycles were calculated from the linear component of the exponential growth phase (GraphPad Prism 4.0, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For BrdUrd incorporation assays, cells (5 × 104) were plated in 96-well dishes and treated with 100 μm BrdUrd for 24 h. BrdUrd incorporation was determined using a non-isotopic enzyme immunoassay (Oncogene, Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Colony Formation Assay—Cells (5 × 103) were plated in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air to allow colony formation. The cultures were monitored on a daily basis, and when colonies were visible (∼2 weeks later) cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies containing ≥50 cells were scored and counted. Histone H1 Kinase Assay—Cells (2 × 106) grown in 100-mm plates were harvested and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E, and associated kinase activities were determined using histone H1 (Roche Diagnostics) as the substrate as described previously (12DeGregori J. Leone G. Ohtani K. Miron A. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2873-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—HCE and NCTC-2544 cells were grown in the appropriate media on glass coverslips, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then fixed with 4% buffered formalin in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in cold methanol, washed with PBS, and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against human ALDH3A1 (1:1) for 1 h. The cells were subsequently washed with PBS and stained with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:20). Enzyme distribution was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY), a xenon continuous arc light source (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA), and a Zeiss 40× Plan Neofluar objective lens (numerical aperture = 1.3) and monitored through a CCD camera (Sensicam, Cooke Corp., Auburn Hills, MI). Texas Red fluorescence was excited at 555 nm, and emission was measured at 617 nm. 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) fluorescence was excited with 360 nm light, and emission was measured at 457 nm. Immunostaining of human corneal epithelial explants was conducted as follows. Corneal epithelial explant cultures (n = 2) were washed in media and then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with acetone/methanol (-20 °C) and then incubated in PBS for 15 min. Primary antibody was applied to the cells and incubated in a moist chamber for 60 min. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) for 60 min in a moist, dark chamber. After a washing step with PBS, the cells were examined and photographed using a Leica inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss 63× oil immersion lens (numerical aperture = 1.4) on a Zeiss Axioskop 2FS MOT that is part of a Zeiss LSM 510 system (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). The pixel size for the laser scans was 0.29 × 0.29 μm. For nuclear staining with DAPI, fluorescence was measured using 458 nm of excitation (argon laser) and 480-520 nm of emission. Texas Red fluorescence was measured using 543 nm of excitation (He-Ne laser) and >560 nm of emission. The overall z axis resolution was 0.8 μm (confocality <0.8 μm for Texas Red and <0.6 nm for DAPI). Intensity profiles were generated from image analysis using ImageJ software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). Preparation of Cellular and Nuclear Extracts—Total cell lysates were prepared as described previously (13Vasiliou V. Qamar L. Pappa A. Sophos N.A. Petersen D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the preparation of cytosolic and nuclear extracts, freshly collected cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and incubated in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and washed 4 times in buffer A. The nuclear extracts were isolated by incubation of the nuclei in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. DNA Fragmentation Assay—Cells (1 × 106) were treated with either Vp-16 (50 μm, Sigma) or mitomycin C (5 μg/ml, Sigma) for 16 h. After treatment cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated overnight at 50 °C. DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and subsequently incubated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C.DNA samples were analyzed using conventional electrophoresis in 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel and visualized under UV illumination. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparison of results between different groups was performed by Student's t test using SigmaPlot (Version 7.0, 2001). Expression of ALDH3A1 in Primary Explant Cultures of Corneal Epithelium—ALDH3A1 gene expression was studied in primary explant cultures of corneal epithelium. As shown in Fig. 1, ALDH3A1 expression appears to be down-regulated during corneal epithelial proliferation. Explant cultures at days 5 and 6 and confluence had progressively less product regardless of whether cholera toxin, known to help maintain expression of ALDH3A1 in primary rat corneal explants (14Boesch J.S. Lee C. Lindahl R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5150-5157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was included in the medium (Fig. 1A). When examined by Western analysis, cultures at days 5 and 6 did have detectable ALDH3A1, although these levels appeared to be decreasing (Fig. 1A); at confluence, ALDH3A1 was not detectable (not shown). The reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed the expected 230-bp product as detected in direct isolates of corneal epithelium (Fig. 1B, lanes a-d). When day 7 cultures were examined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C), the staining pattern was non-uniform in the cell and appeared to be associated with discreet vesicles and cellular remnants not containing nuclei (note arrowheads). These data demonstrate a progressive loss of the ALDH3A1 gene expression in the actively proliferating primary explant cultures of corneal epithelium. Expression of ALDH3A1 in Human Corneal Epithelial Cells Inhibits Cell Growth—We have generated a stable-transfected human corneal cell line (ALDH3A1-HCE) expressing a metabolically active human ALDH3A1 at levels comparable with those found in vivo (7Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A) and Western immunoblotting (Fig. 2B) confirmed expression of the enzyme in ALDH3A1-HCE cells and the absence of the protein from parental (naïve) HCE cells or from HCE cells transfected with empty vector alone. One of the distinctive phenotypic changes that we have observed previously in ALDH3A1-HCE cells is a slower proliferation rate than the mock-transfected HCE cells or parental HCE cells (data not shown). For this reason the characteristics of growth curve, cell population doubling time, DNA synthesis, and plating efficiency were examined. ALDH3A1-HCE cells demonstrated a significantly slower growth rate compared with the mock-HCE cells (Fig. 2C). The doubling time and the length of cell cycle in mock-HCE cells were found to be 1.8 and 2.7 days, respectively (Table I). Similar values were determined for the parental HCE cells (data not shown). Expression of ALDH3A1 in HCE cells increased the doubling time to 4.1 days and the length of cell cycle to 5.9 days (Table I). In addition, expression of the enzyme was associated with a significantly reduced DNA synthesis as indicated by BrdUrd incorporation assays (Fig. 2D). Consistent with these findings, ALDH3A1-HCE cells showed a 70% decrease in colony formation efficiency relative to mock-HCE cells (Fig. 2E). Because the HCE cell line is SV-40-transformed (11Araki-Sasaki K. Ohashi Y. Sasabe T. Hayashi K. Watanabe H. Tano Y. Handa H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 614-621PubMed Google Scholar), we examined if the decreased cell proliferation resulted from disruption of the SV40 large tumor T antigen after ALDH3A1 transfection. There were no apparent differences between any of the cells lines in expression of SV40 large tumor T antigen (Fig. 2F).Table IALDH3A1 retards cell proliferation in stably transfected HCE and NCTC-2544 cellsMock-HCEALDH3A1-HCEMock-NCTCALDH3A1-NCTCDoubling time (days)1.8 ± 0.114.1 ± 0.60ap < 0.001 (Student's t test; compared to mock-transfected cells).1.4 ± 0.093.8 ± 0.61ap < 0.001 (Student's t test; compared to mock-transfected cells).Length of cell cycle (days)2.7 ± 0.165.9 ± 0.87ap < 0.001 (Student's t test; compared to mock-transfected cells).2.0 ± 0.145.4 ± 0.89ap < 0.001 (Student's t test; compared to mock-transfected cells).a p < 0.001 (Student's t test; compared to mock-transfected cells). Open table in a new tab Overexpression of ALDH3A1 in Human Keratinocytes Inhibits Cell Growth—To test whether the effect of ALDH3A1 on cell growth was specific to HCE cells, we overexpressed ALDH3A1 in a human keratinocyte cell line NCTC-2544, which is a spontaneously transformed human epithelial cell line that expresses ALDH3A1. Transfection of ALDH3A1 into NCTC-2544 cells resulted in a 4-fold overexpression of ALDH3A1 (Fig. 3A, lane 3) relative to parental (Fig. 3A, lane 1) or mock (empty vector)-transfected (Fig. 3A, lane 2) cells. The enzymatic activity of ALDH3A1 in cellular extracts was also significantly elevated in ALDH3A1-NCTC-2544 cells (123 ± 18 nmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein) when compared with parental cells (26 ± 4 NADPH/min/mg of protein) or mock-transfected cells (28 ± 5 nmol of NADPH/min/mg of protein). Overexpression of ALDH3A1 increased the doubling time and the length of the cell cycle in ALDH3A1-NCTC-2544 cells to 3.8 and 5.4 days, respectively, whereas mock-transfected cells were estimated to be 1.4 and 2.0 days, respectively (Table I). BrdUrd incorporation revealed that expression of ALDH3A1 is associated with reduced DNA synthesis (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, ALDH3A1-NCTC-2544 cells exhibited a significantly lower plating efficiency relative to mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). Expression of ALDH3A1 Inhibits Cyclin-dependent Kinase Activities—To gain further insight into the mechanism by which ALDH3A1 affects the cell cycle progression, we examined the activities of the cyclins A, B, and E in extracts from mock- and ALDH3A1-transfected HCE and NCTC-2544 cells. A significant reduction in all cyclin-associated activities was observed in HCE and NCTC-2544 cells transfected to express ALDL3A1 when compared with their respective mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4). Altered Expression Profiles of Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins in ALDH3A1-transfected Cells—Because the cell cycle is controlled by expression and activation of several cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, we addressed whether their expression levels were altered by the presence of ALDH3A1. Protein expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in mock-HCE, ALDH3A1-HCE, and ALDH3A1-NCTC-2544 cells were examined (Fig. 5). When compared with mock-transfected cells, expression of cyclin A was decreased, whereas expression of cyclins B and E were abolished in ALDH3A1-expressing cells compared with mock-transfected cells. Expression of ALDH3A1 was also associated with reduction of the phosphorylated form of pRb. Decreased levels of E2F1 and its target p21 (15Wunderlich M. Berberich S.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4414-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were also observed in ALDH3A1-expressing HCE and NCTC-2544 cells relative to their mock-transfected counterparts. Expression of ALDH3A1 Protects HCE Cells against Apoptosis Induced by DNA-damaging Agents—We have shown that ALDH3A1 protects human corneal epithelial cells from either UV- or 4-HNE-induced apoptosis (7Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Inhibition of apoptosis was attributable to the role of ALDH3A1 in metabolizing (and, thus, eliminating) toxic lipid peroxidation aldehyde byproducts (7Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The association of ALDH3A1 with inhibition of cell growth led us to hypothesize that ALDH3A1 retards the cell cycle, thus promoting cell survival. To examine this possibility, ALDH3A1- and mock-HCE cells were treated with DNA-damaging agents (viz. mitomycin C or Vp-16), and apoptosis was evaluated by the DNA fragmentation assay. In the absence of drug treatment, no DNA laddering was apparent in either ALDH3A1-HCE or mock-HCE cells. Upon treatment with either mitomycin C or Vp-16, DNA fragmentation occurred to a significant extent in the mock-HCE cells but only to a minor extent in ALDH3A1-HCE cells (Fig. 6). Cellular Localization of ALDH3A1 in ALDH3A1-HCE Cells—The involvement of ALDH3A1 in the regulation of cell cycle is intriguing, and as yet we do not know the exact mechanism by which this protein may exert its inhibitory effect on the cell cycle. The distribution pattern of a protein within the cell may provide important information regarding this function. We have, therefore, used a combination of confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical fractionation to visualize and determine the distribution of ALDH3A1 in ALDH3A1-HCE cells. Expression of ALDH3A1 was detected in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments in ALDH3A1-HCE cells (Fig. 7A, top panel). Although ALDH3A1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm, a significant amount of the protein appeared to be localized in the nucleus. Fig. 7A, bottom panel, also shows the intensity profile of nuclear and ALDH3A1 staining (expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units) generated by image analysis. By examining the fluorescence intensity at different focal planes and at the same confocality, we ensured that the fluorescence could not have originated from the cytoplasm present above or below the nucleus. To confirm the nuclear localization of ALDH3A1, we employed a biochemical fractionation procedure followed by Western blot analysis and enzymatic assays. Immunoblot analysis of cytosolic and nuclear fractions in ALDH3A1-HCE cells indicated the presence of ALDH3A1 in the cytosol and the nucleus in these cells (Fig. 7B). Tubulin was used as a cytosolic marker, whereas lamin B1 was used as a nuclear marker. The absence of lamin B1 and β-tubulin from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, respectively, verifies the effectiveness of the isolation processes and argues against the notion that ALDH3A1 in the nuclear compartment may be a cytoplasmic fraction contaminant. Enzyme activity analyses (Fig. 7C) revealed that ALDH3A1 activity was greater in the cytoplasmic compartment than in the nuclear compartment. In this study, we report a novel function of ALDH3A1 associated with inhibition of cellular growth. We used human HCE and skin keratinocytes (NCTC-2544) to investigate the role of ALDH3A1 in modulating cell proliferation. We provide evidence that ALDH3A1 serves as an inhibitor of cell growth. First, proliferating primary corneal epithelial cells exhibited a gradually decreasing ALDH3A1 expression. Second, induced expression of ALDH3A1 in HCE cells, which do not constitutively express the enzyme, resulted in growth inhibition. Overexpression of ALDH3A1 in NCTC-2544 cells, which constitutively"
https://openalex.org/W1970989906,"The polycomb group proteins are required for the stable maintenance of gene repression patterns established during development. They function as part of large multiprotein complexes created via a multitude of protein-protein interaction domains. Here we examine the interaction between the SAM domains of the polycomb group proteins polyhomeotic (Ph) and Sex-comb-on-midleg (Scm). Previously we showed that Ph-SAM polymerizes as a helical structure. We find that Scm-SAM also polymerizes, and a crystal structure reveals an architecture similar to the Ph-SAM polymer. These results suggest that Ph-SAM and Scm-SAM form a copolymer. Binding affinity measurements between Scm-SAM and Ph-SAM subunits in different orientations indicate a preference for the formation of a single junction copolymer. To provide a model of the copolymer, we determined the structure of the Ph-SAM/Scm-SAM junction. Similar binding modes are observed in both homo- and heterocomplex formation with minimal change in helix axis direction at the polymer joint. The copolymer model suggests that polymeric Scm complexes could extend beyond the local domains of polymeric Ph complexes on chromatin, possibly playing a role in long range repression."
https://openalex.org/W2053430492,"Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase responsible for the maintenance of one strand of the telomere terminal repeats. It consists minimally of a catalytic protein component (TERT) and an RNA subunit that provides the template. Compared with prototypical reverse transcriptases, telomerase is unique in possessing a DNA binding domain (anchor site) that is distinct from the catalytic site. Yeast TERT mutants bearing deletion or point mutations in an N-terminal domain (known as N-GQ) were found to be selectively impaired in extending primers that form short hybrids with telomerase RNA. The mutants also suffered a significant loss of repeat addition processivity but displayed an enhancement in nucleotide addition processivity. Furthermore, the mutants manifested altered primer utilization properties for oligonucleotides containing non-telomeric residues in the 5′-region. Cross-linking studies indicate that the N-GQ domain physically contacts the 5′-region of the DNA substrate in the context of a telomerase-telomere complex. Together, these results implicate the N-GQ domain of TERT as a physical and functional constituent of the telomerase anchor site. Coupled with previous genetic analysis, our data confirm that anchor site interaction is indeed important for telomerase function in vivo.

Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that is responsible for maintaining the terminal repeats of telomeres in most organisms (1Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 405-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). It acts as an unusual reverse transcriptase, using a small segment of an integral RNA component as template for the synthesis of the dG-rich strand of telomeres (2Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). The enzymatic core of telomerase consists minimally of two components, a reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; CTE, C-terminal extension. -like protein that catalyzes nucleotide addition (named TERT), and an RNA in which the template is embedded (for reviews see Refs. 3Nugent C.I.

Telomerase RNAs are evolutionarily divergent in sequence, but recent studies suggest that they share a number of key structural elements, including a template segment, a pseudoknot, and a long-range base-pairing element (for reviews, see Refs. 7Lin J. Ly H. Hussain A. Abraham M. Pearl S. Tzfati Y. Parslow T. Blackburn E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and 8Chen J. Greider C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14683-14684Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The TERT protein, on the other hand, is well conserved in evolution and possesses a central domain with significant sequence similarity to prototypical RTs (Fig. 1A) (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 10Nakamura T.M. Cech T.R. Cell. 1998; 92: 587-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Flanking the RT domain are a large N-terminal extension and a short C-terminal extension (CTE). By analogy with prototypical RTs, the CTE is likely to constitute the so-called thumb domain of the polymerase (11Hossain S. Singh S. Lue N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36174-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Huard S. Moriarty T. Autexier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4059-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension consists of a non-conserved region (named N-region), four conserved motifs (named GQ, CP, QFP, and T), and a flexible linker (located between the GQ and CP motif) (13Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The CP, QFP, and T motifs have been shown to mediate interaction with telomerase RNA (15Bryan T.M. Goodrich K.J. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 493-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Lai C.K. Mitchell J.R. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Bachand F. Autexier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Bosoy D. Peng Y. Mian I. Lue N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3882-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The N-region and GQ motif together apparently comprise a stable domain (named N-GQ) that is required for telomerase function both in vitro and in vivo (see below). An unusual property of telomerase is its ability to mediate realignment of the DNA product relative to the RNA template. This was inferred from the capacity of the enzyme to add more repeats onto a starting primer than are present in the RNA template (19Greider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4572-4580Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The addition of multiple repeats depends on two types of movements: simultaneous translocation of the RNA-DNA duplex away from the active site after each nucleotide addition and translocation of the RNA template relative to the DNA product after each cycle of copying the template, such that the 3′-end of the DNA realigns with the 3′-region of the RNA template. These movements have been referred to as type I and type II translocation, and the propensity to carry out the movements referred to as nucleotide addition and repeat addition processivity, respectively (20Collins K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 187-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Lue N. Krupp G. Parwaresch R. Telomeres and Telomerases: Cancer and Biology. Landes Biosciences, Austin, TX2002: 239-258Google Scholar). Although nucleotide addition processivity is a common property of all RTs, repeat addition processivity is unique to telomerase. Various features of the telomerase protein and RNA have been shown to modulate nucleotide and repeat addition processivity (for review see Ref. 23Lue N. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Type II translocation is postulated to require an interaction between telomerase and the more 5′-region of the DNA primer, one that is distinct from the RNA-DNA hybrid near the catalytic site. This “anchor site” interaction is presumed to allow telomerase to remain bound to DNA during type II translocation when the DNA product unpairs from the RNA template prior to realignment. In support of this hypothesis, longer oligonucleotides have been shown to support more processive elongation by Tetrahymena telomerase (24Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sequence of the DNA primer 5′ to the RNA-DNA hybrid has been shown to influence the binding affinity and catalytic rate of the enzyme (25Melek M. Davis B. Shippen D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7827-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Lee M. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6586-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the precise molecular determinants of anchor site interaction are not well understood, the TERT protein from Euplotes aediculatus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to cross-link to the 5′-region of the DNA primer, suggesting that a portion of this protein may mediate anchor site interaction (27Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Hammond P.W. Lively T.N. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, there is physical evidence for the participation of telomerase RNA in anchor site interaction (29Hammond P.W. Lively T.N. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The physiologic significance of anchor site interaction has not been determined. We and others have shown previously that the N-GQ domain of yeast TERT (Est2p) is required for telomerase function both in vivo and in vitro (13Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Some truncations and point mutations in the N-GQ domain cause dramatic telomere shortening, cell senescence, and a drastic reduction in enzyme activity. Similar mutations in the Tetrahymena and human enzymes are also known to adversely affect telomerase function in vitro and in vivo (16Lai C.K. Mitchell J.R. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17Bachand F. Autexier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1888-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 31Armbruster B. Banik S. Guo C. Smith A. Counter C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7775-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-GQ domain of Est2p has been shown to bind weakly to nucleic acids when recombinantly expressed and purified from Escherichia coli (14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In this study, the enzymatic properties of several Est2p mutants bearing mutations in the N-GQ domain were examined in greater detail. Both physical and function assays supported the notion that this domain of Est2p represents at least part of the telomerase anchor site. Coupled with previous genetic analysis, our data for the first time provide a correlation between loss of anchor site interaction in vitro with loss of telomerase function in vivo. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The construction of an est2-Δ strain harboring the pSE-Est2-C874 plasmid (containing a protein A-tagged EST2 gene) has been described (14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This fully functional Est2p is designated wild type telomerase throughout the text. The plasmid harboring the N-30 mutant has also been described (14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The N-50 and N-151 deletion mutant, missing the first 49 and 150 amino acids of Est2p, were similarly constructed by substituting truncated PCR fragments into the N-terminal region of the gene. Purification of and Assay for Yeast Telomerase—Whole cell extracts and IgG-Sepharose-purified telomerase were prepared as previously described (14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Cohn M. Blackburn E.H. Science. 1995; 269: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1/100 volume of TMG-10 buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) (28Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The suspension was mixed with an equal volume of glass beads, and the cells were lyzed by vortexing. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. All of the Est2 variants tested in this study were tagged at the C terminus with protein A. Therefore, telomerase in the extracts was purified on IgG-Sepharose. Typically, protein extract (4 mg) was supplemented with sodium acetate (to 0.4 m) and Tween 20 (to 0.05%) and was incubated with 20 μl of IgG-Sepharose with end-to-end rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then washed three time each with 1 ml of TMG-10 buffer containing 600 mm sodium acetate and two times each with TMG-10 buffer. Telomerase prepared in this manner is largely free of nuclease contamination; no degradation of end-labeled primers was observed following incubation with the beads (data not shown). Primer extension assay was carried out using the bead-bound telomerase as previously described (21Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1201-1211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The primers (Sigma-Genosys) have the following sequences: TEL10, GGGTGTGGTG; TEL15, TGTGTGGTGTGTGGG; OXYT1, GTTTTGGGGTTTTGGG; TEL15(m4,5), TGTGTGGTGTCAGGG; TEL15(m12), TGTCTGGTGTGTGGG. For determination of the processivity of telomerase, the signal for each product was determined by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to the amount of transcript by dividing against the number of labeled residues. The TEL15(m4,5) and OXYT1 primers both end in 3 Gs and can align to only one site along the yeast RNA template, thus supporting the addition of a defined 7-nt sequence (TGTGGTG) up to the 5′-boundary of the template. For nucleotides beyond the +7 position, a sequence of TGTG...was assumed as shown in Equation 1 (calculations were made assuming other plausible sequences, and the conclusions were not altered), Processivity Pi=∑j=i+1N(Tj)/∑j=iN(Tj), (Eq. 1) where Ti denotes the amount of transcript calculated for the primer +i position and N is the highest number such that a visible signal can be discerned in the PhosphorImager file for the primer +N product. Protein Cross-linking—Telomerase was isolated by adsorption to IgG-Sepharose and cross-linked to oligonucleotides containing Iodo-dU substitutions by UV irradiation (310 nm, 15 min at 4 °C). Following cross-linking, radioactive dTTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added to 0.7 μm and the covalent adduct incubated at 22 °C for 30 min to allow for labeling of the DNA by telomerase. The beads were then washed three times with TMG-10 (300) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. For trypsin digestion following cross-linking, the beads were incubated with varying concentrations of trypsin at room temperature for 30 min and washed three times with TMG-10 (200). The Sepharose-bound proteins were then separated in a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter by electroblotting. Protein A-tagged species were visualized by Western analysis (ProtoBlot System; Promega). The dried filter was subsequently exposed to a PhosphorImager plate to detect radioactively labeled protein-DNA adducts. Mutations in the N-GQ Domain Caused a Primer-specific Impairment of Telomerase Activity in Vitro—We have previously shown that several deletions in the N-region and several point mutations in the GQ motif (N-10, N-20, N-30, W115A, FH118AA and G123A) caused a severe reduction (>50-fold) in the primer extension activity of telomerase on a particular primer substrate (14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two additional deletion mutants (N-50, N-151) were generated and subjected along with the N-30 and W115A mutant to analysis using two other primer oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 1B, all of the mutant enzymes exhibited comparable levels of activity as the wild type enzyme in adding just one T residue to the TEL15 primer but were about 10-40-fold less active on the TEL10 primer. Additional studies with other primers suggest that the key determinant of primer utilization by the mutant enzymes is the degree of base complementary between the primer and template RNA: primers that form short hybrids were inefficiently utilized (Table I and data not shown). Notably, primers that form 3-4-bp hybrids with telomerase RNA were extended ∼10-fold less efficiently by N-151 than wild type telomerase, whereas those that form 8-9-bp hybrids supported comparable levels of DNA synthesis by both enzymes.Table IPrimer utilization by wild type and N-151 telomerasePrimerPrimer lengthHybrid lengthaThe length of uninterrupted hybrid that can form between the 3′-end of the primer and yeast telomerase RNA.N-151/wild typebComparable amounts of wild type and N-151 telomerase immobilized on IgG-Sepharose (as judged by Western blotting of the bead preparations) were tested in primer extension assays using labeled dTTP as the sole nucleotide.

Open table in a new tab Disparate Effects of the N-GQ Mutations on Telomerase Processivity—To assess the effect of the N-GQ mutations on the elongation properties of telomerase, I included both dGTP and dTTP in primer extension assays to allow the addition of multiple nucleotides and then analyzed the processivity of the enzyme at multiple positions during elongation. Earlier analysis suggests that for yeast telomerase polymerization beyond a single repeat can be most easily observed by using primers that form short hybrids with telomerase RNA (33Lue N. Lin Y. Mian I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8440-8449Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Bosoy D. Lue N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, to assess nucleotide and repeat addition processivity simultaneously, I used one such primer, named OXYT1. As shown in Fig. 2A, all of the deletion mutants and the W115A point mutant manifested significant alterations in elongation property. Quantitative analysis showed that from the p +2 to +5 position the mutant enzymes were more processive than the wild type enzyme (by ∼15-25%) (Fig. 2B). This effect was reversed at the p +7 position such that the mutant enzymes became less processive (by >3-fold for the N-151 mutant). Because the OXYT1 primer contains 3 G residues at its 3′-end, it can align to a unique position within the yeast telomerase RNA template (9Lingner J. Hughes T.R. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Lundblad V. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 276: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 28Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Based on this alignment position, the p +7 product is generated upon one complete round of nucleotide addition, when the active site of telomerase reaches the 5′-boundary of the template. For further elongation to take place, telomerase must perform a type II translocation. Our observations thus indicate that the N-GQ mutations enhanced type I, but impaired type II, processivity. Notably, the magnitude of the effect correlated with the size of the deletion, suggesting that residues throughout the domain participate in the underlying mechanism(s) for processivity alteration. Similar results were obtained from assays using another primer that forms a short hybrid with telomerase RNA (data not shown). The N-region Is Functionally Required for Interaction between Telomerase and the 5′-Region of the DNA Primer—The altered primer utilization property and processivity for the N-GQ mutants suggest that this domain may be a constituent of the long-hypothesized anchor site. This notion is also consistent with the earlier observation that the N-GQ domain is a low affinity nucleic acid binding domain (14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To test this idea functionally, I examined the ability of the N-30 telomerase to utilize a primer with a sequence alteration in the presumed anchor site target. Earlier studies indicate that such a sequence alteration (a G to C mutation in TEL15 to give TEL15(m12), Fig. 3A) weakens anchor site interaction, leading to higher levels of DNA synthesis because of increased enzyme turnover (27Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Lue N.F. Peng Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). I reasoned that if the N-GQ domain is in fact required for anchor site interactions then the mutant might not exhibit enhanced DNA synthesis on mutated primers. As shown in Fig. 3B, the wild type telomerase mediated 2-fold higher DNA synthesis on the TEL15(m12) primer than on the TEL15 primer (compare lanes 1 and 3 in both the left and right panels), whereas the N-30 enzyme was equally active on both primers (compare lanes 2 and 4). The difference in primer utilization between the wild type and N-30 telomerase was observed regardless of the identity of the labeled nucleotide (Fig. 3, B and C, asterisks), which is present at a much lower concentration than the unlabeled nucleotide. Together, these finding suggests that the N-30 enzyme is in fact defective in interacting with the upstream region of the DNA primer. Aside from the N-GQ domain, two other domains of TERT, named IFD and CTE, have been implicated in primer interaction (11Hossain S. Singh S. Lue N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36174-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Huard S. Moriarty T. Autexier C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4059-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Lue N. Lin Y. Mian I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8440-8449Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IFD designates a telomerase-specific insertion in the putative fingers domain of TERT, and a mutation in IFD has been demonstrated to cause similar processivity defects as the N-GQ mutants. CTE denotes the C-terminal extension of TERT. Analysis of yeast and human TERT suggests that this region may correspond to the thumb domain of conventional RTs and may contact the nucleic acid duplex from the opposite side of the fingers domain. I tested the ability of an IFD mutant (named LYID589) and a CTE mutant (named C745) to respond to the TEL15(m12) primer mutation. Like the wild type enzyme and in contrast to the N-30 enzyme, these two mutants were able to mediate 2-3-fold greater DNA synthesis on the TEL15(m12) primer than on the TEL15 primer (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, despite their apparent roles in primer binding, IFD and CTE do not appear to be required for anchor site interactions. The N-GQ Domain Physically Interacts with the 5′-Region of Telomeric Oligonucleotides—To detect the presumed physical interaction between TERT and the primer upstream region, I utilized a previously described cross-linking assay (27Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Hammond P.W. Lively T.N. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Telomerase with an Est2p subunit that is C-terminal tagged with protein A was bound to IgG-Sepharose, incubated with telomere oligonucleotides containing Iodo-dU substitutions in the 5′-region, and irradiated with UV light to allow covalent adduct formation. The adduct was then labeled by telomerase-mediated incorporation of [32P]dTTP to the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and exposure to PhosphorImager plates. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, a labeled species corresponding in size to Est2p can be detected in this assay. Adduct formation was most efficient with an oligonucleotide derivatized at positions 11 and 13, consistent with its being due to anchor site interactions. Also, as expected, the signal was absent when the enzyme preparation was pretreated with RNase A. Altering the size of Est2p by the addition of a Myc3 tag resulted in a decrease in the mobility of the adduct, thus confirming unequivocally the identity of the cross-linked protein as Est2p (Fig. 4C). To map the site on Est2p that cross-linked to the oligonucleotide, I subjected the cross-linked products to partial proteolysis and analyzed the association of individual proteolytic fragments (as detected in Western blotting using protein A antibodies) with radioactivity. Because of the location of the protein A tag at the C terminus, only fragments that retained the C terminus can be detected in the Western analysis. At least three proteolytic fragments of 95, 60, and 40 kDa can be observed in appreciable quantities (designated A, B, and C in Fig. 4D). These fragments are judged to be caused by cleavage at positions ∼190, 470, and 650 of Est2p. This interpretation was confirmed by analyzing the proteolytic pattern of a C-terminal-truncated Est2p (supplemental Fig. S2). Remarkably, none of the proteolytic fragments is associated with appreciable amounts of radioactivity (Fig. 4D, lanes 2-5 and 7-10). Importantly, the sample shown in lanes 2 and 6 contained similar amounts of full-length protein and fragment A. However, radioactivity was almost exclusively associated with the full-length protein. These observations indicate that the main cross-linking site on Est2p is within the first 190 amino acids. Consistent with this finding, the N-151 mutant exhibited greatly reduced cross-linking to the DNA primer in similar assays (data not shown). In addition to Est2p, another protein of ∼55 kDa can be labeled in the cross-linking assay (labeled species II in Fig. 4D). Labeling of this protein is also sensitive to RNase (data not shown), but its identity is presently unknown. The N-GQ Domain of TERT as the Telomerase Anchor Site—The N-GQ domain appears to fulfill the classic criteria for being a determinant of telomerase anchor site: it physically and functionally interacts with a 5′-region of the DNA primer located outside of the RNA-DNA hybrid, and it is required for optimal type II translocation (repeat addition processivity) (24Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Lee M. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6586-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The current study also reveals two additional biochemical activities of the telomerase anchor site: it facilitates initiation on primers that form short hybrids with telomerase RNA, and it can impair type I translocation or nucleotide addition processivity. All of the activities of the anchor site can be rationalized by its DNA binding function, as follows. I presume that the overall affinity of the telomerase enzyme for DNA is a function of both RNA-DNA and protein-DNA interactions and that a threshold level of affinity is required for efficient binding and polymerization. Given a short RNA-DNA hybrid, the protein-DNA interaction mediated by the N-GQ domain may be critical for this threshold level of affinity, thus accounting for the primer-specific impairment of activity. The realignment step following type II translocation also entails the formation of a short hybrid (36Chen J. Greider C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and may critically depend on the same protein-DNA interaction for complex stability. That the repeat addition processivity was not completely abolished by N-GQ mutations suggests that other domains of TERT (e.g. the IFD motif) can help to stabilize short RNA-DNA hybrids (33Lue N. Lin Y. Mian I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8440-8449Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Indeed, even very short primers (lacking the presumed anchor site target) can mediate multiple repeat addition by Tetrahymena telomerase, albeit rather inefficiently (37Baran N. Haviv Y. Paul B. Manor H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5570-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, anchor site interactions may greatly stimulate, but not be essential for, multiple repeat addition. Less obvious is the mechanism by which anchor site binding impairs type I translocation. Perhaps the energy barrier for conformational transition that is necessary for nucleotide addition becomes too high with a very stable telomerase-DNA complex (one that contains both a long RNA-DNA hybrid and protein-DNA contacts). Indeed, the nucleotide addition processivity of Kluyveromyces lactis telomerase was shown to be impaired by increasing the length of complementarity between the DNA primer and RNA template, arguing that enhancing complex stability can have a detrimental effect on type I processivity (38Fulton T.B. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4961-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the putative yeast telomerase anchor site, the GQ motif is clearly conserved in evolution (18Bosoy D. Peng Y. Mian I. Lue N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3882-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, I propose that telomerase in other species is also likely to utilize the same domain as the anchor site. Consistent with this notion, deletions in this region of hTERT have been demonstrated to alter primer utilization (30Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Moriarty et al. (39Moriarty T. Marie-Egyptienne D. Autexier C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3720-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated a convincing role for the GQ motif of hTERT (named RID1 in their report) in supporting repeat addition processivity. That the N-region is not highly conserved raises the additional possibility that different anchor sites may have evolved slightly different recognition properties for species-specific purposes (e.g. de novo telomere formation, which requires recognition of non-telomeric sequences and appears to be more efficient in ciliates (40Karamysheva Z. Wang L. Shrode T. Bednenko J. Hurley L. Shippen D. Cell. 2003; 113: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). The N-GQ domain may have functions other than serving as the anchor site. For example, part of the GQ motif has been shown to mediate interaction between Est2p and a regulatory subunit known as Est3p (41Friedman K. Heit J. Long D. Cech T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Even though EST3 is absolutely essential for telomere maintenance in vivo, deletion of this gene does not appear to affect the processivity of telomerase (data not shown), implying that it is not necessary for anchor site function. Nevertheless, the interaction of the anchor site domain with a regulatory subunit underscores the possibility that this domain may be a key target of regulation in vivo. Anchor Site Function Is Required for Telomere Maintenance in Vivo—Earlier analysis has established a critical role for the N-GQ domain of TERT in telomerase function in vivo: yeast strains bearing mutations in this domain of EST2 suffered severe telomere shortening and eventually became senescent (13Friedman K.L. Cech T.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2863-2874Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Xia J. Peng Y. Mian I.S. Lue N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5196-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Coupled with the current biochemical analysis, these observations imply that the protein-DNA interaction conferred by the telomerase anchor site is indeed essential for telomerase function in vivo, possibly for one of the following reasons. First, the available molecular genetic data indicate that telomerase preferentially extends short telomeres by multiple repeats within a single cell cycle, very likely through processive repeat addition (42Teixeira M. Arneric M. Sperisen P. Lingner J. Cell. 2004; 117: 323-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 43Marcand S. Brevet V. Gilson E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 44Forstemann K. Hoss M. Lingner J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2690-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). If this were the case, then the anchor site mutants would be unable to maintain telomeres because they are defective in repeat addition processivity. Alternatively, the synthesis of long telomeric DNA in vivo may be due to multiple cycles of binding, polymerization, and dissociation (i.e. without processive repeat addition). In this latter scenario, the N-GQ mutants may be non-functional because they are unable to rebind the telomere ends using the 3′-region of the RNA template after one round of synthesis. (This latter scenario seems unlikely, given that only a few telomeres are elongated in a cell cycle.) Finally, it has been suggested that telomerase may have a protective role at telomeres by virtue of its ability to bind stably to telomeric DNA (27Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2790-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This protective function can be compromised by the loss of anchor site interaction. Regardless of the precise mechanisms, our results demonstrate that anchor site, a unique structural and biochemical attribute of the telomerase enzyme, is indeed critical for telomere maintenance.

We have found that the nitrone spin trap DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) prevented such processes by trapping human serum albumin (HSA)-centered radicals, in situ and in real time, before they reacted with oxygen. When (bi)carbonate (CO2, H2CO3, HCO3− and CO3−2) was added to the reaction mixture, it blocked fragmentation mediated by hydroxyl radical-like species but enhanced DMPO-trappable radical sites in HSA. In the past, this effect would have been explained by oxidation of (bi)carbonate to a carbonate radical anion ( CO3·−) by a bound hydroxyl radical-like species. We now propose that the CO3·− radical is formed by the reduction of HOOCO2- (a complex of H2O2 with CO2) by the protein-Cu(I) complex.

The pathophysiological significance of our findings is discussed. When the ability to store and/or handle copper in cells or plasma is overwhelmed, copper is released from its stores via non-copper-dependent oxidative damage (e.g. myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidations) of sulfhydryl groups (1Linder M.C. Mutat. Res. 2001; 475: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or copper-mediated oxidative damage to biomolecules (2Beshgetoor D. Hambidge M. Am. J. Clin.

Indeed, the occurrence of loosely bound copper ions has been reported for a number of clinical samples from pathological conditions involving oxidative stress and inflammation, such as in Wilson disease plasma during an episode of fulminant hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid, Parkinson disease cerebrospinal fluid, senile plaques of Alzheimer disease (3Gaetke L.M.

Thus, (bi)carbonate could affect the mechanism of oxidative damage to proteins by copper-catalyzed oxidations. On the other hand, evidence of the involvement of free radicals in the oxidative damage to proteins by H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed oxidations has been limited to the detection of protein fragmentation, carbonyl groups, and other end products resulting from oxidative modification of amino acids (8Halliwell B.

To our knowledge, nobody has detected protein radicals in the well known system of human serum albumin (HSA)/Cu(II)/H2O2. If such detection is possible by means of immunospin trapping (26Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1214-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Ramirez D.C. Gomez Mejiba S.E. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (see Scheme I), it would represent a notable advantage of this technique over the standard ESR techniques for detecting protein radicals, which are compromised by the broad ESR signal of Cu(II) (28Hanna P.M. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Hanna P.M. Chamulitrat W. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, immunospin trapping could be a powerful tool for detecting protein radicals in complex systems such as cells. In the present investigation, to study H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed protein radicals in functioning cells, we have validated the recently developed immunospin trapping technique with DMPO using the HSA/Cu(II)/H2O2 system as a model. Our results suggest a novel mechanism to explain carbon dioxide-modulated, H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed oxidation that can help us explain the highly specific DMPO trapping of protein radicals in cells exposed to Cu(II) and H2O2. Reagents—Anhydrous CuCl2 (99.999% purity), ZnCl2 (99.999%), and NaHCO3 (99.7-100.3%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Human serum albumin (HSA, 99.99% purity), carbonate dehydratase, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCDS), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), sodium azide, and potassium cyanide were purchased from Sigma. ABTS, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, lysine, methionine, and cysteine were from MP Biomedical, Inc. (Aurora, OH). The spin trap DMPO was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), purified twice by vacuum sublimation at room temperature, and stored under argon atmosphere at -80 °C until use. The DMPO concentration was measured at 228 nm, assuming a molar absorption coefficient of 7,800 m-1 cm-1. Reagent grade 30% H2O2 was obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. (Fair Lawn, NJ). The H2O2 concentration was verified using UV light absorption at 240 nm (ϵ = 43.6 m-1 cm-1). All buffers were treated with Chelex 100® ion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) to remove transition metals usually found in phosphate buffers (PBs) as contaminants (30Miller D.M. Buettner G.R. Aust S.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 8: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The pH of the buffer solutions containing NaHCO3 was adjusted to 7.4 by bubbling a 5% CO2, 95% N2 gas mixture into them. Human Serum Albumin Preparation—HSA (10 mg/ml) was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) treated with Chelex 100®. Before use, we passed our preparations of HSA through a prepacked Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm phosphate buffer to eliminate contaminating metals and preservatives. As a result of their physiological role in transporting metals, commercial preparations of albumin usually contain bound copper (∼3.87 μmol Cu(II)/mmol albumin), indicating that nearly 0.4% of the albumin molecules carry bound copper (discussed in Ref. 31Gabaldon M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 431: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the incubation of our HSA preparations with 1 mm H2O2 and 100 mm DMPO for 2 h at 37 °C did not produce either protein fragmentation or DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts (as assessed by SDS-PAGE or Western blot and ELISA, respectively), indicating that our HSA preparations did not contain significant catalytic copper. In addition, it has been noticed that in commercial preparations of bovine albumin, ∼50% of their free sulfhydryl groups (Cys-34) have formed disulfide bonds (31Gabaldon M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 431: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To reduce disulfide bonds in our HSA preparation, 1 ml of 5 mg/ml HSA (∼75 μm, 0.92 ± 0.04 sulfhydryl/albumin) was treated overnight with a 2-fold molar excess of 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad)/0.2 mm EDTA at 4 °C, followed by dialysis until the following morning against 2,000 volumes of chelexed phosphate buffer. The sulfhydryl/albumin molar ratio in our 2-mercaptoethanol-treated HSA preparations was 1.00 ± 0.05 (n = 5), similar to that of the commercial preparation we used. Whether or not HSA preparations were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol made no significant difference in the amount of H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed, DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts. HSA concentration was determined from its 280 nm absorption band (ϵ280nm = 43.6 mm-1 cm-1). HSA Sulfhydryl Groups—The analysis of free sulfhydryl groups in commercial and fully reduced (mercaptoalbumin) HSA was performed as previously described (32Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-μl samples were mixed with 1 ml of 0.25 m Tris base/20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 20 μl of DTNB (4 mg/ml in methanol). After 15 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance of the sample at 410 nm was measured and subtracted from a DTNB blank and a blank containing sample without DTNB. For calculation of sulfhydryl content, an extinction coefficient for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate at 410 nm equal to 13.6 mm-1 cm-1 was used. To determine the percentage of reduction of sulfhydryl groups by 2-mercaptoethanol, a fluorescent assay using ThioGlo-1 (33Shvedova A.A. Kisin E.R. Murray A.R. Kommineni C. Castranova V. Mason R.P. Kadiiska M.B. Gunther M.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1451-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used. This result confirmed the data from our DTNB assay. Chemical Reactions—Typically, reactions of HSA (0.5 mg/ml or 7.5 μm), 500 μm H2O2, and 10 μm Cu(II) were carried out in the presence or absence of 100 mm DMPO in 100 mm chelexed sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 300 μl. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 2 h and stopped by elimination of the excess H2O2 by adding 10 μl of 10 IU of catalase/10 mm DTPA in phosphate buffer. Copper Binding to HSA—Incubations containing either Cu(II) (10 μm), Cu(II)/H2O2 (500 μm), Cu(II)/HSA (7.5 μm), or Cu(II)/H2O2/HSA were mixed at room temperature in 100 mm chelexed phosphate buffer in a total volume of 400 μl in 1.5-ml centrifugal filtration units (cutoff 5 kDa; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immediately after mixing, tubes were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min. The Cu(II) + Cu(I) content in the filtrate was determined by bathocuproine-assisted, H2O2-induced reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) (34Ivanov A.I. Parkinson J.A. Cossins E. Woodrow J. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 350 μl of filtrate were mixed with 50 μl of 50 mm BCDS (in water) and 50 μl of 100 mm H2O2 and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by the addition of 200 μl of phosphate buffer, and the absorbance of the Cu(I)-BCDS complex was determined (ϵ480 = 12,540 m-1 cm-1). Cell Culture, Exposure to Chemicals, and Trapping of Protein Radicals with DMPO—RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained as subconfluent cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Three days before experiments, 104 cells/ml were cultured in monolayers up to 85-90% of confluence in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in 12-well plates (Corning). After three washes with warm phosphate-buffered saline to eliminate fetal calf serum proteins, warm 100 mm chelexed sodium PB with or without different concentrations of BB, pH 7.4, and 100 mm DMPO was added and cells incubated for 5 min. Thereafter, 10 μm Cu(II) and 500 μm H2O2 were added and the incubation continued for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by washing the monolayer with PB containing 10 IU/ml catalase and 1 mm DTPA. After that, the cells were harvested by trypsin/EDTA treatment and washed three times at 4 °C (400 × g, 5 min) with PB containing 1 mm DTPA (2 min, 12,000 rpm) to remove any media proteins and catalase. Thereafter, 107 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of cold PB, and their ability to exclude 0.4% trypan blue was determined after 15 min using a hemocytometer under a light microscope. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 1 mm DTPA and lysed by sonication. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin, fraction V, as a standard. (Bi)carbonate-enhanced, H2O2-induced, Copper-catalyzed Peroxidative Activity—The oxidation of ABTS (0.5 mm) by a system containing Cu(II) (50 μm), H2O2 (10 mm), and different concentrations of (bi)carbonate, which was added from a 1 m NaHCO3 solution, was studied in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. When HSA or carbonic dehydratase was added, their final concentration was 0.5 mg/ml or 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. The oxidation of ABTS was followed at 420 nm during the first minute after the addition of H2O2 at room temperature, and the production of ABTS.+ was determined using its extinction coefficient at 420 nm = 43.1 mm-1 cm-1. Antiserum Antispin Trap—A rabbit antiserum against the nitrone form of DMPO was obtained in our laboratory and used successfully in the detection of myoglobin (35Detweiler C.D. Deterding L.J.

The anti-DMPO-OA antiserum is commercially available from Alexis Biochemicals (catalog number ALX-210-530; San Diego, CA), Cayman Chemical Co. (catalog number 10006170; Ann Arbor, MI), and Oxford Biomedical Research (catalog number RT15; Oxford, MI). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The DMPO-protein radical-derived nitrone adducts were determined using a standard ELISA in 96-well plates (Greiner Labortechnik, Frickenhausen, Germany) as described previously (27Ramirez D.C. Gomez Mejiba S.E. Mason R.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 201-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue Stain, and Anti-DMPO Western Blot—Reaction mixtures were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE (1.2 μg/lane). After electrophoresis, either the gels were stained using Coomassie Blue, or the proteins were blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with a 4% cold-water fish gelatin solution in 100 mm (bi)carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, for 90 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed once with washing buffer (0.2% cold-water fish skin gelatin in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) and then exposed to the antiserum anti-DMPO nitrone at a dilution of 1:5,000 in washing buffer for 1 h, followed by three washing steps. The secondary antiserum anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) was added at a dilution of 1:5,000 in washing buffer. After exposure for 1 h, the excess secondary antiserum was eliminated by washing. The immunocomplexes were detected by exposing membranes to nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate One-step reagent from Pierce for 15 min. Anti-DNP Western Blot for Carbonyl Detection—Carbonyl groups in HSA were investigated using an OxyBlot™ protein oxidation detection kit from Chemicon International Inc. (catalog number S7150) following their protocol with some modifications. After incubation with the anti-dinitrophenylhydrazone (anti-DNP) antiserum and washing, antigen-antibody immunocomplexes were detected using the same system as that used in our anti-DMPO Western blots, except that the secondary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:2,500. H2O2-induced, Copper-catalyzed, DMPO-HSA Radical-derived Nitrone Adducts—When HSA was incubated with 10 μm Cu(II), we observed H2O2-dependent fragmentation of HSA (∼60-, 49-, 39-, 28-30-, 15-17-, 8-, and 5-kDa fragments) and decrease of the HSA dimer (Fig. 1A). Parallel to fragmentation was an H2O2-dependent increase in carbonyl groups in HSA (Fig. 1B). The pattern of HSA fragmentation and carbonyl formation indicates the presence of multiple, but specific, susceptible sites of HSA fragmentation and supports the site-specific mechanism for oxidative damage to proteins by metal-catalyzed oxidations (6Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 12Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Chevion M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). When DMPO was included in the reaction mixture, we observed H2O2-dependent, DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adduct formation as assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1C). DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts were observed only when HSA, Cu(II), DMPO, and H2O2 were all present (Fig. 1). In addition, structural damage and generation of nitrone adducts were prevented in a concentration-dependent fashion by catalase or KCN (data not shown), suggesting that H2O2 and redox cycling of copper were necessary for the production of HSA-centered radicals and site-specific fragmentation of HSA. When the pH was varied and the reaction of HSA, Cu(II), H2O2, and DMPO was carried out in 100 mm chelexed phosphate buffer, the fragmentation of HSA and DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adduct production increased with increasing pH (data not shown). When HSA was incubated with 500 μm H2O2 for 2 h at 37 °C, Cu(II) produced a concentration-dependent increase in site-specific fragmentation of HSA as demonstrated with Coomassie Blue stain (Fig. 1D, left panel). Under these conditions and in the presence of 100 mm DMPO, 5 μm Cu(II) produced DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts that were detectable by Western blot (Fig. 1D, right panel). These nitrone adducts appeared as monomers, dimers, aggregates, and fragments of HSA, suggesting that there are multiple, but discrete, radical sites, i.e. DMPO-trappable backbone carbon-centered radicals, which are involved as intermediates in the site-specific fragmentation of HSA (6Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 24Hawkins C.L. Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 196-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). When HSA was incubated with 100 mm DMPO, 500 μm H2O2, and varying concentrations of Cu(II), ELISA indicated that a concentration of Cu(II) as low as 1 μm was enough to produce detectable DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts (∼300 relative light units) (Fig. 1E, RLU). Under our experimental conditions, the background signal in ELISA experiments in samples containing HSA and DMPO was always <40 relative light units (data not shown), indicating that our HSA preparation does not contain significant copper. In addition, no DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts were detected when DMPO was added after a 2-h incubation of HSA/Cu(II)/H2O2 followed by the addition of catalase (data not shown), suggesting that DMPO traps, in real time, a short-lived species to form a radical adduct that decays to form the corresponding nitrone. DMPO Traps HSA Radicals and Prevents Fragmentation Produced by Copper-catalyzed Oxidations—Me2SO (DMSO) and benzoate (Fig. 2A) as well as other scavengers of free hydroxyl radicals (i.e. ethanol, formate, and d-mannitol) failed to protect HSA against oxidative fragmentation, ruling out a role for free hydroxyl radicals and, thereby, Fenton chemistry catalyzed by free copper in our system. We observed a DMPO-dependent protection against H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed oxidative fragmentation of HSA (Fig. 2B), carbonyl formation (Fig. 2C) and increased production of DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts (Fig. 2D). Although DMPO inhibition of fragmentation and carbonyl group formation is consistent with the formation of DMPO nitrones of radical intermediates in the oxidative fragmentation of HSA, we cannot exclude the possibility that aromatic residues are also oxidized and trapped by DMPO to form protein-bound nitrones. In fact, some protein-nitrone adducts and carbonyl-containing HSA are present at the same molecular weight as native HSA (Figs. 1, B and D, right panel, and 2C). Copper Binding to HSA and H2O2-induced, Copper-catalyzed Oxidations—The addition of 10 μm Cu(II) to 7.5 μm HSA followed by immediate centrifugation at 4 °C showed that <5% of the total Cu(II) was recovered in the filtrate (Fig. 3A, first lane). When 0.5 mm H2O2 was added to the above mixture, no copper [Cu(I)/Cu(II)] was recovered in the filtrate (Fig. 3A, second lane), suggesting that, in our system, the added Cu(II) is completely bound to HSA and there is no Fenton chemistry resulting from free copper. When the Cu(II) chelator DTPA was added before the addition of H2O2, it inhibited DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adduct formation (Fig. 3B). A Cu(II)/DTPA ratio of ∼1 was enough to decrease such nitrone adducts to almost background levels, whereas a BCDS/Cu(II) ratio ≥5 was necessary to block the adduct formation (Fig. 3B). As BCDS was added to the reaction mixture (HSA/Cu(II)/H2O2), a progressive increase was observed in (Cu(I)(BCDS)2)-3 complex production (ϵ480nm = 12,540 m-1 cm-1) (34Ivanov A.I. Parkinson J.A. Cossins E. Woodrow J. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which was prevented by catalase or KCN (data not shown). When HSA was pre-incubated with Zn(II) chloride, we observed protection against H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed oxidative fragmentation, as shown by an increase in the dimeric form (∼130 kDa) as well as a decrease in fragmentation (Fig. 3C). Zn(II) also decreased DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts (Fig. 3D). However, these effects required high concentrations of Zn(II) relative to Cu(II), i.e. a Zn(II):Cu(II) ratio of ∼10 (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, even the highest concentration of Zn(II) used in these studies, i.e. 1 mm, did not completely abolish H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed oxidative damage to HSA (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that Zn(II) could not displace Cu(I)/Cu(II) from some of its high affinity binding sites as was recently proposed (39Bal W. Christodoulou J. Sadler P.J. Tucker A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1998; 70: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the free Cu(I)/Cu(II) displaced by Zn(II) may catalyze hydroxyl radical formation in solution, which forms HSA radicals in a non-site-specific manner. Moreover, the addition of certain amino acids (1 mm) protected HSA (His → Cys → Tyr → Trp) against H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed oxidative fragmentation (Fig. 4A) and decreased DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adduct formation to a similar extent (Fig. 4B). Lysine and methionine (data not shown) did not affect either protein fragmentation or generation of such nitrone adducts (Fig. 4, A and B). (Bi)carbonate Protects HSA against Fragmentation but Enhances Side Chain Oxidations—The presence of (bi)carbonate produced a concentration-dependent enhancement of H2O2-induced, copper-catalyzed, DMPO-HSA radical-derived nitrone adducts (Fig. 5A), but decreased backbone oxidations, thereby protecting against fragmentation of HSA (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C shows that the inclusion of (bi)carbonate in systems containing Cu(II) and H2O2 enhanced H2O2-induced"

At present, it is unclear whether ABCA1-mediated lipid exposure is specific with regard to lipid headgroups and whether it requires calcium activation and the presence of a lipid acceptor. In the present work, we found exofacial exposure of endogenous phosphatidylserine in the absence of apoA-I to be enhanced in ABCA1-GFP expressing MDCKII and HeLa cells compared with control cells. By using C6-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) (NBD)-labeled phospholipid analogues, we observed elevated redistribution of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not of phosphatidylcholine analogues from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane of ABCA1-GFP expressing cells. Whereas glyburide affected neither the level of exofacial endogenous PS nor the outward movement of the amino phospholipid analogues, the latter was sensitive to intracellular Ca2+ in ABCA1-GFP expressing cells, further enhancing outward analogue redistribution with respect to control cells.

Glyburide raised the level of receptor-mediated endocytosis in the ABCA1-GFP expressing cell to the level of control cells in the absence of glyburide.

Upon expression of functional ABCA1 in cultured cells, enhanced binding of apoA-I to the plasma membrane and increased cellular cholesterol and phospholipids efflux to apoA-I have been found. It has been suggested that ABCA1 serves as a receptor for docking of apoA-I to the plasma membrane. A chemical cross-linking approach revealed complex formation between both proteins (4Wang N.

The relevance of ABCA-1 for binding of apoA-I is supported by the observation that Tangier patients typically fail to bind nascent apoA-I (8von Eckardstein A. Chirazi A. Schuler-Luttmann S. Walter M.

Another recent study also provided a clear indication that ABCA1 expression increases cell surface PS (11Smith J.D. Waelde C. Horwitz A. Zheng P. J. Biol.

However, this binding was not sufficient to trigger phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. Thus, apart from PS, other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) might also be transported by ABCA1 to enable lipid removal from the plasma membrane to apoA-I (12Gilotte-Taylor K. Nickel M.

An enhanced endocytotic activity in Tangier disease cells has been associated with an impairment of PS exposure (14Zha X. Genest J. McPherson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39476-39483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).From these studies, it appears that ABCA1-mediated surface exposure of lipids is of rather low specificity. However, so far no systematic study on ABCA1-dependent lipid exposure has been done. Here we investigated the exposure of endogenous PS and various fluorescent lipid analogues in the plasma membrane of ABCA1-expressing MDCKII cells. In order to correlate directly the expression of ABCA1 and exposure of endogenous PS, ABCA1-GFP, which has been shown to be fully functional with respect to wild type ABCA1 (15Neufeld E.B.

We observed an ABCA1-mediated redistribution of amino phospholipid analogues of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from the cytoplasmic side to the exoplasmic plasma membrane leaflet. The enhanced surface exposure of the PS analogue is in line with the higher level of exofacial endogenous PS in comparison with control cells, which was confirmed for ABCA1-GFP expressing HeLa cells. In contrast to the amino phospholipid analogues, we did not find an enhanced surface exposure for the phosphatidylcholine analogue in ABCA1-GFP expressing cells. In parallel, we investigated the endocytotic activity observing that the down-regulated receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis in ABCA1-GFP expressing cells cannot solely be linked to the lipid transport activity of ABCA1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the calcium ionophore A23187 were purchased from Sigma. A23187 stocks were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was supplemented with 24 mm glucose and 10 mm HEPES (mPBS). 1-Palmitoyl-2-[6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)]-phosphatidic acid (C6-NBD-PA), -PE (C6-NBD-PE), and -PS (C6-NBD-PS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL); high performance TLC plates were from Merck. APC-annexin V and binding buffer were bought from Pharmingen; propidium iodide was from Sigma. Triton X-100 and trypsin/EDTA were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) and Biochrom KG (Berlin, Germany), respectively. Tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (TMR-dextran) and Texas Red-transferrin (TR-transferrin) were obtained from MoBiTec (Göttingen, Germany). Inhibitors of ABC transporters used were glyburide (Sigma), PSC 833 (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), and MK 571 (Merck). Glyburide and PSC 833 stocks were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide or ethanol; MK 571 was prepared in double-distilled water. For all experiments, the effect of the solvent was determined.Cells—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen), penicillin, streptomycin, and sodium pyruvate (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). pBI ABCA1-GFP plasmid (Clontech) was constructed as detailed (6Hamon Y.

Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's procedure. Briefly 106 MDCKII or HeLa Tet-Off (Clontech) cells maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS were incubated overnight with the transfection mix (5 μg of pBI ABCA1-GFP and 100 ng of pTK-Hyg mixed to 20 μl of ExGen 500 in 0.15 m NaCl). After transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded into 10-cm culture dishes. Transfection efficiency was monitored by flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences) before seeding. Hygromycin B selection (200 μg/ml, Invitrogen) was started 48 h after transfection. Three-week-old individual cell clones were picked with cloning cylinders and expanded subsequently on the basis of GFP-positive cells visualized by fluorescence microscopy (passage 0).Cells were regularly passed before complete confluence to reduce loss of expression. Cells were grown in the absence or presence of cytostatic drugs for 24 or 72 h on 35-mm culture dishes (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) for transport assays, and on two-chamber cover glasses (Nunc) for microscopy.Expression of HA-GFP—MDCKII cells (50% confluent) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Influenza virus hemagglutinin (strain X31) tagged with a GFP at the C terminus (HA-GFP) in vector pTM1 was expressed by using vaccinia virus T7 system (16Kozerski C. Ponimaskin E. Schroth-Diez B. Schmidt M.F.G. Herrmann A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 395-404Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cells were washed and infected with modified vaccinia virus (vTF7–3 virus) with a multiplicity of infection of ∼2.5 and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. The virus inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed once with DMEM without FCS. Subsequently, cells were transfected with a mixture of 6 μl of cDNA (1.2 μg/μl) and 30 μl of Lipofectin (1 μg/μl) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Incubation was continued at 37 °C for another 2 h. Upon removal of medium and substituting with DMEM with 2% FCS medium, cells were incubated at 31 °C for 24 h. As controls, MDCKII cells were taken that have undergone the whole transfection procedure but without the HA-GFP cDNA.Inward Redistribution of C6-NBD-PS and -PE—Cells were washed and labeled with 1 ml of 10 μm C6-NBD-PS or -PE in ice-cold mPBS (17Pomorski T. Müller P. Zimmermann B. Burger K. Devaux P. Herrmann A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 687-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pohl A. Lage H. Müller P. Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 20 min, non-inserted analogues were removed by washing two times with cold mPBS. Inward redistribution of analogues was initiated by addition of mPBS prewarmed to 20 °C (with or without inhibitors), containing 5 mm DFP (as in all following incubations) to prevent hydrolysis of analogues (19Colleau M. Hervé P. Fellmann P. Devaux P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 57: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After 30 min, culture dishes were transferred on ice, and cold mPBS containing BSA (final 2%, w/v) was added to extract NBD lipid analogues from the exoplasmic leaflet. C6-NBD-lipids present in the outer leaflet, not in the inner leaflet, of the plasma membrane have been shown to be selectively extracted by incubation with an excess of BSA (referred to as back exchange) (20Martin O.C.

Phospholipids with two long fatty acid chains as endogenous phospholipids, for example, are not extracted by BSA. After 10 min, BSA-containing media were collected, and back exchange was repeated with cold mPBS plus 2% BSA for 10 min, followed by lipid analysis of cells and media.Measurement of Outward Redistribution of C6-NBD-PS and -PE by Direct Labeling—Cells were labeled with 1 ml of 10 μm C6-NBD-PS or -PE on ice and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min to allow inward movement of the NBD lipid analogues as described above. Inhibitors (200 μm glyburide; 25 μm MK 571; 10 μm PSC833) and A23187 (0.5 μm) in Me2SO were added 20 min after the beginning of the incubation at 20 °C. NBD lipid analogues remaining on the cell surface were extracted twice by incubation with BSA (2% (w/v)) in mPBS for 10 min on ice. After removing the second BSA-containing medium, cells were washed twice with cold mPBS. For t = 0 min, cold medium containing 2% (w/v) BSA and 5 mm DFP in mPBS with or without inhibitor was added to the cell dish and incubated for 10 min on ice. To measure C6-NBD-PS or -PE outward transport, prewarmed (15 or 37 °C) mPBS with 2% (w/v) BSA and 5 mm DFP was added to the dish, and cells were incubated at 15 or 37 °C for 30 min. Removal of the BSA-containing media and a second extraction with 2% BSA in mPBS for 10 min on ice terminated incubations, followed by lipid analysis.Measurement of Outward Redistribution of C6-NBD-PC Biosynthetically Produced from C6-NBD-PA—C6-NBD-PC was biosynthetically produced from C6-NBD-PA, and its transport to the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane was assessed at 15 °C as described by van Helvoort et al. (23van Helvoort A. Smith A. Sprong H. Fritzsche I. Schinkel A. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 15 °C with 1 ml of 25 μm C6-NBD-PA in mPBS. After 180 min, analogues on the exoplasmic leaflet (C6-NBD-PA and respective metabolites) were removed by washing cells two times with 2% (w/v) BSA-containing mPBS for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, cells were incubated at 15 °C in 2% (w/v) BSA containing mPBS. After 30 min, the amount of extracted analogues was determined as described below.Lipid Analysis—After the incubations, the second BSA back exchange medium was pooled with the first, and cells were scraped into mPBS. For C6-NBD-PS analysis, lipids from both scraped cells and media were extracted with isopropyl alcohol (5.5 ml per 1 ml of medium) to prevent substantial loss into the aqueous phase. Samples were centrifuged at 780 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred into new glass tubes and dried. For C6-NBD-PC and -PE analysis, lipids from both cells and incubation media were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42098) Google Scholar) using 20 mm acetic acid in the aqueous phase. After two-dimensional separation (I, chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium hydroxide (65:25:4, v/v); II, chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:2:2:1, v/v)) on TLC plates, fluorescent lipid spots were visualized under ultraviolet light, scraped, and quantified as described before (17Pomorski T. Müller P. Zimmermann B. Burger K. Devaux P. Herrmann A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 687-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Pohl A. Lage H. Müller P. Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Annexin Assay—Cells were washed two times with mPBS, trypsinized (by addition of trypsin/EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C), and washed again two times. To measure exposure of endogenous PS on the cell surface, about 105 cells were incubated on ice for 10 min in the dark with 5 μl of APC-annexin V in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). Cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of binding buffer containing 1 μl of 1 mg/ml aqueous propidium iodide stock for 1 min on ice. Measurement was performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with a Ar+ laser (488 nm) and a diode laser (630 nm) (BD Biosciences). Forward and side scatter were set at a linear scale. The following fluorescence channels (log scale) were used: FL1 (530/30, enhanced GFP), FL2 (585/42, propidium iodide, PE), FL3 (670LP, propidium iodide), and FL4 (661/16, APC-annexin V). Compensation parameters were as follows: FL1, 1.2% FL2; FL2, 23.9% FL1; FL2, 0.0% FL3; FL3, 14% FL2; FL3, 0.5% FL4; and FL4, 16.4% FL3. Threshold was set at 72 FCS-H. Data were analyzed by CellQuest Pro software.Endocytosis—Cells grown on chambered cover glasses were washed with mPBS, 1 ml of 2 mg of BSA in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES was added, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing cells twice in mPBS, cells were labeled with 1 ml of 5 mg/ml TMR-dextran (“fluid-phase” endocytosis) or 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml TR-transferrin (receptor-mediated endocytosis) in DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES, for 30 min at 37 °C. After removal of supernatant, cells were washed four times with mPBS and fixed for 10 min on ice in the presence of 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed twice with mPBS, and intracellular uptake of fluorophore was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (inverse standard microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar ×100 (1.3 NA) objective) and quantified employing the software package Metamorph software (version 6.1, Universal Imaging). The barrier filter sets (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) used were as follows: green fluorescence (NBD, GFP): BP 450–490 excitation filter, FT 510 dichroic mirror, and LP 520 emission filter; red fluorescence: BP 546 excitation filter, FT 580 dichroic mirror, and LP 590 emission filter. Each cell was defined as a region of interest, and its average fluorescence intensity was determined. Background fluorescence, assessed by quantification of fluorescence intensity in cell free regions, was subtracted.Fluorescence Microscopy—Trypsinized cells (106) were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes with cover glass bottoms (MatTek, Ashland, MA) and grown for 1 day. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (magnification ×63) with Zeiss software. To assess intracellular localization of ABCA1-GFP, the fluorescent markers MitoTracker RedCMXRos (mitochondrial marker) and TetramethylX-wheat germ agglutinin (Golgi marker) (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) were employed.Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as means ± S.E., if not stated otherwise, and were analyzed statistically using a two-way ANOVA (Jandel SigmaStat 2.0) considering treatment and day of experiment. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05.RESULTSExpression and Localization of ABCA1-GFP—Expression of ABCA1-GFP in nonpolarized MDCKII cells and HeLa cells was assessed by FACS analysis. Two populations of cells differing in their level of ABCA1-GFP expression were distinguished (Fig. 1, only shown for MDCKII cells). About 20% of MDCKII and 30% of HeLa cells expressed ABCA1-GFP at a high level (GFP-high, Table I), whereas the remaining cells showed only a low level or no expression of ABCA1-GFP (GFP-low). Staining of cells with the membrane-impermeable nucleic acid stain propidium iodide (PI) did not correlate with GFP fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1). Thus, viability of cells was not impaired by expression of ABCA1-GFP.Table IAverage GFP fluorescence intensity of ABCA1-GFP expressing MDCKII and HeLa cellsMDCKII cellsHeLa cellsGFP fluorescence intensity, mean ± S.D.Fraction of cellsGFP fluorescence intensity, mean ± S.D.Fraction of cellsau%au%Control cells (no ABCA1-GFP) background11001100Low ABCA1-GFP expressing cells1.04 ± 0.0874.08 ± 2.571.60 ± 0.0962.22 ± 1.17High ABCA1-GFP expressing cells12.69 ± 0.5925.92 ± 2.579.47 ± 0.1537.78 ± 1.17 Open table in a new tab Expression of ABCA1-GFP was dependent on number of cell passages. For example, the number of highly ABCA1-GFP expressing MDCKII cells declined by about 50 and 70% after the first and second passage, respectively. A similar effect was observed for HeLa cells (data not shown).ABCA1-GFP was localized to the plasma membrane in MD-CKII and HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Cross-section images show that ABCA1-GFP is expressed in the plasma membrane with no difference between the side facing the dish and the opposite side. As revealed from co-labeling with TetramethylX-wheat germ agglutinin (not shown), ABCA1-GFP was also found in the Golgi apparatus. When MDCKII cells were allowed to reach confluency and to polarize, ABCA1-GFP distributed preferentially to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane in line with previous observations (see Refs. 6Hamon Y.

However, for our studies only nonpolarized cells were used. Both cell lines did not express endogenous ABCA1 as shown previously (6Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S.

(18Pohl A. Lage H. Müller P. Pomorski T. Herrmann A. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To this end, cells were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C upon incorporation of PS analogues into the exoplasmic leaflet (see “Experimental Procedures”). During this period, analogues rapidly redistributed to the cytoplasmic side mediated by an amino phospholipid translocase activity present in the plasma membrane of MDCKII cells (17Pomorski T. Müller P. Zimmermann B. Burger K. Devaux P. Herrmann A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 687-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analogues remaining on the exoplasmic leaflet were removed by repeated washing with BSA. About 50% of analogues became internalized in control cells. We observed a slightly reduced amount of intracellularly localized analogues for ABCA1-GFP expressing cells with respect to control cells after no passage or one passage of cells. The ratio of internalized analogues between ABCA1-GFP expressing and control cells was 0.83 ± 0.13 (mean ± S.E.; n = 3). However, the difference between ABCA1-GFP expressing cells and control cells disappeared when cells were used after three culturing passages correlating with the decline of ABCA1-GFP expressing cells (see above).Subsequently, to follow outward redistribution of analogues, cells were continuously incubated at 37 or 15 °C in BSA-containing medium. Any analogue reaching the cell surface was extracted by BSA into the suspension medium. The kinetics of outward redistribution at 37 °C are shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Outward redistribution of C6-NBD-PS in ABCA1-GFP expressing MDCKII and HeLa cells.

Both mitomycin-induced caspase 3 activity and PARP activation were also inhibited. The mitochondrial DNA-encoded Cox I protein, but not nuclear-encoded proteins, was down-regulated in chloramphenicol-treated cells. Cellular levels of the p21waf1/cip1 protein and p21waf1/cip1 mRNA were increased through a p53-independent pathway, possibly because of the stabilization of p21waf1/cip1 mRNA in chloramphenicol-treated cells. The p21waf1/cip1 was redistributed from the perinuclear region to the cytoplasm and co-localized with mitochondrial marker protein. Several morphological changes and activation of the senescence-associated biomarker, SA β-galactosidase, were observed in these cells. Both p21waf1/cip1 antisense and small interfering RNA could restore apoptotic-associated caspase 3 activity, PARP activation, and sensitivity to mitomycin-induced apoptosis. Similar effects were seen with other antibiotics that inhibit mitochondrial translation, including minocycline, doxycycline, and clindamycin.

These findings suggested that mitochondrial stress causes resistance to apoptosis through a p21-dependent pathway. Apoptosis, a genetically conserved physiologic process, plays a major role in the elimination of injured or unwanted cells in many physiological and pathological conditions. One apoptotic signaling pathway, termed the mitochondrial-dependent pathway, causes the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol where it then binds to Apaf-1 and caspase 9 and activates caspase 3 (1Liu X.

Mitochondria are also involved in the death receptor-associated extrinsic apoptotic pathway, where they mediate an amplification of the death signal. Thus, damage to mitochondrial integrity or function usually results in limited apoptosis in many cell types (6Morais C. Sandra S. Russell H. Oliveira C.R.

The induction of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were associated with genotoxins, oxidants, and metabolic perturbation. Recent studies show that inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide or desferrioxamine mesylate will induce CKI accumulation and halt cell cycle progression (13Yoon G.

In the present studies, we found that chloramphenicol treatment causes an increase in cellular p21Cip1 level and resistance to anti-neoplastic administration in cancer cells. Mitomycin-induced caspase 3 activation was inhibited in chloramphenicol-treated cells, but caspase 3 activation could be restored by both p21Cip1 antisense and siRNA treatment. The results suggest that mitochondrial stress in cells induces resistance to apoptosis through a p21Cip1-dependent pathway. Cell Culture and Treatments—Hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 (p53+/+) and non-small cell lung cancer cell line H1299 (p53–/–, p21+/+) kindly donated by Dr. Y. S. Lin, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a 37 °C incubator. Chloramphenicol was dissolved in ethanol, protected from light, and prepared fresh each time it was used. The solvent content was less than 5 μl/ml in all studies.

Determination of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—For detection of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), 40 nm DiOC6 was added and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C (27Lee C.C. Kang J.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DiOC6 is a lipophilic fluorochrome enriched in positive charge that diffuses across the inner membrane dependent on ΔΨm. Cells after chloramphenicol treatment were loaded with DiOC6 and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Finally, cells were harvested by trypsinization, and the fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Western Blotting and Cytochrome c Release—To obtain total cellular protein extracts, the cell monolayers were washed with phosphatebuffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer. To obtain the cytosolic fraction for determination of cytochrome c release (28Tonomura N. McLaughlin K. Grimm L. Goldsby R.A. Barbara A.O. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2469-2478Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g) and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, proteinase inhibitor mixture, and 100 μg/ml digitonin). The samples were kept on ice for 20 min, and the cells were pelleted by high speed centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 10 min. The supernatant was stored for SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined using the Borford reagents (Bio-Rad). Each sample was aliquoted and separated on SDS-PAGE with consistent voltage for 3–4 h. For immunodetection, protein samples in the gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked in nonfat milk, and incubated in TBST (Tris-buffered saline Tween 20) with antibodies specific to cytochrome c, p21, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, caspase 3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p16, p27 (NeoMarker), Cox I, core II (Molecular Probes), phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Cell Signaling), p53 (Upstate Biotechnology), PARP (eBioscience), and actin (Sigma). The chemoluminescence was enhanced by an ECL kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by the manufacturer. Senescence-associated (SA) β-Galactosidase Staining—Cells were washed and fixed for 3 min in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde at room temperature. SA-β-galactosidase activity was stained in solution (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 mm citric acid, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide) with 1 mg/ml X-Gal at 37 °C for 24–48 h. The blue crystal from X-Gal cleavage could be detected locally in senescent cells (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed by using Superscript™ (Invitrogen). Briefly, 3 μg of total RNA was denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and then reverse transcribed by 200 units of RT enzyme at 42 °C for 50 min. To end the reaction, the cDNA products were heated at 70 °C for 15 min. Target gene expression was detected by PCR amplification by using specific primer pairs (p21: sense CTGGGGATGTCCGTCAGAAC, antisense GAGTCTCCAGGTCCACCTGG; actin: sense TCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAGG, antisense TGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAG). PCR was performed for 35 cycles in 25 μl of reaction mixture; cycling conditions were 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were visualized in 2% agarose gels stained with EtBr. p21 Promoter Reporter Assay—Two constructs, the full-length 2.4-kb p21 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (pGL2-Waf1) (31Lee S.J. Ha M.J. Lee J. Nguyen P. Choi Y.H. Pirnia F. Kang W.K. Wang X.F. Kim S.J. Trepel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10618-10623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the pRK5-laz construct (donated by Dr. Y. S. Lin), were transiently transfected into H1299 with Lipofectamine 2000 as recommended by the manufacturer. Chloramphenicol was added at the desired time point, and cells were lysed in buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Luciferase activity was measured by a luciferase assay system (Promega). Briefly, 5 ml of sample was added to 45 ml of luciferase assay reagent, and the luminescence was recorded by luminometer after 1 min. The internal β-galactosidase activity was assayed in 600 μl of buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 120 μl of the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mg/ml). The mixture was mixed gently and incubated at 37 °C for 1–3 h. The reaction was stopped by 300 μl of 1 m Na2CO3, and the colorimetric changes were quantified by spectrophotometer (DU-650; Beckman). The number of -fold increase in p21 reporter can be determined by comparing the luminescence with an uninduced control that is then normalized with the β-galactosidase activities. Laser Confocal Microscopy—For immunofluorescent studies, cells were seeded onto cover glasses and cultured as previously. After treatments, cells were incubated in ice-cold methanol at –20 °C for 20 min for fixation and permeability. Before being mounted, samples were incubated in specific antibodies (antibody diluted in PBST with Tween 20, with different dilutions ranging from 1:1000 to 1:200) overnight at 4 °C, and then secondary antibodies were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or TRITC at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were observed under Leica confocal laser microscopy with excitation at 488 and 543 nm, respectively. Plasmids, siRNA, and Antisense Oligonucleotide Transfection—To perform transfections, H1299 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 10-cm culture plates or 1 × 105 cells in 6-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells in each plate were transfected with 20 μg of empty vector or pCEP4-p53wt by calcium phosphate precipitation (32Chen S.S. Chang P.J. Cheng Y.W. Lin Y.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4491-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The transfecting medium was refreshed after 12 h, and cells were harvested at indicated intervals. For p21 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide (p21 antisense: 5′-ATCCCCAGCCGGTTCTGACAT-3′; p21 sense: 5′-ATGTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGAT-3′) studies, HepG2 and H1299 cells were transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described (33You H. Yu W. Munoz-Medellin D. Brown P.H. Sanders B.G. Kline K. Mol. Carcinog. 2002; 33: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–10-μg oligomers and 1 μg of Lipofectamine were diluted in 50 μl of incomplete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, and then mixed vigorously and incubated at room temperature. Twenty minutes later, 100 μl of the mixture were layered on 500 μl of complete medium without penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected for 6 h and then treated with chloramphenicol or other manipulation as described. Caspase 3 Activity Measurement—Cellular caspase 3 activity that recognizes the sequence DEVD was assayed using a caspase 3/CPP32 colorimetric assay kit (BioVision). After 12 h of apoptotic stimulation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected, and a volume containing 50–100 μg of protein was diluted to 50 ml with lysis buffer for each assay. The lysate was then mixed with 50 μl of 2× reaction buffer (containing 10 mm dithiothreitol), and 200 μm DEVD-pNA substrate was added. The reaction was performed in a 37 °C water bath for 1–2 h. The cleaved pNA, with a light emission at 405 nm, was quantified by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Dynatech MR-7000). The -fold increase in caspase 3 activity was determined by comparing the absorbance of pNA from the apoptotic sample with the absorbance of pNA from an uninduced control. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Paired data were evaluated by Student's t test. Chloramphenicol Inhibited the Apoptosis Induced by Mitomycin C in HepG2 Cells—The DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C (MMC) induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells, with features including DNA fragmentation (Table I), loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Fig. 1A), release of cytochrome c, and cleavage of PARP (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with chloramphenicol (20 and 100 μg/ml) for 48 h prior to MMC exposure greatly attenuated these MMC-induced apoptotic effects (Table I; Fig. 1). A similar response was seen with H1299 cells, but not with Hep3B cells (Table I). Although chloramphenicol treatment attenuated the MMC-induced apoptosis, the induction of p53 and p21 proteins by MMC was not affected (Fig. 2A).Table IChloramphenicol-treated HepG2 and H1299 cells, but not Hep3B cells, were resistant to the apoptotic stimulusHepG2Hep3BH1299Control5 μg/ml MMC10 μg/ml MMCControl10 μg/ml MMCControlp53 transfection9.4 ± 2.434.1 ± 3.7**53.6 ± 4.9***16.0 ± 2.865.4 ± 2.4*3.0 ± 0.363.4 ± 5.6***+ Chloramphenicol20 μg/ml13.7 ± 4.823.1 ± 1.3#38.5 ± 4.5#NDND6.7 ± 0.213.7 ± 0.4#100 μg/ml7.7 ± 0.513.5 ± 1.2#24.0 ± 2.1#16.7 ± 0.861.0 ± 4.86.7 ± 0.210.3 ± 1.2# Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Chloramphenicol inhibited mitochondrial-encoded protein expression and induced p21 induction. A, Western blots show the changes in cellular p53, p21, Cox I, and core II levels before and after MMC administration in HepG2 cells with or without chloramphenicol pretreatment. Total lysates from MMC-treated cells (5 μg/ml; 12 h) were extracted, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and immunodetected by α-p53, α-p21, α-Cox I, and α-core II antibodies. B, total lysates from chloramphenicol-treated (0–100 μg/ml for 48 h) HepG2 cells were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunodetected by antibodies specific to p21, COX I, and actin. The results showed a dose-dependent correlation between p21 expression and inhibition of mitochondrial translation. C, chloramphenicol-induced p21 expression was detected in H1299 and Hep3B cells by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chloramphenicol Treatment Reduced the Expression of Mitochondrial-encoded Protein and Augmented p21 Expression— The expression of the mitochondrial-encoded Cox I protein was greatly reduced in chloramphenicol-treated HepG2 cells. The expression of nuclear DNA-encoded protein, core II, was not affected (Fig. 2A). However, chloramphenicol treatment induced p21 protein expression (Fig. 2A). The induction of p21 protein was dose dependent (Fig. 2B). In agreement with its ability to inhibit MMC-induced apoptosis, chloramphenicol treatment induced p21 in H1299 cells, but not in Hep3B cells (Fig. 2C). Chloramphenicol Augments p21 Protein and mRNA Expression by Increasing mRNA Stability—Previous data show that chloramphenicol induced p21 protein expression in both HepG2 and p53-null H1299 cells, suggesting that p53 might not be involved. The effect of chloramphenicol on p21 expression was further investigated in p53-null H1299 cells. The expression of mitochondrial-encoded Cox I, but not nuclear-encoded proliferating cell nuclear antigen, was inhibited by chloramphenicol treatment, as seen in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A). Chloramphenicol treatment caused an overexpression of p21 protein in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Other CKIs, p16 but not p27, were also overexpressed in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells. In addition, p21 mRNA was increased in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells (Fig. 3B). A reporter assay was performed to evaluate the direct effect of chloramphenicol on p21 transcription in H1299 cells transfected with the plasmid containing p21 promoter and luciferase. The luciferase activity was greatly enhanced when p53 was co-transfected, but not when treated with chloramphenicol (Fig. 3C), suggesting that chloramphenicol treatment did not affect the transcription of p21. The cellular content of p21 mRNA was increased after pretreatment with chloramphenicol and gradually decreased with time in the presence of actinomycin D (5 ng/ml) when the chloramphenicol was withdrawn from the medium (Fig. 3D). However, continuous exposure to chloramphenicol prevented the degradation of p21 mRNA. The half-life of p21 mRNA was calculated to be 18 and 26 h in the absence and presence of chloramphenicol, respectively. In H1299 cells, the constitutively expressed p21 protein was distributed in the perinuclear region, as shown by immunofluorescence imaging (Fig. 4A). The expression of p21 was increased and the distribution of p21 was changed to the cytoplasm after chloramphenicol treatment (Fig. 4A). The p21 was then seen to be co-localized with core II, a mitochondria protein (Fig. 4B). Chloramphenicol-induced Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Activity—The activation of SA-β-galactosidase has been identified as a biomarker of cellular senescence (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). The SA-β-galactosidase activity was detected by the accumulation of blue-violet X-gal crystals in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells (Fig. 5). The morphology of these chloramphenicol-treated cells was changed to the more flattened, enlarged, and irregular shape characteristic of cell senescence. The p21 Antisense Oligomers and siRNA Reversed the Anti-apoptotic Effects of Chloramphenicol—To determine the role of p21 in the resistance to apoptosis in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells, p21 antisense and siRNA were used. The p21 antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides reversed the resistance of chloramphenicol-treated cells to MMC- and MG132-induced apoptosis (Table II). The increased cellular caspase 3 activity normally seen during apoptosis induced by MMC was inhibited in chloramphenicol-treated cells (Fig. 6A). Addition of p21 siRNA restored the increase of caspase 3 activity induced by MMC. Similar effects were seen in PARP and procaspase 3 cleavage, two marker events of cell apoptosis (Fig. 6B).Table IIThe possible factors involved in chloramphenicol-associated apoptotic prevention10 μg/ml MMC50 μm MG132Control-20 μg/ml Chloramphenicol100 μg/ml Chloramphenicol-20 μg/ml ChloramphenicolWithout p21 oligomers8.7 ± 1.354.7 ± 12.136.9 ± 2.1*23.6 ± 0.9*75.8 ± 2.955.8 ± 1.4*p21 oligomers+ Antisense9.0 ± 2.4ND47.0 ± 1.0#42.8 ± 2.8#ND70.2 ± 2.2#+ Sense7.6 ± 0.6ND34.1 ± 0.526.2 ± 1.5ND59.9 ± 1.4 Open table in a new tab Mitochondrial Stress by Other 70 S Ribosomal Inhibitors Also Causes p21 Induction, SA-β-Galactosidase Activation, and p21-associated Apoptotic Resistance—Drugs, including doxycycline, minocycline, and clindamycin, that have been shown to inhibit prokaryotic translation also induced p21 accumulation (Fig. 7A), SA-β-galactosidase staining (Fig. 7B), and inhibition of MMC-induced caspase 3 activation (Fig. 7C). Mitochondria have been shown to play an important role in apoptosis induced by many factors (34Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Alteration of mitochondria can change the death signaling in either a positive or a negative fashion. Full mitochondrial function is required in amyloid β25–35-induced apoptosis (6Morais C. Sandra S. Russell H. Oliveira C.R. Brain Res. 2002; 931: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Jiang S. Cai J. Wallace D.C. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29905-29911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of the expression of mitochondrial-encoded proteins increases the susceptibility to nitric oxide-induced apoptosis in endothelial cells (35Ramachandran A. Moellering D.R. Ceaser E. Shiva S. Xu J. Darley-Usmar V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6643-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study, we reported that inhibition of mitochondrial-encoded protein expression by chloramphenicol attenuates mitomycin-induced apoptosis. This attenuating effect is p53 independent, because chloramphenicol treatment did not affect the MMC-induced p53 expression. In addition, the same effect was observed in p53-null H1299 cells. Chloramphenicol treatment enhanced the p21 expression in both HepG2 and H1299 cells, but not in Hep3B cells. The MMC-induced apoptosis in HepG2 and H1299 cells, but not in Hep3B cells, was attenuated by chloramphenicol treatment. The correlation between the chloramphenicol-induced p21 expression and the anti-apoptotic effect suggests that p21 might play an important role. This is further supported by the inhibitory effect of p21 antisense and siRNA on the chloramphenicol-induced anti-apoptotic effect. p21 functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and halts cell cycle progression via interaction with the cyclin-cydon-dependent kinase complex through its N-terminal domain (36Roninson I.B. Cancer Lett. 2002; 179: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 37Dotto G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1471: M43-M56PubMed Google Scholar). This arrest of DNA replication permits DNA repair and diminishes DNA damage by DNA-damaging agents. Although the anti-apoptotic effect of p21 is well established, the mechanisms by which p21 can prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis are not well understood. It has been shown that p21 phosphorylation by Akt at Thr-145 will relocalize p21 from the perinuclear region into the cytoplasm (40Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.H. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) where the p21 can interact with ASK1 (38Asada M. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and procaspase 3 (39Suzuki A. Tsutomi Y. Yamamoto N. Shibutani T. Akahane K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When it reacts with ASK1, the resulting p21-ASK1 complex inhibits c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-induced apoptosis (38Asada M. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazono K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the p21-procaspase 3 complex can mask the serine proteinase cleavage site and inhibit caspase 3 activation. Interestingly, the p21-procaspase 3 complex was found to colocalize with mitochondria (39Suzuki A. Tsutomi Y. Yamamoto N. Shibutani T. Akahane K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We found that, upon pretreatment of the cells with chloramphenicol, not only was the basal expression of p21 increased but also the p21 was redistributed from the perinuclear region to the cytoplasm and co-localized with the mitochondrial marker protein, core II. Furthermore, we found that MMC-induced activation of caspase 3 was inhibited in chloramphenicol-pretreated cells without significant changes in the cytochrome c levels in the cytosol. These data suggested that p21 accumulation and redistribution might be important in desensitization to MMC-induced apoptosis in chloramphenicol-pretreated cells. In this study, the levels of both p21 protein and p21 mRNA were increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cells pretreated with chloramphenicol. Expression of the p21 gene is controlled by transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional mechanisms (41Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1998; 20: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been reported that transcription of p21 can be regulated by p53 and other transcription factors, including E2F, AP2, Sp1, BRCA1, Smad, C/EBP, etc. (41Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1998; 20: 43-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, chloramphenicol treatment did not change the reporter signal in H1299 cells transfected with a plasmid containing the p21 promoter. This suggested that post-transcriptional control might be involved in chloramphenicol-induced p21 accumulation. Post-transcriptional regulation of p21 expression has been demonstrated with ultraviolet C (42Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 570: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). p21 mRNA contains a conserved AU-rich element in its 3′-untranslated region that could bind with the AUBF, hnRNP, and Elav-like protein HuR. In UVC-treated cells, HuR were accumulated in cytoplasm where they bound with p21 mRNA and enhanced stability of the p21 mRNA (42Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Moreover, a poly(C)-binding protein might also bind to p21 mRNA and stabilize the p21 mRNA (46Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2937-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our data showed that chloramphenicol treatment could stabilize p21 mRNA and thereby increase cellular protein level. However, the factors participating in chloramphenicol-induced p21 mRNA stabilization, and hence in p21 overexpression, are still unclear. Chloramphenicol-treated cells also showed morphological changes that resemble senescence (flattened, irregular shapes rich in vacuoles) with increased SA β-galactosidase activity. The SA β-galactosidase has been evidenced as a biomarker of senescence in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Senescent cells often show morphological alteration (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc.

Science. 1990; 249: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Senescent cells often show a decline in death signaling that would lead to accumulation of damaged cells, possibly representing a significant factor in the development of cancer (49Yoon Y.S. Byun H.O. Cho H. Kim B.K. Yoon G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51577-51586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 50Suh Y. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 881-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Mitochondria have been demonstrated that will operate the senescence biogenesis, especially in cellular redox regulation. A defect in mitochondrial complex II caused by the iron chelator desferrioxamine mesylate also causes senescence (49Yoon Y.S. Byun H.O. Cho H. Kim B.K. Yoon G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51577-51586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These findings, together with our findings reported here, suggest that mitochondrial damage might trigger biological senescence and senescence-associated responses. In the present studies, we found that chloramphenicol and other 70 S ribosomal inhibitors could induce p21 induction, anti-apoptosis, and senescence-like morphological deterioration. Our data also provide evidence that chloramphenicol-associated apoptotic resistance occurs through a p21-dependent pathway. Although chloramphenicol and its metabolites have been considered weak mutagens (19Robbana-Barnat S. Decloitre F. Frayssinet C. Seigneurin J.M. Toucas L. Lafarge-Frayssinet C. Drug Chem. Toxicol. 1997; 20: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Lafarge-Frayssinet C. Robbana-Barnat S. Frayssinet C. Toucas L. Decloitre F. Mutat. Res. 1994; 320: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we provide evidence that chloramphenicol might promote tumorigenesis indirectly through p21-associated apoptotic resistance. Hence, the clinical significance of our studies is that chloramphenicol administration, as well as other 70 S ribosomal inhibitors, should be used with caution, especially during cancer chemotherapy.

The protein is water-soluble, and during regulatory volume decrease after cell swelling, it is able to migrate from the cytosol to the cell membrane. Purified, water-soluble ICln is able to insert into lipid bilayers to form ion channels. Here, we show that ICln159, a truncated ICln mutant, which is also able to form ion channels in lipid bilayers, belongs to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfold family of proteins. The ICln PH domain shows unusual properties as it lacks the electrostatic surface polarization seen in classical PH domains. However, similar to many classical PH domain-containing proteins, ICln interacts with protein kinase C, and in addition, interacts with cAMP-dependent protein kinase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase type II but not cGMP-dependent protein kinase type Iβ. A major phosphorylation site for all three kinases is Ser-45 within the ICln PH domain.

In bacteria, overexpression of ICln leads to an improved tolerance to hypotonicity, an effect that can be reversed by the extracellular application of nucleotides (21Tao G.Z. Tashima Y. Peptides (N.

The extracellular effect of nucleotides was also shown for heterologous expression of ICln in oocytes, and the putative binding site for nucleotides was identified (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickmann K.

Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The successful reconstitution of purified ICln in artificial lipid bilayers demonstrated that ICln can indeed form ion conducting channels, the selectivity of which depends on the lipid composition of the membrane (23Fürst J.

In the cytosol, ICln forms two separate complexes with splicing factors. One complex (6S) contains ICln and the Sm heteromers D1 ·D2, D3 ·B/B′ and E ·F ·G. The other complex is composed of ICln, the arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, MEP-50, and Sm proteins and is termed the methylosome. The current hypothesis on the role of ICln in the splicing process is that ICln sequesters newly synthesized Sm proteins and directs these proteins to the methylosome, a protein complex that methylates Sm and possibly LSm proteins, prior to the assembly of the cytoplasmic UsnRNA core particle by the survival of motor neurons complex (6Friesen W.J.

Kambach C. Fischer U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).For both functions of ICln, e.g. ion transport as well as splicing, the structure of ICln is of utmost importance to better understand, on a molecular level, the regulatory mechanisms involved. The aim of the present study was to get insight into the protein-protein interaction of ICln based on the structure of its water-soluble form, which seems to connect multiple and different regulatory modules, a concept common for connector hubs in complex protein networks (3Guimera R. Nunes Amaral L.A. Nature. 2005; 433: 895-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Here, we show the NMR solution structure of ICln159, which demonstrates that ICln belongs to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain superfold family of proteins.PH domains are highly conserved in regulatory proteins involved in intracellular signaling. The best characterized physiological role of PH domains is to recruit and tether their host proteins to the cell membrane (27Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). PH domains are also known as substrates for different kinases (27Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was shown that ICln can be phosphorylated by a CKI/CKII-like kinase (28Sanchez-Olea R. Emma F. Coghlan M. Strange K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1381: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis predicts that ICln could also be phosphorylated by purified protein kinase C (PKC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase type Iβ or II (PKGI or PKGII). Here, we show that ICln159 interacts with PKC, PKA and, in addition, with PKGII, but not PKGI. The finding that ICln159 interacts with LSm proteins, as well as kinases, suggests that the ICln PH domain may serve as connector hub.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning—Starting from human (Homo sapiens) and dog (Canis canis) cDNA, the open reading frames of full-length LSm4 and ICln, as well as of the different ICln truncations, were amplified by PCR using standard protocols. The PCR products were cloned in-frame into the mammalian expression vectors pECFP-C1, pEYFP-C1, pECFP-N1, pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) to produce fusion proteins suitable for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). For protein purification, ICln and ICln truncations as well as LSm4 were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET3-His (23Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. König M. Gschwentner M.

The primer pairs and restriction sites used for amplification and cloning are given in the Supplemental Material.Protein Expression—All proteins were expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) or BL 21 (DE3) pLys, grown in either minimal (29Schedlbauer A.

Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture medium at an A600 of 0.8. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 2-4 h after induction of protein expression. Bacterial pellets of 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (ICln and ICln truncations: 25 mm K2HPO4, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole-HCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.2; LSm4, 25 mm K2HPO4, 900 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.2) and lysed twice in a French press at 15,000 p.s.i.Protein Purification—Purification and labeling of ICln and its truncations in E. coli BL21(DE3) for NMR, interaction, and bilayer experiments are described in detail in Refs. 23, 25, and 29. For the purification of hsLSm4, bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation and loaded onto a cation exchange column (bed volume, 8 ml, MacroPrep High S, Bio-Rad). After washing with 1 m NaCl in 25 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.2, bound proteins were eluted by increasing NaCl to 2 m. Fractions containing LSm4 were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Sephacryl S100 gel filtration column (bed volume 125 ml, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 25 mm K2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.2. Fractions containing LSm4 were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -70 °C. Protein-protein interaction assays were performed in gel filtration chromatography equilibration buffer at 4 °C.Bilayer Experiments—The experimental procedure used for the reconstitution of ICln in “black” lipid bilayers was previously described in detail (23Fürst J.

For the lipid bilayer membrane, a mixture (1:1) of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1% (w/v) lipids in n-decane was employed. After the membrane was formed and its stability was assessed, ICln159 (500 ng/ml) was added to the cis and trans chambers. The experiments were made at 28 °C, in a symmetrical solution composed of 100 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.00. To determine the ion selectivity of reconstituted ICln159, we chose a gradient for the ions employed that had a higher salt concentration in the trans chamber (150 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.00) and a lower concentration in the cis chamber (10 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES pH 8.00). The chloride gradient (ΔPDCl) was measured after each experiment and used to calculate the pK/pCl value according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. Reversal potentials were determined graphically by interpolation and were normalized to a gradient of 15 (23Fürst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. König M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A.

The NMR sample conditions were 1 mm protein, 25 mm K2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O, pH 7.0. NMR data were processed and analyzed with NMRPipe (30Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G.

NOE distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N/13C-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (150 ms) cross-peaks, which were classified into strong, medium, weak (1.8-2.2 Å|1.8-3.4Å|1.8-6Å). Hydrogen bonds within the α-helix and between adjacent β-strands were inferred from NOE patterns. Backbone torsion angle restraints were obtained from backbone secondary chemical shifts using the TALOS software package (36Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Phosphorylation was started by the addition of 5 μl of ATP (final concentration 120 μm) containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and terminated after 30 min (30 °C) by the addition of SDS sample mix. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE.Mass Spectrometry—Samples were digested overnight at 37 °C with two different enzymes. Digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 Protease (Roche Applied Science) was performed in a 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and digestion with trypsin (Roche Applied Science, sequencing grade) was performed in a 10 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.9). Protein digests were analyzed using capillary high pressure liquid chromatography connected on-line to a LCQ ion trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray interface as published previously (38Ott H.W. Lindner H. Sarg B. Mueller-Holzner E. Abendstein B. Bergant A. Fessler S. Schwaerzler P. Zeimet A. Marth C. Illmensee K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7507-7514PubMed Google Scholar). The nanospray voltage was set at 1.6 kV, and the heated capillary was held at 170 °C. Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were searched against the Madin-Darby canine kidney ICln sequence using TurboSEQUEST (BioWorks; ThermoFinnigan) with subsequent manual validation. Phosphorylation (+80 Da) was searched on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues as variable modification.Whole Cell Patch Clamp in NIH3T3 Fibroblasts—Whole cell patch clamp measurements were made as described in detail by Gschwentner et al.

Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.Statistical analysis—All values are given as mean ± S.E.. Data were tested for differences in the means by Student's t test after verifying normal distribution and equal variance within the data sets. A statistically significant difference was assumed at p < 0.05.RESULTSThe NMR Structure of ICln—As shown in Fig. 1, the full-length ICln protein from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells consists of 235 amino acids (aa) (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickmann K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Since this protein is prone to degradation (within days at room temperature), we decided to modify ICln by C-terminal truncation to circumvent problems with proteolysis during NMR data acquisition. Deleting the C-terminal 76 aa leads to an ICln protein comprised of the N-terminal 159 aa, which contains the putative transmembrane β-strands (1Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickmann K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). This truncated form of ICln (ICln159) proved to be very stable (for more than 1 week at room temperature), is monomeric in solution, and forms functional ion channels in lipid bilayers with a pK/pCl of 21.87 ± 4.2 (n = 12). The selectivity of these channels can, similarly to full-length ICln, be shifted toward chloride after the addition of 2 mm Ca2+ (pK/pCl = 7.86 ± 1.6; n = 7; Supplemental Materials, Supplement 1).The NMR structure of ICln159 exhibits a PH domain topology. It consists, as shown in Fig. 2a, of a pair of nearly orthogonal antiparallel β-sheets with strands β2, β3, and β4 forming one side of the β-barrel and strands β1, β5, β6, and β7 forming the other side of the β-barrel (Supplemental Materials, Table I). Near the C terminus, the β-barrel is capped by an α-helix that is formed by residues 117-133. The loops between β5 and β6 as well as β6 and β7 are highly mobile as evidenced by little or no deviation of their shifts from random coil values and the high 15N T2 values of the amides (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2NMR structure of water-soluble ICln159. a, a bundle of 15 final structures and a ribbon plot of ICln where the β6/β7 loop is displayed in magenta, β-sheets are in cyan, and the α-helix is in red.

GAT-1 has 15 endogenous cysteine residues of which three are located onextracellular loops. Studies on the related dopamine and serotonintransporters indicate that the cysteine residues, equivalent to their GATcounterparts at positions 164 and 173 (which are located in the secondextracellular loop), form a disulfide bond(11Wang J.B.

This leaves cysteine 74,located on the first extracellular loop, as the only cysteine that reacts withimpermeant methanethiosulfonate reagents. GABA transport by wild-type GAT-1 isonly very modestly inhibited by the membrane-impermeant (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl-)methanethiosulfonate(13Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J.Biol.

Mutagenesis studies, of GAT-1 and SERT, in particular (but also of othermembers of the family), have identified a conserved tyrosine (tyrosine 140 and176 in GAT-1 and SERT, respectively) in TMD 3 critical for neurotransmitterbinding (16Bismuth Y.

Theseobservations suggest that TMDs 1 and 3 may participate in the formation of thebinding pocket in this family of transporters and therefore may be close inspace. In this study, we have provided the first evidence for this idea. Generation and Subcloning of Mutants—Mutations were made bysite-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type GAT-1 in the vector pBluescriptSK(-) (Stratagene) using single-stranded uracil-containing DNA as describedpreviously (23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar,24Kleinberger-Doron N. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the parent DNAwas used to transform Escherichia coli CJ236 (dut–,ung–). From one of the transformants, single-strandeduracil-containing DNA was isolated upon growth in uridine-containing medium,according to the standard protocol from Stratagene, using helper phage R408.This yields the sense strand, and consequently mutagenic primers were designedto be anti-sense. Double cysteine mutants were prepared by subcloning mutantsin TMD 3 into a construct containing mutants in TMD 1 using unique restrictionenzymes. The coding and non-coding strands were sequenced between the uniquerestriction sites.

Inall the experiments described, the expression vector was pBluescript SK(-).The data presented in the figures deal with the inhibition of the transport ofmutants by sulfhydryl Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 (CuPh) andCd2+. The values of the transport of the untreated mutants as apercentage of that of the parent construct are given in the text or in thefigure legends, where the mutant appears for the first time. Inhibition byCopper(II)(1,10-Phenanthroline)3—HeLa cells transfectedwith the indicated construct were washed once with choline solution (150mm choline chloride, 5 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 0.5mm MgSO4, and 0.3 mm CaCl2) andpreincubated with the indicated concentration of CuPh. The CuPh stock solutionwas prepared for each experiment by mixing 0.4 ml of 1.25 m1,10-phenanthroline in water:ethanol (1:1) and 0.6 ml of 250 mmCuSO4. Inhibition by Cd2+—HeLa cellstransfected with the indicated construct were washed once with cholinesolution and preincubated with the indicated concentrations of cadmiumchloride in sodium solution (150 mm NaCl, 5 mmKPi, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 0.3mm CaCl2) for 5 min at room temperature. The solutionwas aspirated, and the cells were assayed for transport in the presence of thesame concentration of cadmium chloride. Effects of Thiol Cross-linking and Cd2+on Transport by W68C Double Mutants—The pioneering studies ofKaback and co-workers (27Sun J. Kemp C.R. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8020-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) todetect proximity relationships in lactose permease were based on creating,under oxidative conditions, a disulfide bond between two single cysteines,each located on a different TMD or loop. Extracellular loop 1, is the onlyextracellular loop between TMDs 1 and 3. If we could engineer aprotease-sensitive site in this loop, it might be possible to detectcross-links between TMDs 1 and 3 by detection of the full-length transporterafter cross-linking subsequent to proteolytic cleavage. However, this loop isalmost completely conserved between the members of the SLC6 transporterfamily. Moreover, cysteine 74 located on this loop reacts poorly with(2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl)methanethiosulfonate(13Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J.Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and therefore theprotease would unlikely be able to cut at such an engineered site. On the other hand, we have shown in the glutamate transporter GLT-1 thatfunctional criteria, such as inhibition of transport by CuPh, which isapparently due to the fact that these transporters undergo extensiveconformational changes during the translocation process, can be used asevidence for proximity (28Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).In fact, the recently published high resolution structure of a glutamatetransporter homologue (29Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar)confirmed the close proximity of a pair of cysteines, each located on adifferent re-entrant loop(28Brocke L. Bendahan A. Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3985-3992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our assumption is thatpositions that are accessible to a sulfhydryl reagent are excellent candidatesto be accessible to reactive oxygen species or divalent metal ions. Based on the studies of SERT(17Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), in GAT-1, the candidatepositions in TMD 3 are 136 and 143. In the external part of TMD 1, thepositions, where an externally accessible cysteine can be introduced so thatfunctionality is maintained, are 67, 68, and 70(19Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise,all of the studies described below were done in the background of C74A. We started with the W68C/I143C double mutant in the background of C74A.Potent inhibition of the transport of this double mutant was observed by CuPh(Fig. 1). No such inhibitionwas observed by the I143C single mutant (data not shown) or by the W68V/I43Cdouble mutant (Fig. 1). Thisindicates that the inhibition by CuPh observed in the double mutant isunlikely to be caused by the cross-linking of cysteine 143 with a previouslyburied endogenous cysteine, which became exposed because of the replacement oftryptophan 68. However, significant inhibition of transport by the singlemutant W68C was observed with CuPh, and the same was true when,simultaneously, a mutation to another residue, such as valine(Fig. 1) or to alanine (datanot shown) was introduced at position 143. The concentration dependence of the inhibition by CuPh of the W68C/L136Cdouble mutant by CuPh was similar to that observed in W68C alone (data notshown). We tried to reduce the inhibition by CuPh of transport by W68C byremoving the endogenous cysteines of GAT-1 one at a time or in combinations inthe background of W68C, yet the inhibition remained the same as in W68C alone.We also considered the possibility that the cysteine introduced at position 68might be cross-linked to the same cysteine in another transporter monomer.However, no higher molecular weight species than the monomer was found afterthe CuPh treatment of W68C followed by surface biotinylation (data notshown). Although the strongest inhibition of transport by CuPh was observed in theW68C/I143C double mutant, we looked for additional evidence that these twopositions could be close in space and examined the ability of the W68C/I143Cdouble mutant to form a high affinity Cd2+ binding site. Thisdivalent cation interacts with cysteinyl side chains(30Perez-Garcia M.T. Chiamvimonvat N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1996; 93: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,31Glusker J.P. Adv. ProteinChem. 1991; 42: 1-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the affinity of theinteraction is dramatically increased when the Cd2+ can becoordinated by two cysteines(32Benitah J.P. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Exposure of the single mutant W68C or the double mutants W68C/I143V orW68C/I143A to up to 500 μm Cd2+ had very littleeffect on [3H]GABA uptake (Fig.2), and the same is true for the W68V/I143C double mutant(Fig. 2) and the single mutantI143C (data not shown, but see Fig.5). In contrast to these controls, an inhibition of ∼70% isobserved on uptake by the W68C/I143C mutant, with a half-maximal effect at∼10 μm (Fig.2). This inhibition is reversible when, after preincubation withCd2+, the cells are washed with NaCl-containing medium supplementedwith 2 mm EDTA (data not shown).Fig. 5Inhibition of transport activity by cadmium ions. Conditions are thesame as described in the legend to Fig.2 using 500 μm Cd+2. Values represent themean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments done in triplicates.Activity of mutants investigated as percentage of C74A-GAT-1 was 53.5 ±3.9% for I143C, 2.5 ± 0.9% for V67S/I143C, and 56.4 ± 3.8% forV67C/L136C (n = 4). Mutants shown are in C74A background unless WTbackground is indicated (WT). Activity of V67C in the WT background(percentage of WT) was 74.0 ± 4.9%.

This suggests that the cysteines introducedat positions 68 and 143 come in close proximity within the transporter monomerbut not at the interface of two transporter monomers. The specificity of theability of the two cysteines introduced at positions 68 and 143 to generate aCd2+ binding site is illustrated by the fact that very littleinhibition of [3H]GABA transport was observed by concentrations ashigh as 500 μm Cd2+ in the double mutants W68C/L136C,G79C/I143C, and A81C/I143C (with position 79 located in extracellular loop 1and position 81 at the extracellular end of TMD 2)(Fig. 3). The same was true foreach of the single mutants W68C, L136C, and I143C, each in the wild-typebackground (here a cysteine is present at position 74; in contrast, the singlemutants shown in the other figures were in the C74A background).Cd2+ sensitivity in the latter cysteine mutants would have beenindicative of their ability to form a Cd2+ binding site with thecysteine at position 74 in the extracellular loop 1(Fig. 3). Effects of Cadmium Ions on V67C/I143C and F70C/I143CDouble Mutants—Adjacent to tryptophan 68 is valine 67, and the V67Cmutant also has significant transport activity(19Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cd2+ alsoinhibited uptake by the double mutant V67C/I143C up to a maximum extent of∼70% (Fig. 4), but itsapparent affinity, with an IC50 of ∼50 μm, wasconsiderably lower than that observed with W68C/I143C(Fig. 2). No significantinhibition by Cd2+ was observed in the single mutants V67C(Fig. 4) or I143C(Fig. 5) or in the doublemutants V67C/I143A (Fig. 4),V67S/I143C, or V67C/L136C (Fig.5). Further evidence for the specificity of the formation of theCd2+ binding site comes from the fact that uptake by V67C in thewild-type background (probing the ability of the cysteines at positions 67 and74 to form such a site) also was not significantly inhibited by the divalentcation (Fig. 5). Again, as wasthe case for the pair W68C and I143C (Fig.2), Cd2+ did not inhibit when the single mutants V67Cand I143C were coexpressed (Fig.5). There was only a very modest inhibition by Cd2+ on transport bythe F70C/I143C double mutant, which was only slightly increased as comparedwith that on the single mutant F70C and the double mutant F70C/I143V(Fig. 6). However,Cd2+ inhibition of transport in the double mutant F70C/I143A wasalmost the same as in F70C/I143C (Fig.6). Thus it appears that the weak inhibition observed is notnecessarily because of the simultaneous presence of cysteines at positions 70and 143. We have created a Cd2+ binding site formed by cysteinesintroduced at TMD 1 position 68 and TMD 3 position 143 (Figs.2 and3). The simultaneous presenceof both of these cysteines is required. The site is not formed 1) with thesingle cysteine replacements (Figs.2 and5); 2) with one cysteineintroduced at either position and a mutation to an amino acid other thancysteine at the other position (Fig.2); 3) when, besides the cysteine at position 143, another isintroduced at position 74 or at 79 in the first extracellular loop or atposition 81 at the top of TMD 2 (Fig.3); and 4) when, besides the cysteine at position 68, another isintroduced at position 136 in TM3 or at position 74(Fig. 3). We observed anadditional Cd2+ binding site when a cysteine is introduced at theneighboring TMD 1 position 67 together with the one at position 143, but theCd2+ affinity was at least five times lower(Fig. 4). A very modestinhibition is also observed in the F70C/I143C double mutant, but thisinhibition does not depend on having a cysteine at position 143, because it isalso observed in the F70C/I143A double mutant(Fig. 6). This latter resultsuggests that a perturbation at position 143 may cause one of the endogenouscysteines present in GAT-1 to come closer to the cysteine introduced atposition 70. We did not explore this possibility due to the very low activityof the F70C/I143A double mutant (∼3% of WT). This would hamper theapproach of replacing the endogenous cysteines one at a time to abolishCd2+ sensitivity. There is good evidence that other members of the SLC6 family, such as SERTor the dopamine transporter DAT, exist in the membrane as dimers(33Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,34Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or as a dimer of dimers(35Hastrup H. Sen N. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45045-45048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is very well possiblethat this is a property of all of the members of this family, with perhaps theglycine transporters 1 and 2 as an exception(36Horiuchi M. Nicke A. Gomeza J. Aschrafi A. Schmalzing G. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2001; 98: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, theCd2+ binding site formed by the cysteine pair introduced atpositions 68 and 143 appears to be intrarather than intermolecular(Fig. 3). This observationsuggests the possibility that the monomeric form of GAT-1, and likely alsothat of the other family members, may be the functional unit, and the role ofthe oligomeric state may be in the targeting of the transporters to the plasmamembrane (37Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or in theformation of a structural framework enabling the monomers to fulfill theirfunction. An example of the alternative possibility comes from the highresolution structure of a glutamate transporter homologue(29Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar); the monomer is thefunctional unit, but the trimer is essential, because it allows the assemblyof the bowl-like structure, which effectively shortens the membrane width forglutamate translocation. A high resolution structure of an SLC6 family memberwill be required to answer this issue in this family. Formation of a Cd2+ binding site in the W68C/I143C double mutantindicates that the distance between parts of TMD 1 and 3 positions is <5Å, compatible with the possibility that the extended form of GABA maybridge this distance and interact simultaneously with molecular determinantson both TMDs. Tyrosine 140, located one turn of a putative α-helix belowposition 143, plays a crucial role in GABA binding(16Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and similar evidenceexists for such a role of the conserved tyrosine in the glycine transporterGlyT (38Ponce J. Biton B. Benavides J. Avenet P. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13856-13862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and in SERT(17Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because this tyrosine isinvariant among all family members, we have suggested that it interacts withthe amino group of the substrate, the moiety common to amino acids andbiogenic amines (16Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Arginine69 from TMD 1 is absolutely critical for GABA transport(21Kanner B.I. J. Biol.Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,39Pantanowitz S. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3222-3225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we have suggestedthat this residue could be important in the liganding of the carboxyl group ofGABA (19Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,21Kanner B.I. J. Biol.Chem. 2003; 278: 3705-3712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the biogenic aminetransporters, there are suggestions that an aspartate, at the TMD 1 positionequivalent to that of 63 of GAT-1, is critical for substrate binding(40Barker E.L. Moore K.R. Rakhshan F. Blakely R.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4705-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The distance constraintrevealed by our study clearly supports the idea that, in GAT-1 and presumablyin the other family members as well, the binding determinants for thesubstrate are located on TMD 1 and 3. The affinity for Cd2+ in the V67C/I143C mutant is at least5-fold lower than that in the W68C/I143C mutant. There are several possibleexplanations for this observation. First, position 68 may be closer to 143than is position 67. An alternative possibility is that the bond angles of thepair 68/143 are more conducive to Cd2+ binding than those of the67/143 pair. Finally, although it has been reported that the apparent affinityfor the interaction with Cd2+ is increased even when the bindingsite is coordinated by two cysteines(32Benitah J.P. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7392-7396Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), in another system, threecysteines have been implicated in Cd2+ binding(41Loussouarn G. Makhina E.N. Rose T. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the apparentaffinity for Cd2+ in the latter case (Kd ∼5μm) was lower than in the former (Kd∼0.1 μm), indicating that other parameters are relevant aswell. Nevertheless, it is possible that the higher affinity forCd2+ in the W68C/I143C pair is the result of a contribution ofanother (yet unknown) contact site within the W68C/I143C transporter and thatthis additional site contributes less to the binding site in V67C/I143C. Suchcontributions have been observed during zinc sensitivity studies in DATmutants (42Loland C.J. Norregaard L. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36928-36934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The effects of CuPh on the W68C mutants also support the idea that thecysteines introduced at positions 68 and 143 are in close proximity(Fig. 1). Even though theW68C/I143C mutant was much more sensitive to CuPh than W68C, there was still asignificant inhibition in this mutant as well as in those where the W68Cmutation was paired with a non-cysteine mutation at position 143(Fig. 1). We failed to identifyan endogenous cysteine as a potential partner for the cysteine introduced atposition 68, and the reason for this inhibition by CuPh is not yet clear.Another potential target to find such relationships may be TMD 2, which ishighly conserved in the SLC6 family. This TMD is possibly close to theexternal part of TMD 1, because extracellular loop 1 is very short. Theactivity of TMD 2 cysteine mutants, except for A81C, is not inhibited bymethane thiosulfonate reagents (data not shown), and the same is true in SERT(43Sato Y. Zhang Y.W. Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22926-22933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the cysteinesintroduced into TMD 2 may still be accessible to the much smallerCd2+. Thus probing pairs of cysteines introduced into TMD 2together with those in TMD 1 and/or 3 with Cd2+ may potentiallylead to the identification of additional structural constraints in GAT-1."

Mutagenesis, kinetic, and NMR studies have indicated that residues His-186 and Asn-189, which are conserved as His-191 and Asn-194 in OYE1, are important in ligand binding, and that His-186 is not the key proton donor required for the reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (24Messiha H.L.

The turnover mechanism for MR is a ping-pong reaction comprising two half-reactions. The mechanism of flavin reduction and oxidation in MR (Fig. 1A) has been studied by stopped-flow and steady-state kinetic methods (25Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of the primary kinetic isotope effect for flavin reduction in MR by nicotinamide coenzyme indicates that quantum mechanical tunneling plays a major role in hydride transfer (26Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The oxidative half-reaction (Fig. 1, A and B) is fully rate-limiting in steady-state turnover with the substrate 2-cyclohexen-1-one and NADH at saturating concentrations and hydride transfer from FMNH2 to 2-cyclohexen-1-one occurs by tunneling (26Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A large solvent isotope effect accompanies the oxidative half-reaction, and double isotope effects indicate that hydride transfer from the flavin N5 atom to 2-cyclohexen-1-one, and the protonation of 2-cyclohexen-1-one by an unknown donor, are coupled (26Basran J. Harris R.J. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43973-43982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Herein we report the isolation and properties of a number of mutant forms of MR with the intention of identifying the key proton donor required for the reduction of 2-cyclohexen-1-one and related compounds. Based on the crystal structure of MR, we have targeted all possible side-chain proton donors and demonstrated retention of activity for each mutant form. Based on the studies reported herein and our previously published mutagenesis studies in which we targeted residues Cys-191 and His-186 (24Messiha H.L. Munro A.W. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4627-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we infer that solvent is the source of the proton in the oxidative half-reaction of MR. This contrasts with similar reactions catalyzed by OYE1 where Tyr-196 has been shown to be the key proton donor. We also demonstrate that Thr-32, which forms a hydrogen bond to the C4 carbonyl oxygen atom and is highly conserved throughout the OYE family, has a major role in modulating the flavin reduction potential. Mutagenesis of this residue (T32A) decreases the mid-point reduction potential of the FMN by ∼50 mV, with concomitant effects on the rates of flavin reduction and oxidation by NADH and 2-cyclohexen-1-one, respectively. Our work further emphasizes detailed mechanistic features of MR in its reaction with reducing coenzyme and α/β unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The study also highlights differences in reaction chemistry compared with those reactions catalyzed by OYE1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All materials were of analytical grade.

The Y72F, the Y356F, the W106F, and the T32A mutant MR enzymes were isolated using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TCG CCC ACC GCC CGC GGC TTT GTC TAC ACG CCG GGG ATC-3′ and 5′-GAT CCC CGG CGT GTA GAC AAA GCC GCG GGC GGT GGG CGA-3′ (Y72F), 5′-CCC GAC CCC AGC ACC TTC TTT GGC GGC GCC GAG GTC GGC-3′ and 5′-GCC GAC CTC GGC GCC GCC AAA GAA GGT GCT GGG GTC GGG-3′ (Y356F), 5′-CGC ATC GCC CTG CAG CTG TTT CAC GTC GGC CGT GTC TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA GAC ACG GCC GAC GTG AAA CAG CTG CAG GGC GAT GCG-3′ (W106F), 5′-GTG ATC ATG GCG CCG CTG GCG CGC TCG CGC ACG CCG GAC-3′ and 5′-GTC CGG CGT GCG CGA GCG CGC CAG CGG CGC CAT GAT CAC-3′ (T32A). Plasmid pMORB3 (1French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used as template for the mutagenesis reactions. The mutant genes were completely sequenced to ensure that spurious changes had not arisen during the mutagenesis reaction. Expression and purification of the mutant MR enzymes was as described for wild-type enzyme (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with the exception of W106F and T32A mutant enzymes, which did not bind to the Mimetic Yellow 2 resin. These enzymes were purified using Q-Sepharose resin as described for wild-type procedures (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but with an additional column washing step involving the passage of 2 liters of buffer B (2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0) through the column followed by 2 liters of 230 mm NaCl in buffer B. The mutant enzymes were eluted from the column using the procedures adopted for the wild-type enzyme (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Redox Potentiometry—Redox titrations were performed at 25 ± 2 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a Belle Technology glove box under anaerobic conditions. Enzyme solutions (60-80 μm in ∼10 ml of titration buffer) were electrochemically titrated according to the method of Dutton (28Dutton P. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) using sodium dithionite as reductant and potassium ferricyanide as oxidant. Mediators were added to facilitate electrical communication between the enzyme and the electrode prior to titration. Typically, 5 μm 2-hydroxy-1,4-napthaquinone, 2 μm phenazine methosulfate, 1 μm methyl viologen, and 1 μm benzyl viologen were included in the titration to mediate in the range between +100 and -480 mV. The electrochemical potential of the enzyme solutions was measured using a Hanna pH 211 meter coupled to a platinum/calomel electrode (ThermoRussell Ltd.) that had been previously calibrated using the Fe+3/Fe+2 EDTA couple as a standard (+108 mV). The calomel electrode was corrected by +244 mV relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. The electrode was allowed to stabilize between each addition of reductant or oxidant and spectra (300-700 nm) were recorded using a Cary 50 UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer (Varian) via a fiber optic cable immersed in the enzyme solution and connected to the external spectrophotometer. The spectra of at least 30-40 points across a whole range of redox potentials during the process of reduction and oxidation were recorded. Titrations were performed over a 5- to 7-h period. Equilibration was achieved throughout the titrations, and no hysteretic behavior was observed. Corrections were made for small amounts of protein evaporation during titrations as described previously (29Craig D.H. Barna T. Moody P.C. Bruce N.C. Chapman S.K. Munro A.W. Scrutton N.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plots of the absorbance against redox potential were fitted to Equation 1, which is derived by extension of the Nernst equation and the Beer-Lambert law using Equation 1, as described previously (30Munro A.W. Noble M.A. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar),Aobs=(a+b10(E12−E)/29.5)1+10(E12−E)/29.5(Eq. 1) where Aobs is the absorbance value at the peak for the oxidized flavin in wild-type MR and the mutants analyzed) at the electrode potential E, and a, b are the absorbance values of the fully oxidized and reduced enzyme at this wavelength, respectively. E12 is the midpoint potential for the concerted two-electron reduction of the MR flavin. Data manipulation and analysis were performed using GraFit software package version 5.0. All redox potentials are given relative to the standard hydrogen electrode.Kinetic Studies—All kinetic studies were performed under strict anaerobic conditions (<5 ppm of O2) within a glove-box environment (Belle Technology) to prevent oxidase activity of MR. Steady-state assays were performed using a Jasco V530 spectrophotometer at 25 °C. Reaction buffer was 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, which was made anaerobic by bubbling with humidified Pureshield argon at 5 p.s.i. for 2 h prior to introduction into the glove box. NADH solutions were made from pre-weighed powder and anaerobic buffer inside the glove box, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ340 = 6220 m-1 cm-1). Solutions of 2-cyclohexen-1-one were made by dilution of a stock (10 m) into anaerobic buffer. The initial velocity in steady-state assays was determined from absorbance changes at 340 nm in a reaction cell volume of 1 ml; the desired concentration of substrate and cofactor solutions was achieved by making microliter additions to the cell. Least-squares fitting procedures to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation or to the simple substrate inhibition equation (31Tipton K. Engel P. Enzymology LabFax. BIOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1996: 115-174Google Scholar) were performed using GraFit software package version 5.0.Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX.17MV stopped-flow instrument, and transients were analyzed using non-linear least-squares regression using Spectrakinetics software (Applied Photophysics). Averages of five to seven individual transients were analyzed. Enzyme was contained in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. In the reductive half-reaction, enzyme (20 mm) was mixed with NADH at different concentrations (at least >5-fold the enzyme concentration to ensure pseudo first order conditions). Flavin reduction was monitored at 462 nm; formation and decay of the oxidized enzyme·NADH charge-transfer species was monitored at 552 nm (25Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In studies of the oxidative half-reaction, MR enzyme was titrated with sodium dithionite to produce the two-electron-reduced form of MR. Reduced MR (20 mm) was then mixed with 2-cyclohexen-1-one at different concentrations, and flavin oxidation was monitored at 462 nm. Equations used to analyze the reductive half-reaction and the oxidative half-reaction have been described elsewhere (25Craig D.H. Moody P.C.E. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7598-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Computational Chemistry—To aid in interpreting the experimental results, computational studies were performed on wild-type and T32A MR. These calculations were based on model systems. The positions of the flavin and Thr-32 were defined from the crystal structure of oxidized MR (PDB accession code 1gwj (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)), and the FMN ribotyl moiety was truncated to methane, forming lumiflavin, as in our previous studies (20Trickey P. Basran J. Lian L.Y. Chen Z. Barton J.D. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7678-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To eliminate strain present in the isoalloxazine ring from the crystal structure, the oxidized lumiflavin was replaced by a copy optimized, using Gaussian 03 (www.gaussian.com/citation.htm), at the B3LYP/3-21G(d) level of theory. To obtain the LUMO energy of the lumiflavin in wild-type and T32A MR, QM/MM calculations were performed using ONIOM (34Vreven T. Morokuma K. J. Comp. Chem. 2000; 21: 1419-1432Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar) within Gaussian 03. The amino acid (Thr or Ala, respectively) was treated molecular mechanically, using the UFF force field (35Rappe A.K. Casewit C.J. Colwell K.S. Goddard W.A. Skiff I.W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10024-10035Crossref Scopus (7368) Google Scholar), with charges derived using the charge equilibration (QEQ) scheme (36Rappe A.K. Goddard W.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 95: 3358-3363Crossref Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). The electronic embedding scheme available in Gaussian 03 was used to account for electrostatic interactions in the QM/MM Hamiltonian, and the lumiflavin was treated quantum mechanically using various levels of theory: HF/3-21G(d), B3LYP/3-21G(d), B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31+G(d), B3LYP/6-311+G(d), B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p), and MP2/6-311++G(d,p). The corresponding two-electron reduction potential obtained was similar to our previous studies (20Trickey P. Basran J. Lian L.Y. Chen Z. Barton J.D. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Mathews F.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7678-7688Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), using an empirical fit (at the appropriate level of theory) to experimentally measured reduction potentials of a range of flavin derivatives (37Hasford J.J. Rizzo C.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 2251-2255Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar).RESULTSActive Site Structure and Implications for Catalysis—Our previous studies of MR (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) established a very close structural relationship with OYE1 (15Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and PETN reductase (16Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Overlay of the structures of the active sites of these enzymes indicates a high degree of sequence and structural conservation; in particular, residue Trp-106 (MR) occupies a similar position in each enzyme (Fig. 2A) and is conserved throughout the OYE family of enzymes (Fig. 2D). The corresponding residue in PETN reductase plays a major role in directing reactivity against nitroaromatic substrates along nitro reduction and hydride transfer pathways, the latter generating a Meisenheimer·hydride complex of the nitroaromatic substrate. High resolution structural studies indicate that in PETN reductase the tryptophan residue adopts multiple conformational states influenced by ligand (nitroaromatic) binding (38Khan H. Barna T. Harris R.J. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Munro A.W. Moody P.C. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30563-30572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Meisenheimer·hydride pathway for nitroaromatic degradation is restricted to PETN reductase (22Williams R.E. Rathbone D.A. Scrutton N.S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 3566-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 39French C.E. Nicklin S. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2864-2868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), prompting the question as to the role of the conserved tryptophan residue in the remaining members of the OYE family. Also conserved throughout the family are residues known to be involved in ligand binding through interaction with the carbonyl moiety of the oxidizing substrate (e.g. 2-cyclohexen-1-one, selected steroids, and codeinone) and the reducing coenzyme (NADH or NADPH). In MR these residues are His-186 and Asn-189, but in PETN reductase the residue corresponding to Asn-189 (MR) is conservatively replaced by histidine (His-184). Our work (16Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Messiha H.L. Munro A.W. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol.

Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 40Brown B.J. Deng Z. Karplus P.A. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that these are key determinants in ligand binding, but that the conserved histidine residue is not involved in proton donation to substrate. Thr-32 (MR) is also conserved throughout the family (Fig. 2C), and is known to modulate the potential of the FMN in OYE1 (41Xu D. Kohli R.M. Massey V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3556-3561Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A striking difference between MR and OYE1 and PETN reductase is the absence of a tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr-196 (OYE1) and Tyr-186 (PETN reductase). In OYE1, Tyr-196 is the proton donor required for the reduction of two cyclic enone substrates (23Kohli R.M. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32763-32770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and structural data suggest a similar role in PETN reductase (16Barna T.M. Khan H. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 433-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In MR, however, the corresponding residue (Cys-191) is known not to donate a proton to oxidizing substrates (17Barna T. Messiha H.L. Petosa C. Bruce N.C. Scrutton N.S. Moody P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30976-30983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), thereby prompting the question as to the source of the proton during reduction of two cyclic enone substrates. The structure of MR indicates two further residues (Tyr-72 and Tyr-356) that could potentially supply a proton in the oxidative half-reaction, and for this reason we have mutated each residue to phenylalanine and investigated the kinetics of substrate reduction by the Y72F and Y356F enzymes. We have also characterized (i) the T32A enzyme to probe effects on flavin potential and enzyme catalysis and (ii) the W106F enzyme to investigate any unforeseen role for the highly conserved tryptophan residue in the OYE family of enzymes.Fig. 2A, structural overlay of the active sites of MR (pink), PETN reductase (red), and OYE1 (green). Residue identities are those for MR; in OYE1 and PETN reductase residue Cys-191 (MR) is replaced by tyrosine. B, active site structure of MR illustrating those residues targeted by mutagenesis either in this study, or in previously published work (24Messiha H.L. Munro A.W. Bruce N.C. Barsukov I.

These complexes become deposited into surrounding tissue matrices, where they regulate cell adhesion and pericellular proteolysis. The mechanism for their co-localization has not been elucidated. We hypothesize that PAI-1-vitronectin complexes form in a stepwise and concentration-dependent fashion via 1:1 and 2:1 intermediates, with the 2:1 complex serving a key role in assembly of higher order complexes. To test this hypothesis, sedimentation velocity experiments in the analytical ultracentrifuge were performed to identify different PAI-1-vitronectin complexes. Analysis of sedimentation data invoked a novel multisignal method to discern the stoichiometry of the two proteins in the higher-order complexes formed (Balbo, A., Minor, K. H., Velikovsky, C.

In contrast to PAI-1, which is locally produced and secreted by cells into the pericellular environment, the main source of vitronectin for tissue deposition is probably its recruitment from circulation. Incorporation of vitronectin into tissue ECM is linked to “activation” of the protein into an altered, adhesive form, which is both structurally and functionally distinct from its native, plasma counterpart (3.Bloemendal H.J. De Boer H.C. Koop E.A. Van Dongen A.J. Goldschmeding R. Landman W.J. Logtenberg T. Gebbink M.F. Voest E.E. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2004; 53: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Adhesive functions adopted by this altered form of vitronectin work in parallel with the inhibitory functions of PAI-1, in a fashion that allows for co-regulation of cell adhesion and tissue degradation. The exact mechanism by which plasma vitronectin adopts the altered form, is relocalized, and becomes associated with PAI-1 in tissues under pathological scenarios is currently undefined.Interaction of PAI-1 and vitronectin affects the structural and functional properties of both proteins. The active structure of free PAI-1 is relatively unstable, and it readily converts into a latent, inactive form by spontaneous insertion of its reactive center loop into the central β-sheet core of the protein (24.Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However, vitronectin bound to PAI-1 stabilizes the serpin in an active, inhibitory conformation (7.Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by binding across the base of the central β-sheet of PAI-1 and constraining the movement necessary to accommodate insertion of the reactive center loop (25.Lawrence D.A. Olson S.T. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3643-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to this stabilization, association with vitronectin endows PAI-1 with inhibitory properties toward a wider repertoire of serine proteases, including thrombin and activated protein C, thus expanding the antiproteolytic potential of PAI-1 (26.Ehrlich H.J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Binding of PAI-1 also affects the adhesive properties of vitronectin that arise from its association with cell surfaces and the ECM. Cell surface receptors (e.g. integrins and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor) bind vitronectin at sites that lie proximal to the high affinity PAI-1 site in the SMB domain of vitronectin (8.Seiffert D.

Under some conditions, PAI-1 disrupts cell receptor binding to vitronectin via a presumed steric effect (32.Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A.

However, under other conditions, PAI-1 actually promotes the association of native vitronectin with purified integrins αVβ3 and GPIIbIIIa (34.Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10337-10345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or cultured cells (34.Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. J. Biol.

Peterson, submitted for publication. 2K. H. Minor, C. E. Wilkins-Port, S. Kuruganti, P. J. McKeown-Longo, and C. B. Peterson, submitted for publication. In addition to such variable effects on interactions with receptors, PAI-1 binding also enhances interactions of vitronectin with heparin, osteonectin, and purified ECM from human placenta (34.Minor K.H.

A similar effect of PAI-1 is apparent in cell culture, in which the PAI-1-vitronectin complexes preferentially are relocalized to the ECM of cultured fibroblasts in a manner that requires glycosaminoglycans. 2K. H. Minor, C. E. Wilkins-Port, S. Kuruganti, P. J. McKeown-Longo, and C. B. Peterson, submitted for publication. These findings suggest that the changes that accompany vitronectin binding may define a mechanism for the recruitment of PAI-1 and vitronectin to tissues in pathological situations.Sedimentation equilibrium analysis first showed that PAI-1 interacts with vitronectin to form a complex with a 2:1 (PAI-1/vitronectin) stoichiometry that associates into a higher order form comprising four PAI-1 molecules and two vitronectin molecules (37.Podor T.J. Shaughnessy S.G. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Formation of the 4:2 complex was postulated to proceed via transient 1:1 and 2:1 species, although these intermediates were not significantly populated in the equilibrium studies (37.Podor T.J. Shaughnessy S.G. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This study provided the first evidence that PAI-1 binds simultaneously to two sites on vitronectin and prompted our working hypothesis, that formation of these 2:1 complexes is the step that controls the pathway for assembly of higher-order PAI-1-vitronectin complexes that adopt altered adhesive properties. In the present study, hydrodynamic approaches were expanded to investigate the mechanism of assembly with defined intermediates to produce multivalent, higher order complexes containing PAI-1 and vitronectin.MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification and Labeling of Vitronectin—Monomeric vitronectin was purified from human plasma as described previously (38.Gibson A.D.

For multiwavelength studies, vitronectin was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate using a FluoReporter® protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) that labels primary amines. The molar ratio of dye to vitronectin in the labeling reaction typically resulted in conjugation of ∼2 fluorescein molecules per vitronectin monomer; labeling ratios varied from 1.5 to 1.8 mol of fluorescein per mol of vitronectin. The labeled vitronectin monomer was fully functional, with no adverse effects of labeling on PAI-1 binding.Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant PAI-1—The stable I4-1B mutant PAI-1 (40.Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and latent PAI-1 were obtained from Molecular Innovations, Inc. The W175F variant (41.Blouse G.E. Perron M.J.

The recombinant human PAI-1 gene was cloned into the pET-24d vector (Novagen) as described previously (43.Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The M347C (P1′-Cys) form of PAI-1 was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis using the MutaGene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) using the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-1125dGATCTCCTCGGGGGCACAGCGGGCTGAGACTAT1093-3′. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the full-length PAI-1 gene.Mutant and wild-type PAI-1 constructs were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified as described (43.Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Thompson J.H. Day D.E. Link C.A. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11997-12009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Labeling of the P1′-Cys PAI-1 variant with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (Molecular Probes) was carried out as described previously (44.Shore J.D. Day D.E. Francis-Chmura A.M. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5395-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with a labeling efficiency of 1-1.2 mol of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein/mol of PAI-1 variant. Latent PAI-1 that typically accumulated during the labeling reaction was removed by affinity chromatography on immobilized β-anhydrotrypsin as described (41.Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All final unlabeled and P1′-fluorescein-labeled preparations were shown to be >98% active by detecting a stable, inactive acyl-enzyme complex with tPA using SDS-PAGE analysis (41.Blouse G.E.

PAI-1 protein concentrations were determined from absorption at 280 nm, using a Mr of 43,000 and extinction coefficients of 0.93 ml mg-1 cm-1 for wild-type PAI-1 (45.Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or 0.83 ml mg-1 cm-1 for W175F PAI-1 (41.Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Concentrations of labeled P1′-fluorescein PAI-1 were determined by the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) using wild-type PAI-1 as the standard (46.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213510) Google Scholar).Kinetic Assay to Quantify Active PAI-1—Equimolar amounts of PAI-1 and vitronectin (2 μm) were mixed in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 2 mm monobasic potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 m NaCl and 3 mm KCl) and incubated at room temperature. At various time points from 15 min to 35 h, an aliquot of the vitronectin/PAI-1 mixture was added to 2 μm tPA and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to allow inactivation of tPA by active PAI-1. The vitronectin/PAI-1/tPA mixture was added to 0.1 mm Spectrozyme® tPA (American Diagnostica Inc., Stamford, CT), and the absorbance at 405 nm was read after 5 min.Sedimentation Velocity Experiments—A Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with both absorbance and interference optical detection systems were used to follow the formation of higher order complexes between vitronectin and PAI-1. Epon double sector centerpieces were filled with 400 μl of samples containing either vitronectin or PAI-1 alone or mixtures of the two at varying molar ratios. All samples were first dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline. For all experiments, the dialysate was loaded into the reference sector. Samples were centrifuged at a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm, and data were collected in fringes using interference optics and/or by absorbance at 494 nm, the extinction maximum for fluorescein.Hydrodynamic Modeling of the Sedimentation Velocity Data—Sedimentation velocity analyses were performed with the program SEDFIT (available on the World Wide Web from www.AnalyticalUltracentrifugation.com) as described in detail in Ref. 47.Dam J. Schuck P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 185-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar that carry out size distribution analyses based on Lamm equation modeling (48.Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 49.Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 50.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). Briefly, the analysis of velocity profiles was performed by direct boundary modeling by distributions of Lamm equation solutions c(s) with the following, α(r,t)≅∫sminsmaxc(s)χ1(s,F,r,t)ds+b(r)+β(t)(Eq. 1) where a(r,t) denotes the measured absorbance or interference profiles at position r at time t, b(r) and β(t) are the characteristic systematic offsets (50.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar), and χ1(s,F,r,t) are solutions of the Lamm equation, ∂χ∂t=1r∂∂r[rD∂χ∂r−sω2r2χ](Eq. 2) (with ω denoting the rotor angular velocity, D the diffusion coefficient, and s the sedimentation coefficient) at unit loading concentration (51.Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Astr. Fys. 1929; 21B: 1-4Google Scholar). D and s are related via the frictional ratio F = (f/f0) and the hydrodynamic scale relationship, D(s)=218πkTs−1/2(ηF)−3/2((1−υ¯ρ)/υ¯)1/2(Eq. 3) (with η and ρ the solvent viscosity and density, respectively, and ν¯ the partial specific volume of the macromolecules, which were calculated using the software SEDNTERP (50.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar)). The nonlinear regression with Equation 1 was combined with the determination of the best fit weight average frictional ratio, the best fit meniscus position, and the algebraic calculation of systematic time-invariant and radial-invariant noise components and maximum entropy regularization at a confidence level of 0.70 (47.Dam J. Schuck P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 185-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 51.Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Astr. Fys. 1929; 21B: 1-4Google Scholar). Because these systematic signals are arbitrary offsets introduced from the detection system, calculated systematic offsets can be subtracted from the raw data without introduction of bias if the degrees of freedom in the analysis are not reduced. Therefore, the final calculated best fit offsets are subtracted from the raw data for presentation purposes. In all calculations, both meniscus and frictional ratio parameters were optimized by carrying out nonlinear regression to obtain best fits. s values were converted to standard conditions in water at 20 °C with the program SEDNTERP (50.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar).Multisignal Analysis of Sedimentation Data for Fluorescently Labeled PAI-1/Vitronectin Mixtures—Sedimentation velocity data acquired simultaneously at different signals (refractive index and absorbance) were globally modeled with a superposition of component sedimentation coefficients ck(s) according to the following, αλ(r,t)≅∑k=1Kεkλ∫sminsmaxck(s)χ1(s,Fk,wr,t)ds λ=1…Λ,K≤Λ(Eq. 4) where ϵkλ denotes the extinction coefficient (or generalized signal increment) of component k at signal λ. This multisignal generalization of Equation 1 for heterogeneous protein interactions is described in detail elsewhere (52.Balbo A. Minor K.H. Velikovsky C.A. Mariuzza R.A. Peterson C.B. Schuck P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and was implemented in the software SEDPHAT (available on the World Wide Web at www.AnalyticalUltracentrifugation.com). Briefly, the extinction coefficients were predetermined in separate experiments with each protein component alone. As a result, the global modeling of data acquired at different wavelengths (or signals) permits a spectral distinction of the different sedimenting protein components and allows for separate deconvolution of the sedimentation coefficient distributions ck(s) of species containing protein component k. Although this may lead also to slightly enhanced deconvolution of the hydrodynamic separation, it has properties very similar to those of the c(s) with regard to the influence of reaction kinetics on the obtained sedimentation coefficient distributions (48.Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Reactions that are fast on the time scale of sedimentation can be diagnosed by concentration-dependent peak positions in ck(s), which reflect the characteristic s values of the reacting system, but with different ck(s) still reflecting the correct stoichiometry (52.Balbo A. Minor K.H. Velikovsky C.A. Mariuzza R.A. Peterson C.B. Schuck P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Like c(s) (48.Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 50.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar, 53.Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), reactions that are slow on the time scale of sedimentation, such as those studied in the present communication, result in peak positions of ck(s) that correspond to different sedimenting species.RESULTSCharacterization of PAI-1 and Vitronectin—The design of this study is to use hydrodynamic methods to critically evaluate the formation of PAI-1-vitronectin complexes. The SV method, which provides first principle hydrodynamic information concerning the size, shape, and stoichiometries of macromolecules in heterogeneous populations of interacting species, was adopted to characterize all complexes that form upon PAI-1 binding to vitronectin.As a first step in the analysis, experiments were conducted to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of the individual proteins. Fig. 1 shows the sedimentation profiles for PAI-1 and vitronectin (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively) and the sedimentation coefficient distributions c(s) for both PAI-1 and vitronectin obtained from these analyses (Fig. 1C). For both samples, a major species is apparent, with peak s values centered at 3.4 and 4.2 S for PAI-1 and vitronectin, respectively (Table I). This observation was made essentially independent of protein concentration. The small peak at a higher s value of 6.2 S corresponds to a small amount of vitronectin dimer that appears to a variable extent in purified vitronectin samples (7.Declerck P.J. De Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of fit was high, with root mean square deviations in both cases on the order of instrument noise. The observed s values are consistent with the monomeric state of the proteins, as summarized in Table I, which lists theoretical s values for spherical proteins of this size for comparison. The best fit frictional ratios (f/f0) were 1.2 for PAI-1 and 1.5 for vitronectin (Table I). This indicates a small degree of shape asymmetry for PAI-1, which is compatible with the dimensions of the protein known from crystallography (54.Sharp A.M. Stein P.E. Pannu N.S. Carrell R.W. Berkenpas M.B. Ginsburg D. Lawrence D.A. Read R.J. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For vitronectin, the series of SV experiments gave consistently a frictional ratio of 1.5-1.7, indicating that the protein is significantly asymmetric. This is supported by recent data using small angle x-ray scattering on the native vitronectin monomer that indicate that the shape of the molecule deviates significantly from that of a sphere, yielding a bilobed shape with a maximal linear dimension of 110 Å and average hydrodynamic radius of ∼30 Å (55.Lynn G.S. Heller W.T. Mayasundari A. Minor K.H. Peterson C.B. Biochemistry. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar).Table ISedimentation coefficients for PAI-1, vitronectin, and PAI-1-vitronectin complexesView Large"

Thus, pituitary cells canretrieve and reuse components of the machinery involved in the final stages ofexocytosis (the SNAREs) as well as soluble and membrane granule proteins. In neurons, synaptic vesicle membrane components are rapidly retrieved atthe nerve terminal after secretion. The vesicles thus formed are replenishedwith locally synthesized neurotransmitter and are again able to undergostimulated release (1Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev.Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). Incontrast, neuroendocrine secretory granule membrane components must have adifferent fate following exocytosis. The peptides stored in secretory granulesare often generated from propeptides as they enter immature secretorygranules, which form in the trans-Golgi network region of the cell.If the membrane proteins of secretory granules are retrieved and reused, aconnection between granule biogenesis and granule membrane recycling mustoccur. Sporadic evidence of functional recycling (retrieval and reuse) ofsecretory granule membrane proteins has been collected over the last 2decades. In chromaffin cells, stimulation of secretion causes internalizationof glycoprotein III/clusterin and dopamine β-hydroxylase from the plasmamembrane and their subsequent re-entry into secretory granules(2Patzak A.

Both endogenous andheterologously overexpressed P-selectin, a protein involved in the first phaseof the inflammatory response, can be retrieved from the plasma membrane andre-inserted in newly formed granules(7Subramaniam M.

Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Studies on thebiosynthesis and trafficking of exogenous membrane PAM in a mouse corticotropetumor cell line, AtT-20, identified residues in the cytosolic domain of PAMthat were essential for granule entry, internalization from the plasmamembrane, and transit through the endosomal pathway(9Milgram S.L. Kho S.T. Martin G.V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 695-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies revealed arole for the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific residues in thecytosolic domain of PAM in determining whether PAM internalized from theplasma membrane entered lysosomes(10Steveson T.C. Keutmann H.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21128-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because overexpressionof membrane PAM in AtT-20 cells causes striking differences in the cellularlocalization of secretory granules, the cytoskeleton, and the basal and evokedrelease of mature hormone compared with cells in which only endogenous PAM ispresent (11Alam M.R. Steveson T.C. Johnson R.C. Back N. Abraham B. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Mol. Biol.Cell. 2001; 12: 629-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we wanted toexamine this process in primary pituitary cells, where secretory granules aremuch more prevalent. We used cultured rat anterior pituitary cells to establish a stimulatoryparadigm based on the synergistic actions of Ba2+, a substitute forCa2+, and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to mimic diacylglycerol,which caused massive secretion of hormone from multiple cell types. Massivesecretion in turn creates the necessity for sustained retrieval of secretorygranule membrane proteins, including PAM, from the plasma membrane. Theresponse to the stimulation paradigm of granule membrane proteins in primarypituitary cells was monitored using subcellular fractionation,immunocytochemistry, surface biotinylation and enzyme assays. The sustainedexocytosis yielded healthy cells with less than 20% of their normal content ofhormone, causing depletion or redistribution of secretory granule membraneproteins. Combining biosynthetic labeling with the stimulation paradigm, wefound that the rate of turnover of recently synthesized PAM in primarypituitary cells was decreased by sustained exocytotic activity. By usingbiotinylation to label PAM on the plasma membrane, we found that a fraction ofthe PAM tagged on the cell surface was subsequently endoproteolyticallyprocessed to yield soluble PHM that was secreted in a regulated fashion. Theability of secretory granule components to be reused, if not releasedfollowing exocytosis, is not limited to membrane proteins. Prolactin, asoluble granule protein, was also internalized following stimulation and wasdelivered to a cellular compartment from which it could be released again intothe medium. Together, these data suggest that secretory granule proteins, ifnot consumed during one round of exocytosis, can be functionally recycled forsubsequent use. Reagents—Antisera to growth hormone (JH89) and ACTH (Kathy)were described previously(12Dickerson I.M. Mains R.E. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), as was antiserum to exonA of PAM (JH629) (13Bell-Parikh L.C. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29854-29863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Polyclonal antiserum to prolactin (IC-5) was from the National Hormone andPeptide Program (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health), and monoclonalantibody to actin (JLA20) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank(University of Iowa). Monoclonal antibody to VAMP2 (clone 69.1) was obtainedcommercially from Synaptic Systems GmbH (Germany). Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin andsulfo-NHS-SS-biotin were from Pierce (catalog numbers 21335 and 21331,respectively); all the other chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwisestated. Anterior Pituitary Primary Cell Cultures—Anterior pituitaryprimary cultures were prepared as described previously(14May V. Eipper B.A. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with only minormodifications. Briefly, anterior pituitaries from adult male and femaleSprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) wereseparated from the neurointermediate lobes under a dissecting microscope,minced, and subjected to sequential collagenase and trypsin digestion at32–37 °C. Cells to be used for microscopy were subjected to oneadditional round of trypsin digestion in order to obtain a single cellsuspension. Chamber slides or plastic dishes were coated with protamine andNu-Serum I or IV (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). Dissociated cells wereplated at high density (1–4 pituitary/well) for biochemical analyses andat low density (1/25 pituitary/well) for microscopy. Cells were plated inDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone IIIfetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), 10% Nu-Serum, 10mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin(Invitrogen); 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was included for thefirst 24 h. The next day, cells were fed with Complete Serum-free Medium(CSFM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, 10 mm HEPES, 100units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, insulin/transferrin/seleniumfrom Invitrogen or Mediatech, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serumalbumin). Cells were fed daily with the same medium until used. Secretion Stimulation Paradigm—Primary cells that had beenmaintained in culture for 3–7 days were pre-rinsed 2–3 times(15–30 min each) with secretion medium (CSFM containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA)devoid of secretagogues. Cells were then fed with secretion medium alone(control) or secretion medium containing secretagogue (stimulation): 2mm BaCl2 and/or 1 μm phorbol myristateacetate (PMA, 1 mm stock in Me2SO). For each experiment,the modality and the length of the stimulation periods are indicated. Thespent media were centrifuged to remove non-adherent cells and stored at–80 °C after addition of protease inhibitors (0.3 mg/mlphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 2μg/ml leupeptin, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin). At theend of the last stimulation period, cells were extracted with 20 mmNaTES, 10 mm mannitol, 1% Triton X-100 (TMT; pH 7.4) at 4 °Ccontaining protease inhibitors. Fluorescence Microscopy—After secretagogue treatment, cellswere rinsed with warm HEPES saline buffer (HS: 120 mm NaCl, 4mm KCl, 5mm CaCl2, 15mm HEPES-KOH,pH 7.5) and fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde in the same pre-warmedbuffer. After extensive rinsing, cells were permeabilized with 0.075% TritonX-100 in blocking buffer (2 mg/ml BSA in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 minat room temperature and then further incubated in blocking buffer for 20 minat room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated with primary antibodiesdiluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Following extensive rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells werethen incubated in the appropriate Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h atroom temperature in the dark. Slides were mounted with glass coverslips usingPermafluor mounting medium (Immunotech, France). Image stacks(Δz = 0.2 μm) were created using Openlab 3.4 software(Improvision, UK) and a Nikon TE300 fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsudigital CCD camera C4742-95-12ERG connected to an Orca-ER camera controller.Images were acquired using an oil immersion 60× objective (NA 1.4) andwere deconvolved (iterative mode) using Volocity 3.0 software (Improvision,UK) and an appropriate point spread function. The pictures shown represent amid-stack region of the cells. Radioimmunoassays—ACTH radioimmunoassays were performed onmedia from cultured anterior pituitary(15Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antiserum Kathy isspecific for the COOH terminus of CLIP, ACTH, and larger precursors like ACTHbiosynthetic intermediate but does not detect intact proopiomelanocortin(16Schnabel E. Mains R.E. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1223-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). 125I-LabeledACTH was from Peninsula Laboratories or Amersham Biosciences, and syntheticrat ACTH-(1–39) was used as the standard (Bachem). Subcellular Fractionation—Control and stimulated cells werescraped from the culture dish into ice-cold homogenization buffer (150mm sucrose, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) containing proteaseinhibitors and then passed 5 times through a 26-gauge needle and 12 timesthrough a ball-bearing homogenizer (H&Y Enterprises, Redwood City, CA).The resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 1,100 ×gmax for 5 min, removing cell debris and nuclei (P1). Theresulting supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 17,400 ×gmax for 15 min to yield a P2 pellet (enriched insecretory granules) and supernatants. These supernatants were then centrifugedat 435,000 × gmax for 15 min to separate a lightmembrane P3 pellet from the soluble, cytosolic supernatant fraction (SN).Pellets were resuspended in equal volumes of homogenization buffer, and thesoluble fractions were adjusted to the same volume of resuspended pellets withhomogenization buffer. Western Blot—After fractionation by SDS-PAGE andelectroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher &Schuell), membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibodies. Theantigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the appropriate horseradishperoxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and Super Signal West Picochemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). When quantification was performed,nonsaturated signals were desensitized using Scion Image software (NationalInstitutes of Health) or acquired with a GeneGnome work station through theGeneSnap software (Syngene) and analyzed with the GeneTools software(Syngene). Biosynthetic Labeling—Cultured rat anterior pituitary cellswere incubated with Met(–) CSFM for 5 min, then pulsed with[35S]Met containing CSFM for 30 min, and rinsed with nonradioactiveCSFM for 2 min. The labeling was performed either before or after challengingthe cells with the Ba2+/PMA paradigm. In the former case, the cellswere chased for 2 h and extracted or further chased in medium devoid orcontaining secretagogues (in the presence or absence of 20 μmchloroquine to dissipate the transmembrane pH gradients) and then extracted inTMT buffer. In the latter case, the control and Ba2+/PMA-challengedcells were labeled and extracted with TMT buffer. Aliquots of the extractswere precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, solubilized, and either countedor loaded on gel, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed for fluorography.Other aliquots of the extracts were immunoprecipitated with the indicatedantibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE andexposed for fluorography. PAM Enzymatic Assays—Peptidylglycine α-hydroxylatingmonooxygenase assays were performed as described(15Ciccotosto G.D. Schiller M.R. Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) usingAc-125I-Tyr-Val-Gly as substrate. Surface Biotinylation—Cultured rat primary anteriorpituitary cells or AtT-20 cells stably expressing PAM-1 were fed with CSFM airsupplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100μg/ml streptomycin, insulin/transferrin/selenium (from Invitrogen orMediatech), and 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin for 30 min at37 °C in order for the cells to adjust to the air conditions. Before theaddition of the biotin derivative, cells were rinsed with pre-warmed (37°C) or pre-chilled (wet ice) HSG buffer (15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 4mmKCl, 25 mm glucose) three times (5 min per rinse) in order to washout amino acids and proteins present in the medium that could quench thebiotinylation reaction. The reactions were performed with 5 mmsulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in HSG, dissolving the biotin derivative just before beingused in order to minimize its hydrolysis. The reaction was stopped, and theresidual unreacted biotin was quenched by rinsing the cells with CSFM airsupplemented as described above with the exception that the BSA concentrationwas 2 mg/ml. For the biotinylation reactions performed at 0 °C, afterbeing fed with CSFM air, cells were transferred to a bath containing meltingice. All the steps were as for the biotinylations at 37 °C except that allthe media and buffers used were pre-chilled at 0 °C. In some experiments,surface biotinylation was performed with 5 mm sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin,a derivative whose biotin moiety can be removed by incubation of cells withbuffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl) containingreduced glutathione (50 mm; GSH), a membrane-impermeable reducingagent (as described in Ref. 17Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholarwith modifications). Cells were extracted in TMT supplemented with proteaseinhibitors. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by thebicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of lysates (by protein)were tumbled with avidin stripped of the carbohydrate moieties(NeutrAvidin™, Pierce) and immobilized on agarose beads for 1 h at roomtemperature. The beads were rinsed twice with TMT buffer and once with thesame buffer devoid of Triton X-100 (TM), both containing protease inhibitors.Finally, avidin-bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample bufferfor 5 min. Biotinylated proteins from the media were purified by the sameprocedure. Repetitive Stimulation Causes Massive Exocytosis and Depletion ofHormone Content in Pituitary Endocrine Cells—Our laboratory haslong been interested in the synthesis, storage, and secretion of proteinstargeted to the secretory pathway(18Eipper B.A. Mains R.E. Endocr. Rev. 1980; 1: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Exocytosis is coupled tocompensatory endocytosis (19Gundelfinger E.D. Kessels M.M. Qualman B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar);therefore, to study secretory granule membrane protein recycling, we developeda stimulation paradigm that causes massive secretion of hormone. Anteriorpituitary endocrine cells typically respond to multiple secretagogues, and weused BaCl2 and a phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate(PMA)) to mimic the physiological second messengers Ca2+ anddiacylglycerol, respectively(20TerBush D.R. Holz R.W. J.Neurochem. 1992; 58: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21von Ruden L. Garcia A.G. Lopez M.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).Phorbol ester and barium are known to have a synergistic effect on the evokedexocytosis of luteinizing hormone in chicken pituitary cells(23Davidson J.S. Wakefield I. King J.A. Millar R.P. J. Endocrinol. 1987; 114: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We observed a similarresponse in cultured rat primary pituitary cells(Fig. 1A). Basalsecretion of growth hormone was compared with that elicited by PMA alone,barium alone, or their combination (Fig.1A). Barium and PMA alone elicited a similar exocytoticresponse, with a 2–3-fold increase of GH secretion over basal levels.However, when the two secretagogues were administered together, the evokedsecretion of GH was 8–9 times higher than basal levels(Fig. 1A,bottom). Next, we tested a paradigm involving sequential stimulation with thesesecretagogues (Fig.1B). The PMA exposure time was selected to maximize thesecretory response and minimize protein kinase C down-regulation. Whencultured anterior pituitary cells were subjected to this paradigm, a largesecretory response was produced by somatotropes, lactotropes(Fig. 1C), andcorticotropes (not shown); we refer to cells exposed to this stimulationparadigm as Ba2+/PMA-challenged. At the end of the stimulationparadigm, the GH and PRL cells had undergone a massive reduction of hormonecontent (Fig. 1D);Ba2+/PMA-challenged cells contained less than 20% as much hormoneas control cells. These biochemical data were qualitatively confirmed byimmunocytochemistry. Ba2+/PMA-challenged and control cells werefixed and probed for ACTH, GH, and PRL(Fig. 1E).Corticotropes and somatotropes under control conditions showed strongimmunoreactivity, mainly in the plasma membrane region(Fig. 1E,arrows). In stimulated cells, staining in the cortical region wasless pronounced, and punctate staining likely corresponding to single granuleswas prevalent throughout the cytoplasm(Fig. 1E,asterisks). Control lactotropes showed a characteristic strongstaining in the Golgi/TGN region along with punctate staining locatedeccentrically to the nucleus (Fig.1E, arrows). In contrast, in the stimulatedlactotropes immunoreactivity was present only in the perinuclear region(Fig. 1E,asterisks), with the cytoplasmic punctate staining almost completelylost. The 5-fold drop in hormone content measured by biochemical analysis(Fig. 1D) was moredramatic than the decrease observed by immunocytochemistry. This discrepancysuggested that some endocrine cells might be so depleted that they becamedifficult to detect based on their remaining hormone content. Each type ofanterior pituitary endocrine cell contains VAMP2, an integral membrane granuleprotein that participates in exocytosis through formation of the SNARE complex(24Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu.Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). VAMP2 is not found athigh levels in non-endocrine cells(25Jacobsson G. Meister B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5344-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When endocrine cellswere identified using VAMP2 and co-stained with hormone-specific antibodies,it became clear that responses ranged from almost complete depletion of thehormone content (very few granules stained) to little discernible effect (notshown). The stimulated cells shown in Fig.1E retained enough hormone following theBa2+/PMA challenge to allow easy identification based onvisualization of hormone. The Ba2+/PMA Stimulation Paradigm Is Not Toxic and PrimarilyAffects Secretory Granule Proteins—The Ba2+/PMA paradigminvolves long stimulation times, raising the possibility that cells could bedamaged. By phase contrast microscopy, the Ba2+/PMA-challengedcells did not show any evident signs of stress (not shown). To obtain aphysiological parameter of cellular health, protein synthesis was analyzed. Atthe end of the Ba2+/PMA stimulation paradigm, control andBa2+/PMA-challenged cells were pulse-labeled using[35S]methionine, chased briefly in nonradioactive medium, andextracted. Aliquots of the extracts were subjected to trichloroacetic acidprecipitation to measure total protein synthesis or to GH immunoprecipitationto look specifically at synthesis of a secretory product. The totalradioactivity incorporated was not significantly different (not shown), andfluorography of equivalent samples from control andBa2+/PMA-challenged cells revealed indistinguishable patterns oftotal protein synthesis and similar rates of GH synthesis(Fig. 2A). Therefore,this stimulation paradigm, while causing massive depletion of hormone, doesnot compromise the viability of the cells. We next analyzed the effect of the Ba2+/PMA challenge on avariety of cellular markers. Stimulated and control cells were homogenized inisotonic buffer and subjected to differential centrifugation. A crude nuclearpellet (P1), a secretory granule-enriched fraction (P2), a fractioncorresponding to lighter membrane compartments (P3), and soluble cytosolicproteins (SN) were subjected to Western blot analysis. The subcellularfractions were probed for a general marker, actin, and for three secretorygranule proteins, GH, PAM, and VAMP2 (Fig.2B). In control cells, actin localizes to the particulatefractions containing nuclei and secretory granules and to cytosol, whereas themicrosomal fraction (P3) is largely devoid of actin. In the stimulated cells,the actin distribution was unchanged. Analyzed in this way, theBa2+/PMA paradigm affects neither the actin distribution nor itstotal amount. As expected, the GH signal was reduced in all fractions from thestimulated cells when compared with control cells. The greatest reduction wasseen in the P2 fraction, where most of the secretory granules sediment. The GHsignal detected in the cytosolic fraction presumably reflects rupture of somegranules during homogenization (Fig.2B). We next analyzed the response of two secretory granule membrane proteins tothe Ba2+/PMA challenge. PAM)is a bifunctional integral membraneenzyme (8Prigge S.T. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Amzel L.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1236-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). PAM-1, a majorsplice variant, undergoes an endoproteolytic cleavage that produces a solublePHM domain (sPHM) and a membrane-bound PAL domain (PALm). As expected, thestrongest signal for both sPHM and PALm was present in the secretorygranule-enriched P2 fraction of control cells(Fig. 2B). Thecorresponding fraction from the stimulated cells showed a marked reduction inthe signal for both full-length PAM-1 and its cleavage products, sPHM andPALm. The reduction was proportionally higher for sPHM, as expected for asoluble protein that undergoes exocytosis, compared with integral membraneproteins that can be recycled. As in the case of GH, the cytosolic fractioncontained a small amount of sPHM. VAMP2 is a resident granule membrane protein that is enriched in matureversus immature granules(24Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu.Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). After fusion of thesecretory granule membrane with the plasma membrane, VAMP2 is recycled. Incontrol cells, VAMP2 was largely associated with the P2 fraction, with smalleramounts recovered in the P3 fraction. In stimulated cells, the amount of VAMP2in the P2 fraction decreased, whereas the amount in the P3 fraction increased(Fig. 2B). This shiftis consistent with movement of VAMP2 into recycling compartments. The overalldecrease in the level of VAMP2 observed followingBa2+/PMA-challenge (an ∼17% decrease,Fig. 2B) indicatesthat this membrane protein is also subject to limited degradation. In order to confirm this observation, primary anterior pituitary cells wereeither challenged with the stimulation paradigm or not, fixed, andimmunostained for VAMP2 (Fig.2C). Control cells showed a localization of VAMP2resembling that of hormones such as GH and ACTH(Fig. 1E), withcharacteristic sub-plasmalemmal staining(Fig. 2C, top,arrows); perinuclear staining and some punctate cytoplasmic staining wasalso visible. When visualized for VAMP2, the Ba2+/PMA-challengedcells looked remarkably different, with the immunoreactivity mainly localizedto internal sites (Fig.2C, bottom, asterisks). As would be predictedfrom the changes in hormone staining, the cell periphery was essentiallydevoid of VAMP2 staining, except for a low intensity punctate staining(Fig. 2C, bottom,arrowheads). Tak"

https://openalex.org/W1975832358,"T he science of volcanology began with Pliny the Younger's observations of the devastating 79 A.D. Vesuvius eruption. The May 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption and its aftermath was the first major eruption observed and monitored systematically with a variety of modern instruments, and it revealed much about eruptive processes, leading in turn to the development of new monitoring instruments. These lessons were applied a decade later in responding to the much larger eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The science of hurricanes has improved from early observations in the same way. Our current ability to make useful estimates of hurricane course and strength derives from satellite and in situ observations. Data gathered from many prior storms, combined with computer modeling developed continually from a huge amount of weather data, have strengthened our prediction capacity. These are but two examples of how past observations, followed by detailed data obtained with modern instruments, have led to improved understanding of natural disasters and how to respond to them.

The Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of 26 December 2004, with its consequent tsunami, was the first great earthquake to be observed with modern instruments. These include a global seismic network equipped with seismographs capable of recording over a broad frequency range (which was partly set up for observing and understanding such earthquakes), satellites that can record changes in ocean height, and a worldwide Global Positioning System (GPS) network capable of recording subtle movements of Earth's crust. Great earthquakes have moment magnitudes of about 9 or greater, release an enormous amount of energy, and are usually caused by the rupture of a convergent plate boundary (where one plate is subducting beneath another). As was the case here, they can produce devastating tsunamis.

Four papers and a Viewpoint in this issue, and one Report published online on Science Express, describe the seismic, satellite, and GPS observations of this earthquake and some of its effects. As shown in these papers, such large earthquakes have important differences from smaller earthquakes. One is their huge rupture length, which is many times the width across the rupture. The Sumatra-Andaman earthquake ruptured about 1300 km of the plate boundary. The rupture itself took about 1 hour, moving mostly from south to north, and the GPS data indicate some additional deformation after that. It rang the earth much like a bell (it is still ringing), and it produced measurable deformations in Earth's crust—as recorded in GPS data—over nearly an entire hemisphere. This protracted and uneven release of energy complicates the determination of magnitude. These data, as well as observations of the geometry of the generated tsunami, can be inverted to show that the rupture progressed rapidly at first, producing displacements of up to 20 m, then more slowly farther north. Seismic waves from the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, like some others, also triggered other earthquakes in distant volcanic areas; this time, however, possibly revealing the mechanism of that triggering. The earthquake also produced numerous aftershocks and was followed by another large temblor. These and other data provide a new basis for understanding these largest, rarest, and most destructive seismic events.
