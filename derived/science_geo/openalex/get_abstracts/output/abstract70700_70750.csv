https://openalex.org/W2093782379,"DURING a search for systemic fungicides it was found that 5-n-butyl-2-dimethylamino-4-hydroxy-6-niethylpyrimidine (I) gives exceptionally good control of powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea (Schlecht)) on cucurbits, particularly when applied to the soil as a liquid or in granules. The compound has very low mammalian toxicity, with LD50 values (female rats) of 200–400 mg/kg (interperitoneal) and >4,000 mg/kg (oral)."

https://openalex.org/W2042171413,"SINCE the discovery of lysosomal enzymes within polymorphonuclear leucocytes there has been an ever growing tendency to attribute to these granules an important role in acute inflammation1–3. This concept has received further support from experiments in which agents known to stabilize membranes have been shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect4–6. In addition, it has been found that a reduced number of polymorphonuclear cells leads to reduced acute inflammatory reactions7 and Arthus type reactions8. The studies by Ward and Cochrane9–12 on immunological inflammation stressing the importance of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte have often been extrapolated to non-allergic acute inflammatory states. There are, however, opposing views as to the relative importance of the polymorphonuclears in bringing about vascular changes in acute inflammation13."

https://openalex.org/W2069544627,"IT has recently been shown in our laboratory that certain enzymes are easily inactivated by interaction with acyl phosphates1. For example, carbamyl phosphate at physiological concentrations rapidly inactivates glutamic dehydrogenase. The possible relation of these findings to protein modification by other acyl reagents has been pointed out, as has the possible relation to protein turnover, that is, modified proteins will be more easily degraded by cathepsins or lysosomal enzymes2. These findings, together with the reported acetylation of serum albumin by aspirin3, prompted us to test the effect of aspirin and of salicylate on a number of enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2071262051,"FRUITING in the gasteromycete fungus Sphaerobolus stellatus is dependent on light. When cultures on oatmeal agar, first incubated in darkness at 20° C for two weeks, are illuminated with “daylight” fluorescent light (100–1,000 lux), abundant sporophores are formed 12–14 days later. During the first week of this period, it is only the blue end of the spectrum (400–480 mµ) which is effective, but during the next few days, light of longer wavelength 550–700 mµ) becomes much more effective than the shorter rays. This switch in the quality of the light involvement (which has already been reported1) seems to represent a unique situation in fungi. It should be noted that the final 24 h of sporophore development, including stellate opening of the sporophore and culminating in glebal-mass discharge, have no requirement for light."

https://openalex.org/W1994451352,"IN his review of the recently published book Tobacco and Tobacco Smoke by Wynder and Hoffmann, Professor Passey1 draws attention to the discrepancy between results of painting cigarette smoke condensate on the skin of mice in the United States and Great Britain. Results of Wynder et al.2, who obtained in America 44.4 per cent of skin carcinomata from a group of eighty-one mice, are compared with 3–5 per cent obtained by workers in Great Britain. Day's work is quoted in support of these low percentages3, and a figure of 3 per cent of 7,875 mice seems to confirm the apparent very low Carcinogenicity. This total, however, includes 1,320 untreated controls and 660 mice treated with the solvent control."
https://openalex.org/W1998308961,"THE communication by Thurston, Noirot-Timothée and Arman1 is of interest to the enzymologist. The authors relate the occurrence of ciliate protozoa in the stomach of Hippopotamus amphibius, a non-ruminant ungulate, to the fact that in this species, as in the ruminants, fermentation takes place in the stomach."
