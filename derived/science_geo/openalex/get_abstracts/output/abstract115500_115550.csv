https://openalex.org/W1580161657,"Coatomer, a complex of seven proteins, appears to be the precursor of the coat structure of non-clathrin-coated Golgi-derived vesicles. Another component of this vesicle coat is the cytosolic protein ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF). Like coatomer, ARF appears to reversibly associate with Golgi membranes. We now report that ARF is required for coatomer binding to Golgi membranes and that myristoylated, but not non-myristoylated, ARF is the required species. We utilize an antibody directed against the beta-subunit of coatomer (beta-COP) to follow coatomer binding. ARF and beta-COP bind stoichiometrically to Golgi membranes. ARF-dependent beta-COP binding requires a membrane-associated protein, is saturable, and is enhanced in the presence of stable GTP analogues like guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S). ARF and beta-COP bind sequentially to Golgi membranes, since beta-COP can be bound to reisolated membranes that had been previously incubated with ARF and GTP gamma S. We conclude that membrane-bound ARF confers to Golgi membranes all of the requirements for specific beta-COP binding."
https://openalex.org/W1516406792,"The lignin peroxidases (LiPs) of white-rot basidiomycetes are generally thought to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of polymeric lignin in vivo. However, direct evidence for such a role has been lacking. In this investigation, 14C- and 13C-labeled synthetic lignins were oxidized with a purified isozyme of Phanerochaete chrysosporium LiP. Gel permeation chromatography of the radiolabeled polymers showed that LiP catalyzed their cleavage to give soluble lower-M(r) products. To a lesser extent, the enzyme also polymerized the lignins to give soluble higher-M(r) products. This result is attributable to the fact that purified LiP, unlike the intact fungus, provides no mechanism for the removal of lignin fragments that are susceptible to repolymerization. LiP catalysis also gave small quantities of insoluble, perhaps polymerized, lignin, but in lower yield than intact P. chrysosporium does. 13C NMR experiments with 13C-labeled polymer showed that LiP cleaved it between C alpha and C beta of the propyl side chain to give benzylic aldehydes at C alpha, in agreement with the cleavage mechanism hypothesized earlier. The data show that LiP catalysis accounts adequately for the initial steps of ligninolysis by P. chrysosporium in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1584824123,"Many effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gene expression, including that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), in monocytic cells are mediated by activation of kappa B DNA-binding proteins. However, the specific members of the NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factor family involved in the LPS response, and the mechanisms through which LPS-generated signals are transduced remain unclear. Here we show that LPS induces nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 heterodimers as well as p50/p65 (NF-kappa B) kappa B DNA-binding complexes in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Nuclear localization of these proteins occurred concomitantly with a rapid decrease in their cytosolic levels and was independent of phorbol ester-sensitive protein kinase C. Within 24 h following LPS stimulation there was a striking increase in the levels of c-Rel, p105, and p50 in the cytosol. The increased levels of these proteins correlated with increases in the amounts of their mRNAs during LPS activation of THP-1 cells. LPS activation of THP-1 cells resulted in phosphorylation of MAD3 (an I kappa B-like protein), a rapid increase in MAD3 mRNA, and an increase in MAD3 protein by 2 h. Thus, LPS activation of human monocytic cells results in nuclear expression of c-Rel/p50 and p50/p65 (NF-kappa B) and induces phosphorylation of MAD3."

https://openalex.org/W1545108295,"Cadmium accumulates in the vacuole of plant cells, but the mechanism driving its transport across the vacuole membrane is not understood. Here we present evidence for Cd2+ transport via a Cd2+/H+ antiport activity into tonoplast-enriched vesicles isolated from oat roots. Experimentally, accumulation of Cd2+ into vesicles could be driven by delta pH generated by either V-type ATPase or artificially using nigericin to exchange K+ and H+ in K(+)-loaded vesicles. When tonoplast-enriched vesicles were separated on a linear sucrose gradient, NO3(-)-sensitive ATPase, total MgATPase, and delta pH-dependent Cd2+ transport equilibrated at 1.11 g/ml, the density of tonoplast membrane. Cd2+ accumulation in vesicles was accompanied by efflux of protons in a Cd2+ concentration-dependent manner characteristic of an antiport activity. The delta pH-dependent Cd2+ accumulation process showed saturation kinetics with a Km(app) of 5.5 microM. Thus the process is a candidate for transport of Cd2+ from the cytoplasm to the vacuolar sap under conditions of low as well as high Cd2+ exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1490087754,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase isoform 2 (PGS-2) mRNA and protein are transiently induced by gonadotropins in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles prior to ovulation. To better understand the hormonal regulation of the rat PGS-2 (rPGS-2) gene in these cells, genomic clones containing rPGS-2 as well as up to 6 kilobases of 5'-flanking DNA were isolated by screening a rat liver genomic library with a labeled 5'-fragment of the mouse PGS-2 cDNA. Primer extension analysis using ovarian follicular mRNA identified the presence of a single rPGS-2 transcription initiation site located 144 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon. To test for promoter activity within the 5'-flanking region of the rPGS-2 gene, a genomic fragment, -2698/32 (1 = cap site), as well as a series of 5'-deletion mutants, were fused upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transfected into primary cultures of granulosa cells. Forskolin (7.5 microM), follicle-stimulating hormone (500 ng/ml) and luteinizing hormone (500 ng/ml) induced CAT activity following transfection with the -2698/32PGS.CAT, whereas gonadotropin-releasing hormone (10(-6) M) and interleukin-1 beta (30 ng/ml) had no effect. Deletion mutants delineated the region spanning from -192 to -54 of the transcription start site to be essential for both basal and forskolin-regulated expression of the reporter gene. The same DNA fragment (-192/-54) exhibited specific binding to granulosa cell nuclear extract proteins as analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Additional specific bands were observed in extracts prepared from granulosa cells exposed to an ovulatory dose of gonadotropin. Collectively, these results provide the first structural and functional evidence that the transcriptional regulation of the rat PGS-2 gene by gonadotropins and forskolin in granulosa cells involves 5'-flanking DNA sequences, specifically a region between -192 and -54 of the transcription initiation site."
https://openalex.org/W1576409652,"In the classical secretory pathway proteins containing a signal peptide are translocated from the cytoplasm of the cell into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). From the ER they are transported to the Golgi apparatus and finally to the plasma membrane (PM) where they are released into the extracellular compartment. However, some proteins are synthesized without a signal peptide and maintain a predominantly cytosolic distribution until they are released from the cell. As a marker for this nonclassical secretory pathway we have chosen L-29, a soluble lectin of M(r) about 29,000, that has affinity for lactose and other beta-galactoside containing glycoconjugates. We were interested in determining if cultured epithelial cells secrete L-29 and if they do so in a polarized fashion. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II cells were found to express large quantities of L-29 (about 1% of the detergent soluble protein). The lectin was diffusely distributed in the cytosol, with little or none in vesicular compartments. The polarity of L-29 secretion, when analyzed in pulse-chase experiments, was selectively into the apical compartment of filter-grown MDCK cells. This secretion was not inhibited by brefeldin A or monensin, drugs that are known to inhibit protein transport through the ER-Golgi-PM pathway. Secretion of L-29 was augmented 3-5-fold by the calcium ionophore A23187 and by increasing the temperature to 42 degrees C, whereas lowering the temperature to 20 degrees C or addition of nocodazole prevented secretion. These results demonstrate the polarized secretion of a cytosolic protein by a nonclassical secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1585911315,"Using electron microscopy and indirect end-labeling methods, we have examined excision tracts produced by the Escherichia coli methyl-directed mismatch repair system on a closed circular G-T heteroduplex that contains a single d(GATC) site. Despite differing polarities of the unmodified strand in the two hemimethylated derivatives of the heteroduplex, that portion of the unmethylated strand spanning the shorter path between the d(GATC) site and mismatch is targeted for excision in both cases. Mismatch-provoked excision occurring on both hemimethylated DNAs requires DNA helicase II, but exonuclease requirements for the reaction depend on heteroduplex orientation. When the d(GATC) sequence on the unmodified strand resides 3' to the mismatch as viewed along the shorter path, excision requires exonuclease I. Excision occurring on the alternate hemimethylated heteroduplex depends on the 5'--> 3' hydrolytic activity of exonuclease VII. Coupled with the previous demonstration that repair initiates via the mismatch-provoked, MutHLS-dependent incision of the unmethylated strand at a d(GATC) sequence (Au, K.G., Welsh, K., and Modrich, P. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12142-12148), these findings indicate an excision mechanism in which helicase II displacement renders the incised strand sensitive to the appropriate single-strand exonuclease. Our data imply that hydrolysis commences at the d(GATC) site, proceeds to a point beyond the mismatch, and terminates at a number of discrete sites within a 100-nucleotide region just beyond this site. The extent of excision is therefore controlled by one or more components of the repair system."
https://openalex.org/W1745661527,"We have determined whether macrophage derived-foam cells, a prominent component of the atherosclerotic lesion, express more urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and whether their ability to generate plasmin stimulates the release of matrix-bound growth factors. Steady state levels of uPA mRNA and both membrane and intracellular uPA activities were significantly increased in foam cells. When cultured on cell-derived matrices containing bound 125I-basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), both macrophage and foam cells released intact 125I-bFGF into their media. The release of 125I-bFGF by either cell was significantly enhanced in the presence of plasminogen. However, foam cells, which expressed more membrane uPA, released more 125I-bFGF than control cells. The release of matrix-bound bFGF was independent of heparanase activity, since neither macrophage nor foam cells degraded 35SO4-labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In addition, media derived from foam cells cultured on cell-derived matrices in the presence of plasminogen had increased levels of transforming growth factor (TGF) beta activity as compared to cells grown in the absence of plasminogen. In contrast, plasminogen had no effect on TGF-beta activity recovered in the media of foam cells grown on plastic. Moreover, when macrophage were cultured on matrices containing bound 125I-TGF-beta, the release of labeled TGF-beta was increased in the presence of plasminogen. This is the first demonstration that foam cells can release two important growth regulators, bFGF and TGF-beta, from the extracellular matrix, and provides a mechanism by which macrophage and foam cells can stimulate atherosclerotic lesion development."
https://openalex.org/W1532514832,"An experimental system has been developed to quantify frameshift deletions and base substitutions formed during DNA synthesis in vitro. Oligodeoxynucleotides, modified site-specifically with acetylaminofluorene or other adducts and lesions, were used as templates in primer extension reactions catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The influence of DNA sequence context on frameshift mutagenesis was determined by modifying systematically the bases flanking the lesion. Frequencies of nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion and chain extension from the 3'-primer terminus were established by steady state kinetic analysis. The ability of a damaged nucleotide to generate one-base and two-base frameshift deletions was determined primarily by two parameters: the nature of the base inserted opposite the adduct with respect to the sequence context in which the lesion is embedded and the overall rate of translesional DNA synthesis. Frameshift deletions generated during DNA synthesis were greatly enhanced in the absence of proofreading exonuclease. Misinsertion of bases opposite the lesion precedes misalignment of the template-primer. Extending on earlier studies (Kunkel, T. A. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 8003-8011), a model has been proposed and used in various sequence contexts to predict the propensity of aminofluorene adducts, exocyclic DNA adducts, 8-oxopurines, and synthetic abasic sites to generate frameshift deletions in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1598340191,"Factor XII (FXII, plasma concentration 375 nM) is a critical member of the plasma contact activation system and is the zymogen form of FXIIa, a serine protease involved in intrinsic coagulation, complement activation, activation of factor VII, and generation of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin. As such its interaction with cells involved in inflammatory pathways can be of physiologic and pathologic significance. We have studied the binding of FXII to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC were incubated with 125I-FXII, and cell-bound factor FXII was measured. FXII bound to HUVEC saturably in a zinc-dependent manner. The optimal zinc concentration was 50-60 microM. Binding of labeled FXII was drastically reduced when a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled FXII was included in the incubation mixture at time zero or when added at 60 min during a 150-min time course experiment. Quantitative binding experiments indicated a dissociation constant of 144 nM with 10-12 million binding sites/endothelial cell. Unlabeled high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibited the binding of labeled FXII with a Ki of 98 nM, whereas unlabeled FXII inhibited the binding of labeled HK to HUVEC with a Ki of 152 nM. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of cell-bound 125I-FXII showed that factor XII underwent limited proteolysis and the molecular weights of the fragments were similar in size to activated FXII. The cell-bound activated factor XII was also able to activate prekallikrein. These data suggest that (i) FXII binds to HUVEC specifically, saturably, and reversibly in a zinc-dependent manner, (ii) HK and FXII may compete with each other for the same cell-surface receptor/s, and (iii) cell-bound FXII is capable of undergoing activation to FXIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1600012306,"An antifungal protein (AFP) was purified from the hemolymph of third instar larvae of Sarcophaga peregrina. This protein repressed the growth of Candida albicans in Sabouraud medium in the presence of nitrofurazone. However, in distilled water or saline, AFP alone killed C. albicans. Significant synergism was detected between AFP and sarcotoxin IA, an antibacterial protein of Sarcophaga. The lethal effect of AFP on C. albicans was greatly enhanced by the presence of a small amount of sarcotoxin IA. AFP was shown to bind to C. albicans and cause leakage of a substance(s) with absorbance at 260 nm from the cells. Analysis of its cDNA showed that AFP is a novel histidine-rich protein consisting of 67 amino acid residues."
https://openalex.org/W1485802089,"The 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET), a renal vasodilator metabolite of arachidonic acid via cytochrome P450 (P450) requires cyclooxygenase for expression of its vasoactivity as the responses are inhibited by indomethacin and other aspirin-like drugs. We now report on the metabolism of 5,6-EET by rabbit kidneys in order to characterize those metabolites that may account for its vasoactivity. The 5,6-EET was injected close-arterially into the rabbit isolated Krebs-Henseleit perfused kidney, preconstricted with phenylephrine, and the effluent collected throughout the response period. Basal collections, following injection of 100 microliters of vehicle, were made at 20-min intervals before each 5,6-EET injection. Prior to acidic extraction, deuterated 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha and PGE2 were added as internal standards. The extracts were separated by TLC and prostaglandins were derivatized for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using a negative ion chemical ionization mode. Injection of 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 micrograms of 5,6-EET (n = 4) resulted in dose-related decreases in perfusion pressure of 6 +/- 2, 12 +/- 4, 21 +/- 4, 26 +/- 4, and 27 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively. Basal perfusates contained 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2, levels of which were increased by 2-fold or more by 5,6-EET. Perfusates, collected during 5,6-EET administration, also contained 5-hydroxy-PGI1 and 5,6-epoxy-PGE1, cyclooxygenase metabolites of 5,6-EET. This is the first report of the recovery and identification of these 5,6-EET metabolites from an intact organ. Since the responses to 5,6-EET are endothelial-dependent, we also studied the profile of eicosanoids formed following incubation of 5,6-EET with cultured bovine pulmonary endothelial cells. Endothelial cells metabolized 5,6-EET to products with a similar radioactive profile on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography compared to kidney perfusates. We compared the vasodilator activity of 5,6-epoxy-PGE1 and 5-hydroxy-PGI1, chemically synthesized by us from PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, respectively, with PGE2 and PGI2 in the rabbit kidney. The 5,6-epoxy-PGE1 was equipotent to PGE2 as a vasodilator. The ED50 values for 5,6-EET, 5,6-epoxy-PGE1, and PGE2 were 4.69, 0.43, and 0.42 nmol, respectively. Although PGI2 was a potent vasodilator (ED50, 0.24 nmol), 5-hydroxy-PGI1 was devoid of activity. Thus, the cyclooxygenase-dependent vasoactivity of 5,6-EET in the rabbit kidney has two components: release of vasodilator prostaglandins, PGE2 and PGI2, and metabolism of 5,6-EET to a prostaglandin analog, 5,6-epoxy-PGE1."
https://openalex.org/W1528682921,"The expression of nuclear and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes was examined in the skeletal muscle of patients with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), myoclonic epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and compared with controls. In KSS muscle, mtDNA transcripts outside the deletion were elevated, while those within the deletion were reduced according to the percentage of deleted mtDNA molecules. In MERRF and MELAS muscle, mitochondrial transcripts levels were increased, but the increase was greater in MERRF muscle. The processing of mtDNA transcripts was reduced in all pathogenic muscles. This was true for full-length heavy and light strand transcripts as well as for the 16 S rRNA + tRNA(Leu)+ND1 transcript. However, the tRNA(Lys) level was reduced in all three muscles. In MELAS muscle, our results are not consistent with an impairment of transcription termination at the end of the 16 S mitochondrial rRNA. Finally, the transcription of the nuclear ATPsyn.beta and ANT1 genes was induced in parallel with the high level of mtDNA transcripts in MERRF and MELAS muscle, but was repressed in KSS muscle. The results demonstrate that the expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic OXPHOS genes is coordinated and that OXPHOS gene expression increases to compensate for respiratory deficiency. The repression of nuclear genes in KSS muscle could be a consequence of the segmental distribution of deleted mtDNA molecules in muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551043626,"The polIII core subassembly of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is composed of the alpha (DNA polymerase), epsilon (editing exonuclease), and theta subunits. We have identified holE encoding theta (8.6 kDa) at 40.4 min, expressed and purified 300 mg of theta, and have studied its function by constituting the polIII core from pure alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits. The theta subunit binds the epsilon proofreader tightly, but it does not form a detectable complex with alpha. The epsilon subunit also binds to alpha (Maki, H., and Kornberg, A. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 84, 4389-4392). Hence, the subunit arrangement of the polIII core is linear, alpha epsilon theta. Interaction of theta with epsilon slightly stimulated epsilon in excision of a 3' terminal mismatched nucleotide, suggesting a possible role for theta in fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W1493031501,"We compared the mechanisms by which caldesmon inhibits actin and actin-tropomyosin activation of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) MgATPase activity. Caldesmon always inhibited actin activation by displacing S1.ADP.Pi from actin and inhibition required at least 0.7 caldesmon molecules bond per actin for 90% inhibition. Caldesmon inhibited actin-tropomyosin without any displacement of S1.ADP.Pi; thus it inhibits a rate-limiting step. Inhibition is highly cooperative, requiring no more than one caldesmon bound per 10 actins for 90% inhibition of activation by actin and smooth muscle tropomyosin. The degree of cooperativity is defined by the tropomyosin since inhibition by skeletal tropomyosin requires up to one caldesmon bound per 4 actins for 90% inhibition under identical conditions. Both noncooperative inhibition of actin and cooperative, tropomyosin-dependent, inhibition are manifested by a fragment of caldesmon containing only the C-terminal 99 amino acids (658C), although this fragment does not itself bind to tropomyosin. The functional properties of 658C are very similar to striated muscle troponin I, consequently we propose a similar mechanism for tropomyosin-dependent regulation by caldesmon. Caldesmon binding switches actin-tropomyosin to the off or weak state and Ca2+/calmodulin binding to caldesmon blocks this switch and thus reactivates the actin filament."

https://openalex.org/W1585503692,"Abstract The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of a protein to the identity of its N-terminal residue. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, substrates of the N-end rule pathway are targeted for degradation by a complex that includes the 225-kDa N-recognin, encoded by UBR1, and the 20-kDa ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme encoded by UBC2. We report that both physical stability and functional activity of the N-recognin.Ubc2 complex require the presence of a highly acidic 23-residue region at the C terminus of Ubc2. Ubc2-C88A, an inactive variant of Ubc2 in which the active-site Cys-88 has been replaced by Ala, is shown to retain the affinity for N-recognin. Expression of Ubc2-C88A inhibits the N-end rule pathway, apparently as a result of competition between Ubc2 and Ubc2-C88A for binding to N-recognin. The two-hybrid (interaction cloning) technique was used to identify a approximately 170-residue C-terminal fragment of the 1,950-residue N-recognin as a Ubc2-interacting domain. We also show that the level of UBR1 mRNA decreases upon overexpression of UBC2. This effect of UBC2 is observed with cells whose UBR1 is expressed from an unrelated promoter but is not observed if UBR1 contains a frameshift mutation, or if the Ubc2 protein lacks its C-terminal acidic region. The N-recognin.Ubc2 complex appears to regulate the expression of N-recognin through changes in the metabolic stability of its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1526653134,"Phosphorylation of mannose residues on N-linked oligosaccharide side chains of lysosomal enzymes targets them to lysosomes. We used site-directed mutagenesis to observe the effect of eliminating selective glycosylation sites from human beta-glucuronidase on enzyme sorting. Expression studies allowed us to determine which of four potential sites were glycosylated, preferentially phosphorylated, and required for catalytic activity. All four sites of the human enzyme were glycosylated, whereas in the mouse and rat enzymes, only three of four sites are used. Sites 2 and 3 were preferentially phosphorylated. Elimination of sites 2 and 3 in combination markedly decreased sorting to lysosomes and increased enzyme secretion. Each of the four glycosylation sites could be eliminated individually without drastic reduction in catalytic activity. Activity was progressively lost as combinations of two, three, and four sites were eliminated. Wild-type enzyme produced in the presence of tunicamycin was also inactive, indicating that glycosylation is required for realization of enzyme activity. However, active enzyme could be deglycosylated with only minimal loss of activity. Mutant enzyme completely lacking glycosylation did not form tetramers. Partial restoration of tetramerization was achieved by the co-expression of normal rat enzyme, provided that the normal rat enzyme supplied at least two subunits to the tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1549253690,"The intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabpi) provides a good model system for studying how gene transcription is regulated in enterocytes as a function of their differentiation program and location along the duodenal-to-colonic axis. We have compared and contrasted the transcriptional activity of four fusion genes composed of elements from the 5'-nontranscribed domain of rat Fabpi linked to the human growth hormone gene (I-FABP/hGH) in transgenic mice and in five primate epithelial cell lines derived from intestine, liver, kidney, and cervix. Nucleotides -103 to +28 of rat Fabpi are able to direct appropriate lineage-specific and geographic patterns of hGH expression in transgenic mice. I-FABP-103 to +28/hGH is preferentially expressed in Caco-2 cells, which emulate some of the features of differentiated small intestinal enterocytes after they reach confluence. However, other I-FABP/hGH fusion genes that exhibit differentiation-dependent changes in their expression along the crypt-to-villus axis do not manifest the same pattern of differentiation-dependent change in activity in this cell line. Correlation of their patterns of expression in vivo and ex vivo suggest that nonproliferating Caco-2 cells mimic some of the features of the transcriptional regulatory environment of enterocytes located in the upper crypt. Nucleotides -103 to +28 of rat Fabpi contain one copy of a repeated 14-base pair element that is conserved in the orthologous mouse and human genes and represented in several other homologous and nonhomologous genes, which are expressed in villus-associated enterocytes. This element binds to two members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors produced in enterocytes and Caco-2 cells: hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) and apolipoprotein regulatory protein-1 (ARP-1). Co-transfection studies performed in Caco-2 cells and in a monkey kidney cell line (CV-1) that lacks endogenous pools of ARP-1 and HNF-4 suggest that ARP-1 and HNF-4 can function to activate I-FABP-103 to +28/hGH+3 through their interactions with the 14-base pair element. This activation appears to be affected by elements located between nucleotides -277 and -104 and other transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1512491101,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are generally absent from the surface of cells that are defective in GPI biosynthesis. The current study was undertaken to: (a) examine in detail the intracellular localization and fate of precursors of GPI-anchored proteins in cells that fail to add GPI groups and (b) define structural characteristics of the precursor proteins that determine their intracellular localization. By examining GPI-deficient cells, we show that the uncleaved precursor of the GPI-anchored protein, Q7b, is retained in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is largely lost intracellularly with a half-time of 2-4 h. Only a small amount (1-10%) of a proteolytically cleaved form of the protein is secreted into the medium. In cells competent for GPI anchor addition, mutation of the putative cleavage/attachment site for GPI addition in Q7b results in a similar phenotype of ER retention of the uncleaved precursor. An aspartic acid residue (Asp316) within the Q7b GPI anchoring signal, previously found to be essential for GPI anchor addition (Waneck, G. L., Stein, M. E., and Flavell, R. A. (1988) Science 241, 697-699), is also shown to be critical for ER retention. Information leading to ER retention is transferable to another protein leading to ER retention is transferable to another protein by fusion of the GPI anchoring signals from either Q7b or the GPI-anchored form of the IgG Fc receptor type III. Analysis by sedimentation on sucrose gradients shows that Q7b species retained in the ER are multimeric, whereas species that exit the ER are monomeric. This correlation suggests that the presence of an uncleaved signal for GPI anchoring induces changes in the aggregation state of the precursor proteins, which may lead to their retention in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1520078901,"In adipocytes and muscle, insulin stimulates the translocation of glucose transporter proteins from an intracellular vesicle pool to the plasma membrane. To study the molecular basis of this process, we used the anti-GLUT4 antibody 1F8 to isolate intracellular vesicles from rat adipocytes that are enriched in the muscle/fat glucose transporter isoform. These vesicles were then used as immunogens to generate monoclonal antibodies against their protein components. We isolated an antibody, 3F8, that recognizes three polypeptides, designated GTV3, migrating in the 36-40-kDa range as analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. These proteins are enriched in GLUT4-containing vesicles, and the two smallest of the polypeptides recognized by 3F8 translocate to the cell surface in response to insulin. GTV3 proteins are also present in plasma membranes of fat cells and liver as well as in a wide number of tissues, red blood cells being the only exception. In adipocytes from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, GTV3 protein levels decrease dramatically and return to normal levels when animals are treated with insulin. The localization of GTV3 in glucose transporter-containing vesicles as well as their wide tissue distribution suggests that these proteins may be involved in vesicle mediated transport and regulated trafficking between membrane compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1603869179,"The gamma complex subassembly (gamma delta delta' chi psi) of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme couples ATP to assemble the ring-shaped beta subunit around DNA forming a DNA sliding clamp. This beta clamp is needed for highly processive synthesis by the holoenzyme. Here, the delta and delta' subunits of the gamma complex are studied for their structural and functional interaction with each other and with the gamma subunit. Both delta and delta are monomeric in their native state, and they bind each other tightly to form a 1:1 complex. Neither delta nor delta' alone binds tightly to the gamma subunit. However, as a complex, delta delta' binds gamma tightly to form a gamma delta delta' complex. The fact that all three subunits, gamma, delta, and delta', are needed to form a tight complex correlates well with activity assays which show that gamma and delta are capable but inefficient in assembly of the beta ring onto DNA and delta' is needed for an efficient reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1553583401,"We have used a series of Escherichia coli-expressed deletion mutants of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-binding domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to study the structural basis of its function. In addition to the prototypic molecule (rvWF441-733), we constructed 11 mutants; seven had deletions of sequence on the amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal side of the Cys509-Cys695 intrachain disulfide loop, and four had limited deletions inside the loop. Other cysteine residues in addition to 509 and 695, when present in the corresponding native sequence, were mutated to glycine; all molecules were purified in the oxidized as well as reduced and alkylated state. The smallest species retaining the ability to interact with GP Ib in the absence of modulators was the oxidized rvWF508-696; the latter, as well as rvWF441-696, became inactive after reduction and alkylation. In contrast, all the other fragments with deletions outside of the loop, but extending at least to residue 700, showed better binding to platelets after reduction and alkylation than when the Cys509-Cys695 disulfide bond was oxidized. Any limited deletion of sequence inside the loop caused complete loss of GP Ib-binding function both in the absence or in the presence of botrocetin, and this persisted even after reduction and alkylation. In contrast, all mutants with intact sequence between residues 509 and 695 bound to GP Ib in the presence of botrocetin, regardless of whether the 2 cysteine residues were oxidized or reduced and alkylated. Ristocetin, unlike botrocetin, appeared to have no effect in modulating the binding of any of the expressed fragments to platelets. Our findings suggest that the GP Ib-binding domain of vWF contains multiple interaction sites, but integrity of the sequence 509-695 is important for function."
https://openalex.org/W1557439744,"Incubation of purified recombinant human tau protein with aluminum salts at concentrations > or = 100 microM induces aggregation of tau that prevents its entry into SDS-polyacrylamide gels and filtration through nylon membranes. This effect is noncovalent and can be reversed by addition of EDTA. However, when incubated along with ATP, GTP, or CTP, aluminum catalyzes a covalent linkage that results in incorporation of the alpha- and gamma-phosphates into the tau protein (phospho-incorporation). The sensitivity to phosphatases and partial hydrolysis and the labeling observed with ATP containing radioisotopes at different positions suggest a novel reaction in which the entire triphosphate moiety is transferred from ATP and linked to tau via an O-linkage to the alpha-phosphate. The aggregation and triphosphorylation phenomena were not catalyzed by divalent or quadrivalent cations, but similar effects were observed with some other trivalent cations. They occurred at aluminum concentrations similar to those found in human brains with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting the possibility that related reactions may have physiological significance in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1594492118,"In a recent paper we demonstrated that cultures of murine adherent peritoneal cells expressed cell surface-associated serine protease activity that specifically inactivated thrombin by cleaving the enzyme into defined proteolytic fragments (Pejler, G., and Seljelid, R. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3136-3142). In the present report, the purification and further characterization of the thrombin-inactivating serine protease is described. The serine protease is shown to be expressed by mast cells. Purification of the thrombin-inactivating serine protease by a combination of anion-exchange chromatography and Superdex 75 chromatography showed that the enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa. N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified protein demonstrated 100% identity of the thrombin-inactivating serine protease with the secretory granule chymases: murine mast cell protease 3 and murine mast cell protease 4. The serine protease showed chymotrypsin-like substrate specificity. The thrombin-inactivating activity was markedly enhanced by optimal concentrations of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1521455675,"The affinity-purified antibody to a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) containing two src homology 2 domains (PTP1C) was generated. The antibody recognized two types of PTP1C (PTP1C-alpha and -beta) of which the molecular sizes were 66 (alpha) and 62 kDa (beta), respectively, and these two types were expressed differentially in various cell types. The immune complex phosphatase assay using the antibody demonstrated that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and a vitamin D metabolite increased the PTP activity of immunoprecipitated PTP1C to 230 and 150% of control, respectively. By contrast, neither dimethyl sulfoxide nor retinoic acid significantly affected the PTP activity of PTP1C in HL-60 cells. The time course increment by TPA of PTP1C activity was closely correlated with that of the acquisition by HL-60 cells of a macrophage-like phenotype. In addition, TPA increased the amount of PTP1C detected by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation and raised the level of expression of PTP1C mRNA in HL-60 cells. The increase of PTP1C mRNA induced by TPA treatment was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that new protein synthesis is required for the increase by TPA of PTP1C mRNA expression. Furthermore, TPA increased the rate of transcription of the PTP1C gene without affecting the stability of PTP1C mRNA. These results suggest that (i) two subtypes of PTP1C may exist and function in various cell types, and (ii) TPA stimulates the PTP activity of PTP1C by increasing the transcription rate of PTP1C gene expression. The possible role of PTP1C in the macrophage differentiation will be also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1571990604,"Oligosaccharides on invertase restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in alg3,sec18 yeast at 37 degrees C were found to be 20% wild type Man8GlcNAc and 80% Man1 alpha-->2Man1 alpha-->2Man1 alpha-->3(Man1 alpha-->6)Man1 beta-->4GlcNAc2 (Verostek, M.F., Atkinson, P.H., and Trimble, R. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5547-5551). These results suggested that alg3 was slightly leaky, but did not address whether the oligosaccharide-lipid Man9GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 precursors were glucosylated in alg3 yeast. Therefore, an alg3,sec18,gls1 strain was constructed to delete the GLS1-encoded glucosidase I responsible for trimming the terminal alpha 1,2-linked glucose from newly transferred Glc3ManxGlcNAc2 oligosaccharides. Invertase activity was overexpressed 5-10-fold on transforming this strain with a multicopy plasmid (pRB58) carrying the SUC2 gene, and preparative amounts of the ER form of external invertase, derepressed and accumulated at 37 degrees C, were purified. The N-linked glycans were released by sequential treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) and peptide-N4-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl asparagine amidase. Oligosaccharide pools were sized separately on Bio-Gel P-4, which showed that endo H released about 17% of the carbohydrate as Glc3Man8GlcNAc, while peptide-N4-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl asparagine amidase released the remainder as Hex8GlcNAc2 and Man5GlcNAc2 in a 1:4 ratio. Glycan structures were assigned by 500-MHz two-dimensional DQF-COSY 1H NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the endo H-resistant Hex8GlcNAc2 pool contained Glc3Man5GlcNAc2 and Man8GlcNAc2 in a 6:4 ratio, the latter a different isomer from that formed by the ER alpha 1,2-mannosidase (Byrd, J. C., Tarentino, A. L., Maley, F., Atkinson, P. H., and Trimble, R. B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14657-14666). Recovery of Glc3Man8GlcNAc and not the ER form of Man8GlcNAc provided an internal control indicating the absence of glucosidase I, which was confirmed by incubation of [3H]Glc3[14C]Man9GlcNAc with solubilized membranes from either alg3,sec18,gls1 or alg3,sec18,GLS1 strains. Chromatographic analysis of the products showed that [3H]Glc was removed only in the presence of the GLS1 gene product. Thus, the vast majority of the N-linked glycosylation in the ER of alg3 yeast (> 75%) occurs by transfer of Man5GlcNAc2 without prior addition of the 3 glucoses normally found on the lipid-linked precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1599908987,"The gamma complex (gamma delta delta' chi psi) subassembly of the Escherichia coli replicase initiates processive replication upon assembling the ring-shaped beta subunit around DNA. The beta ring acts as a clamp to hold the replicase down to DNA for highly processive synthesis. In this report we characterize the chi and psi subunits of the gamma complex. Both chi and psi are monomeric, and they associate to form a 1:1 complex. The chi subunit does not form a complex with gamma, but psi binds gamma tightly thereby acting as a bridge to assimilate chi into the gamma complex structure. The psi subunit stimulated the ATPase and replication activities of gamma. The chi subunit only stimulated the activities of gamma when the psi subunit was also present thus reflecting the structure where psi bridges the interaction of chi with gamma."

We demonstrate that the in-frame deletion of 60 amino acids, from Asn204 to Glu263 in DAB389-IL-2, results in complete loss of cytotoxic activity, whereas when the amphipathic regions from Asp208 to Ser220 and Ala244 to His258 are replaced with idealized amphipathic helices composed of repeating Glu, Lys, and Leu residues, the mutant fusion toxin has low but detectable activity. DAB389-IL-2 and both variants form channels in artificial phospholipid bilayers with conductances identical to those formed by diphtheria toxin. Both mutant fusion toxins bind to the high affinity IL-2 receptor with affinities similar to that of DAB389-IL-2. The fact that these mutants have markedly reduced or absent cytotoxic activity, but possess wild type catalytic activity, binding affinities, and channel conductances, suggests the existence of a step in the intoxication pathway, defective in the mutants, which occurs after DAB389-IL-2 binds to the IL-2 receptor. It is unknown whether this step occurs prior or subsequent to channel formation, but it is essential for the efficient delivery of the ADP-ribosyltransferase from DAB389-IL-2 to the cytosol of target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577530156,"The formation of long and very long chain (VLC) n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in isolated rat seminiferous tubules was investigated by following the metabolism of three 1-14C-labeled n-6 tetraenoic fatty acids (20:4, 24:4, and 32:4) and [U-14C]acetate. In contrast to [14C]32:4, which was poorly incorporated and altered, [14C]20:4 and [14C]24:4 were efficiently taken up by the tubules, esterified into lipids, elongated to VLCPUFA, and desaturated to pentaenoic fatty acids; the rate of [14C]24:4 desaturation to [14C]24:5 was notably high. The main products with [14C]acetate as precursor were labeled saturates and VLCPUFA, most of the label in tetraenoic and pentaenoic acids appearing in 24:4 and 24:5, respectively. These two C24 polyenes, connected by a delta 6 desaturation, may play a central role in n-6 PUFA metabolism, in their capacity as potential precursors of longer polyenes via elongation and of shorter ones, such as 22:5n-6, via retroconversion. Triacylglycerols, rich in C22 and C24 polyenes, incorporated the greatest amounts of both [14C] acetate-derived and exogenous 14C-PUFA, suggesting that this lipid class is involved in the traffic and metabolism of testicular PUFA. The detection of a series of unusual odd-chain tetraenoic and pentaenoic acids, also labeled with [U-14C]acetate, suggests that a PUFA chain shortening mechanism occurs in testis involving alpha- in addition to beta-oxidation. We speculate that alpha-oxidation plays a role in the retroconversion of PUFA."
https://openalex.org/W1608872254,"Staphylococcal alpha-toxin, the prototype of an oligomerizing, pore-forming cytotoxin, is sensitive to biochemical modifications and cannot be labeled with biotin or fluorescein under preservation of its biological activity. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce cysteine residues at positions 69, 130, and 186. Each mutant was fully and rapidly reactive with several sulfhydryl-specific reagents, indicating superficial location. Coupling of SH-groups with fluorescein-maleimide or biotin-maleimide was tolerated without loss of hemolytic activity at position 130, and the formed hexamers were visible on target cells by fluorescence microscopy and could be detected on electroblots by reaction with streptavidin-peroxidase. At the two other positions, modification caused significant loss of activity. However, the labeled proteins still bound to red cells, as shown by fluorescence microscopy and electroblotting. Intrinsically labeled alpha-toxin represents a novel tool to study the interaction of this pore-former with target membranes."
https://openalex.org/W58491693,"An A135V substitution in the first transmembrane segment of the yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase (PMA1) confers cellular resistance to hygromycin B, exhibits growth sensitivity to low external pH, and results in a defective enzyme that hydrolyzes ATP at 33% of wild type level. The importance of the A135 residue was probed genetically by analysis involving both site-directed mutagenesis and randomly generated second-site intragenic suppressor mutations. No other amino acid at position 135 gave either the wild type phenotype or the normal enzyme activity of A135. Substitutions with the bulkier amino acid residues A135L, A135I, and A135F produced more severe cellular phenotypes than the original A135V mutation. The substitution of the smaller side chain residue Gly was also a mutant, although not as severe as the A135V mutant. The introduction of a bulky Trp or a polar Ser residue produced dominant lethality, while charged amino acids produced recessive lethality. Reduced rates of proton transport measured by acidification of the medium by whole cells correlate closely with the severity of cellular phenotype. Some of the mutant enzymes exhibit an apparent instability in vitro. Thus, the localized structure around A135 is highly constrained. The cellular sensitivity to low external pH of the A135V mutant was used to select intragenic revertants. Most full revertants (low pHR, HygS) restored A135, but second-site mutations in putative transmembrane segments 2 (V146I and V157F) and 4 (L327V) were also observed. Two partial revertants (low pHR, HygR) have secondary mutations at S660C or a double change at F611L-S660F in the putative ATP binding domain. These results provide additional evidence for functional coupling between the cytoplasmic domain catalyzing ATP hydrolysis and transmembrane helices 1 and 2."
https://openalex.org/W1566210470,"Abstract The dependence on the integrity of the human protein C (PC) gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain on its Ca(2+)-dependent binding properties to acidic phospholipid (PL) vesicles has been examined by analysis of these interactions with recombinant (r)-PC Gla domain muteins. The concentration of Ca2+ that results in 50% saturation (C50-Ca) of PL with wild-type (wt) r-PC was not altered by more than 2-fold for the following r-variants of PC, viz. [Gla6-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla14-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla19-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla25-->Asp]r-PC, [Gla29-->Asp]r-PC, and [Gln32-->Gla]r-PC. The C50-Ca was substantially higher than that of wtr-PC for [Gla7-->Asp]r-PC (8.2 mM), [Arg15-->Leu]r-PC (4.5 mM), [Gla16-->Asp]r-PC (> 10 mM), [Gla20-->Asp]r-PC (> 10 mM), and [Gla26-->Asp]r-PC (> 10 mM), indicating that the Ca(2+)-induced conformations of these latter variants interacted poorly with these acidic PL vesicles. Titration of the PL vesicles with wtr-PC at a constant concentration of 20 mM Ca2+ leads to calculation of a concentration of PC that results in 50% saturation of the PL (C50-PC) of 0.38 microM. Essentially this same value was determined for the r-mutants, [Gla7-->Asp]r-PC and [Gln32-->Gla]r-PC. An approximate 2-fold lower C50-PC was obtained for [Gla14-->Asp]r-PC (0.14 microM), [Gla25-->Asp]r-PC (0.16 microM), and [Gla29-->Asp]r-PC (0.15 microM). Somewhat higher C50-PC values were found for [Gla6-->Asp]r-PC (1.2 microM), [Arg15-->Leu]r-PC (1.2 microM), [Gla16-->Asp]r-PC (1.2 microM), [Gla19-->Asp]r-PC (1.8 microM), [Gla20-->Asp]r-PC (1.1 microM), and [Gla26-->Asp]r-PC (1.6 microM). The results of this investigation, in conjunction with other structural and functional studies with these mutants, and the x-ray crystallographic structure of the prothrombin Gla domain-Ca2+ complex, show that Gla16 and Gla26 are the most indispensable Gla residues for maintenance of the functional Ca(2+)-dependent structure of the Gla domain of PC, whereas Gla14 is the least critical Gla residue in this regard. Of the non-Gla residues investigated, Arg15 is of great importance for maintenance of a functional Ca(2+)-dependent structure of PC, and insertion of a Gla residue at position 32, a situation that exists in the cases of some other proteins of this type, does not significantly alter these characteristics of r-PC."
https://openalex.org/W1549333591,"The stability of complexes between serine proteinases and their inhibitors after sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been claimed to indicate covalent bond formation. In this work we have investigated the effects of SDS on the stability of complexes between single-chain or two-chain tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1). Complexes formed by incubation of t-PA with PAI-1 for 15 min at 22 degrees C were further incubated with various amounts of SDS before being subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular species in the gels were identified both by zymography or by autoradiography after immunoblotting with antibodies directed against either t-PA or PAI-1. It was demonstrated that the interaction of SDS with t-PA.PAI-1 complexes before electrophoresis resulted in a transition from the complexed state to the free forms of t-PA and PAI-1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The first-order dissociation rate constant in the presence of 35 mM SDS at 22 degrees C had a koff value of 1.4 x 10(-2) min-1, which corresponds to a half-life of 49.5 min. The t-PA released from the complexes was fibrinolytically active, whereas the released PAI-1 inhibited activator-dependent fibrinolysis. In a similar fashion, the well characterized nonacylated pair alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor-elastase was dissociated by SDS treatment, confirming the validity of our experimental approach to demonstrate the reversibility of t-PA.PAI-1 complexes. These results demonstrate that SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis traps the molecular species in the state in which the proteins existed prior to the analysis, and they suggest that under the conditions used, the interaction of t-PA with PAI-1 results in the formation of nonacylated reversible complexes. This phenomenon may be relevant to the pathophysiology of fibrinolysis and to the general mechanism of serine proteinase-inhibitor complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1570063124,"Abstract Alg3 yeast mutants synthesize endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides whose precursor for elongation is Man1 alpha-->2Man1 alpha-->2Man1 alpha-->3(Man1 alpha-->6)Man1 beta-->4GlcNAc2 (Verostek, M.F., Atkinson, P.H., and Trimble, R. B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5547-5551). To characterize alg3 glycan elongation in vivo, oligosaccharides on alg3,sec18 invertase synthesized and secreted at 26 degrees C were released with peptide-N4-N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl asparagine amidase and purified by Bio-Gel P-4 chromatography. Large (Man > 30GlcNAc2) and intermediate (Man5-10GlcNAc2) sized oligosaccharides were pooled separately, and the smaller ones were exchanged with 2H2O for one- and two-dimensional DQF-COSY 1H NMR analyses at 500 MHz. Although there was no detectable substitution of the terminal alpha 1,6-core-linked mannose, addition of alpha 1,6-, alpha 1,2-, and alpha 1,3-mannoses to the alpha 1,3-linked core branch of a majority of the Man5 precursor was analogous to core-filling reactions seen on wild type invertase glycans (Trimble, R.B., and Atkinson, P.H. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9815-9824). Two additional types of oligosaccharide structures were found; those which retained glucose and those consistent with mannan elongation. Glucose retention appeared to be due to inefficient trimming from minor glucosylated intermediates, while mannan elongation was by extension of a new alpha 1,6-linked branch from the alpha 1,3-core-linked residue as seen in wild-type core oligosaccharides (Hernandez, L.M., Ballou, L., Alvarado, E., Gillece-Castro, B.L., Burlingame, A.L., and Ballou, C. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11849-11856) or mnn1,mnn2,mnn10 processing intermediates (Ballou, L., Alvarado, E., Tsai, P-k., Dell, A., and Ballou, C.E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11857-11864). Thus, the alpha 1,6-linked branch additions which form Man9GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol from Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol appear to provide important structural information enabling efficient recognition by the endoplasmic reticulum-glucosyltransferases forming oligosaccharide-lipid as well as the glucosidases involved in early trimming reactions, but the alg3 mutant documents that they are unnecessary for normal yeast mannan elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1596552525,"Plasma desorption mass spectrometry has recently been used with success to characterize native, underivatized Re- to Rc-type endotoxins in terms of their constituent lipopolysaccharides. The spectra give masses for the major molecular species of lipopolysaccharide present from which their probable compositions could be inferred using the overall composition determined by chemical analyses. Moreover, the relative intensities of the signals are roughly proportional to the abundance of their corresponding molecular species. Native Rc-, Rb-, and Ra-type enterobacterial endotoxins with 5-10 core sugar units have been rendered amenable to plasma-desorption mass spectrometry analysis by improvement in their solubility and the use of cellobiose as an additive. The spectra of four Salmonella and Escherichia endotoxin preparations demonstrated heterogeneity in acylation and phosphorylation. Since these sources of heterogeneity are critical for many biological activities, the spectra underline the need to define the composition of each preparation of endotoxin used in structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W1539375769,"Staphylococcal alpha-toxin is a single-chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 34,000 that hexamerizes in lipid bilayers to form pores of 1-1.5 nm effective diameter in membranes. We demonstrate that limited proteolysis of purified alpha-toxin with proteinase K generates a hemolytically active product that yields one major protein band of 17-18 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 17-18-kDa protein band harbors two major fragments of similar size representing the N- and C-terminal halves, which remain associated with each other in non-denaturing buffers but dissociate in 6 M urea. Dissociation in urea leads to loss of hemolytic activity. In contrast, unnicked alpha-toxin is not inactivated by urea. Nicked, hemolytically active alpha-toxin forms hexamers on erythrocyte membranes and on lymphocytes and monocytes. However, the nicked toxin can only lyse erythrocytes and fails to permeabilize nucleated cells. Osmotic protection experiments indicate that the size of pores generated by the nicked toxin is considerably smaller (0.6-0.9 nm effective diameter) than that generated by native toxin. The collective results do not support a previous proposal that different functions of alpha-toxin are contained in separate domains of the molecule."

The phosphorylation state of eIF-4E correlates with increased activity and a major phosphorylation site resides at serine 53. To further evaluate the role of eIF-4E phosphorylation, eIF-4E wild-type and two Ser53 mutants, Ser53Ala and Ser53Asp, were expressed at high level, representing almost 2% of the total cell protein, by transient transfection of COS-1 monkey cells. 32PO4 metabolic labeling of transfected cells demonstrated both Ser53 mutants were phosphorylated at an alternate serine residue. [35S]Methionine pulse-labeling demonstrated that the wild-type and both Ser53 mutants were equally incorporated into the eIF-4F complex. The effect of wild-type and Ser53 mutant overexpression on cap-dependent translation initiation and internal translation initiation was monitored by cotransfection with an expression vector encoding a dicistronic mRNA for which the 5' cistron is translated in a cap-dependent manner, and the 3' cistron is translated by internal ribosome binding. Unexpectedly, overexpression of the wild-type or either mutant did not affect the efficiency of either cap-dependent or internal initiation. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF-4E at residue 53 is not required for interaction with p220 and suggest that Ser53 phosphorylation may not be required for cap-dependent translation initiation in this system."
https://openalex.org/W145745569,"Hormonally regulated and particulate-associated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was detected in endothelial cells from bovine pulmonary artery. The enzyme was solubilized and subjected to initial characterization. PLA2 activity was determined in subcellular fractions from bradykinin (BK)-stimulated and nonstimulated cells by following the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from exogenously added 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine. Stimulation of cells with BK led to increased PLA2 activity in a particulate fraction (the 92,000 x g pellet of the postnuclear supernatant). The activity in the cytosolic fractions from BK-stimulated and nonstimulated cells was the same. The association of the hormonally regulated PLA2 (HR-PLA2) activity with the particulate fraction was not affected by decreasing the Ca2+ concentrations in the homogenate from 7 microM to 33 nM and therefore was not induced during homogenization by the presence of Ca2+ in the homogenate. The HR-PLA2 activity was Ca(2+)-dependent and was maximal at submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+. Incubation of the particulate fraction obtained from BK-stimulated and nonstimulated cells with 10 mM n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside resulted in a differential solubilization of the HR-PLA2 activity. Its isoelectric point was determined to be 5.7. HR-PLA2 activity in the octyl glucoside extract of the particulate fraction from stimulated cells co-sedimented in sucrose gradients with the cytosolic PLA2. Their molecular mass was estimated to be 103,000 Da. The extracted enzyme from BK-stimulated cells retained its increased activity toward 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine. However, its activity toward 1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine was equal to the PLA2 activity extracted from nonstimulated cells. Treatment of the cells with 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in a 20 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- S.E., p < 0.01, n = 4) increase in the PLA2 activity in the cytosol but failed to increase PLA2 activity in the particulate fraction. In contrast, addition of 7 microM Ca2+ ionophore A23187 resulted in a 21 +/- 0.55% (mean +/- S.E., p < 0.01, n = 5) decrease in the cytosolic activity and a concomitant increase of 68 +/- 9.6% (mean +/- S.E., p < 0.05, n = 5) in the particulate-associated activity. We conclude that stimulation of endothelial cells with BK increases the activity of a Ca(2+)-sensitive high molecular weight isoform of PLA2 which is associated with the particulate fraction. Possible mechanisms of activation are discussed."

In this report, we show that Goodpasture antigen mRNA undergoes processing to at least two alternatively spliced forms in a variety of human tissues, resulting in the exclusion of sequence encoded by either one or two exons. Interestingly, no alternatively spliced forms were observed in bovine or rat tissues. The derived amino acid sequences of the two variant mRNA forms are identical and significantly shorter than that arising from the complete Goodpasture antigen mRNA. They lack the carboxyl-terminal region contributing to the formation of the Goodpasture epitope and all but one of the cysteines found in the complete form. These sequence characteristics suggest that, if translated, the variant Goodpasture antigen is likely to be defective in triple helix formation and no longer reactive with Goodpasture autoantibodies. Although each tissue expressing Goodpasture antigen displayed a specific mRNA pattern, the complete form was always the most abundant and was present at levels apparently unrelated to whether or not the organ of origin is a potential target in Goodpasture syndrome. Furthermore, the antigen sequence was identical in the kidneys of normal and Goodpasture-affected individuals, and no major differences in the expression of the complete and spliced forms were observed."

https://openalex.org/W1615570324,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase is a bifunctional enzyme, catalyzing the phosphorylation of the serine and threonine residues in peptides and proteins (kinase activity) as well as the phosphorylation of water (ATPase activity). We have found that several peptides, which serve as inhibitors of the kinase reaction, will either maintain or enhance the ATPase reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. Positively charged dipeptides (e.g. Arg-Arg), as well as small guanidino-containing compounds (e.g. guanethidine) block protein kinase activity yet enhance ATPase activity up to 3.5-fold over that exhibited by the enzyme in the absence of these compounds. In contrast, several nonphosphorylatable peptides, whose primary sequences are based on that of a known substrate (i.e. Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly), such as Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ala-Leu-Gly, Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Phe-Leu-Gly, and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Tyr-Leu-Gly, have little or no effect on the rate of the kinase-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP. An exception to the latter observation is Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Cys-Leu-Gly, a cysteine-containing peptide that promotes the protein kinase-catalyzed ATPase reaction by 2.2-fold. We have also found that peptides that possess relatively large amino acid side chain moieties immediately following the arginine dyad (i.e. such as Phe, Tyr, Cys, or Asn at Xaa in Leu-Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ala-Leu-Gly) sharply reduce the rate of enzyme-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. This suggests that in the presence of peptides containing an -Arg-Arg-Ala- sequence, the enzyme-bound gamma-phosphate of ATP is relatively accessible to water. In contrast, when the latter alanine moiety is replaced by a larger residue, access by water to ATP appears to be hindered. These results indicate that certain structural features associated with the substrate or substrate analog have a profound influence on the manner by which these species interact with the protein kinase. Furthermore, the work described herein demonstrates that it is possible to block the physiologically important kinase reaction and simultaneously promote the energetically wasteful ATPase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W115214958,"Abstract A previously unreported enzymatic activity is described for monomers of the beta 1 beta 1 isoenzyme of human alcohol dehydrogenase that were prepared from dimeric enzyme by freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen. Whereas the dimeric enzyme has optimal activity at substrate concentrations (2.5 mM ethanol, 50 microM NAD+; low activity), the monomer has its highest activity at substrate concentrations (1.5 M ethanol, 2.5 mM NAD+; high activity). While the activity of the monomer does not appear to be saturated at 1.5 M ethanol, its maximal activity at this ethanol concentration exceeds the Vmax of the dimer by about 3-fold. The apparent Km of NAD+ with monomers is 270 microM, and no activity could be detected with nicotinamide mononucleotide as cofactor. During gel filtration the Km activity elutes at a lower apparent molecular weight position than the dimer. The kinetics of monomer-to-dimer reassociation are consistent with a second-order process with a rate constant of 240 M-1 s-1. The reassociation rate is markedly enhanced by the presence of NAD+. During refolding of beta 1 beta 1 following denaturation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, an enzyme species with Km activity and spectral properties similar to the freeze-thaw monomer is observed, indicating that a catalytically active monomer is an intermediate in the refolding pathway. The enzymatic activity of the monomer implies that the intersubunit contacts of beta 1 beta 1 are not crucial in establishing a catalytically competent enzyme. However, the differences in specific activity and Km between monomer and dimer suggest that dimerization may serve to modulate the catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1525065862,"Abstract Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a poor activator of plasminogen, but its catalytic efficiency is greatly enhanced in the presence of fibrin or certain fibrin derivatives. These two very different rates of plasminogen activation provide a basis for the phenomenon of substrate inhibition, which was the subject of the present study. The reaction mixture contained Glu-plasminogen (0-4.0 microM), +/- D-dimer (0.06-1.0 microM), t-PA (0.05-50.0 nM), and S2251 (1.5 mM). Inhibition of the reaction at higher plasminogen concentrations was seen at lower concentrations of t-PA (< 1.0 nM) and D-dimer (< 0.5 microM). The maximum rate of plasminogen activation occurred at 0.2 microM Glu-plasminogen but then decreased progressively above this concentration. At a physiological concentration of plasminogen (2.0 microM), activation was about half that at 0.2 microM. This phenomenon was shown not to be related to Glu-plasminogen aggregation or to a non-competitive inhibiting contaminant. Instead, the non-linear Lineweaver-Burk curve in the presence of D-dimer was consistent with substrate inhibition. Increasing the concentration of D-dimer (1.0 microM) and/or t-PA (50 nM) overcame the inhibition and reestablished linearity in the Lineweaver-Burk plots. However, at the higher concentrations of t-PA, the catalytic efficiency was reduced by 50-120-fold, suggesting that t-PA may be less efficient at pharmacological than at physiological concentrations. In conclusion, substrate inhibition in t-PA-induced plasminogen activation is reported for the first time. This phenomenon was confined to low concentrations of t-PA and D-dimer in the presence of physiological concentrations of plasminogen. The observation suggests that small fibrin clots (hemostatic plugs) may be more resistant to t-PA-induced lysis than an occlusive thrombus."
