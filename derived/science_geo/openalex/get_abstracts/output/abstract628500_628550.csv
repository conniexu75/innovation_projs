https://openalex.org/W2915574559,"Background Intracellular delivery of antimicrobial agents by nanoparticles, such as mesoporous silica particles (MSPs), offers an interesting strategy to treat intracellular infections. In tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis avoids components of the immune system by residing primarily inside alveolar macrophages, which are the desired target for TB therapy. Methods and findings We have previously identified a peptide, called NZX, capable of inhibiting both clinical and multi-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis at therapeutic concentrations. In this study we analysed the potential of MSPs containing NZX for the treatment of tuberculosis. The MSPs released functional NZX gradually into simulated lung fluid and the peptide filled MSPs were easily taken up by primary macrophages. In an intracellular infection model, the peptide containing particles showed increased mycobacterial killing compared to free peptide. The therapeutic potential of peptide containing MSPs was investigated in a murine infection model, showing that MSPs preserved the effect to eliminate M. tuberculosis in vivo. Conclusions In this study we found that loading the antimicrobial peptide NZX into MSPs increased the inhibition of intracellular mycobacteria in primary macrophages and preserved the ability to eliminate M. tuberculosis in vivo in a murine model. Our studies provide evidence for the feasibility of using MSPs for treatment of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2917923184,"Different planting patterns affect the light interception of intercrops under intercropping conditions. Here we revealed that narrow-wide-row relay-intercropping improves the light interception across maize leaves in wide rows (60cm) and narrow rows (40cm), accelerated the biomass production of intercrop-species and compensated the slight maize yield loss by considerably increasing the soybean yield. In a two-year experiment, maize was planted with soybean in different planting patterns (1M1S, 50:50cm and 2M2S, 40:60cm) of relay-intercropping, both planting patterns were compared with sole cropping of maize (M) and soybean (S). As compared to M and 1M1S, 2M2S increased the total light interception of maize leaves in wide rows (WR) by 27% and 23%, 20% and 10%, 16% and 9% which in turn significantly enhanced the photosynthetic rate of WR maize leaves by 7% and 5%, 12% and 9%, and 19% and 4%, at tasseling, grain-filling and maturity stage of maize, respectively. Similarly, the light transmittance at soybean canopy increased by 218%, 160% and 172% at V2, V5 and R1 stage in 2M2S compared with 1M1S. The improved light environment at soybean canopy in 2M2S considerably enhanced the mean biomass accumulation, and allocation to stem and leaves of soybean by 168%, and 131% and 207%, respectively, while it decreased the mean biomass accumulation, and distribution to stem, leaves and seed of maize by 4%, and 4%, 6% and 5%, respectively than 1M1S. Compared to 1M1S, 2M2S also increased the CR values of soybean (by 157%) but decreased the CR values of maize (by 61%). Overall, under 2M2S, relay-cropped maize and soybean produced 94% and 69% of the sole cropping yield, and the 2M2S achieved LER of 1.7 with net income of 1387.7 US $ ha-1 in 2016 and 1434.4 US $ ha-1 in 2017. Our findings implied that selection of optimum planting pattern (2M2S) may increase the light interception and influence the light distribution between maize and soybean rows under relay-intercropping conditions which will significantly increase the intercrops productivity. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the light environment when considering the sustainability of maize-soybean relay-intercropping via appropriate planting pattern selection."

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate serum soluble PD-1/PD-L1 levels in patients with advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT).Serum soluble PD-L1 and PD-1 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after CRT in 117 patients with low rectal cancer. Changes in the levels of sPD-L1/PD-1 after CRT, and the correlation between sPD-L1/PD-1 level and clinicopathological characteristics or disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated.sPD-L1 levels significantly increased after CRT (p < 0.0001), whereas sPD-1 levels did not change significantly (p = 0.1050). High sPD-L1 before CRT was significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.044), and after CRT, with lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.021). High sPD-1 before and after CRT was significantly associated with a longer distance of the tumor from the anal verge (both p < 0.001). There was no correlation between sPD-L1 level and local PD-L1 expression on stromal immune cells. High sPD-L1 level after CRT tended to be associated with worse DFS (p = 0.0752). The multivariate analysis could not demonstrate an independent association for sPD-L1 levels after CRT with DFS.Significant increase of sPD-L1 levels after CRT suggests that anti-PD-L1 therapy might be a potential treatment strategy in combination with CRT in advanced rectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2916076010,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the deadliest tumor due to its highly abundant tumor stroma. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are considered precursor cells of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which induce tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the role of integrin subunit α (ITGA) 11, the receptor for collagen type I, in tumor stroma interaction. Clinical sample analysis showed that ITGA11 was overexpressed by CAFs in PDAC stroma, as shown with colocalization immunostaining with α-smooth muscle actin. In contrast, there was no expression in healthy pancreas. Public transcriptomic data confirmed a reduced expression of ITGA11 in healthy pancreas and adjacent nontumoral tissues compared with human tumor tissues. Primary human PSCs (hPSCs) activated with either TGF-β or pancreatic cancer cell (PANC-1)-conditioned medium (CM) resulted in the significant up-regulation of ITGA11 and various CAF markers. Furthermore, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated stable ITGA11 knockdown (shITGA11) in hPSCs significantly inhibited TGF-β- and PANC-1 CM-mediated activation at both gene and protein levels of extracellular matrix, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. Additionally, shITGA11 hPSCs had a reduced migration and contractility compared with shRNA control (shCTR) PSCs. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of ITGA11 on the paracrine effects of hPSCs. Interestingly, the CM from shITGA11 hPSCs, activated with either TGF-β or PANC-1 CM, caused tumor cells to migrate and invade lesser compared with their counterpart, activated shCTR PSCs. In summary, this study presents ITGA11 as an interesting stromal therapeutic target that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the differentiation of PSCs into CAFs and paracrine effects.-Schnittert, J., Bansal, R., Mardhian, D. F., van Baarlen, J., Östman, A., Prakash, J. Integrin α11 in pancreatic stellate cells regulates tumor stroma interaction in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2915131490,"Shark attacks are a global phenomenon that attracts widespread attention and publicity, often with negative outcomes for shark populations. Despite the widespread perceptions of shark attacks, trends in human water activities and shark populations are both dynamic, resulting in variable rates of shark attacks over space and time. Understanding variable trends in shark attacks may contribute to a better understanding of risk, and a more tempered response in the wake of an attack. We found that global shark attack rates are low, yet variable across global regions and over decades. Countries with low populations were found to have the highest rates of attack, while countries with high populations (U.S.A., Australia, South Africa) tended to have overall low attack rates, but also much more interannual variability. From the 1960s to the present, those countries with the highest populations also tended to be the places where attack rates have increased. Ultimately, shark attack risk is also driven by local conditions (e.g., time of day, species present); however, a global scale understanding of attack rates helps place risk into perspective and may contribute to a more scientifically-grounded discussion of sharks, and their management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2915554264,"The chromosome 8q24.21 locus, which contains the proto-oncogene c-MYC, long non-coding RNA PVT1, and microRNAs (miRs), is the most commonly amplified region in human prostate cancer. A long-range interaction of genetic variants with c-MYC or long non-coding PVT1 at this locus contributes to the genetic risk of prostate cancer. At this locus is a cluster of genes for six miRs (miR-1204, -1205, -1206, -1207-3p, -1207-5p, and -1208), but their functional role remains elusive. Here the copy numbers and expression levels of miRs-1204–1208 were investigated using quantitative PCR for prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumors. The data revealed that copy numbers and expression of miR-1205 were increased in both castration-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and in primary tumors. In castration-resistant prostate cancer specimens, the copy number at the miR-1205 locus correlated with the expression of miR-1205. Furthermore, functional analysis with an miR-1205 mimic, an miR-1205 inhibitor, and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout revealed that, in human prostate cancer cells, miR-1205 promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibited hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. In these cells, miR-1205 downregulated the expression of the Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 3(EGLN3) gene and targeted a site in its 3′-untranslated region to downregulate its transcriptional activity. Thus, by targeting EGLN3, miR-1205 has an oncogenic role and may contribute to the genetic risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2952399752,"Globally, preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death with estimated prevalence and associated mortality highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Accurate identification of preterm infants is important at the individual level for appropriate clinical intervention as well as at the population level for informed policy decisions and resource allocation. As early prenatal ultrasound is commonly not available in these settings, gestational age (GA) is often estimated using newborn assessment at birth. This approach assumes last menstrual period to be unreliable and birthweight to be unable to distinguish preterm infants from those that are small for gestational age (SGA). We sought to leverage machine learning algorithms incorporating maternal factors associated with SGA to improve accuracy of preterm newborn identification in LMIC settings.This study uses data from an ongoing obstetrical cohort in Lusaka, Zambia that uses early pregnancy ultrasound to estimate GA. Our intent was to identify the best set of parameters commonly available at delivery to correctly categorize births as either preterm (<37 weeks) or term, compared to GA assigned by early ultrasound as the gold standard. Trained midwives conducted a newborn assessment (<72 hours) and collected maternal and neonatal data at the time of delivery or shortly thereafter. New Ballard Score (NBS), last menstrual period (LMP), and birth weight were used individually to assign GA at delivery and categorize each birth as either preterm or term. Additionally, machine learning techniques incorporated combinations of these measures with several maternal and newborn characteristics associated with prematurity and SGA to develop GA at delivery and preterm birth prediction models. The distribution and accuracy of all models were compared to early ultrasound dating. Within our live-born cohort to date (n = 862), the median GA at delivery by early ultrasound was 39.4 weeks (IQR: 38.3-40.3). Among assessed newborns with complete data included in this analysis (n = 468), the median GA by ultrasound was 39.6 weeks (IQR: 38.4-40.3). Using machine learning, we identified a combination of six accessible parameters (LMP, birth weight, twin delivery, maternal height, hypertension in labor, and HIV serostatus) that can be used by machine learning to outperform current GA prediction methods. For preterm birth prediction, this combination of covariates correctly classified >94% of newborns and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9796.We identified a parsimonious list of variables that can be used by machine learning approaches to improve accuracy of preterm newborn identification. Our best-performing model included LMP, birth weight, twin delivery, HIV serostatus, and maternal factors associated with SGA. These variables are all easily collected at delivery, reducing the skill and time required by the frontline health worker to assess GA.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02738892."
https://openalex.org/W2917510390,"Foraging behaviors that impact gene flow can guide the design of pollinator strategies to mitigate gene flow. Reduced gene flow is expected to minimize the impact of genetically engineered (GE) crops on feral and natural populations and to facilitate the coexistence of different agricultural markets. The goal of this study is to link foraging behavior to gene flow and identify behaviors that can help predict gene flow for different bee species. To reach this goal, we first examined and compared the foraging behaviors of three distinct bee species, the European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., and the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., foraging on Medicago sativa flowers. Each foraging behavior investigated differed among bee species. Both social bees exhibited directionality of movement and had similar residence, in contrast to the random movement and shorter residence of the solitary bee. Tripping rate and net distance traveled differed among the three bee species. We ranked each behavior among bee species and used the relative ranking as gene flow predictor before testing the predictions against empirical gene flow data. Tripping rate and net distance traveled, but not residence, predicted relative gene dispersal among bee species. Linking specific behaviors to gene flow provides mechanisms to explain differences in gene flow among bee species and guides the development of management practices to reduce gene flow. Although developed in one system, the approach developed here can be generalized to different plant/pollinator systems."
https://openalex.org/W2916543990,"A nonactivating allosteric modulator of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R, also called GPCR 43) turns both propionate (an orthosteric FFA2R agonist) and ATP (an agonist for the purinergic P2Y2 receptor), into potent activating ligands that trigger an assembly of the superoxide-generating neutrophil NADPH oxidase. The ATP-induced activation requires the participation of FFA2R, and the signaling is biased toward oxidase activation, leaving the ATP-induced rise in intracellular Ca2+ unaffected. No NADPH oxidase activity was induced by ATP when propionate replaced the allosteric modulator. Signaling downstream of propionate-activated FFA2Rs was insensitive to Gαq inhibition, but the crosstalk activation involving both FFA2R and P2Y2R relied on Gαq signaling. The receptor crosstalk, by which allosterically modulated FFA2Rs communicate with P2Y2Rs and generate NADPH oxidase activating signals downstream of Gαq, represent a novel mechanism by which GPCR activities can be regulated from inside the plasma membrane. Further, the finding that an allosteric FFA2R modulator sensitizes not only the response induced by orthosteric FFA2R agonists, but also the response induced by ATP (P2Y2R-specific agonist) and formyl peptide receptor-specific agonists, violates the receptor restriction characteristics normally defining the selectivity of allosteric GPCR modulators.—Lind, S., Holdfeldt, A., Mårtensson, J., Sundqvist, M., Bjórkman, L., Forsman, H., Dahlgren, C.

https://openalex.org/W2918153918,"Working atypical schedules leads to temporal misalignments between a worker's rest-activity cycle and their endogenous circadian system. Several studies have reported disturbed centrally controlled rhythms, but little is known on shift workers' peripheral clocks. Here, we assessed central clock markers, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and salivary cortisol, and clock gene expression in 2 peripheral clocks, oral mucosa cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in 11 police officers. Before working 7 consecutive nights, officers' centrally controlled rhythms were aligned to a day-oriented schedule. These rhythms were partially realigned to the shifted schedule and dampened after a week working nights. For peripheral clocks at baseline, Period (PER)1-3 and nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (REV-ERBα) in oral mucosa cells had a significant mRNA peak in the afternoon, whereas in PBMCs, higher PER1-3 expression was observed at 10:00 compared with 19:30. After a week working nights, PER1-3 and REV-ERBα expression in oral mucosa cells lost rhythmicity, and in PBMCs, the morning/evening difference observed at baseline was lost. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the disruption of several peripheral clocks in real shift workers. Molecular circadian disturbances are believed to have important clinical implications for the occurrence of shift work-associated medical disorders.-Koshy, A., Cuesta, M., Boudreau, P., Cermakian, N., Boivin, D.

https://openalex.org/W2915290766,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by remodeling and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries, which lead to elevation of right ventricular pressure, heart failure, and death. Proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of PAH, although the underlying mechanisms are still being explored. The protein p53 is involved in cell cycle coordination, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cellular senescence, but its role in pulmonary hypertension (PH) is not fully known. We developed a mouse model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) and found significant reduction of p53 expression in the lungs. Our in vitro experiments with metabolomic analyses and the Seahorse XF extracellular flux analyzer indicated that suppression of p53 expression in PASMCs led to upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of mitochondrial respiration, suggesting a proliferative phenotype resembling that of cancer cells. It was previously shown that systemic genetic depletion of p53 in a murine PH model led to more severe lung manifestations. Lack of information about the role of cell-specific p53 signaling promoted us to investigate it in our mouse PH model with the inducible Cre-loxP system. We generated a mouse model with SMC-specific gain or loss of p53 function by crossing Myh11-Cre/ERT2 mice with floxed Mdm4 mice or floxed Trp53 mice. After these animals were exposed to hypoxia for 4 weeks, we conducted hemodynamic and echocardiographic studies. Surprisingly, the severity of PH was similar in both groups of mice and there were no differences between the genotypes. Our findings in these mice indicate that activation or suppression of p53 signaling in SMCs has a minor role in the pathogenesis of PH and suggest that p53 signaling in other cells (endothelial cells, immune cells, or fibroblasts) may be involved in the progression of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2915079067,"The channel that governs mechanotransduction (MT) by hair cells in the inner ear has been investigated intensively for 4 decades, but its precise molecular composition remains enigmatic. Transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1) was recently identified as a component of the MT channel, and lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) is considered to be part of the MT complex and may functionally couple the tip link to the MT channel. As components of the MT complex, TMC1 and LHFPL5 are expected to localize at the lower end of the tip link in hair cells, a notion generally supported by previous studies on neonatal mice. However, the localization of these 2 proteins, particularly in the hair cells of adult mice, remains incompletely elucidated. Because determination of TMC1 and LHFPL5 localization at distinct developmental stages is essential for understanding their function and regulation, we used several approaches to examine the localization of these proteins in neonatal and adult hair cells in the mouse. We report several notable findings: 1) TMC1 and LHFPL5 predominantly localize at the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia in neonatal hair cells, which largely verifies the previously published findings in neonatal hair cells; 2) LHFPL5 persists in the hair bundle of hair cells after postnatal day (P)7, which clarifies the previously reported unexpected absence of LHFPL5 after P7 and supports the view that LHFPL5 is a permanent component in the MT complex; and 3) TMC1 and LHFPL5 remain at the tip of the shorter rows of stereocilia in adult outer hair cells, but in adult inner hair cells, TMC1 is uniformly distributed in both the tallest row and the shorter rows of stereocilia, whereas LHFPL5 is uniformly distributed in the shorter rows of stereocilia. These findings raise intriguing questions regarding the turnover rate, regulation, additional functions, and functional interaction of TMC1 and LHFPL5. Our study confirms the previous findings in neonatal hair cells and reveals several previously unidentified aspects of TMC1 and LHFPL5 localization in more mature hair cells.—Li, X., Yu, X., Chen, X., Liu, Z., Wang, G., Li, C., Wong, E.

Cancer patients tend to experience psychological inflexibility as a reaction to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Therefore, there is a need to identify psychological inflexibility due to its impact on quality of life among cancer patients. Objectives Acceptance and action questionnaire (AAQ II) is a scale used to assess psychological inflexibility. The aim of this study is to translate AAQ II into Malay language and evaluate the psychometric properties of AAQ II Malay version. Methods The AAQ II which has been translated into Malay language via back translation procedure was distributed to 101 cancer patients and 100 non-cancer patients. The evaluation of psychometric properties in this study included content validity index, internal consistency, parallel reliability, exploratory factor analysis, concurrent validity, sensitivity and specificity of AAQ II Malay version. Results AAQ II Malay version has established good content validity index, acceptable internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.91, excellent parallel reliability and adequate concurrent validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) results demonstrated AAQ II Malay version is a unidimensional factor instrument. The result of sensitivity and specificity of AAQ II Malay version indicated cancer patients who scored more than 17.5 were having significant psychological inflexibility. Conclusion AAQ II Malay version is a reliable and valid instrument to measure psychological inflexibility among cancer patient in Malaysia."
https://openalex.org/W2916367487,"FOXF2 and FOXQ1, forkhead box transcription factor superfamily members, are encoded by neighboring genes located on human chromosome 6p25.3 and play opposite roles in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). However, the relationship between FOXF2 and FOXQ1 in cancer remains unknown. Here, we found mutual transcriptional repression between FOXF2 and FOXQ1, and the reciprocal negative feedback loop controlled EMT, aggressiveness, and chemoresistance in BLBC cells. We further demonstrated that FOXF2 recruited nuclear receptor corepressor 1 and histone deacetylase 3 to the FOXQ1 promoter to inhibit its transcription in BLBC cells, but FOXQ1 did not exert such an effect on FOXF2. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms underlying the determination of BLBC aggressiveness and the transrepressive function of FOXF2 in a basal-like cell subtype-specific manner. Therefore, blocking the vicious cycle of the abnormal reciprocal feedback loop between FOXF2 and FOXQ1 to induce cell differentiation and restore tissue homeostasis is a promising strategy for the treatment of aggressive BLBC.-Kang, L.-J., Yu, Z.-H., Cai, J., He, R., Lu, J.-T., Hou, C., Wang, Q.-S., Li, X.-Q., Zhang, R., Feng, Y.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2915358366,"Research with adults and older adolescents suggests a general factor may underlie both mental health difficulties and wellbeing. However, the classical bifactor model commonly used to demonstrate this general trait has recently been criticised when a unidimensional structure is not supported. Furthermore, research is lacking in this area with children and early adolescents. We present confirmatory factor analysis models to explore the structure of psychopathology and wellbeing in early adolescents, using secondary data from a large U.K. sample (N = 1982). A simple correlated factors structure fitted the data well and revealed that wellbeing was just as related to internalising as this was to externalising symptoms. The classical bifactor solution also fitted the data well but was rejected as the general factor explained only 55% of the total common variance. S-1 models were therefore used to explore general covariance in a more robust way, and revealed that a general internalising distress factor could play an important role in all item responses. Gender and income differences in mental health were also explored through invariance testing and correlations. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering mental health difficulties and wellbeing items together, and suggestions are made for how their correspondence could be controlled for."
https://openalex.org/W2916893408,"Background Liver metastases are the major cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related deaths. However, there is no reliable clinical predictor for CRC progression to liver metastasis. In this study, we investigated possible predictors (miRNAs and biomarkers) for clinical application. Methodology The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE49355, GSE41258 and GSE81558 for genes and GSE54088 and GSE56350 for miRNAs were used to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs between primary CRC tissues and liver metastases. The identified miRNAs and their targets from the DEGs were verified in datasets comprising gene, miRNA and miRNA exosome profiles of CRC patients with no distant metastases (M0) and distant metastases (M1); the interaction networks and pathways were also mapped. Results There were 49 upregulated and 13 downregulated DEGs and 16 downregulated and 14 upregulated miRNAs; between the DEGs and miRNA targets, there were five upregulated and four downregulated genes. MiR-20a was strongly correlated with the status of liver metastasis. MiR-20a, miR499a, and miR-576-5p were highly correlated with the metastatic outcomes. MiR-20a was significantly highly expressed in the M1 group. In an analysis of the miRNA target genes, we found that CDH2, KNG1, and MMP2 were correlated with CRC metastasis. We demonstrated a new possible pathway for CRC metastasis: miR-576-5p/F9, miR20a/MMP2, CTSK, MMP3, and miR449a/P2RY14. The regulation of IGF transport and uptake by IGFBPs, extracellular matrix organization, signal transduction and the immune system were the enriched pathways. Conclusion This model can predict CRC to liver metastases and the pathways involved, which can be clinically applicable."
https://openalex.org/W2915806881,"Baleen whales face the challenge of finding patchily distributed food in the open ocean. Their relatively well-developed olfactory structures suggest that they could identify the specific odours given off by planktonic prey such as krill aggregations. Like other marine predators, they may also detect dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a chemical released in areas of high marine productivity. However, dedicated behavioural studies still have to be conducted in baleen whales in order to confirm the involvement of chemoreception in their feeding ecology. We implemented 56 behavioural response experiments in humpback whales using two food-related chemical stimuli, krill extract and DMS, as well as their respective controls (orange clay and vegetable oil) in their breeding (Madagascar) and feeding grounds (Iceland and Antarctic Peninsula). The whales approached the stimulus area and stayed longer in the trial zone during krill extract trials compared to control trials, suggesting that they were attracted to the chemical source and spent time exploring its surroundings, probably in search of prey. This response was observed in Iceland, and to a lesser extend in Madagascar, but not in Antarctica. Surface behaviours indicative of sensory exploration, such as diving under the stimulus area and stopping navigation, were also observed more often during krill extract trials than during control trials. Exposure to DMS did not elicit such exploration behaviours in any of the study areas. However, acoustic analyses suggest that DMS and krill extract both modified the whales’ acoustic activity in Madagascar. Altogether, these results provide the first behavioural evidence that baleen whales actually perceive prey-derived chemical cues over distances of several hundred metres. Chemoreception, especially olfaction, could thus be used for locating prey aggregations and for navigation at sea, as it has been shown in other marine predators including seabirds."
https://openalex.org/W2916162574,"Chagas disease is still prevalent in rural areas of South America. In endemic areas of Bolivia, school children are screened for the program of Chagas disease eradication of the Ministry of Health, and positive children are treated. Here, we compared the fecal, oral and skin microbiomes of children with or without Chagas disease, and before and after benznidazol treatment of infected children.A total of 543 Bolivian children (5-14 years old) were tested for Chagas disease, and 20 positive children were treated with Benznidazole. Fecal samples and oral and skin swabs were obtained before and after treatment, together with samples from a group of 35 uninfected controls. The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and analyzed using QIIME to determine Alpha diversity differences and community distances, and linear discriminant analyses to determine marker taxa by infection status or treatment.Twenty out of 543 children screened were seropositive for Chagas disease (3.7%) and were included in the study, together with 35 control children that were seronegative for the disease. Fecal samples, oral and skin swabs were taken at the beginning of the study and after the anti-protozoa therapy with Benznidazole to the chagasic children. Infected children had higher fecal Firmicutes (Streptococcus, Roseburia, Butyrivibrio, and Blautia), and lower Bacteroides and also showed some skin -but not oral- microbiota differences. Treatment eliminated the fecal microbiota differences from control children, increasing Dialister (class Clostridia) and members of the Enterobacteriaceae, and decreasing Prevotella and Coprococcus, with minor effects on the oral and skin bacterial diversity.The results of this study show differences in the fecal microbiota associated with Chagas disease in children, and also evidence that treatment normalizes fecal microbiota (makes it more similar to that in controls), but is associated with oral and skin microbiota differences from control children. Since microbiota impacts in children, it is important to determine the effect of drugs on the children microbiota, since dysbiosis could lead to physiological effects which might be avoidable with microbiota restoration interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2917713222,"In Bangladesh the exclusive breastfeeding rate remains low and prelacteal, formula and bottle feeding is increasing. This study aims to explore reasons behind infant formula feeding practices from mothers, caregivers, and health care provider’s perspective. This was a qualitative study carried out in four sub-districts of Sylhet and Jessore of rural Bangladesh. Data were collected through focus group discussions (12), in-depth interviews (4) and key informant interviews (12) from January to February 2014. The qualitative data collected and were analyzed using thematic content analysis. This study clearly showed the factor behind formula feeding by Bangladeshi rural women. One of the major findings was that women could not differentiate between formula and other milk. Main differences between formula and powder milk were the type of consumer where formula only was taken by infant and children less than 2 years. Other major reasons include; poor breastfeeding practices, lack of appropriate breastfeeding practices, superficial knowledge on harmful effect on infant formula; perceived insufficient breast milk production, the influence of family and society and authoritarian power of hospital staff. Rural mothers have intension to feed infant formula to their infants due to various factors including individual, social, cultural and institutional. These identified factors can contribute to policy making and develop more specific interventions targeting expected mother and their family members that can contribute to stop formula feeding and increase breastfeeding practices in rural Bangladesh."

Methods We obtained a random sample of 1038 tweets in two 4-week periods, before and after the UK Government’s announcement. Content analysis was used to examine the following Tweet characteristics: support for the policy, purpose, Twitter-user’s geographical location and affiliation, and evidence citation and quality. Chi-squared analyses were used to compare Tweet characteristics between the two periods. Results Overall, significantly more sampled Tweets were in favour of the policy (49%) in comparison to those opposed (19%). Yet, at Time 2, following the announcement, a greater proportion of sampled tweets opposed standardised packaging compared to the period sampled at Time 1, prior to the announcement (p<0.001). The quality of evidence and research cited in URLs linked at Time 2 was significantly lower than at Time 1 (p<0.001), with peer-reviewed research more likely to be shared in positive Tweets (p<0.001) and in Tweets linking to URLs originating from the health sector (p<0.001). The decline in the proportion of positive Tweets was mirrored by a reduction in Tweets by health sector Twitter-users at Time 2 (p<0.001). Conclusions Microblogging sites can reflect offline policy debates and are used differently by policy proponents and opponents dependent on the policy context. Twitter-users opposed to standardised packaging increased their activity following the Government’s announcement, while those in support broadly maintained their rate of Twitter engagement. The findings offer insight into the public health community’s options for using Twitter to influence policy and disseminate research. In particular, proliferation of Twitter activity following pro-public health policy announcements could be considered to ensure pro-health messages are not overshadowed by anti-regulation voices."
https://openalex.org/W2915639535,"The 2017 Australian and Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines recommend infants receive 30 minutes of tummy time daily. Currently, there are no validated objective measurement tools or devices to assess tummy time. The purpose of this study was to: 1) test the practicality of using devices on infants as an objective measure of tummy time, and 2) test the accuracy of developed algorithms and cut-points for predicting prone posture. Thirty-two healthy infants aged 4 to 25 weeks completed a protocol of 12 positions. Infants were placed in each position for 3 minutes while wearing a MonBaby (chest), GENEActiv (right hip) and two ActiGraphs (right hip and ankle). Direct observation was the criterion measure. The accuracy of the algorithms or cut-points to predict prone on floor, non-prone and prone supported positions were analyzed. Parents also completed a practicality questionnaire. Algorithms and cut-points to classify posture using devices from MonBaby, GENEActiv and ActiGraph (hip and ankle) were 79%, 95%, 90% and 88% accurate at defining tummy time and 100%, 98%, 100% and 96% accurate at defining non-prone positions, respectively. GENEActiv had the smallest mean difference and limits of agreement (-8.4s, limits of agreement [LoA]: -78.2 to 61.3s) for the prone on floor positions and ActiGraph Hip had the smallest mean difference and LoA for the non-prone positions (-0.2s, LoA: -1.2 to 0.9s). The majority of parents agreed all devices were practical and feasible to use with MonBaby being the preferred device. The evaluated algorithms and cut-points for GENEActiv and ActiGraph (hip) are of acceptable accuracy to objectively measure tummy time (time spent prone on floor). Accurate measurement of infant positioning practices will be important in the observation of 24-hour movement guidelines in the early years."

They also employ multiple mechanisms to preserve the integrity of their genomes. Nucleotide excision repair, a versatile repair mechanism, removes bulky DNA adducts from the genome. However, the dynamics of the capacity of nucleotide excision repair during stem cell differentiation remain unclear. Here, using immunoslot blot assay, we measured repair rates of UV-induced DNA damage during differentiation of human embryonic carcinoma (NTERA-2) cells into neurons and muscle cells. Our results revealed that the capacity of nucleotide excision repair increases as cell differentiation progresses. We also found that inhibition of the apoptotic signaling pathway has no effect on nucleotide excision repair capacity. Furthermore, RNA-Seq–based transcriptomic analysis indicated that expression levels of four core repair factors, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group A (XPA), XPC, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1, are progressively up-regulated during differentiation, but not those of replication protein A (RPA) and transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). Together, our findings reveal that increase of nucleotide excision repair capacity accompanies cell differentiation, supported by the up-regulated transcription of genes encoding DNA repair enzymes during differentiation of two distinct cell lineages.

We obtained 538 rectal swabs from pigs, chickens and ducks in 5 provinces during 2015 and 2016. C. difficile isolates were characterized by detection of toxin genes, multilocus sequence typing and ribotyping. And antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method. Out of 538 samples, 44 (8.2%) were C. difficile positive with high prevalence in pigs (n = 31). Among these, 39 (88.6%) were toxigenic including 14 (31.8%) that were A+B+CDT+ and 13 (29.5%) A+B+. The remaining 12 (27.3%) were A-B+. We identified 7 ST types and 6 PCR ribotypes. The most predominant type was ST11/RT078 with toxin profile A+B+CDT+ and all were isolated from piglets with diarrhea. ST109 isolates possessed two different toxigenic profiles (A-B-CDT- and A-B+CDT-) and although it was not the most prevalent sequence type, but it was widely distributed between chickens, ducks and pigs in the 5 provinces. All C. difficile isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin, metronidazole, fidaxomicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate and meropenem but retained resistance to 4 or 5 of the remaining antibiotics, especially cefotaxime, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin. The RT078/ST11 isolates were simultaneously resistant to cefotaxime, tetracycline, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. This is the first report of the molecular epidemiology of C. difficile isolated from food animals in China. We identified the epidemic strain RT078/ST11 as the predominate isolate among the animals we screened in our study."
https://openalex.org/W2915583832,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a contagious neurotropic herpesvirus responsible for oral lesions and herpesviral encephalitis. The HSV-1 envelope contains N-glycosylated proteins involved in infection and that are candidate drug targets. NGI-1 is a small-molecule inhibitor of oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complexes STT3A-OST and STT3B-OST, which catalyze cotranslational and post-translational N-glycosylation, respectively. Because host OSTs attach HSV-1 glycans, NGI-1 might have anti–HSV-1 activity. We evaluated HSV-1 function using NGI-1 and human embryonic kidney 293 knockout lines for OST isoform-specific catalytic and accessory subunits. N-glycosylation of 2 representative envelope proteins (gC and gD) was primarily dependent upon STT3A-OST, but to a large extent replaceable by STT3B-OST. Knockouts impairing STT3A- or STT3B-OST activity, by themselves, did not appreciably affect HSV-1 function (plaque-forming units, normalized to viral particles measured by unglycosylated capsid protein VP5 content). However, with cells lacking STT3B-OST activity (missing the catalytic subunit STT3B or the oxidoreductase subunits magnesium transporter 1/tumor suppressor candidate 3) and thus solely dependent upon STT3A-OST for N-glycosylation, NGI-1 treatment resulted in HSV-1 having cell type–dependent dysfunction (affecting infectivity with Vero cells much more than with the 293 lines). Ablation of post-translational N-glycosylation can therefore make HSV-1 infectivity, and possibly masking of immunogenic peptide epitopes by glycans, highly sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of cotranslational N-glycosylation.—Lu, H., Cherepanova, N.

https://openalex.org/W2917079697,"Calmodulin (CaM) conveys intracellular Ca2+ signals to KCNQ (Kv7, “M-type”) K+ channels and many other ion channels. Whether this “calmodulation” involves a dramatic structural rearrangement or only slight perturbations of the CaM/KCNQ complex is as yet unclear. A consensus structural model of conformational shifts occurring between low nanomolar and physiologically high intracellular [Ca2+] is still under debate. Here, we used various techniques of biophysical chemical analyses to investigate the interactions between CaM and synthetic peptides corresponding to the A and B domains of the KCNQ4 subtype. We found that in the absence of CaM, the peptides are disordered, whereas Ca2+/CaM imposed helical structure on both KCNQ A and B domains. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that Ca2+/CaM has higher affinity for the B domain than for the A domain of KCNQ2–4 and much higher affinity for the B domain when prebound with the A domain. X-ray crystallography confirmed that these discrete peptides spontaneously form a complex with Ca2+/CaM, similar to previous reports of CaM binding KCNQ-AB domains that are linked together. Microscale thermophoresis and heteronuclear single-quantum coherence NMR spectroscopy indicated the C-lobe of Ca2+-free CaM to interact with the KCNQ4 B domain (Kd ∼10–20 μ m ), with increasing Ca2+ molar ratios shifting the CaM-B domain interactions via only the CaM C-lobe to also include the N-lobe. Our findings suggest that in response to increased Ca2+, CaM undergoes lobe switching that imposes a dramatic mutually induced conformational fit to both the proximal C terminus of KCNQ4 channels and CaM, likely underlying Ca2+-dependent regulation of KCNQ gating."
https://openalex.org/W2915416263,"Very little is known about how lipid signaling regulates intima hyperplasia after vascular injury. Herein, we report that deletion and pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD)2, which generates the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA), reduced neointimal formation in the mouse carotid artery ligation model. PLD2 deficiency inhibits migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into the intima in mice as well as migration and formation of membrane ruffles in primary VSMCs. PA specifically binds to the IQ motif-containing guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) scaffold protein. The binding between PA and IQGAP is required for the plasma membrane recruitment of IQGAP1. Similar to PLD2 inhibition, knockdown of IQGAP1 blocks ruffle formation and migration in VSMCs, which are rescued by expression of the exogenous IQGAP1 but not the PA binding-deficient mutant. These data reveal that the PLD2-PA-IQGAP1 pathway plays an important role in VSMC migration and injury-induced vascular remodeling, and implicate PLD2 as a candidate target for therapeutic interventions.-Wang, Z., Cai, M., Tay, L.

https://openalex.org/W2916097017,"Ether-a-go-go family (EAG) channels play a major role in many physiological processes in humans, including cardiac repolarization and cell proliferation. Cryo-EM structures of two of them, KV10.1 and human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG or KV11.1), have revealed an original nondomain-swapped structure, suggesting that the mechanism of voltage-dependent gating of these two channels is quite different from the classical mechanical-lever model. Molecular aspects of hERG voltage-gating have been extensively studied, indicating that the S4-S5 linker (S4-S5L) acts as a ligand binding to the S6 gate (S6 C-terminal part, S6T) and stabilizes it in a closed state. Moreover, the N-terminal extremity of the channel, called N-Cap, has been suggested to interact with S4-S5L to modulate channel voltage-dependent gating, as N-Cap deletion drastically accelerates hERG channel deactivation. In this study, using COS-7 cells, site-directed mutagenesis, electrophysiological measurements, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we addressed whether these two major mechanisms of voltage-dependent gating are conserved in KV10.2 channels. Using cysteine bridges and S4-S5L–mimicking peptides, we show that the ligand/receptor model is conserved in KV10.2, suggesting that this model is a hallmark of EAG channels. Truncation of the N-Cap domain, Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, or both in KV10.2 abolished the current and altered channel trafficking to the membrane, unlike for the hERG channel in which N-Cap and PAS domain truncations mainly affected channel deactivation.

We hypothesized that molecular mechanisms of gating identified in hERG may apply to the closely related KV10 channels. In the heart, deactivation of hERG channels (closing of the activation gate) is slow, allowing a major role for this channel in the late repolarization phase of the action potential. In this channel, two mechanisms have been shown to play a major role in the deactivation process. First, hERG deactivation is due to a voltage-dependent interaction between the S4-S5 region, including the S4-S5 linker and a part of S5 (named S4-S5L, Fig. 1A) and the C-terminal part of the S6 segment (named here S6T), which is the activation gate (14Ferrer T.

In other words, at resting potentials, S4-S5L (the ligand) is bound to the S6T gate (the receptor) and locks it in a closed state (as shown in Fig. 1B, left). Upon membrane depolarization, S4 drags S4-S5L out of the S6T gate, and the channel opens (Fig. 1B, middle). Upon repolarization S4-S5L binds to the S6T gate and channel deactivates (back to Fig. 1B, left). Here, using two distinct approaches, we observe that this ligand/receptor mechanism, which we originally proposed for hERG, is conserved in KV10.2 (15Malak O.A. Es-Salah-Lamoureux Z.

These observations suggested that the N-Cap and/or the PAS domains regulate channel deactivation by modulating S4-S5L and S6T interaction. In KV10.2, we show that the eag domain presents quite different functions. Deletions of the N-Cap and PAS domains, separately or altogether, completely abolish channel activity, at least partially due to a defect in membrane trafficking. In conclusion, we show that slowing activating channels follow an allosteric model, in which the voltage sensor and pore domains are weakly coupled, via a ligand, S4-S5L and a receptor, S6T. In KV10.2, such coupling is not modulated by the eag domain, as proposed for hERG (20de la Peña P. Alonso-Ron C. Machín A. Fernández-Trillo J. Carretero L. Domínguez P. Barros F.

First, Ferrer and collaborators, observed that introduction of a cysteine in S4-S5L (D540C) and another cysteine in S6T (L666C) locks the channel in a closed state in oxidative conditions. This was associated to a restricted movement of the voltage sensor in a oxidative condition, as measured by gating currents, suggesting the formation of a disulfide bridge (14Ferrer T. Rupp J.

Also, mutagenesis experiments on hERG suggested electrostatic interaction between Asp-540 and Leu-666 playing a major role in hERG voltage-dependent gating (22Tristani-Firouzi M. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. Interactions between S4-S5 linker and S6 transmembrane domain modulate gating of HERG K+ channels.J. Biol.

Such observations suggest that in the WT hERG channel, specific interactions between S4-S5L and the activation gate (S6T) stabilize the closed channel. In transfected COS-7 cells, we could reproduce the experiments originally done by Ferrer and collaborators (14Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M. The S4-S5 linker directly couples voltage sensor movement to the activation gate in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel.J. Biol.

Moreover we could observe that a S4-S5L mimicking peptide inhibits the hERG channel, suggesting a ligand/receptor model, in which S4-S5L, directly under the control of the voltage sensor S4, binds to S6T to lock the channel in a closed state (see Fig. 1B, right). To check whether KV10.2 channels follow the same voltage-gating mechanism as hERG channels, we aligned the amino acid sequences of the two channels, and mutated to a cysteine Asp-339 and Met-474 in KV10.2, corresponding to hERG positions in which cysteines were previously introduced: Asp-540 in S4-S5L and Leu-666 in S6T (14Ferrer T.

As for the hERG double cysteine mutant, a 2-h application of 0.2 mm tert-butylhydroperoxide (tbHO2) led to an almost complete inhibition of the D339C/M474C KV10.2 channel current (Fig. 2, A and B). Knowing the high homology between hERG and KV10.2 (65%), we supposed that D339C and M474C in KV10.2 also form a disulfide bridge in oxidative conditions, as a cause of the drastic current reduction. As control experiments, 0.2 mm tbHO2 application had no effect on tail current amplitude when only one (D339C or M474C KV10.2) or none (WT KV10.2) of the two cysteines was introduced (Fig. 2, C–H) and activation curves showed a similar shift in all conditions (Fig. S1). Because a 2-h tbHO2 application represents a slow time course for a putative disulfide bridge formation, we also applied a higher concentration of tbHO2 (2 mm) for a shorter time. As in the Ferrer study (14Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M.

This inhibition was reversed by 10 mm DTT, as in the Ferrer study on hERG (14Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M.

We chose the E343C/M474C KV10.2 channel, because Glu-343, in S4-S5L, is aligned with Glu-544 in hERG, which when mutated to a cysteine together with L666C in hERG S6T (Fig. 1A), also lead to channel inhibition, suggesting the formation of a disulfide bridge (15Malak O.A.

We observed an inhibition of the current after 15 min incubation of 2 mm tbHO2, which is reversed by 10 mm DTT (Fig. 4, A and B). Control experiments showed no effect either on tail current amplitude or on the activation curve when only one (E343C or M474C KV10.2) or none (WT KV10.2) of the two cysteines was introduced (Fig. 4, C–H, Fig. S2). Altogether, these observations confirmed that two different disulfide bridges created between the two introduced cysteines in S4-S5L and S6T locks KV10.2 in a closed state, as in hERG (14Ferrer T.

Rep. 2017; 7 (28273916): 11310.1038/s41598-017-00155-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed that (i) co-expressing a hERG S4-S5L mimicking peptide with hERG channel partially inhibited the generated current and (ii) covalently binding this peptide to the hERG channel completely inhibited it (15Malak O.A. Es-Salah-Lamoureux Z. Loussouarn G. hERG S4-S5 linker acts as a voltage-dependent ligand that binds to the activation gate and locks it in a closed state.Sci.

These observations suggest that in hERG channels, S4-S5L rather acts as a voltage-controlled ligand that binds to the S6T gate and stabilizes it in the closed state (Fig. 1B, left, for the endogenous interaction and B, right, for the mimicking peptide). This mechanism of gating is consistent with Ferrer et al. (14Ferrer T. Rupp J. Piper D.R. Tristani-Firouzi M. The S4-S5 linker directly couples voltage sensor movement to the activation gate in the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channel.J. Biol.

Using the alignment between hERG and KV10.2 (Fig. 1A), we designed the KV10.2 S4-S5L peptide from the position of the S4-S5L peptide sequence that was inhibiting the hERG channel (15Malak O.A. Es-Salah-Lamoureux Z. Loussouarn G. hERG S4-S5 linker acts as a voltage-dependent ligand that binds to the activation gate and locks it in a closed state.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (28273916): 11310.1038/s41598-017-00155-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Co-expressing the KV10.2 channel with its specific S4-S5L peptide led to a profound decrease in current density (more than 70%), with no shift in the activation curve, as observed for hERG (Fig. 5, A–E). As an additional control, co-expressing KV10.2 with a scramble S4-S5L peptide led to current density similar to the one observed in the absence of peptide (Fig. 5, A and B). Because the S4-S5L peptide is supposed to interfere with the gating, it may be intriguing that activating and tail currents are inhibited to the same extent, and that neither the activation curve, nor the activation kinetics are modified (Fig. 5, C–F). To address this issue, we used a kinetic model mimicking channel activity in the presence/absence of the peptide (Fig. 6), based on a previous model of KCNE1–KCNQ1 and S4-S5L peptide interaction (23Choveau F.S. Rodriguez N. Abderemane Ali F. Labro A.J. Rose T. Dahimène S. Boudin H. Le Hènaff C. Escande D. Snyders D.J. Charpentier F. Mérot J. Baró I. Loussouarn G. KCNQ1 channels voltage dependence through a voltage-dependent binding of the S4-S5 linker to the pore domain.J. Biol.

In the KCNE1–KCNQ1 model, the presence of the peptides was affecting the channel activation curve and activation kinetics. However, when constrained to KV10.2 kinetics, the model did not show any alteration of activation kinetics or steady-state activation (Fig. 6, B and C). This is because peptide binding and unbinding rates (0.02 and 0.04 s−1, respectively) are lower than channel opening/closing rates, because increasing these rates leads to alterations in channel activation kinetics and steady-state activation (Fig. 6, B and C). A peptide with similar binding/unbinding rates impact KCNE1–KCNQ1 channel activation curve and activation kinetics (23Choveau F.S. Rodriguez N. Abderemane Ali F. Labro A.J. Rose T. Dahimène S. Boudin H. Le Hènaff C. Escande D. Snyders D.J. Charpentier F. Mérot J. Baró I. Loussouarn G.

Altogether, these observations support the ligand/receptor model of voltage dependence in KV10 channels. The results described above suggest that in both KV10.2 and hERG channels, deactivation is due to S4-S5L binding to S6T and consequent stabilization of the closed state. It has been shown by several works that intracellular N-cap and PAS domains of hERG (shown in Fig. 7A for KV10.2, cf. alignment in Fig. S3) modulate channel deactivation kinetics. Most importantly truncated hERG channels missing N-Cap or the whole eag domain (N-Cap + PAS), when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, showed robust currents but a more than 5-fold acceleration in deactivation (16de la Peña P.

https://openalex.org/W2917668677,"Introduction Current evidence suggests that Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) has a limited role in the contemporary management of premature ejaculation (PE). Aim The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a new CBT for the PE called Sphincter Control Training (SCT) in combination with a masturbation aid device. Methods The present study included 35 patients’ that met diagnostic criteria for PE including intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) of ≤2 minutes and had a Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) score ≥11. Participants completed all phases of a randomized controlled clinical study with a parallel group design, which was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital Morales Meseguer of Murcia (Spain).The two treatment groups completed SCT over 7 weeks. The SCT consists of four different exercises and an educational session. Its objective is to provide patients with greater knowledge, awareness, and control of the external urethral sphincter. The only difference between groups was the use of a masturbation aid device called Flip Zero (TFZ-001) from the Japanese company Tenga Co., Ltd. Outcomes The main measure was the ""fold increase"" (FI) of the IELT, which was calculated using the geometric mean pre-treatment and post-treatment. In addition, Premature Ejaculation Profile PE was used as a secondary measure. Results The geometric mean of the measurements corresponding to the 7 weeks of treatment was calculated, and both groups were compared by means of an ANCOVA test, finding a statistically significant difference (F: 10.51, 1; p = .003) in the increase experienced by subjects in the group with the device (GWD) mean = 166.63, SD = 106.54) compared with that experienced by subjects in the group without device (GWtD) (mean = 86.99, SD = 59.98).Using Student's t-test, the Fold increase (FI) corresponding to both groups were compared. The results showed statistically significant differences (p = .008) between the measurements corresponding to the GWtD (1.38 (0.50)) and those relative to the GWD (2.69 (1.81)) Clinical implications The FI in the GWD at the end of the trial allow us to consider this new CBT as a potential and viable PE treatment alternative. No side effects were observed in either treatment group and it required little therapeutic input and no partner involvement. Strengths & limitations The main limitation of this study is the lack of a 3- to 6-month follow-up of the treatment and placebo control. Conclusions This SCT exercise program combined with the use of a masturbation device shows promise because has numerous advantages in relation to current recommended treatments in patients with PE."
https://openalex.org/W2917940816,"Fusarium virguliforme is a soil borne root pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]. Once the fungus invades the root xylem tissues, the pathogen secretes toxins that cause chlorosis and necrosis in foliar tissues leading to defoliation, flower and pod drop and eventually death of plants. Resistance to F. virguliforme in soybean is partial and governed by over 80 quantitative trait loci (QTL). We have conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) for a group of 254 plant introductions lines using a panel of approximately 30,000 SNPs and identified 19 single nucleotide polymorphic loci (SNPL) that are associated with 14 genomic regions encoding foliar SDS and eight SNPL associated with seven genomic regions for root rot resistance. Of the identified 27 SNPL, six SNPL for foliar SDS resistance and two SNPL for root rot resistance co-mapped to previously identified QTL for SDS resistance. This study identified 13 SNPL associated with eight novel genomic regions containing foliar SDS resistance genes and six SNPL with five novel regions for root-rot resistance. This study identified five genes carrying nonsynonymous mutations: (i) three of which mapped to previously identified QTL for foliar SDS resistance and (ii) two mapped to two novel regions containing root rot resistance genes. Of the three genes mapped to QTL for foliar SDS resistance genes, two encode LRR-receptors and third one encodes a novel protein with unknown function. Of the two genes governing root rot resistance, Glyma.01g222900.1 encodes a soybean-specific LEA protein and Glyma.10g058700.1 encodes a heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase. In the LEA protein, a conserved serine residue was substituted with asparagine; and in the heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, a conserved histidine residue was substituted with an arginine residue. Such changes are expected to alter functions of these two proteins regulated through phosphorylation. The five genes with nonsynonymous mutations could be considered candidate SDS resistance genes and should be suitable molecular markers for breeding SDS resistance in soybean. The study also reports desirable plant introduction lines and novel genomic regions for enhancing SDS resistance in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W2916586339,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF), an important cause of thromboembolic events, is often silent and intermittent, thus presenting a diagnostic challenge. The aim of this study was to assess whether the plasma level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is related to the presence of AF and thereby might be used to facilitate screening programs for AF in primary care. Methods This was a cross sectional screening study. A population of 70–74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary care center in Stockholm were invited to AF screening. Intermittent ECG recording, 30 seconds twice a day using a hand-held device over 2 weeks, was offered to participants without previously known AF. Of the 324 participating persons, 34 patients had already known AF and 16 new cases of AF were detected by screening. Plasma NT-proBNP was measured in patients with previously known AF, newly detected AF, and 53 control participants without AF. Findings The median NT-proBNP was 697 ng/L in patients with previously known AF, 335 ng/L in new cases of AF, and 146 ng/L in patients without AF. After adjustment for several clinical variables and morbidities, the differences of median NT-proBNP levels were statistically significant between cases of previously known AF and new cases of AF as well as between new cases of AF and those without AF. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve of detection of new AF was 0.68 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.79) yielding a cut-off point of 124 ng/L with 75% sensitivity, 45% specificity, and 86% negative predictive value. Conclusions The NT-proBNP plasma levels among patients with known AF are higher than those with newly detected AF, and the latter have higher levels than those without AF. Therefore NT-proBNP might be a useful screening marker for the detection of AF and its persistence."

Though being prioritized in the national HIV response, it would be relevant to generate statistics on the number of FSWs in order to guide HIV interventions among FSWs. Our objective was to estimate the size of FSWs within hotspots of Cameroon. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from September-November 2015 in selected cities in Cameroon: Bafoussam, Bamenda, Bertoua, Buea, Douala, Kribi, Limbé, and Yaoundé. A programmatic mapping was used, consisting of interviews with secondary key informants (KI) to identify hotspots of FSWs and their respective estimated numbers. Validation of size estimates was done by interviews with FSW at each hotspot. Size estimations in the councils mapped were extended to others not mapped using a Poisson regression model. Results A total of 2,194 hotspots were identified: Douala (760), Yaoundé (622), Bamenda (263), Bafoussam (194), Kribi (154), Bertoua (140), Limbé (35), and Buea (26). The estimated total number (range) of FSWs was 21,124 (16,079–26,170), distributed per city as follows: Douala 7,557 (5,550–9,364), Yaoundé 6,596 (4,712–8,480), Bafoussam 2,458 (1,994–2,923), Bamenda 1,975 (1,605–2,345), Kribi 1,121 (832–1,408), Bertoua 1,044 (891–1,198), Buea 225 (185–266), and Limbé 148 (110–148). The variability of estimates among cities was also observed within the councils of each city. The national predicted estimate of FSW population was 112,580 (103,436–121,723), covering all councils of Cameroon. An estimate of 1.91% (112,580/5,881,526; 0.47%-3.36%) adult female population in Cameroon could be sex workers. Conclusion There are considerable numbers of FSW in major cities in Cameroon. There is a need to prioritize interventions for HIV prevention toward this population in order to limit the burden of HIV sexual transmission nationwide."
https://openalex.org/W2915453541,"This study aims to clarify the relationship between task constraints and the preparatory movement of fast-pitch softball batters in Japan for three different competition categories, namely high school, college, and league. As task constraints, we focused on the temporal and tool constraints and evaluated preparatory movements using initiation time and step duration of the stepping movement in a striking action. First, we confirmed the temporal constraints in each category and then examined the relationship between the temporal constraints and the stepping movements. The results demonstrated that the temporal constraints affected both initiation time and step duration of the stepping movements. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to the two variables. Consequently, the stepping movement of the softball players was classified into three types: ""late initiation-short duration"" (LS), ""early initiation-short duration"" (ES), and ""early initiation-long duration"" (EL) corresponding to the task constraints. Finally, the relationship between the task constraints of each category and the stepping movements was examined. The results revealed that high school players exhibited mostly the LS- or EL-type stepping movement; college players exhibited mostly the EL-type stepping movement; and league players exhibited all types. These results depict that the players in each category with each temporal and tool constraint exhibited particular types of stepping movements as a preparatory movement corresponding to each task constraint, thereby arguing that players use a not-to-lose strategy exploiting the redundancy in solutions under various task constraints."

Lytic factors, especially secreted proteases, are capable of modulating tissue invasion, thereby aggravating host susceptibility. Despite the important role of exoproteins during infection, the exoproteomic data on Histomonas meleagridis are non-existent. The present study employed traditional 1D-in-gel-zymography (1D-IGZ) and micro-LC-ESI-MS/MS (shotgun proteomics), to investigate H. meleagridis exoproteomes, obtained from a clonal virulent and an attenuated strain. Both strains were maintained as mono-eukaryotic monoxenic cultures with Escherichia coli. We demonstrated active in vitro secretion kinetics of proteases by both parasite strains, with a widespread proteolytic activity ranging from 17 kDa to 120 kDa. Based on protease inhibitor susceptibility assay, the majority of proteases present in both exoproteomes belonged to the family of cysteine proteases and showed stronger activity in the exoproteome of a virulent H. meleagridis. Shotgun proteomics, aided by customized database search, identified 176 proteins including actin, potential moonlighting glycolytic enzymes, lytic molecules such as pore-forming proteins (PFPs) and proteases like cathepsin-L like cysteine protease. To quantify the exoproteomic differences between the virulent and the attenuated H. meleagridis cultures, a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical spectra mass spectrometric (SWATH-MS) approach was applied. Surprisingly, results showed most of the exoproteomic differences to be of bacterial origin, especially targeting metabolism and locomotion. By deciphering such molecular signatures, novel insights into a complex in vitro protozoan- bacteria relationship were elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2915111376,"Maintenance of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with stable genome is important for their future use in cell replacement therapy and disease modeling. Our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining genomic stability of hESC and our ability to modulate them is essential in preventing unwanted mutation accumulation during their in vitro cultivation. In this study, we show the DNA damage response mechanism in hESCs is composed of known, yet unlikely components. Clustered oxidative base damage is converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by base excision repair (BER) and then quickly repaired by ligase (Lig)3-mediated end-joining (EJ). If there is further induction of clustered oxidative base damage by irradiation, then BER-mediated DSBs become essential in triggering the checkpoint response in hESCs. hESCs limit the mutagenic potential of Lig3–mediated EJ by DNA break end protection involving p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), which results in fast and error-free microhomology-mediated repair and a low mutant frequency in hESCs. DSBs in hESCs are also repaired via homologous recombination (HR); however, DSB overload, together with massive end protection by 53BP1, triggers competition between error-free HR and mutagenic nonhomologous EJ.—Kohutova, A., Raška, J., Kruta, M., Seneklova, M., Barta, T., Fojtik, P., Jurakova, T., Walter, C.

The evolutionarily conserved JmjC protein; Myc Induced Nuclear Antigen (Mina) has been shown to repress IL4, a key Th2 cytokine, suggesting Mina may negatively regulate nematode expulsion. Here we report that expulsion of the parasitic nematode Trichuris muris was indeed accelerated in Mina deficient mice. Unexpectedly, this was associated not with an elevated Th2- but rather an impaired Th1-type response. Further reciprocal bone marrow chimera and conditional KO experiments demonstrated that retarded parasite expulsion and a normal Th1-type response both required Mina in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Transcriptional profiling experiments in IECs revealed anti-microbial α-defensin peptides to be the major target of Mina-dependent retention of worms in infected mice. In vitro exposure to recombinant α-defensin peptides caused cytotoxic damage to whipworms. These results identify a latent IEC-intrinsic anthelmintic pathway actively constrained by Mina and point to α-defensins as important effectors that together with Mina may be attractive therapeutic targets for the control of nematode infection."
https://openalex.org/W2916652146,"Adopting a proper topology is crucial for transmembrane proteins to perform their functions. We previously reported that ceramide regulates a transmembrane protein called TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L six family member 20) through topological inversion by altering the direction through which the protein is translocated across membranes during translation. This regulatory mechanism, denoted regulated alternative translocation (RAT), depends on a GXXXN motif present in the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that Asn-26 in the motif is crucial for RAT of TM4SF20, as it cannot be replaced even by Gln. In contrast, Gly-22 in the motif could be substituted by other small residues such as Ala and Ser without affecting RAT of TM4SF20. We further demonstrate that the GXXXN motif alone is insufficient to induce RAT of a transmembrane protein because TM4SF4, a relative of TM4SF20 that also contains the motif in the first transmembrane helix, did not undergo RAT. Using TM4SF40–TM4SF20 chimeras, we identified Pro-29 of TM4SF20 as another important element required for RAT of the protein. Substituting Pro-29 alone did not affect RAT of TM4SF20, whereas replacing Pro-29 together with either Leu-25 or Val-17 of TM4SF20 with the corresponding residues of TM4SF4 abolished RAT of TM4SF20. Because Val-17, Gly-22, Leu-25, Asn-26, and Pro-29 are predicted to reside along the same surface of the transmembrane helix, our results suggest that interactions with other proteins mediated by this surface during translocation may be critical for RAT of TM4SF20.

Unlike cytosolic and nuclear proteins, segments of transmembrane proteins located at either side of membranes are exposed to different environments. Thus, the topology of transmembrane proteins, which depicts orientation of their segments at either side of membranes, is crucial for the function of these proteins. In eukaryotic cells, the topology of polytopic membrane proteins is primarily determined during their translation by the direction through which the first transmembrane helix is translocated across membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumTM4SF20transmembrane 4 L six family member 20RATregulated alternative translocationTM4SF4transmembrane 4 L six family member 4CREB3L1cAMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1PNGase Fpeptide N-glycosidase FTRAM2translocating chain-associated membrane protein 2TLC domainTRAM/LAG1/CLN8 homology domainTRAM1translocating chain-associated membrane protein 1GPCRG protein-coupled receptor.

We recently reported that ceramide regulates a polytopic transmembrane protein called TM4SF20 (transmembrane 4 L six family member 20) by inverting the topology of the protein (2Chen Q. Denard B.

In the absence of ceramide, the N-terminal end of the first transmembrane helix is inserted into ER lumen, producing TM4SF20(A), which inhibits proteolytic activation of a membrane-bound transcription factor called CREB3L1 (cAMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1) (2Chen Q.

Accumulation of ceramide or related sphingolipids inverts the direction through which the first transmembrane helix is inserted into the ER, leading to production of TM4SF20(B) in which the N-terminal end of the transmembrane helix is located at cytosol (2Chen Q.

Because this regulatory mechanism does not flip TM4SF20 that has already been synthesized but inverts the topology of the newly synthesized protein by changing the direction through which the first transmembrane helix is translocated across membranes, we designated this process as regulated alternative translocation (RAT) (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

We then determined that RAT of TM4SF20 relies on a GXXXN motif present in the first transmembrane helix of the protein, as mutating either the Gly-22 or Asn-26 in the motif to leucine completely abolished the topological regulation, causing the protein to be locked into TM4SF20(B) regardless of the presence of ceramide (2Chen Q.

In the current study, we performed more detailed analyses on this motif. Our data indicate that the presence of a G/A/SXXXN motif in the first transmembrane helix is required but not sufficient to drive RAT of TM4SF20. The results suggest that the two critical residues in the motif along with other residues aligned with them at the same surface of the helix may interact with ER translocation machinery, and this interaction may be critical for RAT of TM4SF20. TM4SF20 contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, all located at the longest loop between the third and fourth transmembrane helix (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

These sites are glycosylated in TM4SF20(B), as the loop is within the ER lumen (Fig. 1A) (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

In contrast, these sites are not glycosylated in TM4SF20(A), as the loop is located at the cytosol (Fig. 1A) (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

This difference in glycosylation is one of the reasons why the apparent molecular weight of TM4SF20(B) is higher than that of TM4SF20(A) (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

A typical immunoblot analysis detecting the Myc epitope tagged at the C terminus of TM4SF20 was shown in Fig. 1B: in untreated cells, a band migrated close to the predicted molecular weight of TM4SF20(A) was detected (Fig. 1B lane 2). Treatment with C6-ceramide, a ceramide analogue that is converted to naturally existing ceramide inside cells (6Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Hannun Y.A. The sphingolipid salvage pathway in ceramide metabolism and signaling.Cell Signal. 2008; 20 (18191382): 1010-101810.1016/j.cellsig.2007.12.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), led to production of TM4SF20(B) with a higher molecular weight (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The residual TM4SF20(A) remained in these cells (Fig. 1B, lane 3) was synthesized before the ceramide treatment (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

In addition to ceramide-regulated TM4SF20(A) and TM4SF20(B), we also detected another form of the protein with a molecular weight slightly lower than that of TM4SF20(B), the presence of which was not affected by ceramide treatment (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Although fallen short of revealing the molecular identity of the protein, our previous study demonstrated that this form of TM4SF20 was glycosylated, and it can only be detected with epitopes tagged at the C but not N terminus of the protein (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

A plausible explanation for these results is that this unknown isoform could be an N terminally-truncated TM4SF20 synthesized from a downstream internal translation initiation site. After the first methionine, the next possible translation initiation sites could be closely positioned Met-61, Met-68, and Met-84. The protein produced from these internal translation initiation sites should not contain the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20, which is crucial to make the protein to adopt a topology consistent with TM4SF20(A) (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 (27499293): 567-57810.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, this truncated protein is expected to be locked into the topology of TM4SF20(B) regardless of the presence of ceramide. This hypothesis could explain why the apparent molecular weight of the unknown form of TM4SF20 is smaller than that of TM4SF20(B), why the protein is glycosylated, and why expression of the protein is not regulated by ceramide. To test this hypothesis, we transfected cells with plasmids encoding various N terminally-truncated mutants of TM4SF20 tagged with Myc at the C terminus, and detected expression of the proteins by immunoblot analysis with anti-Myc. Deleting the first methionine (ΔM1) abolished expression of TM4SF20(A) and TM4SF20(B) but not this unknown form of TM4SF20 (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that this protein was not initiated from the first methionine. The same result was obtained for TM4SF20 initiated from M61(Δ1–60) or M68(Δ1–67) (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–9). In contrast, the molecular weight of the truncated TM4SF20 initiated from M84(Δ1–83) was slightly smaller than that of the unknown form of the protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 10 and 11). These results suggest that the unknown form of TM4SF20 was initiated from an internal methionine N-terminal to Met-84. We thus designate this form of the protein as TM4SF20(i) to reflect its initiation from an internal start codon. To further characterize TM4SF20(i), we mutated the two potential internal initiation codons at Met-61 and Met-68 to alanine. Although mutating either methionine did not affect migration of TM4SF20(i) on immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–7), mutating both residues reduced the molecular weight of TM4SF20(i) to that of TM4SF20(Δ1–83) (Fig. 1C, lanes 8 and 9). TM4SF20(i) almost disappeared when Met-61, -68, and -84 were all mutated to alanine (Fig. 1C, lanes 10 and 11). These results suggest that TM4SF20(i) is a N terminally-truncated protein, the translation of which is initiated from a cluster of methionines between the second and third transmembrane domain, namely Met-61, Met-68, and Met-84. We previously reported that a GXXXN motif present in the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 is crucial for the topological regulation of TM4SF20, as mutating either one of the two critical residues in the motif to leucine (G22L or N26L) completely blocked RAT of the protein, locking the topology of the protein into TM4SF20(B) regardless of the presence of ceramide (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 (27499293): 567-57810.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To gain more insights into this motif, we mutated Gly-22 and Asn-26 to other residues. Although substituting Gly-22 to other smaller residues such as Ala and Ser did not affect RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–8), replacing it with a larger residue such as Thr or Val completely inhibited RAT of TM4SF20 just like G22L, causing production of only B but not A form of the protein regardless of ceramide treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–14). In contrast to Gly-22, the requirement of Asn-26 for RAT of TM4SF20 appears to be more stringent, as replacing Asn to other polar or nonpolar residues such as Ala, Leu, Ser, or Gln all abolished RAT of the protein (Fig. 2B). TM4SF20 belongs to a family of proteins that contain four transmembrane domains (7Wright M.D. Ni J. Rudy G.B. The L6 membrane proteins: a new four-transmembrane superfamily.Protein Sci. 2000; 9 (10975581): 1594-160010.1110/ps.9.8.1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Within this family, TM4SF4 is another protein that contains a GXXXN motif in the first transmembrane domain. We thus decided to determine whether TM4SF4 is subjected to ceramide-induced topological inversion through RAT. Similar to TM4SF20, TM4SF4 has two predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the loop between the third and fourth transmembrane helix. Thus, if TM4SF4 behaves similarly to TM4SF20 undergoing ceramide-induced RAT, we expect the protein to be unglycosylated in untreated cells, but become glycosylated in cells treated with ceramide (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, TM4SF4 was glycosylated regardless of ceramide treatment, as treatment with PNGase F, an endoglycosidase that removes N-linked glycan, reduced the apparent molecular weight of the protein in either condition (Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6). In contrast to PNGase F, endoglycosidase H, another endoglycosidase that trims N-linked sugars from proteins localized in the ER but not those in the post-Golgi compartment (8Breitling J. Aebi M. N-Linked protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 (23751184): a013359Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), was only active for deglycosylation of TM4SF4 in ceramide-treated but not untreated cells (Fig. 3B, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5). These results suggest that trafficking but not topology of TM4SF4 is affected by ceramide, and TM4SF4 always adopts a topology consistent with that of TM4SF20(B) regardless of the presence of ceramide. We previously reported that the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 is required and sufficient to drive topological inversion of the protein in response to ceramide accumulation (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 (27499293): 567-57810.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that even though TM4SF4 contains a GXXXN motif, other elements in the transmembrane helix may prevent RAT of the protein. To test this hypothesis, we replaced the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 with the corresponding sequence of TM4SF4 (Fig. 4A). Unlike TM4SF20, the chimeric protein (chimera A in Fig. 4B) did not undergo RAT and was locked into the configuration of TM4SF20(B) regardless of ceramide treatment (Fig. 4C). To further narrow down the regions of TM4SF4 that block RAT, we divided the first transmembrane domain of the protein into four regions (Fig. 4A). Sequence alignment revealed that region 4 located at the C-terminal end of the transmembrane helix shared the least sequence homology between TM4SF4 and TM4SF20 (Fig. 4A). However, substituting residues of TM4SF20 in this region with that of TM4SF4 (chimera E, Fig. 4B) did not affect ceramide-induced RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 4D, lanes 11 and 12). Likewise, placing back residues of TM4SF20 in this region to the chimera in which the transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 was replaced by the corresponding sequence of TM4SF4 (chimera F, Fig. 4B) did not restore RAT of the protein (Fig. 4D, lanes 13 and 14). These results suggest that this region is not important for RAT of TM4SF20. Further chimeric analyses revealed that substituting residues of TM4SF20 in regions 1 or 2 by that of TM4SF4 (chimera B or C, Fig. 4B) barely affected RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 4D, lanes 5–8). Although replacing residues in region 3 of TM4SF20 with that of TM4SF4 alone (chimera D, Fig. 4B) partially impaired RAT of the protein (Fig. 4D, lanes 9 and 10), combining this substitution with that switching the residues in regions 1 or 2 (chimera G or H, Fig. 4B) completely abolished RAT of the protein (Fig. 4D, lanes 15–18). The results shown in Fig. 4 suggest that combining mutations in region 3 with that in regions 1 or 2 results in complete inhibition of RAT of TM4SF20. To identify the residues in region 3 that are important for RAT, we fixed the substitution in region 1 (chimera B, Fig. 4B), and then mutated each residue of TM4SF20 in region 3 to the corresponding residue of TM4SF4. This analysis revealed that only the P29L mutation under this circumstance completely inhibited RAT of the chimeric protein (Fig. 5A, lanes 8 and 9). These results suggest that Pro-29 in region 3 of TM4SF20 may also be important for RAT of the protein. We then sought to identify residues in region 1 supporting RAT of TM4SF20. For this purpose, we substituted each residue of TM4SF20 in region 1 with that of TM4SF4 on TM4SF20(P29L). Although P29L by itself did not affect RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 5B, lanes 5 and 6), combining this mutation with V17P but no other substitutions in region 1 abolished RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 5B, lanes 7–14). Under this circumstance, it appears that it was gaining a Pro but not losing a Val that resulted in inhibition of RAT, as mutating Val-17 to other residues such as Ala or Val did not affect RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 5C). Using the same strategy, we identified that it was the substitution of L25A in region 2 combined with the P29L mutation in region 3 resulted in inhibition of RAT of TM4SF20 (Fig. 5D). We previously reported that ceramide triggers topological inversion of TM4SF20 through RAT, and this process depends on a GXXXN motif present in the first transmembrane helix of the protein (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 (27499293): 567-57810.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we present more evidence that the first transmembrane helix is crucial for RAT. TM4SF20(i), another isoform of the protein, does not undergo RAT owing to the lack of the first transmembrane helix because its translation is initiated from a cluster of methionines between the second and third transmembrane domain. Interestingly, expression of TM4SF20(i) was significantly inhibited only when all three start codons were mutated in the mRNA encoding this section of the protein. This observation suggests that the mRNA surrounding these start codons lies within a strong internal translation initiation site so that translation of TM4SF20(i) can be started from either one of the in-frame start codons. This scenario may also explain why mutating all three start codons in this region markedly reduced but did not completely eliminate production of TM4SF20(i), as multiple non-AUG, noncanonical start codons (9Kearse M.G. Wilusz J.E. Non-AUG translation: a new start for protein synthesis in eukaryotes.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (28982758): 1717-173110.1101/gad.305250.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) present in this strong translation initiation site may still allow residual amounts of the protein to be produced. We also performed more mutational analyses on the GXXXN motif. Although the Gly-22 position can tolerate other small residues such as Ala or Ser without losing the topological regulation, Asn-26 appears to be very critical for RAT as it cannot even be replaced by Gln. These observations are supported by sequence alignment of TM4SF20 from various species, which demonstrates that Asn-26 is conserved across species, whereas Gly, Ala, or Ser can be found at position 22 of the human TM4SF20 (Fig. 6A). To gain structural insights into this motif, we used the structural data of the first transmembrane domain of the P2Y12 receptor (10Zhang J. Zhang K. Gao Z.-G. Paoletta S. Zhang D. Han G.W. Li T. Ma L. Zhang W. Müller C.E. Yang H. Jiang H. Cherezov V. Katritch V. Jacobson K.A. et al.Agonist-bound structure of the human P2Y12 receptor.Nature. 2014; 509 (24784220): 119-12210.1038/nature13288Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Zhang K. Zhang J.

This structural model predicts that Gly-22 is adjacent to Asn-26 at the same side of the transmembrane α-helix. A small side chain at position 22 may favor formation of a hydrogen bond between the backbone C = O group at this location and the Asn-26 side chain NH2 group (10Zhang J. Zhang K. Gao Z.-G. Paoletta S. Zhang D. Han G.W. Li T. Ma L. Zhang W. Müller C.E. Yang H. Jiang H. Cherezov V. Katritch V.

Van Galen P.J. Jacobson K.A. Modelling the P2Y purinoceptor using rhodopsin as template.Drug Des. Discov. 1995; 13 (8872457): 133-154PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). Formation of this hydrogen bond may orientate the side chain of Asn-26 for interaction with another protein during its translocation across ER membranes, and this interaction may be critical for RAT of TM4SF20. The energetic tendency for protein–protein interaction mediated by the asparagine residue in the GXXXN motif present in the center of a transmembrane helix has been reported previously (13Lear J.D. Gratkowski H. Adamian L. Liang J. DeGrado W.F. Position-dependence of stabilizing polar interactions of asparagine in transmembrane helical bundles.Biochemistry. 2003; 42 (12767221): 6400-640710.1021/bi020573jCrossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to Gly-22 and Asn-26, we identified Pro-29 as a residue important for RAT of TM4SF20. This finding is supported by the sequence alignment, as Pro-29 is also conserved in TM4SF20 across species (Fig. 6A). Unlike Gly-22 and Asn-26, replacing the proline residue at this position with leucine by itself did not affect RAT of TM4SF20. This mutation has to combine with other amino acid substitution within the transmembrane helix to disrupt the topological regulation. One of the mutations acting together with P29L to disrupt RAT is L25A. Given the conservation of Pro-29 within the TM4SF20 family, the presence of Pro-29 may induce a kink in the α-helix by disrupting the backbone hydrogen bond to be formed by Pro-29 and the neighboring Leu-25 in a transmembrane helix structure model (14Huang Y.H. Chen C.M. Statistical analyses and computational prediction of helical kinks in membrane proteins.J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2012; 26 (22996198): 1171-118510.1007/s10822-012-9607-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B, left). Although formation of this hydrogen bond may become possible with the P29L mutation, the influence of the neighboring Leu-25 side chain may still favor the native kinked helix conformation (15Langelaan D.N. Wieczorek M. Blouin C. Rainey J.K. Improved helix and kink characterization in membrane proteins allows evaluation of kink sequence predictors.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2010; 50 (21090591): 2213-222010.1021/ci100324nCrossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B, middle). The additional L25A mutation, in which the bulky side chain on Leu-25 was replaced by the smaller one of alanine, might allow straightening of the helix (Fig. 6B, right). If this explanation is correct, then the presence of this kink may also be a structural requirement for RAT. Another mutation acting together with P29L to disrupt RAT is V17P. Interestingly, Val-17, Gly-22, Leu-25, Asn-26, and Pro-29 are all located along the same surface of the transmembrane helix revealed by the net projection (Fig. 6C). We currently do not understand why combining the P29L mutation with V17P disrupts RAT of TM4SF20. Because it is gaining a proline rather than losing a valine at this position that blocked RAT of TM4SF20, it is likely that introducing a proline at this position may disrupt the helical surface formed by the residues described above. Taken together, our results suggest that a protein-interacting surface containing Val-17, Gly-22, Leu-25, Asn-26, and Pro-29 may bind to a component of ER translocon, and this interaction may be critical for RAT of TM4SF20. A candidate protein that may interact with the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 during its translocation is translocating chain-associated membrane protein 2 (TRAM2). We previously reported that knockdown of TRAM2 stimulated production of TM4SF20(B) even in the absence of ceramide (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J. Inverting the topology of a transmembrane protein by regulating the translocation of the first transmembrane helix.Mol.

TRAM2 is highly homologous to TRAM1, a component of ER translocon responsible for transporting nascent peptide chains across ER membranes during translation (16Görlich D. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. A protein of the endoplasmic reticulum involved early in polypeptide translocation.Nature. 1992; 357 (1315422): 47-5210.1038/357047a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Voigt S. Jungnickel B. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Signal sequence-dependent function of the TRAM protein during early phases of protein transport across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134 (8698819): 25-3510.1083/jcb.134.1.25Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). TRAM2 contains a TLC domain postulated to bind ceramide or related sphingolipids (18Winter E. Ponting C.P. TRAM, LAG1 and CLN8: members of a novel family of lipid-sensing domains?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27 (12151215): 381-38310.1016/S0968-0004(02)02154-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A possible explanation of these results is that in the absence of ceramide, TRAM2 interacts with the first transmembrane helix portion of the nascent peptide chain of TM4SF20, and this interaction enables an unusual translocation process by driving the sequence N-terminal to the transmembrane helix into the ER lumen to produce TM4SF20(A). Ceramide, through its potential binding with TRAM2, may block this interaction. In the absence of this interaction, the translocation goes through the default pathway by pushing the sequence C-terminal to the transmembrane helix into the ER lumen (19Rapoport T.A. Li L. Park E. Structural and mechanistic insights into protein translocation.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33 (28564553): 369-39010.1146/annurev-cellbio-100616-060439Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to produce TM4SF20(B). We have tried to disrupt RAT of TM4SF20 by substituting polar residues within transmembrane helices of TRAM2 that might interact with Asn-26 of TM4SF20 with leucine. Unfortunately, these efforts so far have been unsuccessful. More sophisticated analyses may be needed to uncover the biochemical interaction between the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 and ER translocon machinery that is critical for RAT of TM4SF20. Notably, all mutations we made in the first transmembrane helix of TM4SF20 that inhibited expression of TM4SF20(A) in the absence of ceramide increased synthesis of glycosylated TM4SF20(B) but not any other forms of the protein with a lower molecular weight. These results suggest that these mutations did not disrupt the first transmembrane helix, as in the absence of this transmembrane helix, the loop containing the glycosylation sites would have been exposed to cytosol, thereby producing an unglycosylated protein with a molecular weight lower than that of TM4SF20(B). Thus, the first transmembrane helix appeared to remain intact in these mutant proteins. Lipid-induced topological inversion has emerged as a novel mechanism to regulate transmembrane proteins both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (2Chen Q. Denard B. Lee C.-E. Han S. Ye J.S. Ye J.

To search for more mammalian proteins subjected to this regulation, we used bioinformatics analysis to look for proteins containing a GXXXN motif in the first transmembrane helix. This analysis revealed that this motif is enriched in the first transmembrane domain of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). We then identified one of these receptors, namely C-C chemokine receptor 5, which indeed undergoes ceramide-induced RAT. 3B. Denard, S. Han, J. Kim, E. M. Ross, and J. Ye, unpublished data. The current study demonstrates that TM4SF4, which also contains a GXXXN motif in the first transmembrane helix, is not subjected to topological inversion through RAT. Through various chimera between TM4SF20 and TM4SF4, we determined that no single amino acid substitution could explain the difference in topological regulation between the two proteins. Instead, it was the combined replacements of Pro-29 with Leu-25 or Val-17 of TM4SF20 with the corresponding residues of TM4SF4 that led to inactivation of RAT. However, placing Pro-29 and Val-17 back still failed to restore the topological regulation of the TM4SF20 chimera in which the rest of the residues in the first transmembrane helix were replaced by TM4SF4. 4J. Wang, unpublished data. Thus, in addition to the residues we have identified, combined substitutions of other residues of TM4SF20 with that of TM4SF4 may also block RAT of the fusion protein. Thus, sequence analysis alone may not be sufficient to predict transmembrane proteins subjected to RAT. Detailed biochemical analysis is required to demonstrate whether a transmembrane protein is subjected to topological regulation through RAT.

https://openalex.org/W2915698888,"Male circumcision (MC) reduces men's risk of contracting HIV by approximately 60% and has the potential to significantly alter HIV epidemics. However, MC does not significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission to women from a circumcised man. In Malawi, several researchers has examined the acceptability, accessibility and sexual behaviour change after circumcision in men but behaviour change in women following their partner's circumcision remains uncertain. In order to fully realise the protective benefits of MC against HIV, factors related to risky sexual behaviour is imperative as some studies have shown potentials of increased risky behaviour in men following voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). This study aimed to explore the perceptions and opinions of female school teachers and health workers on HIV-protective benefits of MC and its impact on risk compensatory behaviour among women in Malawi.We conducted a cross-sectional survey of women (N = 68) between May and June 2016 in three districts of southern Malawi. Risk compensatory behaviour was measured by number of sexual partners and use of protection during sex among female teachers and health care workers who are involved with educating people on benefits of VMMC. The bivariable analysis was conducted to test for association between HIV-protective benefits and risk compensatory behaviour. Purposive sampling was used to conduct eight qualitative in-depth interviews with women from the selected districts and the qualitative data was analysed thematically.The mean age of women who participated in the survey was 30 years. Most women (94.1%) correctly indicated that HIV-positive circumcised men can still infect their partner and approximately, 90% of were knowledgeable of risky sexual behaviour for HIV. However, 55.9% perceived MC can lead women to adopt risky sexual behaviour. On the contrary to this finding, qualitative data indicate women's misconceptions regarding their partners' circumcision and HIV-protective benefits. Most women expressed that risky sexual behaviour such as having multiple sexual partners and inconsistent or non-use of condoms can easily be observed among women if they learn of their partners' partial HIV-protective benefits circumcision.Exploring women's sexual behaviour change in the right of HIV-protective benefits of MC fills in a research knowledge important to public health. In-depth studies are therefore required to give more evidence that will guide the development of HIV risk-reduction interventions."

Conversely, S246→L and S246→M missense mutations, which reduce the ICPB in Xaa246-P247 in human β-catenin, can enhance interactions between β-catenin and APC and between β-catenin and E-cadherin, leading to decreased nuclear migration of β-catenin.

In response to the CXCR4 ligand stromal cell–derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12), MIM associates with RAS-related GTP-binding protein 7 (RAB7) 30 min after stimulation. However, RAB7′s role in MIM function remains undefined. Here we show that RNAi-mediated suppression of RAB7 expression in human HeLa cells has little effect on the binding of MIM to RAB5 and on the recruitment of CXCR4 to early endosomes but effectively abolishes MIM-mediated CXCR4 degradation, chemotactic response, and sorting into late endosomes and lysosomes. To determine whether I-BAR domain proteins interact with RAB7, we examined cells expressing insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (IRTKS), an I-BAR domain protein bearing an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. We observed that both MIM and IRTKS interact with RAB5 at an early response to SDF-1 and that IRTKS binds poorly to RAB7 but strongly to RAB11 at a later time point. Moreover, IRTKS overexpression reduced CXCR4 internalization and enhanced the chemotactic response to SDF-1. Interestingly, deletion of the SH3 domain in IRTKS abolished the IRTKS–RAB11 interaction and promoted CXCR4 degradation. Furthermore, the SH3 domain was required for selective targeting of MIM–IRTKS fusion proteins by both RAB7 and RAB11. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, our results provide first evidence that the SH3 domain is critical in the regulation of specific endocytic pathways by I-BAR domain proteins."

We investigated whether atherosclerotic plaque of the basilar artery (BA) can be identified in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Patients with acute ischemic stroke who had BA stenosis (""symptomatic BAA"") were retrospectively recruited using the prospective stroke registry. In the HRMR databank, subjects without BA stenosis were recruited and classified as those with silent plaque (""silent BAA"") and without any plaque (""normal controls""). Outer diameter of the BA and T2 plaque sign (an eccentric or complete obscuration of normal flow-void) within the BA were assessed by two blinded raters using conventional T2 MRI.Seventy-five patients with symptomatic BAA, 40 with asymptomatic BAA, and 36 normal controls were included in the study. Maximal BA diameter was significantly larger in symptomatic BAA patients with <30%, 30-50%, 50-70%, and >70% stenosis (all p<0.01 in each subgroup) and silent BAA subjects (p = 0.018) than controls. T2 plaque signs were present in 46 (61.3%) patients with symptomatic BAA and 6 (14.6%) subjects with asymptomatic BAA, while none in normal controls (p <0.001 and 0.057, respectively). Detection rates were increased with an increase in stenosis degree (25.0% in <30% stenosis, 57.9% in 30-50% stenosis, 38.5% in 50-70% stenosis, 92.3% in 70-99% stenosis, and 100.0% in occlusion).Our data suggest that BA atherosclerosis can be detected by conventional MRI. When the use of HRMR is limited, conventional MR imaging may give additive information to clinicians."
