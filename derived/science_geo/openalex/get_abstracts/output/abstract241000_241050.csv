https://openalex.org/W2169330513,"The human endogenous intestinal microflora is an essential ""organ"" in providing nourishment, regulating epithelial development, and instructing innate immunity; yet, surprisingly, basic features remain poorly described. We examined 13,355 prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene sequences from multiple colonic mucosal sites and feces of healthy subjects to improve our understanding of gut microbial diversity. A majority of the bacterial sequences corresponded to uncultivated species and novel microorganisms. We discovered significant intersubject variability and differences between stool and mucosa community composition. Characterization of this immensely diverse ecosystem is the first step in elucidating its role in health and disease."

https://openalex.org/W2094660330,"Microglial cells represent the immune system of the mammalian brain and therefore are critically involved in various injuries and diseases. Little is known about their role in the healthy brain and their immediate reaction to brain damage. By using in vivo two-photon imaging in neocortex, we found that microglial cells are highly active in their presumed resting state, continually surveying their microenvironment with extremely motile processes and protrusions. Furthermore, blood-brain barrier disruption provoked immediate and focal activation of microglia, switching their behavior from patroling to shielding of the injured site. Microglia thus are busy and vigilant housekeepers in the adult brain."

Dam-impacted catchments experience higher irrigation pressure and about 25 times more economic activity per unit of water than do unaffected catchments. In view of projected changes in climate and water resource use, these findings can be used to identify ecological risks associated with further impacts on large river systems."
https://openalex.org/W2049468624,"Here we provide global estimates of the seasonal flux of sediment, on a river-by-river basis, under modern and prehuman conditions. Humans have simultaneously increased the sediment transport by global rivers through soil erosion (by 2.3 +/- 0.6 billion metric tons per year), yet reduced the flux of sediment reaching the world's coasts (by 1.4 +/- 0.3 billion metric tons per year) because of retention within reservoirs. Over 100 billion metric tons of sediment and 1 to 3 billion metric tons of carbon are now sequestered in reservoirs constructed largely within the past 50 years. African and Asian rivers carry a greatly reduced sediment load; Indonesian rivers deliver much more sediment to coastal areas."

https://openalex.org/W2035571475,"Kai proteins globally regulate circadian gene expression of cyanobacteria. The KaiC phosphorylation cycle, which persists even without transcription or translation, is assumed to be a basic timing process of the circadian clock. We have reconstituted the self-sustainable oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation in vitro by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and adenosine triphosphate. The period of the in vitro oscillation was stable despite temperature change (temperature compensation), and the circadian periods observed in vivo in KaiC mutant strains were consistent with those measured in vitro. The enigma of the circadian clock can now be studied in vitro by examining the interactions between three Kai proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2022339063,"Ebola virus (EboV) causes rapidly fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and there is currently no effective treatment. We found that the infection of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells by vesicular stomatitis viruses bearing the EboV glycoprotein (GP) requires the activity of endosomal cysteine proteases. Using selective protease inhibitors and protease-deficient cell lines, we identified an essential role for cathepsin B (CatB) and an accessory role for cathepsin L (CatL) in EboV GP-dependent entry. Biochemical studies demonstrate that CatB and CatL mediate entry by carrying out proteolysis of the EboV GP subunit GP1 and support a multistep mechanism that explains the relative contributions of these enzymes to infection. CatB and CatB/CatL inhibitors diminish the multiplication of infectious EboV-Zaire in cultured cells and may merit investigation as anti-EboV drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2074378742,"Hearing relies on faithful synaptic transmission at the ribbon synapse of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs). At present, the function of presynaptic ribbons at these synapses is still largely unknown. Here we show that anchoring of IHC ribbons is impaired in mouse mutants for the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon. The lack of active-zone-anchored synaptic ribbons reduced the presynaptic readily releasable vesicle pool, and impaired synchronous auditory signalling as revealed by recordings of exocytic IHC capacitance changes and sound-evoked activation of spiral ganglion neurons. Both exocytosis of the hair cell releasable vesicle pool and the number of synchronously activated spiral ganglion neurons co-varied with the number of anchored ribbons during development. Interestingly, ribbon-deficient IHCs were still capable of sustained exocytosis with normal Ca2+-dependence. Endocytic membrane retrieval was intact, but an accumulation of tubular and cisternal membrane profiles was observed in ribbon-deficient IHCs. We conclude that ribbon-dependent synchronous release of multiple vesicles at the hair cell afferent synapse is essential for normal hearing."

The consequences of tau pathology were investigated here by proteomics followed by functional analysis. Mainly metabolism-related proteins including mitochondrial respiratory chain complex components, antioxidant enzymes, and synaptic proteins were identified as modified in the proteome pattern of P301L tau mice. Significantly, the reduction in mitochondrial complex V levels in the P301L tau mice revealed using proteomics was also confirmed as decreased in human P301L FTDP-17 (frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17) brains. Functional analysis demonstrated a mitochondrial dysfunction in P301L tau mice together with reduced NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity and, with age, impaired mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Mitochondrial dys-function was associated with higher levels of reactive oxygen species in aged transgenic mice. Increased tau pathology as in aged homozygous P301L tau mice revealed modified lipid peroxidation levels and the up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes in response to oxidative stress. Furthermore, P301L tau mitochondria displayed increased vulnerability toward β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide insult, suggesting a synergistic action of tau and Aβ pathology on the mitochondria.

These mice show an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and NFT formation similar to those in FTDP-17 and AD. Little is known about the distinct intracellular mechanisms underlying the consequences of tau pathology. This insight could help us to understand the selective vulnerability of cells with tau pathology and thereby the pathogenesis of AD. Increasing evidence highlights a connection between AD and mitochondrial dysfunction together with a deregulation of energy metabolism and oxidative stress (8Mattson M.P. Pedersen W.A. Duan W.

To examine the contribution of tau to these neurodegenerative processes, we carried out a proteomic analysis of our P301L tau transgenic mice. To zoom in on proteins relevant to the pathology, we sequentially extracted whole brains from six pairs of P301L tau and wild-type (WT) mice into three fractions according to protein solubility. Comparative analysis of two-dimensional gels run for each fraction revealed statistically significant differences between P301L tau and WT mice. We found three principal categories of proteins differentially regulated by P301L tau expression: metabolism-related proteins including mitochondrial respiratory chain complex components, oxidative stress-related enzymes implicated in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, and synapse-related proteins. Consistent with these findings, P301L tau mice exhibited mitochondrial functional defects together with reduced electron transport chain complex I activity. Aged P301L tau mice showed impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced complex V activity, and higher levels of ROS than WT controls. Furthermore, modified lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant enzyme activities were detected in aged homozygous mice. We also found an increased vulnerability of P301L tau mitochondria to Aβ insult, suggesting a synergistic action of tau and Aβ pathology on the mitochondria. Corroborating the P301L tau mouse mitochondrial deficits, we could demonstrate a reduction in complex V levels in human P301L FTDP-17 brains, implying a potential mitochondrial dysfunction in human patients afflicted with this neurodegenerative disorder. Transgenic Mice—The transgenic mice used in the present study express the human pathogenic mutation P301L of tau together with the longest human brain tau isoform (htau40) under control of the neuron-specific mThy1.2 promoter (7Gotz J. Chen F. Barmettler R. Nitsch R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 529-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This isoform contains exons 2 and 3 as well as four microtubule-binding repeats (2+3+4R, human tau40). Pronuclear injections were done into C57Bl/6 × DBA/2 F2 oocytes to obtain founder animals that were back-crossed with C57Bl/6 mice to establish transgenic lines. In addition, homozygous P301L tau mice were obtained and confirmed by TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR (data not shown). Different age sets of mice were used for different experimental procedures corresponding to various stages in the development of tau pathology. P301L tau mice show tau hyperphosphorylation already at 3 months (7Gotz J. Chen F. Barmettler R. Nitsch R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 529-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). NFT formation starts at 6 months of age (20Gotz J. Chen F. van Dorpe J. Nitsch R.M. Science. 2001; 293: 1491-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). We used 8.5–10-month-old mice for the proteomics analysis to study the consequences of tau pathology at the beginning of NFT formation without the influence of aging. At a similar age (i.e. 12 months old), mitochondrial membrane potential and complex I and IV activity were determined. ATP levels, mitochondrial respiration, and ROS levels were analyzed in mice at 12 and 24 months of age. 24-month-old mice are expected to bear the highest levels of tau pathology. 18-month-old mice were used to determine mitochondrial numbers in neurites. This intermediate age allows us to see the full effect of tau pathology on mitochondrial transport without pronounced aging effects such as those seen in 24-month-old mice. Finally, 12- and 24-month-old homozygous, hemizygous, and wild-type mice were tested for lipid peroxidation. Sequential Extraction of Brain Samples—Four pairs of 8.5-month-old male hemizygous P301L tau and WT control mice and two pairs of 10-month-old male hemizygous P301L tau and WT control mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and brains were removed at 4 °C and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Brains were sequentially extracted with the ReadyPrep sequential extraction kit (Bio-Rad) according to a modified version of the manufacturer's protocol. Only one P301L tau and one WT each were extracted at a time. All steps were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise specified. Briefly, whole brains were homogenized in 3 ml of buffer 1 (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm Na3V04, and 1 mm NaF) and 200 units of DNase I in a glass-Teflon potter. After 15 min on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatant E1 was collected for further analysis. The pellet was washed twice with buffer 1 before it was resuspended in 750 μl of buffer 2 (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm Tris, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes (Bio-Rad), and 2 mm tributylphosphine), incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and ultra-centrifuged at 57,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant E2 was collected for further analysis. The pellet was washed once with buffer 2 and then resuspended in buffer 3 (5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% caprylyl sulfobetaine 3–10, 40 mm Tris, 0.2% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes, and 2 mm tributylphosphine). The final supernatant, E3, was collected after ultra-centrifugation at 89,000 × g for 30 min at 10 °C. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Isoelectrical focusing was carried out using the PROTEAN IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). Six P301L tau transgenic and six WT samples were focused simultaneously. Each fraction from the sequential extraction (40 μg of E1, 50 μg of E2, or 60 μl of E3) was loaded on 17-cm IPG strips (pH 3–10; Bio-Rad) in rehydration buffer (8.5 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.5% pharmalytes (pH 3–10; Amersham Biosciences), and 1.2% DeStreak reagent (Amersham Biosciences). After passive rehydration for 15 h, the IPG strips were isoelectrically focused following a stepwise increase in voltage from 150 to 10,000 V, finishing with 60,000 V-h. Prior to SDS-PAGE, the IPG strips were equilibrated in 2% dithiothreitol, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.05 m Tris, pH 8.8, and 20% glycerol for 30 min and then equilibrated again in the same buffer with 2.5% iodoacetamide instead of dithiothreitol for another 30 min. Second dimension separation was performed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels at 200 V using the PROTEAN Plus Dodeca cell electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). All gels of the six P301L tau transgenic and six WT samples from one fraction were run at the same time. Gel Staining and Image Analysis—Gels were stained using a modified silver staining method (21Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Six P301L tau transgenic and six WT two-dimensional gels were compared simultaneously with the Proteomweaver imaging software Version 2.1 (Definiens, Munich, Germany). This software normalizes all gels and compares each two-dimensional spot pattern of every transgenic gel of one fraction with each two-dimensional spot pattern of every WT gel of the same fraction. Only spots present in all 12 gels and differentially regulated by at least 1.5-fold were considered for statistical analysis with Student's t test (p < 0.05). Mass Spectrometry—For mass spectrometry analysis, 150 μg of E1, 150 μg of E2, and 180 μl of E3, respectively, were loaded on 24-cm IPG strips (pH 3–10). The two-dimensional gels were stained with Sypro Ruby (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), and the protein spots of interest were excised with the GelPix protein spot excision system (Genetix, Hampshire, UK). Spots were prepared for in-gel trypsin digestion. Briefly, spots were washed twice with double-distilled H2O, once with 50 mm NH4HCO3/30% acetonitrile for 5 min at 37 °C, and once with 80% acetonitrile for 10 min at room temperature. Digestion was carried out with 30 ng trypsin/spot in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 2 mm CaCl2 for 3 h at 37 °C. After 5 min of sonication, the tryptic digests were desalted and concentrated using μ-C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Volketswil, Switzerland). The bound peptides were eluted directly onto the MALDI target with 0.8 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (5 mg/ml) in 65% acetonitrile, 35% double-distilled H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Digests were analyzed by MALDI tandem time-of-flight (TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). One mass spectrum and up to five tandem mass spectra of all precursor ions with a minimum signal/noise ratio of 80 were recorded for each sample spot. Autoproteolytic fragments of trypsin were used as internal calibrants in the mass spectrometry mode. The mass and tandem mass spectra were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; available at www.matrixscience.com) as the search engine. A combined mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry search with a peptide tolerance of 25 ppm and a tandem mass spectrometry tolerance of 0.2 Da was carried out against the UniProt complete mouse proteome data base (available at ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/integr8). Protein identification was considered significant if the Mascot score was higher than the probability p < 0.05 of a random match. Evaluation of Complex V Level in Human Brains—Homogenates from temporal cortex of two controls and four P301L FTDP-17 patients were prepared in 150 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 8 m urea, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue and subjected to Western blotting using standard methods. 2.5 μl of total brain lysate were loaded. The blots were developed with antibodies directed against the complex V component ATP synthase chain D (A21343, 0.2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) and against porin for normalization (A31855, 0.2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). As a secondary antibody, a goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, 1:5000) was used. Non-overexposed films were used to quantify the bands with Image J software (National Institutes of Health; available at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Complex V levels were expressed as a percentage of porin levels. Samples used (as loaded) were as follows: 1) control brain, 73-year-old female; 2) control brain, 72-year-old male; 3) P301L brain, 64-year-old female; 4) P301L brain, 52-year-old male; 5) P301L brain, 66-year-old female; and 6) P301L brain, 60-year-old male. Three other control samples were used (specifically, control temporal cortex from 78-year-old female, 82-year-old female, and 78-year-old male brains) (data not shown). Materials Used for Mitochondrial Analysis—Rhodamine 123, tetramethylrhodamine-ethylester, and MitoTracker Green FM were purchased from Molecular Probes Europe (Leiden, The Netherlands); 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) and dihydroethidium (DHE) were purchased from Calbiochem (Merck Biosciences, Bad Soden, Germany); hydrochloric acid, ethanol, ferric chloride, and chloroform were purchased from VWR International (Darmstadt, Germany); and the ViaLight HT kit was purchased from Cambrex Bio Science (Copenhagen, Denmark). The Cytochrome c Oxidase (Complex IV) Assay Kit, sodium nitroprusside, rotenone, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, anti-mycin, sodium azide (NaN3), and oligomycin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Aβ1–42 (Bachem, Weil am Rhein, Germany) was dissolved in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at a concentration of 1 mm and stored at –20 °C. The stock solution was diluted in Tris-buffered saline to the desired concentrations and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h to obtain aged, aggregated preparations of Aβ1–42. All aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized and filtered water (Millipore). Brain Tissue Preparation for Mitochondrial Analysis—Mice (8 pairs of 12-month-old and 8 pairs of 24-month-old hemizygous P301L tau and WT control mice) were sacrificed by decapitation, and brains were quickly dissected on ice (described in Ref. 22Stoll L. Schubert T. Muller W.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, with modification). After removing the cerebellum, one hemisphere (the other hemisphere was directly used for preparation of isolated mitochondria) was minced into 1 ml of medium I (138 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.17 mm Na2HPO4, 0.22 mm K2PO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 58.4 mm sucrose, pH 7.35) with a scalpel and further dissociated by trituration through a nylon mesh (pore diameter, 1 mm) with a Pasteur pipette. The resulting suspension was filtered by gravity through a fresh nylon mesh with a pore diameter of 102 μm, and the dissociated cell aggregates were washed twice with medium II (110 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2·H2O, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 25 mm glucose, 70 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) by centrifugation (400 × g for 3 min at 4 °C). 100 μl of the suspension were used for protein determination. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then aliquots (100 μl/well) were distributed in a white 96-well plate for measurement of ATP levels, and aliquots (250 μl/well) were distributed in a 48-well plate for measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS levels. The latter were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air for the staining period with the appropriate dye or incubated with Aβ for 4 h. The preparations of cortical cells from P301L tau transgenic mice and WT littermate controls (crossover design) were made within 2 h under the same conditions and in parallel. Data are expressed as fluorescence units per mg/ml protein. The total protein content was determined (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential ψm—The membrane potential of the inner mitochondrial membrane was measured using Rhodamine 123 dye added to the cell culture medium at a final concentration of 0.4 μm for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (Sigma), and fluorescence was determined with a Victor2 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 490 nm (excitation)/535 nm (emission). Loading capacity of the dye within the membrane decreases when the mitochondrial membrane potential declines after damage, e.g. exposure to Aβ1–42. For the secondary insult with Aβ1–42, cells were incubated for 4 h with 50 nm pre-aggregated Aβ1–42. To test acute and fast changes in ψm, the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine-ethylester was used at 0.4 μm for 15 min. Tetramethylrhodamine-ethylester exhibits a characteristic increase in fluorescence at 490 nm (excitation)/590 nm (emission) after challenging mitochondria with drugs that decrease the membrane potential. The mitochondrial membrane potential was recorded with the respiratory inhibitors rotenone (2 μm), thenoyltrifluoroacetone (10 μm), antimycin (2 μm), oligomycin (10 μm), and sodium azide (10 mm) (24Krohn A.J. Wahlbrink T. Prehn J.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7394-7404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Collins T.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1616-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). ATP Levels—ATP levels were determined with a bioluminescence assay (ViaLight HT; Cambrex Bio Science). The enzyme luciferase, which catalyzes the formation of light from ATP and luciferin, was utilized. The emitted light was linearly related to the ATP concentration and measured using a luminometer (26Crouch S.P. Kozlowski R. Slater K.J. Fletcher J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 160: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). ROS Levels—Levels of cytosolic ROS were measured using the fluorescent probe H2DCF-DA, and levels of superoxide anion radical were measured by using DHE. Brain cells were loaded for 15 min with 10 μm H2DCF-DA or 10 μm DHE. After washing twice with Hank's balanced salt solution, formation of the fluorescent product dichlorofluorescein was detected with Victor2 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 485 nm (excitation)/535 nm (emission). Dichlorofluorescein is trapped mainly in the cytoplasm and oxidized by several ROS, most notably hydrogen peroxide. (27Kenney A.M. Kocsis J.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DHE, which is oxidized to the fluorescent ethidium cation by O2·¯ was detected with Victor2 multiplate reader at 490 nm (excitation)/590 nm (emission) (28Budd S.L. Castilho R.F. Nicholls D.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Amount of Mitochondria—The total amount of mitochondria was measured using the cell-permeable mitochondrion-selective dye Mito-Tracker Green FM (100 nm, 15 min) which is essentially nonfluorescent in aqueous solutions and only becomes fluorescent once it accumulates in the lipid environment of mitochondria (490 nm, excitation; 516 nm, emission). To determine the number of mitochondria, in addition, four pairs of 18-month-old P301L tau transgenic and WT mice were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in microtubule stabilization buffer (65 mm PIPES, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 3 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9). 5-μm paraffin brain sections were co-immunostained with anti-porin (A31855, diluted 1:2000; Molecular Probes) and anti-tubulin (YOL 1/34, 1:600; Abcam Limited, Cambridge, UK) antibodies, followed by incubation with Cy3- and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, Milan Analytic, Fribourg, Switzerland). The number of mitochondria in neurites of CA1 hippocampal neurons was counted both proximal and distal to the cell body. Preparation of Isolated Mitochondria—Mice were sacrificed by decapitation, and one brain hemisphere was rapidly dissected on ice and washed in an ice-cold buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.45% bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics)). After removing the cerebellum, the tissue sample was homogenized in 2 ml of buffer with a glass homogenizer (10–15 strokes, 400 rpm), and the resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 1400 × g for 7 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and tissue particles. The low-speed centrifugation step was repeated once with the supernatant. Then, the supernatant fraction was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer and centrifuged again at 800 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Finally, the mitochondria-enriched supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain a mitochondrial fraction. This fraction was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer and stored at 4 °C until use, followed by determination of protein content (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Respiration—The rate of mitochondrial respiration was monitored at 25 °C using an Oxygraph-2k system (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) equipped with two chambers and DatLab software. Mitochondria (0.5 mg) were added to 2 ml of a buffer containing 65 mm sucrose, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgSO4, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. State 4 respiration was measured after adding 40 μl of malate/glutamate (240/280 mm; assay concentration, 4.8/5.6 mm). Then, 10 μl of ADP (100 mm; assay concentration, 0.5 mm) were added to measure state 3 respiration. After determining coupled respiration, 1 μl of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (0.1 mm; assay concentration, 0.05 nm) was added to the reaction chamber, and respiration was measured in the absence of a proton gradient. To inhibit complex I activity, a total volume of 3 μl (2 + 1 μl) rotenone (0.1 mm; final concentration, 0.15 nm) was added. Then, 10 μl of succinate (1 m; final concentration, 5 mm) were added, and respiration was measured. Finally, 8 μl of KCN (0.5 m; assay concentration, 2 nm) were added to inhibit complex IV activity. P301L tau mice and WT mitochondria were measured in parallel pairs using the same conditions (crossover design). Complex I Activity—Isolated mitochondria were solubilized in n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (20%) (Sigma-Aldrich). NADH:hexaammineruthenium(III)-chloride (HAR) activity was measured at 30 °C in a buffer containing 2 mm Na+/MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm KCN, pH 7.2, using 2 mm HAR and 200 μm NADH as substrates to estimate the complex I content. To determine NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity, 100 μmn-decylubiquinone (DBQ) and 100 μm NADH were used as substrates, as described previously (29Djafarzadeh R. Kerscher S. Zwicker K. Radermacher M. Lindahl M. Schagger H. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Oxidation rates of NADH were recorded with a Shimadzu Multi Spec-1501 diode array spectrophotometer (ε340–400 nm = 6.1 mm–1 cm–1). Complex I activity was normalized to the complex I content of the mitochondrial preparation and is given as DBQ/HAR ratio. Complex IV Activity—Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined in intact isolated mitochondria using the Cytochrome c Oxidase Assay Kit. The colorimetric assay is"

An accelerator-based source of femtosecond x-ray pulses allowed us to follow directly atomic displacements on an optically modified energy landscape, leading eventually to the transition from crystalline solid to disordered liquid. We show that, to first order in time, the dynamics are inertial, and we place constraints on the shape and curvature of the transition-state potential energy surface. Our measurements point toward analogies between this nonequilibrium phase transition and the short-time dynamics intrinsic to equilibrium liquids."

We propose that, because vision is poorly sensitive to accelerations, an internal model that calculates the effects of gravity is derived from graviceptive information, is stored in the vestibular cortex, and is activated by visual motion that appears to be coherent with natural gravity. The acceleration of visual targets was manipulated while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In agreement with the internal model hypothesis, we found that the vestibular network was selectively engaged when acceleration was consistent with natural gravity. These findings demonstrate that predictive mechanisms of physical laws of motion are represented in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2107638340,"The Drosophila cuticle is essential for maintaining the surface barrier defenses of the fly. Integral to cuticle resilience is the transcription factor grainy head , which regulates production of the enzyme required for covalent cross-linking of the cuticular structural components. We report that formation and maintenance of the epidermal barrier in mice are dependent on a mammalian homolog of grainy head, Grainy head-like 3 . Mice lacking this factor display defective skin barrier function and deficient wound repair, accompanied by reduced expression of transglutaminase 1, the key enzyme involved in cross-linking the structural components of the superficial epidermis. These findings suggest that the functional mechanisms involving protein cross-linking that maintain the epidermal barrier and induce tissue repair are conserved across 700 million years of evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1996317585,"Complex antibiotics based on natural products are almost invariably prepared by semisynthesis, or chemical transformation of the isolated natural products. This approach greatly limits the range of accessible structures that might be studied as new antibiotic candidates. Here we report a short and enantioselective synthetic route to a diverse range of 6-deoxytetracycline antibiotics. The common feature of this class is a scaffold of four linearly fused rings, labeled A through D. We targeted not a single compound but a group of structures with the D ring as a site of structural variability. A late-stage, diastereoselective C-ring construction was used to couple structurally varied D-ring precursors with an AB precursor containing much of the essential functionality for binding to the bacterial ribosome. Five derivatives were synthesized from benzoic acid in yields ranging from 5 to 7% over 14 to 15 steps, and a sixth, (-)-doxycycline, was synthesized in 8.3% yield over 18 steps."

Although there is ample evidence for climate oscillations that are too frequent to be explained by orbital forcing, suborbital-frequency sea-level change has been difficult to resolve, primarily because of problems with uranium/thorium coral dating. Here we use a new approach that corrects coral ages for the frequently observed open-system behavior of uranium-series nuclides, substantially improving the resolution of sea-level reconstruction. This curve reveals persistent sea-level oscillations that are too frequent to be explained exclusively by orbital forcing."
https://openalex.org/W2062269693,"We used wounded Drosophila embryos to define an evolutionarily conserved pathway for repairing the epidermal surface barrier. This pathway includes a wound response enhancer from the Ddc gene that requires grainy head (grh) function and binding sites for the Grh transcription factor. At the signaling level, tyrosine kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activities are induced in epidermal cells near wounds, and activated ERK is required for a robust wound response. The conservation of this Grh-dependent pathway suggests that the repair of insect cuticle and mammal skin is controlled by an ancient, shared control system for constructing and healing the animal body surface barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2029058221,"A catastrophic extinction occurred at the end of the Permian Period. However, baseline extinction rates appear to have been elevated even before the final catastrophe, suggesting sustained environmental degradation. For terrestrial vertebrates during the Late Permian, the combination of a drop in atmospheric oxygen plus climate warming would have induced hypoxic stress and consequently compressed altitudinal ranges to near sea level. Our simulations suggest that the magnitude of altitudinal compression would have forced extinctions by reducing habitat diversity, fragmenting and isolating populations, and inducing a species-area effect. It also might have delayed ecosystem recovery after the mass extinction."
https://openalex.org/W1561104679,"Covering 32% of the planet, boreal forests are one of the last relatively intact terrestrial biomes, and are a critical carbon sink in global climate dynamics. Mature and old-growth boreal forests provide a large number of products that are culturally and economically important, from wood-based lumber, pulp, and fuel wood, to numerous nonwood products. Intensive wood harvest and conservation of naturally dynamic intact forests tend to be mutually exclusive; where biodiversity is highly valued, wood harvests are limited or banned outright. The authors of this

In some cases, exporting impact across the border may cause negative impacts to boomerang back into the country9s protected forests."
https://openalex.org/W2157061952,"To identify the mechanisms underlying muscle aging, we have undertaken a high-resolution differential proteomic analysis of gastrocnemius muscle in young adults, mature adults, and old LOU/c/jall rats. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry analyses led to the identification of 40 differentially expressed proteins. Strikingly, most differences characterized old (30-month) animals, whereas young (7-month) and mature (18-month) adults exhibited similar patterns of expression. Important modifications in contractile (actin, myosin light-chains, troponins-T) and cytoskeletal (desmin, tubulin) proteins, and in essential regulatory proteins (gelsolin, myosin binding proteins, CapZ-beta, P23), likely account for dysfunctions in old muscle force generation and speed of contraction. Other features support decreases in cytosolic (triose-phosphate isomerase, enolase, glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase, creatine kinase) and mitochondrial (isocitrate dehydrogenase, cytochrome-c oxidase) energy metabolisms. Muscle aging is often associated with increased oxidative stress. Accordingly, we observed differential regulation of molecular chaperones (hsp20, hsp27, reticuloplasmin ER60) and of proteins implicated in reactive aldehyde detoxification (aldehyde dehydrogenase, glutathione transferase, glyoxalase). We further noticed up-regulation of proteins involved in transcriptional elongation (RNA capping protein) and RNA-editing (Apobec2). Most of these proteins were previously unrecognized as differentially expressed in old muscles, and they represent novel starting points for elucidating the mechanisms of muscle aging."
https://openalex.org/W2037362944,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) regulates multiple cellular processes via activation of Smad signaling pathways. We have recently demonstrated that the inhibitory Smad7 interacts with the acetyl transferase p300 and that p300 acetylates Smad7 on two lysine residues. These lysine residues are critical for Smurf-mediated ubiquitination of Smad7, and acetylation protects Smad7 from TGFβ-induced degradation. In this study we demonstrate that Smad7 interacts with specific histone deacetylases (HDACs) and that the same HDACs are able to deacetylate Smad7. The interaction with HDACs is dependent on the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad7. In addition, HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of Smad7 decreases the stability of Smad7 by enhancing its ubiquitination.

Dysfunction of TGFβ signaling has been implicated in various human disorders ranging from vascular diseases to cancer progression (for a recent review see Ref. 1Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). TGFβ exerts its cellular effects via formation of a heteromeric complex of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. The type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor, which in turn phosphorylates and activates the receptor-activated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) in their C-terminal SSXS motif. The activated Smads then interact with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus where they act as transcription factors together with co-activators and co-repressors (2Shi Y. Massague J.

Polyubiquitination modulates protein function by inducing proteasome-dependent degradation. Protein acetylation can also affect protein stability, because it has been demonstrated that acetylation prevents ubiquitination of the same lysine residues (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H.

The class I HDACs, consisting of HDAC1, -2, -3 and -8, are homologs of the yeast RPD3 protein, whereas the class II HDACs, HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10, are related to yeast HDA1. Class III HDACs, the sirtuins, are homologs of the yeast protein Sir2. In contrast to members of the class I and II HDACs, class III HDACs require NAD+ for their deacetylase activity (24Imai S.

In addition, it was recently shown that HDAC1 interacts with the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 and that HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of the tumor suppressor p53 promotes MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (20Ito A.

Thus, HDAC-mediated deacetylation may be a novel mechanism to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of some acetylated proteins. In this study, we demonstrate that Smad7 interacts with specific HDACs. The HDACs that associate with Smad7 also deacetylate the protein. We also demonstrate that endogenous Smad7 interacts with HDAC1 and map the interaction to the C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad7. siRNA-mediated inactivation of endogenous HDAC1 enhances the acetylation and steady-state levels of endogenous Smad7. In addition, HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of Smad7 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7. Thus, our results indicate that the balance between acetylation and deacetylation of Smad7 can control its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylated Smad7K64 and anti-Smad7 antibodies were raised against an acetylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 60–68 in Smad7 and a GST fusion of full-length Smad7, respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, and protein G-Sepharose were from Amersham-Biosciences and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Plasmids and DNA Transfections—The expression vectors for FLAG- and Myc-tagged Smad7 in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were generously provided by P. ten Dijke (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). The expression vectors for HA-tagged p300, HDAC1, -2, and -3 were a kind gift from T. Kouzarides (Wellcome/CRC Institute, Cambridge, UK). HDAC4, -5, and -6 were from S. Schreiber (Harvard University). The various fragments of human HDAC1 (amino acids 1–160, 161–483, and 321–483) and mouse Smad7 (amino acids 2–126, 127–260, and 261–426) were generated by PCR and cloned into Flag-pcDNA3 and 6xMyc-pcDNA3, respectively. The mammalian expression vector, pSUPER, generously provided by R. Bernards, (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam) was used for cloning a HDAC1-specific sequence (gcctcaccgaatccgcatg) corresponding to nucleotides 92–111 in human HDAC1 for expression of short hairpin RNA (30Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3963) Google Scholar). Gene silencing of HDAC1 was performed using siRNA oligonucleotides obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). The oligonucleotides were delivered to cells using Silentfect (Bio-Rad). Transient transfections were performed using the MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO4, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 1% Aprotenin) and cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding the appropriate antibodies plus protein G-Sepharose beads, followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with 0.5 m NaCl, and once with water. SDS sample buffer (400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 4% SDS, 1 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added, and the precipitates were heated. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline with the addition of 5% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate antibodies, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. After washing, the blots were visualized with Western blotting chemiluminescence luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For reprobing, blots were incubated in stripping buffer (0.2 m NaOH, 0.5 m NaCl) at room temperature for 10 min and washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline before blocking. In Vivo Ubiquitination—Cells were lysed in Ub-lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and sonicated. The samples were boiled for 10 min and diluted 10 times with lysis buffer. After clearing by centrifugation, immunoprecipitations were performed as described. Generation of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Pull-down Assays— GST-Smad7 and GST-HDAC1 fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3pLysS) and purified according to standard protocols. The amount of protein on the beads was estimated by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels, and equal amounts of protein were used in the binding assays. Proteins were in vitro translated using the T7 TnT kit (Promega) and 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine (Promix, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with GST fusion proteins prebound to glutathione beads at 4 °C for 3 h in the presence of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) to avoid unspecific binding. The samples were treated as described for immunoprecipitates and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was incubated in enhancer (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences) for 15 min, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager overnight. Deacetylation Assay—293T cells were transfected with Myc-Smad7 and HA-p300 using the reagents and methods described above. Acetylated Myc-Smad7 was immunoprecipitated, and the precipitates were washed extensively. After washing, HDAC buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2) was added. The precipitates were aliquotted and used in deacetylation assays in the absence or presence of HeLa nuclear extract. To inactivate endogenous HDACs, HeLa nuclear extracts were preincubated 45 min on ice with TSA (final concentration 100 nm). The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, SDS sample buffer was added, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The preparation of HeLa nuclear extracts has been described elsewhere (31Kanopka A. Muhlemann O. Akusjarvi G. Nature. 1996; 381: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HDAC Activity Increases the Acetylation of Smad7—We have recently shown that Smad7 is acetylated on lysine residues 64 and 70 by p300 (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). During our studies we observed that activation of the TGFβ receptor resulted in a reduction in the acetylation of Smad7 (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting that Smad7 is deacetylated in response to TGFβ signaling. To test the possibility that Smad7 is a substrate for HDACs, 293T cells were transiently transfected with Smad7 either alone or together with p300 and incubated in the absence and presence of the HDAC inhibitor TSA. Following lysis of the cells, Smad7 was immunoprecipitated and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the acetylation of Smad7 was monitored by anti-acetyl lysine antibodies. As previously reported, Smad7 was acetylated by p300 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the acetylation of Smad7 was enhanced in cells treated with TSA (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 4). The same result was obtained using an antibody specific for the major acetylation site in Smad7 (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that Smad7 is actively deacetylated in vivo. To further test the possibility that Smad7 is a HDAC substrate, Smad7 was expressed in 293T cells together with p300 and immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitated material was divided into three aliquots. One aliquot was left untreated, one aliquot was incubated with nuclear extract from HeLa cells, and the third aliquot was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract pretreated with TSA to inhibit endogenous HDACs. After incubation, the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the acetylation of Smad7 was detected by Western blotting. The incubation of Smad7 with HeLa nuclear extract significantly reduced the acetylation of Smad7 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, preincubating the HeLa nuclear extracts with TSA blocked the effect on the acetylation of Smad7, indicating that the deacetylation of Smad7 is catalyzed by a TSA-sensitive process. Taken together, these results suggest that acetylated Smad7 is a potential HDAC substrate. Smad7 Interacts with Specific HDACs—To analyze whether Smad7 is associated with specific members of the HDAC family of proteins, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in transiently transfected 293T cells, using Myc-tagged Smad7 and FLAG-tagged HDACs (HDAC1–HDAC6). Among the class I HDACs, both HDAC1 and HDAC3 interacted well with Smad7, whereas only a weak interaction was detected between Smad7 and HDAC2 (Fig. 2A). Among the class II HDACs, both HDAC5 and HDAC6 interacted with Smad7, whereas we were unable to detect any interaction between Smad7 and HDAC4 (Fig. 2A). The interactions between Smad7 and HDAC5 or HDAC6 were consistently weaker than the interaction between Smad7 and HDAC1 or HDAC3. This difference made us focus on the interaction between Smad7 and HDAC1. GST pull-down experiments using GST-HDAC1 and in vitro translated Smad7 showed that these two proteins interact in vitro and that the interaction most probably is direct (Fig. 2B). To verify that Smad7 and HDACs interact under physiological conditions, the interaction between endogenous proteins was investigated. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, Smad7 antibodies immunoprecipitated endogenous HDAC1 from 293T whole-cell lysates, whereas an unrelated antibody was unable to do so. The C-terminal Domain of Smad7 Interacts with HDAC1— Smad7 contains an N-terminal domain, which is conserved between the I-Smads and a C-terminal MH2 domain, which is conserved in all members of the Smad family. Smad7 also contains a linker region, which, via its PY motif, is critical for the interaction with the Smurf family of ubiquitin ligases (8Ebisawa T. Fukuchi M. Murakami G. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 32Zhang Y. Chang C. Gehling D.J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Derynck R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The acetylated lysine residues are located within the N-terminal domain of Smad7 (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine the domain(s) in Smad7 that are responsible for its interaction with HDAC1, we used deletion mutants of Smad7 together with full-length HDAC1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As seen in Fig. 3A, full-length Smad7 and the isolated MH2 domain (amino acids 261–246) interacted strongly with HDAC1, whereas no interaction was detected between HDAC1 and the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–126) or linker region (amino acids 127–260) of Smad7. To further map the interaction between Smad7 and HDAC1, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using Myc-tagged Smad7 together with FLAG-tagged HDAC1, either full-length or three deletion fragments (amino acid residues 1–160, 161–483, and 321–483). As expected, Smad7 interacted with full-length HDAC1. Smad7 also interacted with the large central fragment of HDAC1, whereas no interaction was detected with the N-terminal or the C-terminal fragments of HDAC1 (Fig. 3B). The fragment of HDAC1 that interacted with Smad7 encompasses a large part of the catalytic domain of HDAC1 (33Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), further supporting the hypothesis that Smad7 is a substrate for HDAC1. Smad7 Is a HDAC Substrate—To investigate whether Smad7 is a substrate for the deacetylase activity of HDACs, 293T cells were transiently transfected with p300 and Smad7, either in the absence or presence of various HDACs (HDAC1–HDAC6). After immunoprecipitation, the acetylation of Smad7 was monitored with anti-acetyl lysine antibodies. The acetylation of Smad7 was drastically reduced in the presence of HDAC1, -3, and -6 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, only minor or no effects on the acetylation of Smad7 were seen when the protein was co-expressed with HDAC2, -4, or -5 (Fig. 4A). Thus, the HDACs that interacted the strongest with Smad7 in the coprecipitation assays were the most effective in catalyzing the deacetylation of Smad7 (compare Figs. 2A and 4A). To further study the effect of HDAC1 on the acetylation of Smad7, the acetylation of the protein was studied in response to short hairpin RNA-mediated inactivation of HDAC1. 293T cells were transfected with Smad7 with or without p300. As seen in Fig. 4B, the acetylation of Smad7 was significantly increased when the protein levels of endogenous HDAC1 were reduced, indicating that endogenous HDAC1 affects the acetylation of Smad7. To further confirm that the acetylation of Smad7 is regulated by endogenous HDACs, HepG2 cells were transfected with Flag-Smad7 in the absence or presence of a vector expressing short hairpin RNA for HDAC1. Twenty-four hours after transfection, TGFβ was added to the cells to stimulate Smad7 turnover. Following immunoprecipitation of the transfected Smad7, the acetylation of the protein was analyzed with anti-acetyl lysine antibodies. Inactivation of endogenous HDAC1 enhanced the acetylation of Smad7 in HepG2 (Fig. 4C). Similar results were also observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). HDAC1 Decreases the Half-life of Smad7 by Promoting Its Ubiquitination—For some proteins, the acetylation of specific lysine residues is able to prevent ubiquitination of the same residues, thereby preventing protein degradation (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 20Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 21Zhao Q. Cumming H. Cerruti L. Cunningham J.M. Jane S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41477-41486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether HDAC1 could affect the half-life of Smad7, 293 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad7 in the absence or presence of co-transfected FLAG-tagged HDAC1. The cells were starved overnight and stimulated with TGFβ for the indicated time periods in the presence of cycloheximide. In a separate experiment, TSA was added to cells expressing Flag-Smad7 to inhibit the activity of endogenous HDACs. Following lysis of the cells, the levels of Smad7 were determined by Western blotting. Co-expression of HDAC1 significantly decreased the half-life of Smad7 (Fig. 5A, compare the top and middle panels). Interestingly, the degradation of transiently transfected Smad7 was blocked in cells treated with TSA, indicating that endogenous HDACs regulate the stability of Smad7 (Fig. 5A, lower panel). To determine whether endogenous HDAC1 could influence the stability of Smad7, HepG2 cells were transfected with low amounts of Flag-Smad7 in the absence or presence of a vector expressing short hairpin RNA for HDAC1. As illustrated in Fig. 5B, the steady-state levels of Flag-Smad7 were enhanced in response to inactivation of endogenous HDAC1, suggesting that HDAC1 regulates the stability of Smad7. Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated in HeLa cells (data not shown). To determine whether HDAC1 could also affect the ubiquitination of Smad7, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad7 and HA-tagged ubiquitin in the absence or presence of co-transfected HDAC1. After lysis of the cells, Smad7 was immunoprecipitated and the ubiquitination of Smad7 was determined by Western blotting. Co-expression of HDAC1 significantly increased the ubiquitination of Smad7 (Fig. 5C), indicating that deacetylation of Smad7 increases the amount of lysine residues available for subsequent ubiquitination. To establish that endogenous HDACs regulate the deacetylation of endogenous Smad7, HepG2 cells were treated with or without TSA for 8 h. After lysis, Smad7 was immunoprecipitated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As seen in Fig. 6A, the acetylation of endogenous Smad7 was increased after TSA treatment, suggesting that the acetylation of Smad7 is regulated by endogenous HDACs. To investigate the effect of endogenous HDAC1 on the acetylation of endogenous Smad7, gene silencing experiments were performed. HepG2 cells were either transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA or a HDAC1-specific siRNA. Lysates were prepared, and Smad7 was immunoprecipitated. Analysis by Western blotting revealed that inactivation of endogenous HDAC1 resulted in an increased acetylation of endogenous Smad7 (Fig. 6B). Inactivation of endogenous HDAC1 also increased the total amount of Smad7 that could be precipitated from HepG2 cells (Fig. 6B, middle panel). Similar results were also obtained when the experiments were repeated in 293T cells (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that endogenous Smad7 is a substrate for endogenous HDAC1 and that HDAC1-mediated deacetylation affects the stability of Smad7. In this study we presented evidence that Smad7 interacts with multiple HDACs, resulting in the deacetylation of Smad7, which enhances its ubiquitination and degradation, further strengthening the hypothesis that the acetylation of Smad7 is critical for its stability. We demonstrated that the acetylation of Smad7 is increased in the presence of the deacetylase inhibitor TSA in vivo, indicating that Smad7 is actively deacetylated by HDACs (Figs. 1A and 6A). An additional indication that Smad7 is a substrate for HDACs came from the observation that HeLa nuclear extracts contained an activity that could deacetylate Smad7 and that this activity was TSA-sensitive (Fig. 1C). TSA has been shown to inhibit both class I and class II HDACs, whereas class III HDACs are insensitive to TSA (25Barlow A.L. van Drunen C.M. Johnson C.A. Tweedie S. Bird A. Turner B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, our results indicate that class III HDACs are not involved in the deacetylation of Smad7; in accordance, treatment of cells with nicotinamide, an inhibitor of the class III HDACs, had no effect on Smad7 acetylation (data not shown). Smad7 interacted with both HDAC1 and -3, whereas the interaction with HDAC2 was weak (Fig. 2A). Although HDAC1 and -2 have 85% amino acid sequence similarity (34Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and are found in the same repressor complexes, it was recently shown that in the DT40 chicken B-cell line, disruption of either HDAC1 or -2 resulted in different protein expression patterns (35Takami Y. Kikuchi H. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23977-23990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that HDAC1 and -2 may have both specific and common interaction partners, which is consistent with the data on the differential interaction with Smad7 described in the present study. The class II HDACs, HDAC5 and -6, were also able to interact with (Fig. 2A) and deacetylate (Fig. 4A) Smad7, although to a lesser extent than the class I HDACs. In contrast, Bai and Cao (36Bai S. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4176-4182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that Smad6, which interacts with HDAC1 and -3, failed to interact with any member of the class II HDACs tested. The C-terminal MH2 domain of Smad7 interacted strongly with full-length HDAC1 (Fig. 3A), whereas no interaction was seen with the N-terminal domain or linker region. This is similar to Smad6, which also interacts with HDAC1 through its MH2 domain (36Bai S. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4176-4182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The interaction between Smad7 and HDAC1 is most probably direct as GST-HDAC1 was able to pull down Smad7 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, GST-Smad7 failed to interact with any of the HDACs tested (data not shown), indicating that Smad7 needs to be modified to interact with HDACs. Smad7 has been shown to be both acetylated (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated (37Pulaski L. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Souchelnytskyi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14344-14349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Acetylation of Smad7 is mediated by p300 and Smad7 is readily acetylated in vitro. However, in vitro acetylated GST-Smad7 still failed to associate with any of the HDACs tested indicating that this modification does not suffice for HDAC interaction (data not shown). The kinase(s) phosphorylating Smad7 is currently unknown preventing us from testing if this modification is critical for the interaction with HDACs in vitro. It was recently shown that the interaction between BCL-3 and HDAC1 is regulated by phosphorylation of BCL-3 and that HDAC1 negatively regulates BCL-3 stability (38Viatour P. Dejardin E. Warnier M. Lair F. Claudio E. Bureau F. Marine J.C. Merville M.P. Maurer U. Green D. Piette J. Siebenlist U. Bours V. Chariot A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that a similar mechanism regulates the interaction between HDAC1 and Smad7. The observation that Smad7 interacts with both transcriptional co-activators (p300) and co-repressors (HDACs) indicate that Smad7 could have a direct role in transcriptional regulation. Further studies will be necessary to analyze this possibility. HDAC6 has been shown to associate with proteins involved in the ubiquitin signaling pathway (39Seigneurin-Berny D. Verdel A. Curtet S. Lemercier C. Garin J. Rousseaux S. Khochbin S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The link between acetylation and ubiquitination gained further support from the observations that the ubiquitination and degradation of various proteins such as Smad7 (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), SREBP (17Giandomenico V. Simonsson M. Gronroos E. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and c-Myc (40Vervoorts J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Rottmann S. Lilischkis R. Walsemann G. Dohmann K. Austen M. Luscher B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1-7Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar) were reduced following acetylation. In Smad7, mutation of the two acetylated residues prevented its polyubiquitination and degradation (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), suggesting that acetylation protects Smad7 from ubiquitination. In support of this hypothesis, co-expression of HDAC1 and Smad7 enhanced the ubiquitination of Smad7 and increased its degradation (Fig. 5). In addition, the acetylation as well as the protein levels of endogenous Smad7 were increased after siRNA-mediated inactivation of endogenous HDAC1 (Fig. 6B). We have shown previously that the acetylation of Smad7 is decreased in response to TGFβ-signaling (11Gronroos E. Hellman U. Heldin C.H. Ericsson J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The reduction in acetylation is most probably the result of multiple, separate events. TGFβ induces nuclear export of Smad7, thereby preventing p300-mediated acetylation. It is also possible that TGFβ signaling enhances HDAC1-mediated deacetylation of Smad7. However, we were unable to detect any TGFβ dependence in the interaction between Smad7 and HDAC1 (data not shown). Thus, further investigations regarding the mechanisms involved in TGFβ-dependent regulation of the acetylation and deacetylation of Smad7 are warranted. Together with our previous findings, the data presented in the current report support a model where the activity of p300 and one or more HDACs determine the stability of Smad7 (Fig. 7). It is an interesting possibility that the stability of other proteins is also regulated by the balance between acetylation, deacetylation, and ubiquitination. We thank P. ten Dijke, S. Itoh, T.

These nuclear hormone receptors bind DNA as obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors and regulate gene expression through LXR response elements. The endogenous ligands for LXRs are oxidized cholesterol derivatives. These oxysterols cause allosteric changes in the ligand-binding domains to regulate interactions with coactivator (e.g. SRC-1, p300) and corepressor (e.g. nuclear receptor corepressor, silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor) complexes and alter transcription of target genes (8Huuskonen J.

For example, activation of LXRs by cholesterol metabolites protects cells from elevated cholesterol levels and coordinates the reverse transport of cholesterol from peripheral cells. These effects of LXRs have been particularly well studied in macrophages, in which cholesterol efflux is facilitated by higher expression of cholesterol transporters such as ABCA1 (13Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12097-12102Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 14Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N.

Excretion from the body is mediated by hepatic and intestinal mechanisms that increase loss of cholesterol in bile and decrease absorption in the intestine (16Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W.

Furthermore, LXRs play an important role in hepatic lipid metabolism with genetic and pharmacological data supporting a role for LXRs in induction of SREBP-1c and downstream lipogenic genes such as acyl CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase I (16Peet D.J.

Indeed, activation of LXRs causes a dramatic increase in hepatic production of triglycerides and appears to play a critical role in induction of lipogenesis by insulin (19Tobin K.A. Ulven S.M.

Finally, stimulation of LXRs with a synthetic agonist suppresses genes involved in gluconeogenesis and increases expression of hepatic glucokinase, as well as the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, Glut4, in adipose tissue (21Laffitte B.A. Chao L.C.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: S75-S78Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, LXRs have important regulatory roles in the maintenance of normal cholesterol, lipid, and glucose metabolism.The function of LXRs in lipid and cholesterol metabolism in liver, intestine, and macrophages has been extensively analyzed. However, roles for these transcription factors in adipose and other tissues are not as well defined. Although LXRβ is constitutively expressed during adipogenesis, expression of LXRα increases soon after the appearance of transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, and SREBP-1c, raising the possibility that LXRs regulate adipogenesis or lipid metabolism (24Ross S.E.

In this study, we report that although LXRα and LXRβ are not required for adipocyte development in mice, LXRβ is required for the increase in adipocyte size that occurs with age or obesity. Despite reduced amounts of adipose tissue, LXRβ–/– mice do not have substantially altered circulating levels of adipocyte hormones, nor are they resistant to insulin. However, LXRβ–/– mice are intolerant to glucose due to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Analyses of islets suggest that reduced expression of cholesterol transporters results in accumulation of cholesterol esters and perhaps other neutral lipids. Our data establish previously unrecognized roles for LXRβ in adipocyte hypertrophy, glucose homeostasis, and β cell function.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimal Experiments—LXRα–/–, LXRβ–/– and LXRα–/–β–/– were generated by gene targeting as described previously (29Alberti S. Schuster G. Parini P. Feltkamp D. Diczfalusy U. Rudling M. Angelin B. Bjorkhem I. Pettersson S. Gustafsson J-Å. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 30Schuster G.U. Parini P. Wang L. Alberti S. Steffensen K.R. Hansson G.K. Angelin B. Gustafsson J-Å. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Mice used in this study were back-crossed to C57Bl/6 mice for at least 10 generations. Animals were housed with a regular 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and ad libitum access to standard rodent chow diet (Laboratory Rodent Diet 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). All experiments were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals and were overseen by the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (University of Michigan).Diets—Where indicated, 4-week-old mice were assigned to receive ad libitum access to a low fat diet (10% fat, D12450B, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) or a high fat diet (45% fat, D12451, Research Diets) for 6 months.Energy Balance and Body Composition—Measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2) of individually housed wild type (n = 5) and LXRβ–/– (n = 5) mice with indirect calorimetry was performed on 7-month-old mice over 2 days with the Oxymax™ system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Animals were fed standard laboratory chow and nectar fluid and maintained on 12-h light and dark cycles beginning at 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., respectively. Animals were acclimated in measuring chambers for 1 week prior to recording. Measurements of VO2 were made every 24 min for each animal over a period of 2 days. Body composition was estimated with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry with pDEXA Sabre software (Norland Medical Systems, Fort Atkinson, WI). Differences between genotypes were evaluated with Student's t test.Glucose, Insulin, and Pyruvate Tolerance Tests—For the glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted for 16 h and then intraperitoneally injected with glucose (1.5 g/kg of body weight). Blood glucose was measured from tail blood with the OneTouch Ultra™ glucometer (Lifescan, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada). Serum insulin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL) for wild type and LXRβ–/– mice. For the insulin tolerance test, mice were deprived of food for 6 h and then injected intraperitoneally with insulin (0.75 units/kg of body weight), and blood glucose levels were measured. For the pyruvate challenge, animals were fasted for 16 h prior to an intraperitoneal injection of pyruvate dissolved in saline (2 g/kg) and measurement of blood glucose.Chemistry—Serum adiponectin, resistin, and leptin were determined with the Lincoplex system on a Luminex 100 machine (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Triacylglycerol determinations were performed with an Infinity triglyceride reagent kit (Sigma) with glycerol as the standard. Non-esterified fatty acids were measured using the half-micro test (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).Real-time PCR—Total RNA from adipose tissue or pancreatic islets was extracted using RNA Stat60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) and then purified using RNeasy mini-kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) and random hexamer primers. Quantitative PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. SYBR Green I was used to monitor amplification of DNA on the iCycler and IQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Gene expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA levels. Primer sequences are available upon request.Histology, Staining, and Immunostaining—Gonadal adipose tissue and pancreata were dissected, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunostaining, sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated in xylene and ethanol. Sections were incubated in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) and then with antibodies against insulin and glucagon (Linco). After washes, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, respectively (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After final washes, sections were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-blue and visualized using fluorescence microscopy. For Oil Red-O staining, pancreata were snap-frozen in Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA). Neutral lipid was visualized by staining 10-μm cryosections with Oil Red-O.Islet Isolation—Islets of Langerhans were obtained by a previously described method (31Pralong W.F. Bartley C. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by ductal injection of collagenase type XI (Sigma). The pancreas was dissected and incubated in 5 ml of collagenase solution at 37 °C for 7 min. Islets were hand-picked under stereomicroscope and selected for an oblong to spherical shape, a smooth surface (indicative of an intact islet membrane), and a diameter of 100–200 μm. The islets were placed in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Islets were used 1–6 days following isolation.Insulin Immunoassay—Single islets were assayed for insulin secretion using a microfluidic device described previously (32Shackman J.G. Dahlgren G.M. Peters J.L. Kennedy R.T. Lab. Chip. 2005; 5: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, single islets were loaded onto the device and perfused at 1 μl/min with balanced salt solution containing varying glucose concentrations. Perfusate was sampled and reacted on-chip with 50 nm fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled insulin (Molecular Probes) and 25 mm monoclonal anti-insulin antibody (Biodesign International, Saco, ME). The reaction mixture was injected onto a capillary electrophoresis channel every 5.5 s for 0.5 s where the antibody-insulin complex and free labeled-insulin were separated at 600 V/cm to quantify the amount of secreted insulin.RESULTSReduced Weight of Adipose Tissue Depots in LXRα–/–β–/– and LXRβ–/– Mice Primarily Due to Decreased Size of Adipocytes—Nebb and co-workers (25Juvet L.K. Andresen S.M. Schuster G.U. Dalen K.T. Tobin K.A. Hollung K. Haugen F. Jacinto S. Ulven S.M. Bamberg K. Gustafsson J-Å. Nebb H.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that LXRα–/–β–/– mice at 18 months of age have significantly less adipose tissue than wild type mice. To determine whether reduced fat mass is due to a loss of LXRα–/–, LXRβ–/–, or both, we analyzed wild type, LXRα–/–β–/–, LXRα–/–, and LXRβ–/– mice at 1 year of age. In male LXRα–/–β–/– and LXRβ–/– animals, the gonadal fat pad as a percentage of body weight decreased by 80 and 65%, respectively (Fig. 1A). Body weights were not different between genotypes under these conditions (data not shown). Although gonadal fat pads from LXRα–/– animals were not significantly different from wild type mice, there was a trend toward less adipose tissue (Fig. 1A). The weight of other tissues examined, including heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and pancreas, was not changed (data not shown). Histological analyses revealed that the relative size of adipocytes from LXRα–/–β–/– and LXRβ–/– mice was decreased by 60–70% when compared with wild type mice (Fig. 1, B and C). The trend for LXRα–/– mice to have slightly less adipose tissue may be the result of a 30% decrease in adipocyte size (Fig. 1B). Decreased triacylglycerol levels in liver may suggest that adipocyte growth is impaired due to reduced delivery of hepatic triacylglycerol to adipocytes (Table I). The reduced weight of gonadal white adipose tissue in LXRα–/–β–/–, LXRα–/–, and LXRβ–/– is proportional to the decrease in adipocyte size, suggesting that the total number of adipocytes per depot is approximately the same between the different genotypes. Similar results are also observed in female mice (data not shown).Table IAdipokines, glycemia, insulin, and lipids in female wild type, LXRα–/–, LXRβ–/– and LXRα–/–β–/– mice at one year of age (n = 4 to 8)Wild typeLXRβ-/-LXRα-/-β-/-LXRα-/-FedBody weight (g)27.5 ± 1.930.6 ± 2.124.7 ± 2.929.9 ± 1.8Blood glucose (mg/dL)148 ± 14141 ± 13Serum insulin (ng/ml)0.68 ± 0.270.36 ± 0.13 #Hepatic triacylglycerol (mg/g)15.5 ± 3.3511.0 ± 4.3 #12.1 ± 4.6810.2 ± 3.1 #Serum triacylglycerol (mg/dL)136.4 ± 18.8129.4 ± 23.9Serum leptin (ng/ml)0.92 ± 0.190.88 ± 0.570.91 ± 0.440.75 ± 0.53Serum resistin (ng/ml)3.5 ± 1.54.21 ± 1.153.4 ± 0.572.99 ± 0.68Serum adiponectin (μg/ml)13.4 ± 3.813.0 ± 3.710.1 ± 2.9 #11.0 ± 3.8FastedBlood glucose (mg/dL)120 ± 25121 ± 29Serum insulin (ng/ml)0.23 ± 0.090.20 ± 0.07Serum triacylglycerol (mg/dL)154.7 ± 23.0102.9 ± 20.3**Serum non esterified fatty acid (mm)0.69 ± 0.260.53 ± 0.16 Open table in a new tab LXRβ–/– Mice Are Resistant to Diet-induced Obesity—To investigate whether LXRβ is required for diet-induced obesity, female wild type and LXRβ–/– mice were fed a low fat or high fat diet for 6 months. Wild type mice gained ∼12 g more body weight on a high fat diet when compared with a low fat diet; however, LXRβ–/– mice were resistant to this weight gain (Fig. 1D). In wild type mice on a high fat diet, the gonadal fat pad increased by ∼2-fold (Fig. 1E), in large part due to an increase in adipocyte size (Fig. 1F). In contrast, LXRβ–/– mice had less adipose tissue on both a low and a high fat diet (Fig. 1E) and resisted the increase in adipocyte size normally observed with diet-induced obesity (Fig. 1F).To investigate mechanisms whereby adipocyte growth is impaired in LXRβ–/– mice, we quantified expression of a number of adipocyte genes involved in lipid metabolism in mice fed a low fat or a high fat diet (Fig. 1, G and H). No consistent difference was observed in expression of hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin, CD36 (fatty acid translocase), GLUT4, lipoprotein lipase, or cytochrome c mRNAs in gonadal adipose tissue (Fig. 1G; data not shown). Reduced lipid accumulation cannot be explained by expression of lipogenic genes as expression of SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase in the gonadal white adipose tissue of LXRβ–/– mice was not suppressed by a high fat diet. Expression of leptin mRNA was less under both dietary conditions (Fig. 1G). As expected (33Margareto J. Larrarte E. Marti A. Martinez J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1471-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), mice on a high fat diet had increased expression of UCP-1 in gonadal adipose tissue due to adaptive thermogenesis (Fig. 1H). Unexpectedly, we discovered that expression of UCP-1 was increased by a further ∼15-fold in LXRβ–/– mice (Fig. 1H), suggesting that LXRβ normally suppresses expression of UCP-1 expression in white adipose tissue. Thus, uncoupling of mitochondria in adipocytes of LXRβ–/– mice may help confer resistance to the adipocyte growth and weight gains observed in wild type mice fed a high fat diet.LXRβ Is Required for the Increase in Adipocyte Size That Occurs with Aging—To investigate further the adipose phenotype of LXRβ–/– mice, tissues at 2 and 6 months of age were examined. At 2 months of age, LXRβ–/– mice did not show differences in the weight of gonadal fat pads nor in the size of adipocytes (Fig. 2, A and B), again indicating that LXRβ is not required for adipocyte development. Between 2 and 6 months of age, gonadal fat mass of the wild type mice more than doubled (Fig. 2A), due in large part to adipocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the weight of gonadal fat pads and the size of adipocytes in LXRβ–/– mice did not change during this period. Diminished adipocyte hypertrophy in LXRβ–/– mice is not specific to the gonadal fat pad as other visceral depots, such as the perirenal and mesenteric fat depots, do not expand between 2 and 6 months of age (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these data indicate that LXRα and LXRβ are not required for adipogenesis per se, but instead, LXRβ appears to play a specific role in growth of adipocytes.Fig. 2LXRβ is required for the hypertrophy of adipocytes that occurs with aging.A and B, gonadal (GWAT) adipose tissue as a percentage of body weight (%BW) (A) and the relative size of adipocytes in gonadal white adipose tissue (B) for male wild type and LXRβ–/– mice at 2, 6, and 12 months of age.

To investigate effects on energy balance, we analyzed male wild type and LXRβ–/– mice at 6 months of age maintained on a standard chow diet. Under these conditions, LXRβ does not appear to play a role in energy balance as differences in daily food intake or oxygen consumption were not detected (Fig. 3, A and B). Although total oxygen consumption did not differ, further analysis revealed a slight statistical decrease in oxygen consumption in LXRβ–/– mice during the light cycle (data not shown). Consistent with LXRβ not having dramatic effects on energy balance, body weights of wild type and LXRβ–/– mice were not different when compared at 2 months, 6 months, or 1 year (Table I; data not shown). Furthermore, analysis of body composition by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry did not reveal differences in either lean body mass or total body lipid at these ages (Fig. 3, C and D; data not shown). Thus, despite a decrease in lipid stored within adipose tissue depots and within liver (Table I), there appears to be a compensatory increase in lipids elsewhere in the body. Therefore, under standard laboratory conditions, LXRβ does not appear to play a major role in regulation of energy balance or body composition. Although impaired hypertrophy could be due to regulation by LXRβ of a lipogenic gene not examined here or through small effects on many adipocyte genes, reduced adipocyte size could also be an indirect effect through altered metabolism elsewhere within the body.Fig. 3Energy balance and body composition of LXRβ–/– mice. Daily food intake (A) and oxygen consumption (B) were determined for male wild type and LXRβ–/– mice at 6 months of age.

Previously, we have reported that, unexpectedly, a hairpin short interfering RNA specifically targeting human telomerase RNA rapidly inhibits the growth of human cancer cells independently of p53 or telomere length and without bulk telomere shortening (Li, S., Rosenberg, J. E., Donjacour, A. A., Botchkina, I. L., Hom, Y. K., Cunha, G. R., and Blackburn, E. H. (2004) Cancer Res. 64, 4833–4840). Here we have demonstrated that such telomerase RNA knockdown in cancer cells does not cause telomere uncapping but rather induces changes in the global gene expression profile indicative of a novel response pathway, which includes suppression of specific genes implicated in angiogenesis and metastasis, and is distinct from the expression profile changes induced by telomere-uncapping mutant template telomerase RNAs. These cellular responses to depleting telomerase in human cancer cells together suggest that cancer cells are “telomerase-addicted” and uncover functions of telomerase in tumor growth and progression in addition to telomere maintenance.

These cellular responses to depleting telomerase in human cancer cells together suggest that cancer cells are “telomerase-addicted” and uncover functions of telomerase in tumor growth and progression in addition to telomere maintenance. Telomeres are specialized complexes at chromosome tips that protect the chromosomal ends and preserve the stability of the genome (1Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Telomeres are essential not only for chromosome stability but also for complete DNA replication (2Watson J.D. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 239: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The telomeric DNA repeat tracts are maintained by the telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNP, ribonucleoprotein; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interfering; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase; WT, wild-type; MT, mutated; mut, mutant. complex, in which the integral RNA component contains a short sequence that acts as the template for synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats (3Greider C.W.

Nature. 1990; 344: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Lack of telomerase in yeast is sufficient to cause a low but measurable frequency of catastrophic telomere shortening, even when the bulk telomere population is still long (5Chan S.W. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1379-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Only after a delay of tens of generations does the shortening of the bulk of the telomere population eventually trigger a stereotypical cellular response in the majority of the cell population. This response includes a DNA damage response (6Ijpma A.S. Greider C.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 987-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 7Enomoto S. Glowczewski L. Berman J. Mol. Biol.

Genetic inactivation of telomerase in mice causes age- and generation-dependent shortening of their normally very long telomeres accompanied by genetic instability. These phenotypes are only apparent after a significant delay, during which bulk telomere shortening occurs (9Lendvay T.S. Morris D.K. Sah J. Balasubramanian B. Lundblad V.

In cultured human primary cells with low endogenous telomerase, telomeric DNA can be lost from the ends of linear chromosomes at rates of up to 150–200 bp/cell division (14Levy M.Z. Allsopp R.C.

In humans, the core essential components necessary for the reconstitution of telomerase activity in vitro are the catalytic protein subunit hTert and the RNA subunit hTER (also called hTR) (18Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C. Yu J. Le S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B.

The long term importance of the full gene dosage of telomerase RNA is demonstrated by human genetics studies showing that, if one telomerase RNA gene copy is non-functional, this is sufficient to cause an autosomal dominant form of non-X-linked dyskeratosis congenita. Patients with this inherited disease die in early adulthood to middle age primarily because of progressive bone marrow failure. In at least one such family pedigree, the cause is apparently a simple haploinsufficiency for telomerase RNA (13Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Goldman F. Dearlove A. Bessler M. Mason P.J. Dokal I.

In contrast, cancer cells commonly up-regulate telomerase; in 85–90% of human cancers and over 70% of immortalized human cell lines (21Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6458) Google Scholar, 24Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar), telomerase activity is highly elevated by up to 100-fold over the normal counterpart cells (25Hiyama E. Yokoyama T. Tatsumoto N. Hiyama K. Imamura Y. Murakami Y. Kodama T. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W. Matsuura Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3258-3262PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with telomerase conferring a strong selective advantage for continued growth of malignant cells (26Smith L.L. Coller H.A. Roberts J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, in yeasts, a well characterized telomerase-independent Rad52-mediated DNA recombination mechanism can also maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase (27Le S. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Greider C.W. Genetics. 1999; 152: 143-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 29McEachern M.J. Blackburn E.H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8083-8093Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and a small percentage of tumors and immortalized human cell lines can utilize an apparently similar mechanism known as “alternative lengthening of telomeres” (31Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Dalla-Pozza L. Dunham M.A. Reddel R.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Although cells without telomerase can be tumorigenic in mouse xenografts, they have weak metastatic potential (32Chang S. Khoo C.M. Naylor M.L. Maser R.S. DePinho R.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 88-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the frequency and strength of telomerase up-regulation in human cancers, have suggested that telomere maintenance is essential for cancer cell immortalization and, further, that it may be possible to inhibit cancer growth by interfering with telomerase action. Attempts to attenuate telomerase function in cultured human cancer cells have been reported to lead to the expected telomere shortening (33Strahl C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, suppression of cell growth by telomerase inhibition or depletion had previously been predicted to require a long lag period, during which time their telomeres would be progressively shortening. Indeed, when cancer cells were selected to stably overexpress a catalytically inactive form of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) protein, which overwhelms the resident wild-type hTERT and, hence, limits its assembly into active telomerase ribonucleoprotein, there was the expected delay before cell growth inhibition ensued (34Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2388-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 35Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), and the length of the delay was dependent on the initial telomere length (35Hahn W.C. Stewart S.A. Brooks M.W. York S.G. Eaton E. Kurachi A. Beijersbergen R.L. Knoll J.H. Meyerson M. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Similarly, a delay in slowing of cell growth was also seen when telomerase enzymatic activity was inhibited by an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to the telomerase RNA-templating region (36Herbert B. Pitts A.E. Baker S.I. Hamilton S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Corey D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14276-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that a non-messenger RNA, the wild-type human telomerase RNA, hTER, can be efficiently and specifically targeted by a short interfering hairpin RNA construct (hairpin siRNA) (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) expressed from a lentivector. In contrast to the delay previously predicted for any effects of telomerase depletion, we noticed that, unexpectedly, such siRNA expression was sufficient to cause rapid and specific slowing of cancer cell proliferation. Strikingly, these effects occurred without bulk telomere shortening and were independent of wild-type p53 and telomere length. The rapidity of the effect of telomerase depletion caused by this siRNA was consistent with a previous report (38Folini M. Berg K. Millo E. Villa R. Prasmickaite L. Daidone M.G. Benatti U. Zaffaroni N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3490-3494PubMed Google Scholar) in which depleting the telomerase RNP by an independent method (knockdown of hTERT with an antisense oligonucleotide targeting the mRNA for hTERT) caused rapid apoptosis of DU145 prostate cancer cells. Here we have investigated key features of the surprisingly rapid effects of telomerase RNA knockdown in human cancer cells. First, we showed that the anti-telomerase RNA siRNA treatment does not cause any telomere uncapping or DNA damage response, in contrast to the effects of expressing mutant template telomerase RNAs (MT-hTer), which are predicted to cause mutant repeats to be added to telomeres (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and which we showed directly here cause telomere uncapping. The lack of telomere uncapping by the siRNA treatment of cancer cells also contrasted with the telomere uncapping previously reported for primary human cells entering cellular senescence (39Herbig U. Jobling W.A. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 501-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Second, the telomerase RNA knockdown induced changes in the global gene expression profile indicative of a novel response pathway. This pathway is distinct from that induced by the expression of an MT-hTer that caused telomere uncapping. We observed and confirmed rapid down-regulation of expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, including Cyclin G2 and Cdc27. These results uncover a rapid novel response of human cancer cells to depletion of the level of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein. Furthermore, the anti-telomerase RNA siRNA also rapidly lowered the expression of specific genes previously reported to play important roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, such as integrin αV and Met oncogene protein. We have recently reported that metastasis of melanoma cells in an in vivo mouse model is specifically inhibited by knockdown of telomerase RNA using a ribozyme targeting telomerase RNA (40Nosrati M. Li S. Bagheri S. Ginzinger D. Blackburn E.H. Debs R.J. Kashani-Sabet M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 4983-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Together with that finding, these results provide new evidence that telomerase affects gene expression to confer additional pivotal functions in tumor progression other then telomere length maintenance. Plasmid Construction—The three-plasmid-based lentivector system was generously provided by Dr. Didier Trono (41Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3937) Google Scholar). The construction of lentivectors that express MT-hTers and anti-hTER siRNA were described in a previous publication (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The hTert expression vector pBabe-puro-hTert was engineered as described previously (42Kim M.M. Rivera M.A. Botchkina I.L. Shalaby R. Thor A. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7982-7987Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation and Transfection—The 21-nucleotide or 22-nucleotide unmodified synthetic RNAs were chemically synthesized (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO) with a two-nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end. siRNA sequences were as follows: hTER-siRNA-2 (position 44–62) sense, 5′-GUCUAACCCUAACUGAGAAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-UUCUCAGUUAGGGUUAGACUU-3′; hTER-siRNA-3 (position 165–184) sense, 5′-GCAAACAAAAAAUGUCAGCUUU-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCUGACAUUUUUUGUUUGCUU-3′; siRNA-control sense, 5′-GUUCUUGCGAUUGUCUCUAUU-3′; antisense, 5′-UAGAGACAAUCGCAAGAACUU-3′. The 25-nucleotide modified synthetic RNAs (stealth RNAi) were custom synthesized (Invitrogen) without overhang at the 3′ end. Primer sequences were as follows: hTER-siRNA-S2 (position 38–62) sense, 5′-UUUUUUGUCUAACCCUAACUGAGAA-3′; antisense, 5′-UUCUCAGUUAGGGUUAGACAAAAAA-3′; hTER-siRNA-S3 sense, 5′-GAGCAAACAAAAAAUGUCAGCUGCU-3′; antisense, 5′-AGCAGCUGACAUUUUUUGUUUGCUC-3′. Stealth RNAi negative control with low GC content was ordered directly from Invitrogen (catalogue number 12935-200). Transient transfection of synthetic siRNA was achieved using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—The isogenic p53-WT and p53-null HCT116 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, with the wild-type p53 gene being completely disrupted by homologue recombination (43Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). The LOX melanoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The primary fibroblast WI38 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The lentivirus production and infection procedure were described previously (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For cell growth measurements, ~5 × 105 cells were infected with lentivirus as indicated at 10–20 transduction units/cell to achieve >95% infection efficiency. Cells were either unselected or selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin for 24 h before cell counting. ~2 × 104 cells were reseeded in six-well plates at 48 h after virus infection, and the cell numbers were counted every day or every other day for 7 days (for the LOX cells) and 14 days (for the HCT116 cells). For cell growth measurement in HeLa cells, the cells were transiently transfected with various synthetic siRNAs at 10 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, 2 × 104 cells were reseeded in six-well plates, and the cell numbers were counted every other day for 7 days. Telomerase Assays and Telomere and RNA Analyses—Telomerase activity from cell extracts was analyzed using the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay. Telomere length was measured by hybridization of a 32P-labeled (CCCTAA)4 probe to genomic DNA digested with HinfI and RsaI. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For Northern blotting analysis, the RNA samples were separated in 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane. The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes, as indicated, by random primer labeling (Amersham Biosciences). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed with 32P-labeled hTER, 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Cyclin G2, and integrin αV riboprobe as described previously (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Histochemistry—Combinational immunostaining and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (44Kishi S. Zhou X.Z. Ziv Y. Khoo C. Hill D.E. Shiloh Y. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29282-29291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-p53BP1 antibody (BD Biosciences) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peptide nucleic acid telomere repeat probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DNA Microarray—Microarray analysis was performed as described previously (45Rogatsky I. Wang J.C. Derynck M.K. Nonaka D.F. Khodabakhsh D.B. Haqq C.M. Darimont B.D. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13845-13850Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In brief, ~1 μg of total RNA was linearly amplified through one round of modified in vitro transcription and coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters of Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences). The 42,680 cDNAs used in these studies were from the Unigene project (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). On the basis of the Unigene data base build155, these clones represent 29,778 independent genes. Primary data were analyzed using GENEPIX version 3.0 software (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA). Gene expression was linearly normalized in NOMAD (derisilab.ucsf.edu) and analyzed with Cluster (46Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13079) Google Scholar), filtering the dataset for genes changed by at least 2-fold using the average linkage metric and visualized with Java Treeview. Genes were grouped based on their expression pattern. The GENEPIX ratio of median value for each gene was log-transformed for the statistical analysis for microarrays using custom macros that were the kind gift of Anthony Dobson, Univerity of California, San Francisco. In Fig. 4B, each column represents data from one analysis; duplicate analyses for each condition are shown in pairs across the panel. Each row represents the expression pattern of a single gene at all time points analyzed. Gene expression ratios shown in red are up-regulated, and those in green are down-regulated. Gray areas indicate missing data. Anti-telomerase RNA siRNA Rapidly Causes Growth Inhibition with No Bulk Telomere Shortening—As previously reported (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), for efficient delivery and expression of the hairpin siRNA, we utilized a safety-engineered, human immunodeficiency virus-1-based lentiviral system (41Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3937) Google Scholar). The hairpin siRNA was designed to target specifically the sequence encompassing the hTER 11-nucleotide template region, as shown in supplemental Fig. S1. By analysis of the human genome and cDNA databases, we found no other exact matches to the 19-base telomerase RNA-matching siRNA sequence used. To confirm the desired target specificity of the anti-wild-type hTER siRNA, we used a human cell line, VA13, which normally lacks any endogenous hTER and hTert expression (47Guiducci C. Cerone M.A. Bacchetti S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). VA13 cells were first infected with lentivirus expressing either wild-type hTER (WT-hTER) or two different telomerase RNAs bearing mutations engineered into the template region (MT-hTers). Two days later, we superinfected with lentivirus expressing the siRNA targeting wild-type telomerase RNA. Expression of this siRNA effectively and selectively knocked down the level of WT-hTER, with no significant effect on the levels of the mutant template hTers, which only differ from WT-hTER by mutations in the templating region (supplemental Fig. S1B, left); one mutant template telomerase RNA sequence differs from the wild-type by only two bases. This specific reduction of WT-hTER was not due to differential expression of siRNA in cells expressing WT-hTER versus MT-hTer, as Northern hybridization detected comparable amounts of siRNA in all of these cells (supplemental Fig. S1B, right). This specificity of the siRNA for the wild-type template telomerase RNA seen in VA13 cells confirmed, in a different cell line, the results reported previously in endogenously as well as ectopically expressed wild-type template and mutant template telomerase RNAs in HCT116 human colon cancer cells (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We conclude that the hairpin siRNA is specific for the wild-type telomerase RNA subunit. As an independent control, an siRNA mutant (siRNA-mut), engineered to target a sequence unrelated to hTER, was used to confirm whether it is the down-regulation of telomerase activity by hTER targeting that inhibits cell growth specifically. Empty lentiviral vector was infected in parallel to control for any toxicity caused by the lentiviral infection itself. The lentivirus-expressing siRNA targeting endogenous hTER was used to infect a pair of human colon cancer lines, derived from line HCT116, which either have or lack functional p53 but otherwise are isogenic (43Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). The high infection efficiency of the lentivirus (>95%) allowed the rapid evaluation of the cellular effects of expression of the anti-hTER siRNA in the pooled cell population, without the need to delay analysis because of the requirement for selection for a drug resistance gene. This whole-population analysis also eliminated any clone-to-clone variation that might have resulted from analysis of clonal cell cultures. The results showed that any cellular toxicity resulting from lentivirus infection per se was negligible, but the anti-hTER siRNA (not the siRNA-mut) caused rapid cell growth inhibition (Fig. 1, A and B). Notably, as described previously (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), in these isogenic HCT116 cell lines with or without p53, the levels of rapid cell growth inhibition and apoptosis were similar. We used different cancer cell lines to test whether the cancer cell growth inhibition caused by the hTER-targeting siRNA depends on bulk telomere shortening. The human melanoma cell line LOX has very long (>40 kb) telomeres. We reasoned that if the bulk of telomeres need to shorten before the siRNA has an effect on cell growth, we would expect a delay in the effect of the siRNA in LOX cells compared with a cell line with short telomeres, such as the HCT116 cells, which have relatively short (~3–4 kb) telomeres, as reported previously (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). LOX cells were infected with the lentiviruses expressing hTER-targeting siRNA and siRNA-mut or the control empty lentivector. Rapid inhibition of cell growth was observed in LOX cells expressing the hTER-targeting siRNA (Fig. 1C). The rapidity of the cell growth inhibition was similar to that in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1, A and B) (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). There was no growth inhibition in LOX cells infected with the control lentivirus or with the lentivirus-expressing siRNA-mut (Fig. 1C). A second control, unrelated siRNA in the same lentiviral vector tested in the LOX cells, also failed to show any effect on cell growth. 2L. Xu and S. Li, unpublished results. Similar expression of both the hTER-targeting siRNA and siRNA-mut in the LOX cells was confirmed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). The knockdown of endogenous hTER was confirmed by Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 1D, top panel). A decrease in telomerase activity was shown using in vitro telomeric repeat amplification protocol assays (Fig. 1E). Finally, consistent with the results reported for the HCT116 cells expressing the siRNA (37Li S. Rosenberg J.E. Donjacour A.A. Botchkina I.L. Hom Y.K. Cunha G.R. Blackburn E.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4833-4840Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), no bulk telomere shortening of the long LOX cell telomere population was seen (Fig. 1F). We also used Northern blotting to examine the levels of siRNA expression in duplicate cell populations that grew after 14 days post-infection. Those cell populations showed a large overall reduction in anti-hTER siRNA levels in comparison with the cells analyzed 3 days post-infection (data not shown). In contrast, in the control siRNA-mut cells, the siRNA-mut expression showed no reduction after 14 days. For all sampl"

To determine systematically and precisely the location and extent of 1p deletion in neuroblastomas, we performed allelic loss studies of 737 primary neuroblastomas and genotype analysis of 46 neuroblastoma cell lines. Together, the results defined a single region within 1p36.3 that was consistently deleted in 25% of tumors and 87% of cell lines. Two neuroblastoma patients had constitutional deletions of distal 1p36 that overlapped the tumor-defined region. The tumor- and constitutionally-derived deletions together defined a smallest region of consistent deletion (SRD) between D1S2795 and D1S253. The 1p36.3 SRD was deleted in all but one of the 184 tumors with 1p deletion. Physical mapping and DNA sequencing determined that the SRD minimally spans an estimated 729 kb. Genomic content and sequence analysis of the SRD identified 15 characterized, nine uncharacterized, and six predicted genes in the region. The RNA expression profiles of 21 of the genes were investigated in a variety of normal tissues. The SHREW1 and KCNAB2 genes both had tissue-restricted expression patterns, including expression in the nervous system. In addition, a novel gene (CHD5) with strong homology to proteins involved in chromatin remodeling was expressed mainly in neural tissues. Together, these results suggest that one or more genes involved in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis or tumor progression are likely contained within this region."
https://openalex.org/W2000425457,"The lung cancer caused by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) — which killed the world's first cloned mammal Dolly — can be duplicated by the expression of just one structural protein of the virus, Env envelope protein. This is the first example of a structural retroviral tumour-causing protein and is rare if not unique among viruses. Surprisingly, immunodeficient mice expressing Env also develop lung cancer whereas immunocompetent mice rarely do. The immune system can block tumorigenesis: sheep are immunotolerant of the virus, which may explain why JSRV seems not to affect most other animals, including humans. It is thought, however, that lung cancer in humans may be due in part to a JSRV-like retrovirus. These new results will focus the search for such viruses on immunocompromised subjects. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) causes a contagious lung cancer in sheep and goats, with significant animal health and economic consequences1. The host range of JSRV is in part limited by species-specific differences in the virus entry receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2), which is not functional as a receptor in mice but is functional in humans2. Sheep are immunotolerant of JSRV because of the expression of closely related endogenous retroviruses3,4, which are not present in humans and most other species, and this may facilitate oncogenesis. Here we show that expression of the JSRV envelope (Env) protein alone in lungs of mice, by using a replication-incompetent adeno-associated virus vector, results in tumours with a bronchiolo-alveolar localization like those seen in sheep. Whereas lethal disease was observed in immunodeficient mice, tumour development was almost entirely blocked in immunocompetent mice. Our results provide a rare example of an oncogenic viral structural protein, show that interaction of the viral Env protein with the virus entry receptor Hyal2 is not required for tumorigenesis, and indicate that immune recognition of Env can protect against JSRV tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042393861,"Mitochondrial production of peroxides is a critical event in both pathology and redox signaling. Consequently their selective degradation within mitochondria is of considerable interest. Here we have explored the interaction of the peroxidase mimetic ebselen with mitochondria. We were particularly interested in whether ebselen was activated by mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin, in determining whether an ebselen moiety could be targeted to mitochondria by conjugating it to a lipophilic cation, and in exploring the nature of ebselen binding to mitochondrial proteins. To achieve these goals we synthesized 2-[4-(4-triphenylphosphoniobutoxy) phenyl]-1,2-benzisoselenazol)-3(2H)-one iodide (MitoPeroxidase), which contains an ebselen moiety covalently linked to a triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation. The fixed positive charge of TPP facilitated mass spectrometric analysis, which showed that the ebselen moiety was reduced by GSH to the selenol form and that subsequent reaction with a peroxide reformed the ebselen moiety. MitoPeroxidase and ebselen were effective antioxidants that degraded phospholipid hydroperoxides, prevented lipid peroxidation, and protected mitochondria from oxidative damage. Both peroxidase mimetics required activation by mitochondrial GSH or thioredoxin to be effective antioxidants. Surprisingly, conjugation to the TPP cation led to only a slight increase in the uptake of ebselen by mitochondria due to covalent binding of the ebselen moiety to proteins. Using antiserum against the TPP moiety we visualized those proteins covalently attached to the ebselen moiety. This analysis indicated that much of the ebselen present within mitochondria is bound to protein thiols through reversible selenenylsulfide bonds. Both MitoPeroxidase and ebselen decreased apoptosis induced by oxidative stress, suggesting that they can decrease mitochondrial oxidative stress. This exploration has led to new insights into the behavior of peroxidase mimetics within mitochondria and to their use in investigating mitochondrial oxidative damage."

Furthermore, H. pylori strains carrying the cagA gene are more virulent than cagA-negative strains and are associated with the development of gastric adenocarcinoma. The cagA gene product, CagA, is translocated into gastric epithelial cells and localizes to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, in which it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motif. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA specifically binds to and activates Src homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) at the membrane, thereby inducing an elongated cell shape termed the hummingbird phenotype. Accordingly, membrane tethering of CagA is an essential prerequisite for the pathogenic activity of CagA. We show here that membrane association of CagA requires the EPIYA-containing region but is independent of EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation. We further show that specific deletion of the EPIYA motif abolishes the ability of CagA to associate with the membrane. Conversely, reintroduction of an EPIYA sequence into a CagA mutant that lacks the EPIYA-containing region restores membrane association of CagA. Thus, the presence of a single EPIYA motif is necessary for the membrane localization of CagA. Our results indicate that the EPIYA motif has a dual function in membrane association and tyrosine phosphorylation, both of which are critically involved in the activity of CagA to deregulate intracellular signaling, and suggest that the EPIYA motif is a crucial therapeutic target of cagA-positive H. pylori infection.

The clinical outcome of H. pylori infection is dependent on both host and bacterial factors. H. pylori strains carrying the cag gene, which localizes at one end of the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI), a horizontally acquired 40-kbp DNA segment, are associated with increased levels of inflammation and severe atrophic gastritis (7Censini S.

Although SFKs are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, they are N-terminally myristoylated, and this lipid modification facilitates the attachment of SFKs to the membrane. Accordingly, membrane localization of CagA may be required for CagA phosphorylation, or it at least may promote the process by SFKs. Tyrosine phosphorylation sites of CagA are characterized by a Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motif present in its C-terminal variable region (19Selbach M. Moese S. Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Backert S. J.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA specifically binds to Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) or C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and stimulates the enzymatic activity (22Higashi H.

Because both SHP-2 and Csk are involved in intracellular signaling, disturbance of their functions by CagA has been thought to play a role in the development of gastric disorders that are associated with cagA-positive H. pylori infection. In vitro infection of gastric epithelial cells with cagA-positive H. pylori strains, but not cagA-negative strains, induces a unique morphological change that is characterized by an elongation of cell shape (25Segal E.D. Cha J. Lo J. Falkow S. Tompkins L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14559-14564Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The cell morphological change, termed “the hummingbird phenotype,” is associated with cell scattering and increased cell motility (21Backert S. Moese S. Selbach M. Brinkmann V. Meyer T.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Higashi H. Nakaya A. Tsutsumi R. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y. Ishikawa S. Higuchi M. Takahashi A. Kurashima Y. Teishikata Y.

Induction of the hummingbird phenotype is mediated by SHP-2, which is deregulated through CagA-SHP-2 interaction (26Higashi H. Nakaya A. Tsutsumi R. Yokoyama K. Fujii Y. Ishikawa S. Higuchi M.

A constitutively active form of SHP-2 can also induce the hummingbird phenotype, but the morphological change requires membrane association of SHP-2 (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that the plasma membrane recruitment is essential for SHP-2 function and suggests that a primary role of CagA in host cells is to translocate cellular proteins such as SHP-2 from the cytoplasm to the membrane and activate them at the membrane-proximal region. In this sense, CagA functionally mimics mammalian scaffolding adaptor proteins, such as IRS and Gab/Dos family members. Also, CagA has been reported to co-localize with ZO-1 and JAM, components of the junctional complex, and to destroy tight junctions in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells in a manner independent of tyrosine phosphorylation (27Amieva M.R. Vogelmann R. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Nelson W.J. Falkow S. Science. 2003; 300: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that CagA induces junctional dysfunction, which alters epithelial cell permeability and thereby promotes mucosal inflammation. The studies described above indicate that membrane association of CagA is important for the pathogenic action of CagA in gastric epithelial cells. In this work, we investigated the CagA structure that is involved in membrane localization of CagA using a series of CagA mutants. We found that the EPIYA motif, which is known to be the site of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation, is also responsible for the association of CagA with the membrane. We discuss the bifunctional role of the EPIYA motif in membrane localization and tyrosine phosphorylation in the context of CagA pathogenicity.

CagA ΔBCCC[ΔEPIYA], CagA ΔACCC[ΔEPIYA], and CagA ΔABCC[ΔEPIYA] were generated by deleting five amino-acids composing the EPIYA motif from CagA ΔBCCC, CagA ΔACCC, and CagA ΔABCC, respectively.

Proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Millipore) were soaked in solutions of appropriate antibody and then visualized using Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Requirement of the EPIYA-containing Region for Membrane Localization of CagA—To determine the CagA region that is responsible for membrane localization, we made a series of CagA mutants from H. pylori NCTC11637 CagA. NCTC11637 CagA (wild-type CagA) possesses five EPIYA motifs in the C-terminal EPIYA-containing region as schematically depicted in Fig. 1A. We first generated CagA mutants that lack the N-terminal region (CagA ΔN), C-terminal region (CagA N), or EPIYA-containing region (CagA ΔABCCC) by deletion. From the CagA ΔN mutant, we also made additional mutant derivatives, CagA ΔNΔC and CagA ΔNΔABCCC, which lack the C-terminal region and EPIYA-containing region, respectively (Fig. 1A). These CagA mutants were all C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope-tagged and were transiently expressed in AGS human gastric epithelial cells. Expression of these CagA mutants was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1B). Expectedly, CagA mutants possessing the EPIYA-containing region were efficiently phosphorylated, whereas those lacking the EPIYA-repeat region were not (Fig. 1B). Wild-type CagA induces the hummingbird phenotype in AGS cells (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the ability of these CagA mutants to induce the hummingbird phenotype. The CagA ΔN and CagA ΔNΔC mutants were capable of inducing elongation of cells, which was indistinguishable from the elongation of cells induced by wild-type CagA (Fig. 1C, left panel). On the other hand, CagA mutants lacking the EPIYA-containing region failed to induce morphological changes in cells as was shown with phosphorylation-resistant CagA (Fig. 1C, right panel, PR CagA), in which all of the tyrosine residues in the five EPIYA motifs were replaced by phenylalanine residues. These results confirm our previous results showing that CagA induces the hummingbird phenotype in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). We next investigated subcellular localization of each CagA mutant in AGS cells by immunostaining. We found that wild-type CagA, as well as the CagA ΔN and CagA ΔNΔC mutants, both of which retained the ability to induce the hummingbird phenotype, was localized to the plasma membrane. In contrast, CagA ΔNΔABCCC, CagA N, and CagA ΔABCCC, all of which failed to induce the hummingbird phenotype, were primarily detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, right panel). Notably, phosphorylation-resistant CagA, which does not induce the hummingbird phenotype, still retained the ability to localize to the membrane. From these observations, we concluded that stable association of CagA with the membrane requires the EPIYA-repeat region but is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA sites. Determination of EPIYA Segments That Correspond to the Genetic Units of Homologous Recombination—NCTC11637 wild-type CagA contains five EPIYA motifs, which are designated EPIYA-A (one site), EPIYA-B (one site), and EPIYA-C (three sites) based on the sequence surrounding each of the EPIYA motifs (Fig. 2A) (29Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we subdivided the EPIYA-containing region of CagA into the EPIYA-A segment (residues 869–900), the EPIYA-B segment (residues 901–940), and 3 copies of the EPIYA-C segment, a repeatable 34-amino acid sequence that contains the EPIYA-C site (residues 941–974, residues 975–1008, and residues 1009–1042) (Fig. 2B). The border of each segment was determined by comparing sequences of the EPIYA-containing regions, which were made by extensive genetic recombination among various CagA isolates (29Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 30Azuma T. Yamazaki S. Yamakawa A. Ohtani M. Muramatsu A. Suto H. Ito Y. Dojo M. Yamazaki Y. Kuriyama M. Keida Y. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Delineation of EPIYA Sites Involved in CagA-Membrane Interaction—To elucidate which EPIYA site is involved in membrane localization of CagA, we generated a series of CagA mutants that lack the EPIYA segments in various combinations (Fig. 3A). We have already shown that EPIYA-C is the major site of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation in AGS cells (29Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Consistently, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation among the CagA mutants were proportional to the number of EPIYA-C (Fig. 3B). As expected, CagA mutants such as ΔCCC, ΔACCC, and ΔBCCC were much less efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated in AGS cells because they do not possess the EPIYA-C site. We next examined the ability of each EPIYA mutant to interact with the membrane by immunostaining (Fig. 3C). The results indicate that CagA mutants possessing at least a single EPIYA segment are capable of membrane localization. However, there was no difference among EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-C segments in their ability to confer membrane localization upon CagA (Fig. 3C). Hence, EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-C segments have comparable activities to target CagA to the membrane. We also compared membrane association among CagA mutants possessing different numbers of EPIYA-C segment (CagA ΔAB, CagA ΔABC, and CagA ΔABCC) (Fig. 3A). Again, we did not find any quantitative correlation between membrane association of CagA and the number of EPIYA sites. From these observations, we concluded that the presence of a single EPIYA segment is necessary for membrane association of CagA. EPIYA Motif Confers Membrane Localization on CagA—To further elucidate the structural basis for the membrane association of CagA, we compared amino acid sequences among EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-C segments and concluded that the EPIYA motif is the only conserved sequence among the EPIYA segments. Accordingly, we suspected that the five-amino acid sequence is responsible for membrane association of CagA. CagA ΔBCCC, CagA ΔACCC, and CagA ΔABCC mutants possess a single EPIYA segment and localize to the membrane. To address the above possibility, we specifically deleted the EPIYA sequence from these CagA mutants and examined their membrane localization in AGS cells (Fig. 4, A and B). As shown in Fig. 4C, deletion of the EPIYA motif abolished membrane interaction of these CagA mutants. The results indicate that the EPIYA sequence itself is required for membrane association of CagA. To further substantiate the conclusion, we made CagA ΔABCCC+EPIYA and CagA ΔABCCC+3EPIYA mutants, in which the entire EPIYA-repeat region (amino acids 869–1086) was replaced with a single copy and three copies of the EPIYA sequence, respectively, and expressed the mutants in AGS cells (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast to CagA ΔABCCC, which exclusively localized in the cytoplasm, both of the CagA mutants exhibited membrane localization (Fig. 5C). Again, in this case, the CagA mutants with a single and triple EPIYA sequence exhibited comparable levels of membrane localization, indicating that the presence of a single EPIYA motif is necessary and sufficient for membrane association of CagA. We concluded from these observations that the EPIYA motif is a membrane localization signal of H. pylori CagA in gastric epithelial cells.Fig. 5Introduction of the EPIYA motif restores membrane localization of a CagA mutant that lacks the EPIYA-containing region.A, a schematic view of CagA ΔABCCC, CagA ΔABCCC+EPIYA, and CagA ΔABCCC+3EPIYA. ΔABCCC+EPIYA and ΔABCCC+3EPIYA mutants were made by replacing the entire EPIYA-containing region (amino acid residues 869–1086) with a single repeat or triple repeats of the EPIYA sequence, respectively. All CagA constructs were HA-tagged at the C terminus. Black boxes indicate locations of the EPIYA motif in CagA. B, AGS cells were transfected with the indicated construct, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with antibody to HA or phosphotyrosine (anti-pY).

Scale bars indicate 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, we investigated whether the EPIYA motif can specify the membrane localization of an unrelated cytoplasmic protein. To do so, we introduced the EPIYA sequence into a constitutive active mutant of SHP-2, SHP-2ΔSH2-Myc, which lacks the N-terminal SH2 domains and therefore localizes exclusively in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 6A). As has been reported previously, addition of the myristoylation signal to the N-terminal region of the SHP-2 mutant directed membrane localization (22Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Muto S. Sugiyama T. Azuma T. Asaka M. Hatakeyama M. Science. 2002; 295: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). On the other hand, addition of the EPIYA motif to the N-terminal region of the SHP-2 mutant did not specify membrane association (Fig. 6B). The result indicates that the EPIYA motif per se is not sufficient to direct membrane localization of unrelated proteins. Upon translocation into gastric epithelial cells, CagA localizes to the plasma membrane, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at EPIYA sites so as to generate docking sites for cellular proteins such as SHP-2 and Csk (31Hatakeyama M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Both SHP-2 and Csk are cytoplasmic proteins, and they are activated upon membrane recruitment. Accordingly, membrane localization is an essential prerequisite for CagA to deregulate intracellular signaling. CagA also associates with tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and JAM, and disturbs junctional functions (27Amieva M.R. Vogelmann R. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Nelson W.J. Falkow S. Science. 2003; 300: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Again, in this case, membrane localization is crucial for CagA to interact with junctional complexes. In this work, we investigated the CagA region that is responsible for membrane association and found that the EPIYA motif is a membrane-targeting sequence of CagA. We confirmed the essential role of EPIYA in membrane association by both deletion and insertion of the EPIYA sequence in CagA. However, we also note that the EPIYA motif is insufficient to direct membrane localization of unrelated proteins. The result indicates that another CagA structure is required in addition to the EPIYA motif to make a stable association of CagA with the membrane. The EPIYA motif has already been shown to be the site of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (19Selbach M. Moese S. Hauck C.R. Meyer T.F. Backert S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6775-6778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 20Stein M. Bagnoli F. Halenbeck R. Rappuoli R. Fantl W.J. Covacci A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). However, the results of the present study rule out the possibility of a role of EPIYA phosphorylation in CagA-membrane interaction because substitution of the tyrosine residue with the nonphosphorylatable phenylalanine residue did not affect the ability of CagA to associate with the membrane. Given that virtually all of the CagA isolates possess multiple EPIYA sites, a dual role of the EPIYA motif in membrane integration and tyrosine phosphorylation is intriguing. Because the presence of a single EPIYA motif has been shown to be sufficient for the membrane association of CagA, one of the multiple EPIYA sites may be utilized for membrane tethering of CagA, whereas others are employed for signal generation though interacting with cellular proteins such as SHP-2. The EPIYA sites of CagA are subclassified into EPIYA-A, -B, -C, and -D based on the sequences surrounding individual EPIYA motifs. A prevalent form of CagA species isolated in Europe, North America, Africa, and Australia is the “A-B-C” type CagA (Western CagA), whereas that in East Asia is the “A-B-D” type CagA (East Asian CagA) based on the composition of EPIYA sites (30Azuma T. Yamazaki S. Yamakawa A. Ohtani M. Muramatsu A. Suto H. Ito Y. Dojo M. Yamazaki Y. Kuriyama M. Keida Y. Higashi H. Hatakeyama M. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 32Yamaoka Y. Osato M.S. Sepulveda A.R. Gutierrez O. Figura N. Kim J.G. Kodama T. Kashima K. Graham D.Y. Epidemiol.

We previously reported that EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D sites are major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in Western and East Asian CagA species, respectively, and that SHP-2 specifically interacts with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D site (29Higashi H. Tsutsumi R. Fujita A. Yamazaki S. Asaka M. Azuma T. Hatakeyama M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, it should be also noted that EPIYA-A and EPIYA-B sites are conserved virtually in all CagA isolates, whereas there are some CagA species that contain neither an EPIYA-C site nor EPIYA-D site. The observations indicate that EPIYA-A and EPIYA-B sites are also important in the function of CagA, and the present work suggests that EPIYA-A or EPIYA-B site is primarily responsible for membrane association of CagA. The present work raises the possibility that the EPIYA motif binds a cellular protein that tethers CagA to the membrane in a manner independent of EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation. Notably, ZO-1, a component of the tight junction, has been reported to associate with CagA in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells independent of CagA phosphorylation (27Amieva M.R. Vogelmann R. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Nelson W.J. Falkow S. Science. 2003; 300: 1430-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a junctional component protein such as ZO-1 may be a potential candidate that tethers CagA to the membrane, although we could not demonstrate a direct complex formation between CagA and ZO-1 in cells. 2S. Ren, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observation. In addition to this basal CagA activity, a fraction of the CagA species may have developed additional pathological activity that disturbs intracellular signaling in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner through acquisition of an EPIYA-C or EPIYA-D site. It has also been reported that CagA is enriched in a lipid raft through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence present in the EPIYA-containing region (34Asahi M. Tanaka Y. Izumi T. Ito Y. Naiki H. Kersulyte D. Tsujikawa K. Saito M. Sada K. Yanagi S. Fujikawa A. Noda M. Itokawa Y. Helicobacter. 2003; 8: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because translocation of CagA to a lipid raft was shown to be dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA, the ITAM-like sequence is not likely to be involved in the CagA-membrane interaction. Also, c-Met hepatocyte growth factor receptor has been reported to associate with CagA in cells (35Churin Y. Al-Ghoul L. Kepp O. Meyer T.F. Birchmeier W. Naumann M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The interaction was independent of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation, although c-Met phosphorylation, which is caused by treatment of cells with hepatocyte growth factor or H. pylori infection, was required. However, we detected neither tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met nor physical interaction between CagA and c-Met in cagA-transfected AGS cells, arguing against the involvement of c-Met in membrane association of CagA. 3H. Higashi, Y. Fujii, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observation. There remains the possibility that membrane association of CagA involves direct interaction of the EPIYA motif with lipid components of the membrane, although we do not have any evidence that supports this idea. Further elucidation of molecular mechanisms involved in membrane association of CagA will not only improve our understanding of cagA-positive H. pylori-induced gastroduodenal disorders but also facilitate identification of potential therapeutic targets. Specific inhibition of EPIYA-mediated membrane association of CagA should prevent development of gastric pathological changes caused by cagA-positive H. pylori infection, which eventually lead to gastric adenocarcinoma."

We confirmed that hSPCA2 has the ability to transport Ca2+, demonstrated its Mn2+-transporting activity, showed its Ca2+- and Mn2+-dependent phosphoprotein intermediate formation, and documented the insensitivity of these functional activities to thapsigargin inhibition. The mRNA encoding hSPCA2 showed a limited tissue expression pattern mainly confined to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, prostate, thyroid, salivary, and mammary glands. Immunocytochemical localization in human colon sections presented a typical apical juxtanuclear Golgi-like staining.

We and others have identified three upstream kinases, Pak1, Tos3, and Elm1, that phosphorylate the activation loop threonine Thr-210 of the Snf1 catalytic subunit and thereby activate Snf1 protein kinase (18Hong S-P.

These three kinases have overlapping functions in vivo, and all three genes must be deleted to abolish Snf1 catalytic function and cause a Snf– phenotype (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D.

Elm1 also has roles in controlling cell morphology, cell cycle progression, and filamentous invasive growth (21Cullen P.J. Sprague Jr., G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These yeast kinases led to the identification of a mammalian homolog, the LKB1 tumor suppressor kinase, as an AMPK kinase (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Snf1 and AMPK are highly conserved, and Tos3 and Elm1 activated AMPK in vitro (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C.

Their closest mammalian homolog, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK), was known to activate AMPK in vitro but did not correspond to the major AMPK kinase activity detected in the liver (26Hawley S.A.

We therefore focused on LKB1 and showed that LKB1 phosphorylates Thr-172 in the activation loop of the catalytic subunit and activates AMPK in vitro (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Subsequent work verified that LKB1 is an AMPK kinase in vivo (27Woods A. Johnstone S.R.

Alitalo K. Henkemeyer M. Makela T.P. Science. 2001; 293: 1323-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, the relationship of AMPK to these phenotypes is not clear, as recent work shows that LKB1 activates 12 AMPK-related kinases (33Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). AMPK kinases are potentially important targets in the AMPK pathway for therapeutic intervention. Here we have used the yeast system, which offers the advantages of powerful genetics, for functional analysis of the Snf1/AMPK kinase family. We first tested LKB1 for heterologous function in yeast lacking the native Snf1-activating kinases and show that LKB1 activates Snf1 catalytic activity and confers a Snf+ growth phenotype. These findings indicate that the Snf1/AMPK kinase cascade is conserved between yeast and mammals. We therefore used the yeast system to test the function of CaMKK as an activating kinase in vivo. There are two isoforms of CaMKK, α and β (34Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 35Corcoran E.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2975-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We show that rat brain CaMKKα (36Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) activates Snf1 protein kinase in pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ mutant yeast, indicating that CaMKKα is a functional member of the Snf1/AMPK kinase family. These findings support CaMKKα as a likely candidate for an AMPK kinase in mammalian cells. Finally, we took advantage of the heterologous function of LKB1 and CaMKKα to probe mechanisms regulating the catalytic activity and the subcellular localization of Snf1 protein kinase in yeast. We present evidence that a mechanism independent of the activating kinases mediates glucose signaling and that Pak1 functions in another capacity, besides activating Snf1, to regulate the nuclear enrichment of Snf1 protein kinase in response to carbon stress. The potential use of the yeast system to identify additional mammalian AMPK kinases by genetic selection is discussed. Strains—S. cerevisiae strains were W303-1A (MATa ura3 trp1 ade2 his3 can1 leu2) and its derivatives MCY5138 (MATα pak1Δ::kanMX4 tos3Δ::kanMX4 elm1Δ::ADE2 ura3 trp1 ade2 his3 can1 leu2), MCY4908 (W303-1A snf1Δ10), MCY4034 (W303-1A reg1Δ::HIS3), and MCY5162 (MATa reg1Δ::HIS3 pak1Δ::kanMX4 tos3Δ::kanMX4 elm1Δ::ADE2 ura3 trp1 ade2 his3 can1 leu2). Synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking appropriate supplements was used to select for plasmids. Plasmids—cDNA clones of mouse LKB1 and LKB1D194A (D194A mutation) and rat CaMKKα (36Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) were gifts of D. Carling and H. Tokumitsu and T. R. Soderling, respectively. pRH117, pRH118, and pRH123 expressed N-terminal triple hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged LKB1, LKB1D194A, and CaMKKα, respectively, from the yeast ADH1 promoter of vector pWS93 (37Song W. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5757-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). pRH133 was derived from pRH123 by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce a mutation changing Asp-293 to Ala. pRH105 expressed HA-tagged Tos3 from pWS93, and pRH104 and pRH131 expressing HA-tagged Pak1 and Pak1D295A, respectively, have been described (38Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mouse STRADα and MO25α cDNAs (Open Biosystems) were cloned into pLexA202+PL (39Ruden D.M. Ma J. Li Y. Wood K. Ptashne M. Nature. 1991; 350: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and pBTM116 (40Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar), respectively, to construct pRH125 and pRH127 expressing LexA-tagged proteins from the ADH1 promoter. Assay of Snf1 Kinase Activity by Phosphorylation of SAMS Peptide— Cells were grown in SC with 2% glucose to an A600 of 1, collected by filtration, incubated in SC with 0.05% glucose for 30 min, and collected by filtration. Extracts were prepared from two independent cultures, and assays for phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide (HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR; SAMS peptide) (41Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were performed as described (15Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using different protein concentrations to confirm linearity. Control reactions lacked the SAMS peptide. Kinase activity is expressed as nanomoles of phosphate incorporated into the peptide per minute per milligram of protein (41Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Assay of Phosphorylation of Snf1 Catalytic Domain—The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged mutant Snf1 catalytic domains Snf1KD-K84R and Snf1KD-T210A were bacterially expressed from pRH85 and pRH122, respectively, in vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant proteins were purified from protein extracts (42Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7002-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) using ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography on GSTrap resin (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 10 mm glutathione. Cultures of MCY5138 expressing each Snf1-activating kinase were grown in SC with 2% glucose, shifted to 0.05% glucose for 30 min, and collected as described above. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from extracts (300 μg) as described (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) by using anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and incubated with GST or GST-Snf1KD proteins (3.0 μg) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm ATP containing 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 25 °C. Assays of CaMKKα also contained 10 μm calmodulin. Immunoblot Analysis—Extracts for immunoblot analysis were prepared by boiling cells and vortexing with glass beads (43Vincent O. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6672-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Snf1 (14Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), anti-LexA (Invitrogen), or monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5). Antibody was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). LKB1 Restores Growth of the pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ Mutant on Raffinose—The pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ triple mutant lacks the native Snf1-activating kinases and therefore fails to grow on raffinose or glycerol-ethanol, the utilization of which requires Snf1 activity (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To test the ability of LKB1 to function in yeast, we expressed HA-tagged LKB1 in pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells. LKB1 restored slow growth on raffinose, whereas the kinase-dead mutant LKB1D194A did not, indicating dependence on the catalytic activity (Fig. 2A). Expression of LKB1 and LKB1D194A was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown), and control transformants expressing Pak1 and kinase-dead Pak1D295A (38Hedbacker K. Hong S.P. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8255-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showed the expected growth phenotypes. To exclude the possibility that LKB1 simply bypasses the requirement for Snf1, we expressed LKB1 in the snf1Δ mutant. LKB1 did not restore growth (data not shown; see Fig. 2C), indicating that complementation of the triple mutant defect depends on the presence of Snf1. Coexpression of STRADα and MO25α Improves LKB1 Function in Yeast—In mammalian cells LKB1 functions in a complex with two other proteins, the pseudokinase STRAD and MO25 (29Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Baas A.F. Boudeau J. Sapkota G.P. Smit L. Medema R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Clevers H.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3062-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 45Boudeau J. Baas A.F. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Kieloch A. Schutkowski M. Prescott A.R. Clevers H.C. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5102-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). To determine whether these proteins similarly contribute to the function of LKB1 as a Snf1 protein kinase kinase, we coexpressed LexA-tagged STRADα and/or MO25α with LKB1 in the pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ mutant; expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Coexpression of STRADα with LKB1 improved growth on raffinose, and coexpression of both STRADα and MO25α with LKB1 allowed growth on glycerol-ethanol as well as raffinose (Fig. 2B). Growth was dependent on Snf1 and did not occur in the snf1Δ mutant (Fig. 2C). The enhancement of growth by STRADα and MO25α depended on LKB1 catalytic activity, as no growth was observed with kinase-dead LKB1D194A (Fig. 2B). Immunoblot analysis showed that coexpression of STRADα and MO25α resulted in higher levels of LKB1, suggesting that formation of the LKB1-STRADα-MO25α complex stabilizes LKB1 in yeast (Fig. 2D). Although it remains formally possible that LKB1 functions alone rather than as part of this complex, these results suggest that the ability of the LKB1-STRADα-MO25α complex to function in the Snf1/AMPK kinase cascade has been conserved from mammals to yeast. LKB1 Activates Snf1 Protein Kinase in Vivo—To demonstrate biochemically that LKB1 functions in yeast to activate Snf1 protein kinase, we assayed Snf1 catalytic activity by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (15Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Davies S.P. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Triple mutant cells expressing the mammalian kinase were subjected to glucose limitation to activate Snf1 protein kinase. Snf1 was then partially purified from cell extracts and incubated with SAMS peptide in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. This assay is specific for Snf1 activity in yeast, and no activity is detected in the snf1Δ mutant (15Woods A. Munday M.R. Scott J. Yang X. Carlson M. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19509-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Expression of LKB1 in pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells elevated Snf1 activity relative to the vector and LKB1D194A controls (Fig. 3A). The modest effect on catalytic activity was consistent with the modest effect on growth. Moreover, triple mutant cells coexpressing LKB1, STRADα, and MO25α showed higher Snf1 catalytic activity than cells coexpressing LKB1 and the two respective vectors (Fig. 3B), as expected from their growth phenotypes (Fig. 2B). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of equivalent amounts of Snf1 protein in the assayed fractions (Fig. 3C). LKB1 Phosphorylates Snf1 on the Activation Loop Threonine in Vitro—LKB1 activates AMPK by phosphorylation of the conserved Thr-172 in the activation loop region (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To determine whether LKB1 phosphorylates the analogous residue of Snf1, Thr-210, we used as substrates two recombinant inactive forms of the Snf1 catalytic domain, GST-Snf1KD-T210A and GST-Snf1KD-K84R (Lys-84 is the conserved residue of the ATP-binding site) (Fig. 4). HA-LKB1 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells that coexpressed STRADα and MO25α, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. LKB1 phosphorylated GST-Snf1KD-K84R strongly and phosphorylated GST-Snf1KD-T210A much more weakly, indicating that Thr-210 is the major site of phosphorylation (Fig. 4). Coomassie Blue staining of the gel confirmed that the amounts of the two substrates were the same (Fig. 4). In control experiments, HA-Tos3 phosphorylated Snf1KD-K84R but not Snf1KD-T210A, as expected (18Hong S-P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitates from cells expressing HA alone showed no phosphorylation of either substrate (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that LKB1 functions in yeast to phosphorylate Thr-210 and activate Snf1 protein kinase. CaMKKα Restores Growth of the pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ Mutant on Raffinose and Glycerol-Ethanol—CaMKK, like LKB1, is homologous to Pak1, Tos3, and Elm1 and, in fact, shows greater sequence similarity. Hawley et al. (26Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) showed many years ago that a preparation of CaMKK from pig brain activated AMPK in vitro but that CaMKK did not correspond to the major AMPK kinase in rat liver, which is now known to be LKB1 (27Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr.

Biol. 2003; 2: 28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that mammals, like yeast, may have multiple AMPK kinases, and CaMKK seemed a likely candidate to be a member of the Snf1/AMPK kinase family. We therefore used yeast as a convenient model system to test its function as an activating kinase in vivo. Using a cloned rat brain cDNA encoding the CaMKKα isoform (36Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), we expressed HA-tagged CaMKKα in the pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ mutant. We first tested its ability to restore the Snf+ growth phenotype. CaMKKα very effectively restored growth on both raffinose and glycerol-ethanol (Fig. 2A). The kinase-dead mutant CaMKKαD293A was expressed (data not shown; see Fig. 4C) but did not confer growth (Fig. 2A), indicating that catalytic activity is required. Restoration of growth was dependent on the presence of Snf1, as expression of CaMKKα had no effect in the snf1Δ mutant (Fig. 2C). Immunoblot analysis showed that HA-CaMKKα was expressed at substantially higher levels than HA-LKB1 (data not shown), which may contribute to its effective function in yeast. CaMKKα Activates Snf1 Protein Kinase in Vivo and Phosphorylates Snf1 on Thr-210 in Vitro—To show that CaMKKα activates Snf1 protein kinase in yeast cells, we assayed Snf1 catalytic activity by phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide, as described above. Expression of CaMKKα conferred significant catalytic activity to Snf1 protein kinase (Fig. 3A), roughly half of that found in triple mutant cells expressing HA-Pak1 or in wild-type cells (see Fig. 5A). In control experiments, kinasedead CaMKKαD293A and Pak1D295A did not activate Snf1. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of equivalent amounts of Snf1 protein in the assayed fractions (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that CaMKKα functions as a Snf1-activating kinase in yeast. Previous studies showed that pig brain CaMKK activated AMPK in vitro but did not determine the site of phosphorylation (26Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27186-27191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of CaMKKα to phosphorylate Thr-210 of Snf1. HA-CaMKKα was immunoprecipitated from extracts of pak1Δ tos3Δ elm1Δ cells and incubated with substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. CaMKKα phosphorylated Snf1KD-K84R more strongly than it phosphorylated Snf1KD-T210A (Fig. 4) and did not phosphorylate GST alone (data not shown). The kinase-dead control CaMKKαD293A was immunopreci"
https://openalex.org/W2149696442,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) main protease represents an attractive target for the development of novel anti-SARS agents. The tertiary structure of the protease consists of two distinct folds. One is the N-terminal chymotrypsin-like fold that consists of two structural domains and constitutes the catalytic machinery; the other is the C-terminal helical domain, which has an unclear function and is not found in other RNA virus main proteases. To understand the functional roles of the two structural parts of the SARS-CoV main protease, we generated the full-length of this enzyme as well as several terminally truncated forms, different from each other only by the number of amino acid residues at the C- or N-terminal regions. The quaternary structure and Kd value of the protease were analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The results showed that the N-terminal 1–3 amino acid-truncated protease maintains 76% of enzyme activity and that the major form is a dimer, as in the wild type. However, the amino acids 1–4-truncated protease showed the major form to be a monomer and had little enzyme activity. As a result, the fourth amino acid seemed to have a powerful effect on the quaternary structure and activity of this protease. The last C-terminal helically truncated protease also exhibited a greater tendency to form monomer and showed little activity.

The genome of SARS-CoV is ∼30,000 nucleotides in length, and the organization is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, polyprotein 1a (∼450 kDa) and polyprotein 1ab (∼750 kDa). The polyproteins are cleaved by the internally encoded main protease (Mpro, 3CL), which is required for the production of new infectious viruses. The main protease represents an attractive target for the development of novel anti-viral agents due to the functional importance of this enzyme in the viral life cycle (9Holmes K.V. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Kesel A.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11: 4599-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Thiel V. Ivanov K.A.

The crystal structures of reported CoV, including the SARS-CoV main proteases, are homodimers (13Anand K. Palm G.J. Mesters J.R. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Hilgenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 14Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Each protomer of the main protease is composed of three structural domains (Fig. 1). The first two domains of the SARS-CoV main protease have an antiparallel β-barrel structure, which is similar to the other CoV proteases, and form a chymotrypsin-like fold responsible for catalytic reactions (15Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G.F. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). The active site containing a catalytic dyad defined by His-41 and Cys-145 is located between domains I and II. The third domain contains five α-helices with an unclear biological function. The domain III of one protomer and the domain II of another form a contacting region in the dimer. The N terminus (N-finger containing amino acid residues 1–7) is seated at this region and plays an important role in dimerization (16Bacha U. Barrila J. Velazquez-Campoy A. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4906-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the major quaternary structure of SARS-CoV main protease at neutral pH is a dimer, which is the catalytically competent form (17Chou C.Y. Chang H.C. Hsu W.C. Lin T.Z. Lin C.H. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14958-14970Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is ultimately important to understand the factors that control dimerization, as the dissociated monomer could be enzymatically inactive. The C-terminal helical domain interacts with the active site of another protomer in the dimer and switches the enzyme molecule from the inactive form to the active form (18Shi J. Wei Z. Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24765-24773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The structural and biochemical data also show that the N-terminal residues 1–7 play an important role in the dimerization and formation of the active site of SARS main protease (15Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G.F. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). N-terminal truncation of the whole N-finger, Δ(1–7) results in almost complete loss of enzymatic activity (19Chen S. Chen L. Tan J. Chen J. Du L. Sun T. Shen J. Chen K. Jiang H. Shen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 164-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this report, we studied critically the functional role of the N and C termini by serial truncations. We report the stability and structure-function relationship of the full-length SARS-CoV main protease in comparison with the various truncated forms. Our results demonstrate that both N- and C-terminal regions are involved in the enzyme activity as well as in dimerization. We have narrowed down the critical amino acid residues to the fourth amino acid residue of the N-terminal and the last helical amino acids of the C-terminal region as those involved in dimerization to give a correct conformation of the active site. Construction of WT and N- and C-terminally Truncated SARS-CoV Main Proteases—The plasmids containing the full-length main protease were kindly provided by Dr. Shao-Hung Wang (Genome Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan). The genes of the full-length SARS-CoV main protease were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers. The forward primer for the full-length WT SARS-CoV main protease was 5′-GGTGGTCATATGAGTGGTTTTAGG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AACTCGAGGGTAACACCAGAG-3′. After digestion with BglII and XhoI, the PCR product was cut into two fragments, 168 and 747 bp. The 168-bp fragment was then digested with NdeI. Finally, the 168-bp NdeI-BglII and 747-bp BglII-XhoI fragments were co-ligated to the NdeI and XhoI sites of the vector pET-29a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The N-terminally truncated proteases were made by PCR. The forward primers were as follows: Δ(1–3), 5′-GGAGATATACATATGAGGAAAATGGCATTC-3′; Δ(1–4), 5′-GGAGATATACATATGAAAATGGCATTCCCG-3′; Δ(1–5), 5′-GGAGATATACATATGATGGCATTCCCGTCA-3′; Δ(1–6), 5′-GGAGATATACATATGGCATTCCCGTCAGGC-3′; and Δ(1–7), 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTTCCCGTCAGGCAAA-3′. The reverse mutagenic primers were as follows: Δ(1–3), 5′-GAATGCCATTTTCCTCATATGTATATCTCC-3′; Δ(1–4), 5′-CGGGAATGCCATTTTCATATGTATATCTCC-3′; Δ(1–5), 5′-TGACGGGAATGCCATCATATGTATATCTCC-3′; Δ(1–6), 5′-GCCTGACGGGAATGCCATATGTATATCTCC-3′; and Δ(1–7), 5′-TTTGCCTGACGGGAACATATGTATATCTCC-3′. The pET-SARS-CoV main protease vector was used as the template. The DNA polymerase Pfu (Promega, Madison, WI) extended and incorporated the mutagenic primers in the process of PCR. After 16–18 temperature cycles, the N-terminally truncated plasmid containing staggered nicks was generated. The PCR products were then treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to digest the template. Finally, the vector containing the protease cDNA with the desired mutation was transformed into Escherichia coli. The C-terminally truncated proteases were subsequently amplified by PCR using the following sequences. The forward primer, 5′-TGAAGATCTGCTCATTCGCAA-3′; reverse primer of Δ(293–306), 5′-AACTCGACTGTAAACTCATCTTC-3′; reverse primer of Δ(201–306), 5′-AACTCGACTATGGTTGTGTCTG-3′. After digestion with BglII and XhoI, the PCR products were inserted into the BglII and XhoI sites of the pET-SARS-CoV main protease. The DNA sequences of the full-length, N- and C-terminally truncated SARS-CoV main proteases were checked by autosequencing. The recombinant SARS-CoV main protease has a His tag at the C terminus. This His tag was not removed, because earlier reports seemed to rule out the possible effect of the His tag on the dimeric structure or enzyme activity (17Chou C.Y. Chang H.C. Hsu W.C. Lin T.Z. Lin C.H. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14958-14970Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of WT and N- and C-terminally Truncated SARS-CoV Main Proteases—The modified plasmids of the recombinant proteases were transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)-competent cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.8 and were then induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside at 18 °C overnight. The cells were centrifuged at 5,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pelleted cells were then suspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 2 mm BME, pH 7.6). The cells were sonicated for 10 min at 10-s burst cycles at 300 W with a 10-s cooling period between each burst. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g at 4 °C for 25 min). One ml of binding buffer-equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was then added to the soluble lysate, and the solution was mixed gently at 4 °C for 50 min to equilibrium. The lysate-nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid mixture was then loaded into a column and washed with the washing buffer (20 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 2 mm BME, pH 7.6). Finally, the protease was eluted with elution buffer (400 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 2 mm BME, pH 7.6). The purified protein was then concentrated at 4 °C using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with molecular mass cutoff at 10 kDa. The purified protein was concentrated to 5–15 mg/ml and then diluted to 0.5–3 mg/ml by 10 mm PBS (containing 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm BME, pH 7.6), which was used to replace the elution buffer over six concentration-dilution cycles. The sample from the purification step was separated on a 4–12% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel to check the homogeneity. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Fluorescence Analyses—CD experiments were performed in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 water-circulated thermal controller. The samples were prepared in 10 mm PBS solution at pH 7.6 with a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Far-UV CD spectra from 250 to 190 nm were collected using a 0.01-cm path-length cuvette with a 0.1-nm spectral resolution at 25 °C. Ten independent scans were averaged for each sample. All spectra were corrected for buffer contributions and converted to mean residue ellipticity ([Θ]). The [Θ] at each wavelength was calculated from Equation 1, [Θ]=MRW⋅θλ10⋅l⋅c(Eq. 1) where MRW is the mean residue weight (a value of 111.3 was used for the WT), θλ is the measured ellipticity in degree at wavelength λ, l is the cuvette path length (0.01 cm), and c is the protein concentration in g/ml. The secondary structure analysis was performed by DICHROWEB (20Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 21Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar), which provides an interactive web site server allowing the deconvolution of data from circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments (public-1.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb/html/). DICHROWEB offers several important types of software, such as CDSSTR (22Compton L.A. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 23Manavalan P.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Thermal stability of the WT and various truncated mutants were analyzed with a spectropolarimeter by monitoring the 222-nm circular dichroism at the temperature range between 30 and 90 °C, and the temperature at which half of the protein molecules were unfolded was recorded (Tm). Fluorescence experiments were performed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B luminescence spectrometer (Beaconsfield, Backinghamshire, England). The sample was prepared in 10 mm PBS solution at pH 7.6 with a protein concentration of 8 μg/ml. The fluorescence emission spectra from 300 to 400 nm were collected after excitation at 280 nm. Fluorescence spectra of proteins were determined with a 1-cm path quartz cuvette at 25 °C. The spectral bandwidth was 5 nm for excitation and 10 nm for emission. All spectra were corrected for the buffer contribution. The average emission wavelength (〈λ〉) was calculated from Equation 2 (30Sanchez del Pino M.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), 〈λ〉=∑i=λ1λN(Fi⋅λi)∑i=λ1λNFi(Eq. 2) where F is the fluorescence intensity and λ is the wavelength. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analysis—The molar mass and sedimentation coefficient of the proteases were analyzed by a sedimentation velocity experiment. It was performed on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical Ultracentrifuge (Fullerton, CA). Prior to the experiments, the sample was diluted to various protein concentrations with 10 mm PBS buffer at pH 7.6. Sample (400 μl) and buffer (440 μl) solutions were loaded into the double sector centerpiece separately. All experiments were carried out at 20 °C with an An50 rotor at the speed of 42,000 revolutions/min. The proteins were measured by UV absorbance at 280 nm in a continuous mode with a time interval of 480 s. The recorded scans at different time points were collected and fitted to a continuous size distribution model by the SEDFIT program (31Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar, 32Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P.

The observed sedimentation profiles of a continuous size distribution (c(s)) can be calculated from Equation 3, a(r,t)=∫c(s)L(s,D,r,t)ds+ε(Eq. 3) where a(r,t) denotes the experimentally observed signal, L(s,D,r,t) denotes the solution of the Lamm equation for a single species (35Lamm O. Ark. Mat. Astr. Fys. 1929; 21B: 1-4Google Scholar), and ϵ is the noise component. For a precise determination of the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the SARS-CoV main protease, the sedimentation velocity experiment was performed at three different protein concentrations, and all sedimentation data were subjected to the monomer-dimer equilibrium model fitting. The partial specific volume of the protease, solvent density, and viscosity were calculated by the software program SEDNTERP (36Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelleter S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar). The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated by the global modeling of the SEDPHAT program (33Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Activity Assay of the SARS-CoV Main Protease Using a Fluorogenic Substrate—The kinetic measurements of the SARS-CoV main protease activity were performed in 10 mm PBS with 2 mm BME at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 12 μg of WT and 1.5–2.0 mg of mutants in 1 ml of reaction mixture. Enhanced fluorescence due to cleavage of the internally quenched fluorogenic substrate peptides (ortho-aminobenzoic acid-TSAVLQSGFRK-2,4-dinitrophenylamide) by protease was monitored at 420 nm with excitation at 362 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B luminescence spectrometer. The mixture containing N-terminal peptides (ortho-aminobenzoic acid-TSAVLQ) and C-terminal peptides (SQFRK-2,4-dinitrophenylamide) of different concentrations were prepared to monitor the specific fluorogenic intensity. All intensities were corrected for the buffer contributions. The serial intensities at 420 nm were used to construct a standard curve for quantifying the product. In this way, the enzyme activity could be precisely determined. Expression, Purification, and Characterization of the Recombinant SARS-CoV Main Proteases—The full-length and truncated SARS-CoV main proteases have been successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by a single affinity column. All the recombinant SARS-CoV main proteases were found in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate. The expressed SARS-CoV main proteases bound to the nickel column, but other proteins flowed through the column as refuse. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the recombinant proteins were almost homogeneous in solution. All purified proteins had Mr in agreement with the theoretical values. After concentration, 5–15 mg/ml recombinant main protease could be obtained from 200 ml of cells. Unfortunately, the other C-terminally truncated mutants were not successfully expressed, probably because of their instabilities. To determine the secondary structure of the successfully expressed and purified recombined main proteases, far-UV CD spectra were recorded. The overall CD spectra were shown in Fig. 2. The spectra of all recombinant SARS-CoV main proteases seemed to be similar, except that of Δ(201–306) as anticipated (Fig. 1A). These results indicated that the proteins have a well defined secondary structure. This is reflected in the secondary structural estimation by the DICHROWEB server (20Lobley A. Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 21Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1991) Google Scholar). The CDSSTR analysis is shown in Table I. The normalized root mean square deviation values of the data fitting for WT and various truncations were all <0.2 and thus showed excellent goodness-of-fit parameters (37Mao D. Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The analysis of the secondary structure of the full-length SARS-CoV main protease is consistent with the data derived from the crystal structure, 1uk3 (Table I). The helical contents of the recombinant WT and crystal structure (1uk3) were 0.21 and 0.22, respectively. All truncations showed similar results with full-length main protease, except that Δ(201–306) had significant low α-helix content, which was in agreement with the structure in which the whole helical domain III was deleted. The thermal stability of the recombinant SARS-CoV main proteases was also examined (Table I). Among the truncated SARS-CoV main proteases, the C-terminally truncated protease Δ(293–306) has significantly lower Tm than WT.Table IStructural characteristics of the recombinant SARS-CoV main proteases in crystal and solutionProteaseα-Helixβ-StrandTurnsUnorderedNormalized NRMSDbNormalized root mean S.D. of the secondary structure fitting results.TmcMelting temperature determined by the CD spectropolarimeter.〈λ〉dAverage fluorescence emission wavelength shift.°Cnm1uk3aCrystal structure determined by x-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank code 1uk3).22252033WT212722300.03054.8342.1Δ(1-3)202521340.02354.8341.8Δ(1-4)222319350.05052.0341.8Δ(1-5)222619330.02853.4341.8Δ(1-6)212618340.02551.5NDeNot determined.Δ(1-7)212820310.02454.6342.1Δ(293-306)242719300.02448.4342.1Δ(201-306)43121430.14055.0331.1a Crystal structure determined by x-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank code 1uk3).b Normalized root mean S.D. of the secondary structure fitting results.c Melting temperature determined by the CD spectropolarimeter.d Average fluorescence emission wavelength shift.e Not determined. Open table in a new tab The fluorescence emission spectra of the recombinant SARSCoV main proteases were shown in Fig. 3. Only Δ(201–306) had significantly low fluorescence intensity. The average emission wavelengths were calculated by the method of Sanchez del Pino and Fersht (30Sanchez del Pino M.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5560-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which accounts for both wavelength shift and the fluorescence intensity attenuation. The average emission wavelength of the full-length SARS-CoV main protease is 342 nm. With the only exception of Δ(201–306), which has an emission wavelength 11 nm lower than WT, other truncations show minor differences (Table I). Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analysis—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed to investigate the association states of WT and truncated SARS-CoV main proteases. This method was successfully used to demonstrate the dimerization of SARS-CoV main protease under various conditions (17Chou C.Y. Chang H.C. Hsu W.C. Lin T.Z. Lin C.H. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14958-14970Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed by continuous size distribution, which implemented a highly reliable model, as indicated by the homogeneous bitmap picture (Figs. 4 and 5, insets). All of these data were derived from an excellent matching curve of the original raw sedimentation data and the randomly distributed residual values (data not shown). WT protease shows a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution. The sedimentation coefficients of 2.4 S and 4.2 S were monomer and dimer, respectively, corresponding to species with molar mass measurements of 34 and 68 kDa (17Chou C.Y. Chang H.C. Hsu W.C.

WT and N- and C-terminally truncated proteases also displayed a mixture of monomer and dimer (Figs. 4 and 5). Deletion of three residues from the N terminus showed a similar monomer-dimer distribution with WT. The monomer became the major species when the fourth amino acid residue was deleted from the N terminus (Fig. 4). Further deletion of more residues (Δ(1–5), Δ(1–6), and Δ(1–7)) from the N terminus showed a similar pattern with Δ(1–4). In addition, we have also examined the involvement of domain III in the subunit association. Truncation of the last helix, the Δ(293–306) mutant, caused the SARS-CoV main protease to become a monomer (Fig. 5). These results clearly indicated that residues 4 and 293–306 are critically involved in stabilizing the dimer structure.Fig. 5Continuous sedimentation coefficient distribution of the full-length WT and C-terminally truncated SARS-CoV main protease.

Because mutations of the ras gene are most often found in tumors of epithelial origin, we explored the signaling pathways utilized by oncogenic Ras to down-regulate Par-4 in RIE-1 and rat ovarian surface epithelial (ROSE) cells. We determined that constitutive activation of the Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor effector pathway alone was not sufficient to down-regulate Par-4 in RIE-1 or ROSE cells. However, treatment of Ras-transformed RIE-1 or ROSE cells with the MEK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 increased Par-4 protein expression. Thus, although oncogenic Ras utilizes the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway to down-regulate Par-4 in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells, Ras activation of an additional signaling pathway(s) is required to achieve the same outcome in epithelial cells. Methylation-specific PCR showed that the par-4 promoter is methylated in Ras-transformed cells through a MEK-dependent pathway and that treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azadeoxycytidine restored Par-4 mRNA transcript and protein levels, suggesting that the mechanism for Ras-mediated down-regulation of Par-4 is by promoter methylation. Support for this possibility is provided by our observation that Ras transformation was associated with up-regulation of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3 DNA methyltransferase expression. Finally, ectopic Par-4 expression significantly reduced Ras-mediated growth in soft agar, but not morphological transformation, highlighting the importance of Par-4 down-regulation in specific aspects of Ras-mediated transformation of epithelial cells.

Proper development and tissue homeostasis are regulated in part through a complex balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Any disruption in the processes that control this balance can lead to disease states such as autoimmunity, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer (1Tamm I. Schriever F. Dorken B. Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 2Olson M. Kornbluth S. Curr. Mol.

Therefore, an understanding of the molecules involved in regulating cell death is crucial for prevention and treatment of these diseases.The par-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4) gene was identified originally in a cDNA screen for genes up-regulated in prostate cancer cells that were induced to undergo apoptosis (4Sells S.F. Wood Jr., D.P. Joshi-Barve S.S. Muthukumar S. Jacob R.J. Crist S.A. Humphreys S. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 457-466PubMed Google Scholar). Par-4 is expressed ubiquitously in a variety of cell lines and rat organs, suggesting a physiologically common function for Par-4 in most cells (5Boghaert E.R. Sells S.F. Walid A.J. Malone P. Williams N.M. Weinstein M.H. Strange R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). However, although staining of Par-4 has been observed in terminally differentiated cells, consistent with its role in apoptosis, Par-4 staining has also been seen in areas enriched in stem cell populations, suggesting that Par-4 may possess additional functions that remain to be defined (5Boghaert E.R. Sells S.F. Walid A.J. Malone P. Williams N.M. Weinstein M.H. Strange R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar).par-4 gene and protein expression has been found to be down-regulated in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and by transient expression of activated H-Ras in human fibroblasts and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells (6Barradas M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7115-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ras gene family encodes small GTPases involved in regulation of cytoplasmic signaling pathways in response to diverse extracellular signals. ras gene point mutations of codons 12, 13, and 61 are found frequently in human cancers and result in persistent activation of Ras due to impaired GTPase activity (9Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 10Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1825) Google Scholar). A consequence of constitutive Ras activation is downstream changes in gene expression, which in turn act to modulate a variety of processes, including proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (11Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Understanding how Ras subverts death is critical to understanding the role of Ras in cancer. Ras is known to cause a shift in the growth/apoptosis balance to favor growth over death and in doing so promotes cell proliferation (12Downward J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Ras achieves growth-favoring conditions in part by altering the expression of pro-apoptotic genes to promote tumorigenesis. Thus, oncogenic Ras protects cells from apoptosis by modulation of a variety of apoptosis-related proteins, including down-regulation of Par-4 expression (6Barradas M. Monjas A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Serrano M. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Nalca A. Qiu S.G. El Guendy N. Krishnan S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29976-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, transient Par-4 expression causes an apoptotic response in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (7Nalca A. Qiu S.G. El Guendy N. Krishnan S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29976-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Ras mediates its actions by interaction with multiple downstream effectors, with the best characterized being the Raf serine/threonine kinases (11Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 13Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Ras binds to and activates Raf, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MEK1 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; A, aliphatic amino acid; FCS, fetal calf serum; ROSE, rat ovarian stromal epithelial. 1The abbreviations used are: MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HEK, human embryonic kidney; A, aliphatic amino acid; FCS, fetal calf serum; ROSE, rat ovarian stromal epithelial. and MEK2, which then activate the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs. The downstream consequences of this signaling pathway that are important in regulating cell survival are not clearly defined (14Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8999-9006Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The second best characterized effector of Ras is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase that facilitates the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (15Rodriguez-Viciana P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In turn, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate promotes activation of the Akt/protein kinase B serine/threonine kinase pathway and a cell survival pathway (17Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate can also activate guanine nucleotide exchange factors (e.g. Sos and Vav) that activate the Rac small GTPase (18Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y.

Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and a prosurvival function for Rac has been described (20Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Rac can activate the JNK and p38 MAPKs, which are also activated by apoptosis-inducing stimuli (21Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 22Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Although Raf and PI3K represent the most studied effectors of Ras, other less well understood effectors such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Ral small GTPases (23Feig L.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 419-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and the proapoptotic NORE1/RASSF1 family proteins (24Feig L.A. Buchsbaum R.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R259-R261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) may also facilitate the ability of Ras to regulate cell survival and apoptosis.Previous analyses of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells have provided some indication of the mechanism of Par-4 down-regulation by Ras (6Barradas M. Monjas A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Serrano M. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Nalca A. Qiu S.G. El Guendy N. Krishnan S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7115-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Activated H-Ras was shown to down-regulate Par-4 through the ERK MAPK pathway based in part on studies demonstrating that stable expression of activated Raf-1, MEK1, or ERK2 in NIH 3T3 cells causes down-regulation of Par-4 expression, whereas treatment with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocks Ras-mediated loss of Par-4. In contrast, activated PI3K alone does not cause down-regulation of Par-4 expression, and inhibition of PI3K does not restore Par-4 expression in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, ectopic expression of Par-4 was shown to block Ras-mediated growth transformation, to inhibit tumor development, and to induce apoptosis in transient assays by inhibiting NF-κB (6Barradas M. Monjas A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Serrano M. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Nalca A. Qiu S.G. El Guendy N. Krishnan S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7115-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, these observations support an important contribution of loss of Par-4 expression in Ras-mediated transformation and that Raf is the key effector utilized by Ras to mediate Par-4 down-regulation in rodent fibroblasts.Although rodent fibroblast cell lines are transformed readily by activated Ras or Raf, we (25Hamad N.M.

Cancer Cells. 2004; 6: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) have shown that a variety of epithelial cell types (RIE-1, IEC-6, MCF-10A, and human embryonic kidney (HEK)) are transformed by Ras, but not by Raf. Instead, activation of Ral GEF alone is sufficient to mediate Ras transformation of human fibroblasts and epithelial cells (25Hamad N.M. Elconin J.H. Karnoub A.E. Bai W. Rich J.N. Abraham R.T. Der C.J. Counter C.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2045-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, the signaling cascades that promote Ras transformation exhibit important cell type differences (11Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Therefore, we initiated studies to determine the mechanism by which Ras causes down-regulation of Par-4 and to assess the importance of Par-4 in Ras-mediated transformation of epithelial cells. We found that, although activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is necessary for par-4 down-regulation, activated Raf alone is not sufficient to mediate this process. We also show that the decrease in Par-4 transcript levels is due to promoter silencing through DNA hypermethylation. Importantly, Ras-mediated soft agar growth (but not morphological transformation) was significantly impaired upon ectopic Par-4 expression, demonstrating that down-regulation of Par-4 is a necessary prerequisite for specific aspects of Ras-mediated transformation of epithelial cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Constructs—pBabe-puro and pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 retrovirus expression vectors for activated Ras, Raf-1, the p110 catalytic subunit (p110-CAAX), and Ral GEF (Rlf-CAAX) have been described previously (26Oldham S.M.

A mammalian expression vector containing the cDNA sequence encoding Par-4 was generated by subcloning a 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment from pCB6+/Par-4 into pBabe-puro (pBabe-Par-4).

HEK and human mammary epithelial cell lines stably infected with the pBabe-puro empty vector or encoding FLAG epitope-tagged H-ras(12V) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS or in MEMα medium (Cambrex), respectively (25Hamad N.M.

The DLD-1 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, which harbors one endogenous mutant K-ras(13D) allele, and a derivative cell line of DLD-1 lacking the mutant K-ras allele (DKO-3) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The reduced ability of the DKO-3 variant to form colonies in soft agar and tumors in athymic nude mice has been described previously (33Plattner R. Anderson M.J. Sato K.Y. Fasching C.L. Der C.J.

Protein concentrations were measured by the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Unless noted otherwise, all blots were analyzed with 30 μgof soluble lysate separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Par-4 polyclonal antibody (R-334, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or mouse β-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma), and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Pharmacological Inhibitors—The chemical inhibitors used in this study were as follows: MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059 (Calbiochem) and U0126 (Promega Corp.), PI3K inhibitor LY294004 (Promega Corp.), p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem), and JNK MAPK inhibitor SP600125 (provided by J.

Investig. 2001; 108: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar).RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate/acid/phenol method (36Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analyses, 25 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated on 1.4% formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes. The par-4 cDNA probe used was a fragment corresponding to the 1.4-kb EcoRI insert from pCB6+ (described above). Rat plasmid cDNA clones for dnmt1, dnmt3a, and dnmt3b used for generating probes were kindly provided by Dr. E. Li (Harvard University). Verification of equivalent loading of RNA was done by hybridization with an oligonucleotide corresponding to the 28 S rRNA (Clontech). Hybridization was carried out by incubation with 1 × 106 cpm/ml in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma) at 68 °C for par-4 and dnmt1 and at 40 °C for the 28 S rRNA oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's recommendations.DNA Methylation Analysis—To assess the role of DNA methylation in Ras-mediated down-regulation of Par-4, cells were incubated in growth medium supplemented with 2 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Sigma) or Me2SO for 6 days. Azadeoxycytidine is an inhibitor of cytosine methyltransferase that methylates CpG islands in genomic DNA (37Jones P.A. Cell. 1985; 40: 485-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Methylation patterns in the CpG island of par-4 were assessed by chemical bisulfite modification as described previously (3Zhang J. Xu M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 84-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this procedure, unmethylated (but not methylated) cytosines are converted to uracil. Methylation-specific PCR was performed with primers specific for either methylated or bisulfite-modified unmethylated DNA. DNA methylation patterns in the CpG island of the par-4 gene were determined using multiple sets of primers. The primers specific for methylated DNA, which were designed based on DNA sequence information (GenBank™ accession number AF503628) to target a CpG-rich region -4466 bp upstream of the transcription start site (5Boghaert E.R. Sells S.F. Walid A.J. Malone P. Williams N.M. Weinstein M.H. Strange R. Rangnekar V.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar), were as follows: GTTGGCGTAGGGTAGGTTGTAGC (forward) and GAAACACGAACGAAAAAAACCGA (reverse). Those specific for unmethylated DNA were as follows: GGTTGGTGTAGGGTAGGTTGTAGTG (foward) and CCAAAACACAAACAAAAAAAACCAAA (reverse). PCR was optimized for each primer pair. DNA treated in vitro with SssI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used as positive control for methylated DNA and that from normal lymphocytes was used as a negative control for unmethylated DNA in PCR with the methylation-specific par-4 primers.For sample preparation, 1 μg of DNA isolated from HEK cells stably expressing vector or activated Ras was denatured by NaOH and modified by sodium bisulfite. DNA samples were then purified using Wizard DNA purification resin (Promega Corp.), again treated with NaOH, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in water. PCRs without DNA were performed as a control. Each PCR product (10–12 μl) was directly loaded onto nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels or 4% agarose gels consisting of 2% ultrapure agarose (Invitrogen) plus 2% Sea-Plaque low melting agarose (BMA Products), stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV illumination.Focus Formation and Soft Agar Colony Formation Assays—The ability of Par-4 to inhibit K-Ras(12V)-mediated focus formation was determined by cotransfection using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of pZIP-K-ras(12V) with 0.5 ng of pBabe-Par-4 or empty vector, and the appearance of transformed foci was quantified after 21 days in culture. For photomicrographs, cells were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol and stained in 0.4% crystal violet in 20% ethanol.For soft agar analyses, mass populations of RIE-1 cells stably expressing K-Ras(12V) and Par-4 were established by cotransfection with pZIP-K-ras(12V)(neor) and pBabe-Par-4(puror), followed by co-selection in growth medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 and 1 μg/ml puromycin. To assess colony formation in soft agar, cells were seeded at 2 × 104/60-mm dish in growth medium containing 0.3% agar. Verification that colonies were alive at the time of quantification was done by staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (thiazolyl blue; Sigma) after 21 days in culture. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide is enzymatically converted from a yellow soluble salt to an insoluble purple product in viable (but not dead) cells (38Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was dissolved at 2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.5 ml was washed gently over colonies on the dishes. Colonies were counted and photographed after incubation at 37 °C for 15 min.PCR Analyses—Reverse transcription was carried out with oligo(dT) primers using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 11 μg of total RNA as recommended by the manufacturer. Subsequent PCR amplification for each transcript was with 200 μm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 1× buffer (supplied by the manufacturer), and 0.2 μm each primer. Primer sequences were as follows: dnmt1, 5′-CCAGATACCTACCGGTTATTCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCTTTAACTGCAGCTGAGGC-3′ (antisense); dnmt3a, 5′-FCTGAAATGGAAAGGGTGTTTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCATGTCCCTTACACACAAGC-3′ (antisense); dnmt3b, 5′-GTACTTCTGGGGTAACCTACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAAACAGGTGTCTGATGACC-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-GACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTCCATCACAATGCCAGTGGT-3′ (antisense). Amplification conditions were as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C (for dnmt1 and β-actin) or 65 °C (for dnmt3a and dnmt3b) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and one cycle at 72 °C for 6 min.RESULTSPrevious studies of the relationship between oncogenic Ras transformation and Par-4 expression have focused primarily on analyses in mouse fibroblasts. In these studies, expression of oncogenic Ras resulted in nearly complete loss of detectable Par-4 protein expression (6Barradas M. Monjas A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Serrano M. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Nalca A. Qiu S.G. El Guendy N. Krishnan S. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7115-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To assess the relationship between Ras and Par-4 in epithelial cells, we examined Par-4 protein levels in several Ras-transformed epithelial cell lines. As described previously for NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (6Barradas M. Monjas A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Serrano M. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6362-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Nalca A.

Rangnekar V.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7115-7123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we observed that 208F rat fibroblasts expressing constitutively active K-Ras(12V) also showed down-regulated Par-4 protein levels (Fig. 1). Similarly, RIE-1, ROSE, HEK, and human mammary epithelial cells expressing either activated H-Ras(12V) or K-Ras(12V) exhibited a decrease in Par-4 protein expression (Fig. 1). Thus, Ras-mediated transformation of a variety of epithelial cell types as well as fibroblasts resulted in down-regulation of Par-4. Interestingly, fibroblasts expressed less endogenous Par-4 compared with the epithelial cells, suggesting that endogenous levels of Par-4 expression are cell type-dependent.The reduced expression of Par-4 observed in response to the forced expression of mutant Ras led us to investigate whether a similar loss of Par-4 would occur in tumor cell systems with endogenous aberrant Ras activity and thus more closely reveal in vivo physiological oncogenic Ras conditions. To address this question, we evaluated Par-4 protein levels in a human colon tumor cell system in which oncogenic Ras was shown previously to be critical for tumorigenic transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2064039108,"Cyclin A1 is an alternative A-type cyclin that is essential for spermatogenesis, but it is also expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells and in acute myeloid leukemia. Its functions during cell cycle progression of somatic cells are incompletely understood. Here, we have analysed the cell cycle functions of cyclin A1 in transformed and nontransformed cells. Murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from cyclin A1-deficient mice were significantly impaired in their proliferative capacity. In accordance, cyclin A1−/− cells accumulated in G1 and G2/M phase while the percentage of S phase cells decreased. Also, lectin stimulated splenic lymphocytes from cyclin A1−/− mice proliferated slower than their wild-type counterparts. Forced cyclin A1 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells and in U937 leukemic cells either by transient transfection or by retroviral infection enhanced S phase entry. Consequently, siRNA mediated silencing of cyclin A1 in highly cyclin A1 expressing ML1 leukemic cells significantly slowed S phase entry, decreased proliferation and inhibited colony formation. Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that cyclin A1 contributes to G1 to S cell cycle progression in somatic cells. Cyclin A1 overexpression enhances S phase entry consistent with an oncogenic function. Finally, cyclin A1 might be a therapeutic target since its silencing inhibited leukemia cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2015041810,"Following initiation of translocation across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum via the translocon, polypeptide chains are N-glycosylated by the oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) enzyme complex. Translocation and N-glycosylation are concurrent events and would be expected to require juxtaposition of the translocon and the OT complex. To determine whether any of the subunits of the OT complex and translocon mediate interactions between the two complexes, we initiated a systematic study in budding yeast using the split-ubiquitin approach. Interestingly, the OT subunit Stt3p was found to interact only with Sec61p, whereas another OT subunit, Ost4p, was found to interact with all three components of the translocon, Sec61p, Sbh1p, and Sss1p. The OT subunit Wbp1p was found to interact very strongly with Sec61p and Sbh1p and weakly with Sss1p. Other OT subunits, Ost1p, Ost2p, and Swp1p were found to interact with Sec61p and either Sbh1p or Sss1p. Ost3p exhibited a weak interaction with Sec61p and Sbh1p, whereas Ost5p and Ost6p interacted very weakly with Sec61p and failed to interact with Sbh1p or Sss1p. We were able to confirm these split-ubiquitin findings by a chemical cross-linking technique. Based on our findings using these two techniques, we conclude that the association of these two complexes is stabilized via multiple protein-protein contacts.

Most secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and are translocated across or integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SP, signal peptidase; OT, oligosaccharyl transferase; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PLV, protein A-LexA-VP16; -NX(S/T)-, -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SP, signal peptidase; OT, oligosaccharyl transferase; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); HA, hemagglutinin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PLV, protein A-LexA-VP16; -NX(S/T)-, -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-. membrane via a complex of proteins called the translocon (for a review on translocation, see Ref. 1Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). In yeast, translocation across the ER membrane can occur in either a co-translational or a post-translational mode. Co-translational translocation requires the Sec61 complex, which is made up of three membrane proteins, Sec61p (α subunit), Sbh1p (β subunit), and Sss1p (γ subunit) (2Oliver J. Jungnickel B. Gorlich D. Rapoport T. High S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The post-translational mode of translocation requires the Sec63 complex, which is made up of Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p, in addition to the Sec61 complex and BiP (3Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Genetic studies in yeast have identified a second set of translocon homologs (4Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), which has been shown to mediate co-translational translocation of a subset of proteins (5Wittke S. Dunnwald M. Albertsen M. Johnsson N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2223-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Wilkinson B.M. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the Sec61 complex is the protein-conducting channel, several other proteins associate with the translocon. The heterodimeric signal recognition particle receptor is required for the targeting of a ribosome-signal sequence-nascent chain-signal recognition particle complex to the ER membrane. Following translocation of the nascent chain, the signal peptidase (SP) cleaves the signal sequence as soon as the cleavage site is exposed on the lumenal side of the membrane. The SP is anchored to the Sec61 channel via the β subunit (mammalian homolog of Sbh1p) (7Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the mammalian system, two other proteins associated with the translocon are the translocon-associated membrane protein and translocon-associated protein, the functions of which are not clearly understood (8Fons R.D. Bogert B.A. Hegde R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Rapoport T.A. Lingappa V.R.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Following translocation of polypeptides across the ER membrane, certain -Asn-X-Ser/Thr-(-NX(S/T)-) sites are N-glycosylated. The oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) enzyme complex catalyzes the N-glycosylation reaction in the lumen of the ER (for a recent review on OT, see Ref. 13Yan A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3121-3124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The N-glycosylation reaction involves the transfer of a high mannose oligosaccharide chain from a dolichol pyrophosphate carrier to the Asn residue of the -NX(S/T)-acceptor site in the nascent polypeptide chain, with X being any amino acid except proline (14Welply J.K. Shenbagamurthi P. Lennarz W.J. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11856-11863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation of ribosome-bound nascent chains is observed when the glycosylation site is 65–75 residues away from the ribosomal P site (15Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus glycosylatable -NX(S/T)-sites are glycosylated in the lumen of the ER as soon as they emerge from the translocon, well in advance of completion of the synthesis of the polypeptide chain (16Popov M. Tam L.Y. Li J. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18325-18332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Translocation and N-glycosylation are believed to be concomitant events, because N-glycosylation sites can occur almost anywhere along the length of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain. It appears that coordination between the two processes is necessary; otherwise the glycosylatable sites might be buried during the process of protein folding. For this reason, OT is believed to be a part of the functional translocon, although it does not contribute to the formation of the structure of the channel (1Johnson A.E. van Waes M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 799-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).In yeast the oligosaccharyl transferase enzyme complex is composed of 9 subunits (Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Wbp1p, and Swp1p), five of which (Ost1p, Ost2p, Stt3p, Wbp1p, and Swp1p) are encoded by essential genes. Homologs of all the OT subunits have been identified in higher eukaryotic organisms (17Kelleher D.J. Karaoglu D. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 101-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R.

Biochem. 1995; 228: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is unclear why the catalysis of the N-glycosylation reaction requires 9 subunits. In fact, with the exception of Stt3p, the precise function(s) of the OT subunits is unknown. Besides participating in the oligosaccharyl group transfer, it is possible that some of the subunits may mediate complex formation among different OT subunits and with components of the translocon complex. It has been shown that when rough microsomes are solubilized with certain nonionic detergents, membrane-bound polysomes co-sediment as a complex containing both the translocon and OT (12Wang L. Dobberstein B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ribophorins I (the mammalian homolog of yeast Ost1p) and II (the mammalian homolog of yeast Swp1p) have been shown to be chemically cross-linked to the 60 S ribosomal subunit (23Kreibich G. Freienstein C.M. Pereyra B.N. Ulrich B.L. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 488-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and polyclonal as well as antipeptide antibodies against ribophorins I and II inhibit the translocation of nascent polypeptide chains (24Yu Y.H. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nascent chains undergoing translocation or integration at the ER membrane were found to cross-link to the STT3 subunit of the OT complex, suggesting a close proximity of the OT complex to the translocon (25Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Clearly, several lines of evidence suggest that the OT complex is closely associated with the translocon complex. However, other than one report indicating the interaction between Wbp1p and Sss1p (26Scheper W. Thaminy S. Kais S. Stagljar I. Romisch K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37998-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the issue of the molecular basis underlying the association of the translocon machinery and the OT complex has not been addressed. In this study we have carried out a systematic analysis of the organization of the translocon-OT supercomplex using chemical cross-linking and split-ubiquitin analysis. Based on the protein-protein interactions identified, we provide a working model of the translocon-OT assemblage. This is the first detailed study providing evidence for the organization of the translocon-OT supercomplex, the existence of which has been hypothesized for at least a decade.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMATERIALSStrains used in this study are listed in Table I.

The principle of the split-ubiquitin technique have been described in detail elsewhere (37Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Knowledge of the topology of the membrane proteins under study is a prerequisite in the utilization of the split-ubiquitin technique. The topology of the protein enables us to decide whether the protein should be fused at the C terminus or the N terminus with the N-terminal half of ubiquitin bearing a I13G mutation (NUB(G)) or the C-terminal (CUB) of ubiquitin. In addition, the Cub domain is fused with the protein A-LexA-VP16 (PLV) reporter (37Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We designed the 2 constructs, pRS315-SEC61-CUB-PLV and pRS314-NUB(G)-SSS1 based on the topology of Sec61p and Sss1p described earlier (44Wilkinson B.M. Critchley A.J. Stirling C.J. J. Biol.

Therefore we used constructs in which NUB(G) was fused to the C terminus of Ost1p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Wbp1p, and Swp1p (see Fig. 1A) (OT-NUB(G)). In the case of Stt3p and Ost2p, we used the constructs in which NUB(G) was fused to the N terminus (see Fig. 1A) (NUB(G)-OT). We fused the C-terminal half of ubiquitin-PLV (CUB-PLV) to the C terminus of Sec61p known to be oriented toward the cytosol depicted in Fig. 1B. Following co-transformation of the SEC61-CUB-PLV and NUB(G)-OT (or OT-NUB(G)) in the LY40 strain, we determined the His phenotype of the transformants by spotting assay on -Leu-Trp-His plates. When we carried out β-galactosidase filter assay for the transformants (data not shown), we found that instant color development was observed for some interactions under study (for e.g. Sec61p and Stt3p), whereas for others, it took about 4 h for color development (e.g. Sec61p and Ost1p). Therefore we performed quantitative β-galactosidase assay to analyze the interactions between OT subunits and the translocon components. The results for the quantitative β-galactosidase and spotting assay are summarized in Fig. 2. Four OT subunits, Ost2p, Stt3p, Wbp1p, and Swp1p, encoded by essential genes, and Ost4p were found to interact strongly with Sec61p in the split-ubiquitin system. The other four OT subunits (Ost1p, Ost3p, Ost5p, and Ost6p) interacted to a much lesser degree with Sec61p as compared with the other 5 OT subunits, a finding that was in agreement with their growth phenotype on the -His plate.Fig. 2Interaction of OT subunits with Sec61p. L40 strain was transformed with pRS315-SEC61-CUB-PLV and one of the constructs (OT-NUB(G) or NUB(G)-OT) as indicated in Fig. 1A. The transformants were selected on -Leu-Trp plates. Three independent colonies were tested for growth on -Leu-Trp-His plates. Spotting assay of one of the colonies on -Leu-Trp or -Leu-Trp-His plates is shown. A quantitative β-galactosidase assay was carried out using the yeast β-galactosidase assay kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). To measure β-galactosidase activity, the equation used was 1000 A420/tVOD660, where A is the absorbance measured at 420 nm after the reaction, t is the time in minutes of reaction incubation, V is the volume of cells (ml) used in the assay, and OD is the optical density of the culture used for the reaction.

CUB-PLV was fused to the C terminus of Sbh1p (depicted in Fig. 1B).

Chimeras of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and full-length pre-pro-VWF (VWF-EGFP) or the VWF propolypeptide (proregion-EGFP) were made and expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Expression of VWF-EGFP or proregion-EGFP resulted in fluorescent rod-shaped organelles that recruited the WPB membrane markers P-selectin and CD63. The WPB secretagogue histamine evoked exocytosis of these fluorescent WPBs and extracellular release of VWF-EGFP or proregion-EGFP. Secreted VWF-EGFP formed distinctive extracellular patches of fluorescence that were labeled with an extracellular antibody to VWF. The half-time for dispersal of VWF-EGFP from extracellular patches was 323.5 ± 146.2 s (±S.D., n = 20 WPBs). In contrast, secreted proregion-EGFP did not form extracellular patches but dispersed rapidly from its site of release. The half-time for dispersal of proregion-EGFP following WPB exocytosis was 2.98 ± 1.88 s (±S.D., n = 32 WPBs). The slow rate of loss of VWF-EGFP is consistent with the adhesive nature of this protein for the endothelial membrane.

The extracellular function of proregion is not clear. Previous biochemical studies have shown that although proregion does associate transiently with VWF inside the secretory pathway (10Wise R.J.

VLA-4 plays an important role in the recruitment of monocytes into the blood vessel wall and is implicated in the vascular accumulation of monocytes that marks the early development of atherosclerotic lesions (14Shih P.T.

These data indicate that WPB-derived VWF and proregion perform distinct extracellular functions, VWF on the endothelial surface and proregion at sites distant from the endothelial surface. Little is known about rates of dispersal of these proteins from the endothelial cell surface following WPB exocytosis, a process that will influence the effectiveness of these molecules at their sites of action. A recent study using viral infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with a fusion protein of VWF and green fluorescent protein (GFP), in which the GFP replaced the A2 domain of VWF, has shown that WPBs can be fluorescently labeled and that stimulation results in the formation of extracellular patches of VWF-GFP that remained visible on the cell surface for up to 20 min (15Romani de Wit T. Rondaij M.G. Hordijk P.L. Voorberg J. van Mourik J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the rate of loss of surface-associated VWF was not made. In this study, we constructed chimeras of VWF and its proregion, fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (16Cubitt A.B. Heim R. Adams S.R. Boyd A.E. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 448-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). We show that both constructs are correctly targeted to WPBs when expressed in HUVECs and that the resulting fluorescent WPBs undergo exocytosis in response to the WPB secretagogue histamine. Using these constructs, we have determined the time course of VWF-EGFP and proregion-EGFP loss from individual WPBs following exocytosis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-human VWF was purchased from Dako Ltd. (Cambridgeshire, UK). Mouse monoclonal anti-P-selectin (clone AK-6) was from Serotec (Oxon, UK). The anti-CD63 monoclonal antibody (clone H5C6) developed by J. T. August and J. E. K. Hildreth was obtained from The Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by The University of Iowa. Secondary antibodies coupled to fluorophores were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless stated otherwise. Primary HUVECs were purchased from TCS Cellworks and grown as previously described (17Arribas M. Cutler D.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or in the TCS Cellworks HUVEC culture medium. HUVECs were transfected using 5–10 μg of expression vector DNA using the Nucleofection device and buffers according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amaxa GMBH). Cells were used between 1 and 3 days after Nucleofection. pVWF-EGFP—A 229-bp PCR fragment flanked by EcoRI and AgeI restriction sites was generated from the carboxyl terminus of human VWF using primers 5′-ctgaattcgaggtggatatccactac-3′ and 5′-ctgaccggtcccttgctgcacttcctggggg-3′ and the vector pMT2-ADA-VWF (18Bonthron D.T. Handin R.I. Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Orr E.C. Mitsock L.M. Ewenstein B. Loscalzo J. Ginsburg D. Orkin S.H.

The reverse primer was designed to mutate the VWF Stop codon (tga) into a glycine (gga). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and AgeI and cloned into the EcoRI/AgeI sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), giving rise to plasmid pVWF-cterm-N1, which encodes a fusion of the VWF carboxyl terminus inframe with the EGFP cDNA. This cloning strategy gave rise to a joining sequence of four extraneous amino acids (Pro-Val-Ala-Thr) between the carboxyl-terminal glycine of VWF (mutated from Stop) and the amino-terminal methionine of EGFP. The entire 8442-bp human VWF coding sequence minus the 204-bp 3′ of the unique EcoRV site (and with some additional 5′-UTR sequence) was cut out of pMT2-ADA-VWF using EcoRI and EcoRV and cloned into EcoRI/EcoRV-digested pVWF-cterm-N1, producing pVWF-FL-N1. A 350-bp EcoRI/XbaI fragment encoding the amino-terminal ATG of human VWF without any additional 5′-UTR was generated from pMT2-ADA-VWF using PCR with the primers 5′-gagaattcatgattcctgccagatttgc-3′ and 5′-caccggacagcttgtagtacc-3′. This fragment was ligated into EcoRI/XbaI-digested pVWF-FL-N1 to give pVWF-EGFP. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. It should be noted that VWF is actually synthesized as a precursor protein (pre-pro-VWF) that has to undergo proteolytic processing in the secretory pathway to give rise to the mature (circulating) VWF (1Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After post-translational modifications, the predicted product of the pre-pro-VWF-EGFP construct is EGFP-fused to the carboxyl terminus of mature VWF. For simplification, we refer to this construct as pVWF-EGFP, and we refer to the protein to which it gives rise as VWF-EGFP (rather than pre-pro-VWF-EGFP). pProregion-EGFP—The proregion of VWF refers to the 741-amino acid protein that is generated from the amino terminus of pre-pro-VWF by its cleavage at a tetrabasic, furin-like cleavage site (19van de Ven W.J. Voorberg J. Fontijn R. Pannekoek H. van den Ouweland A.M. van Duijnhoven H.L. Roebroek A.J. Siezen R.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1990; 14: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 20Fay P.J.

Science. 1986; 232: 995-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To manufacture a proregion-EGFP fusion protein, we took advantage of the presence of a unique HindIII restriction site just 50 bp 5′ of the proregion-VWF cleavage site. The HindIII site in the multiple cloning site of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) was destroyed by restriction digest and subsequent filling-in, giving rise to pEGFP-N2 (minus HindIII). A 2.8-kb EcoRI/BamHI fragment encoding the entire proregion of VWF plus some additional carboxyl-terminal amino acids was cut out of pVWF-EGFP (above) and ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-N2(minus HindIII), giving rise to pVWF-nterm-N2(minus). This was digested with HindIII/BamHI, and a 57-bp linker encoding a synthetic proregion carboxyl terminus in-frame with EGFP and with the tetrabasic cleavage site mutated (from Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg to Arg-Ser-Lys-Gly) was ligated in to generate pProregion-EGFP. The linker was generated with overlapping oligonucleotides (5′-cggaagcttgctgcctgacgctgtcctcagcagtcccctg-3′ and 5′-gtggatccctttgctgcgatgagacaggggactgctgag-3′) that were annealed, filled in, and digested with HindIII/BamHI. The linker and the regions surrounding the restriction sites were verified by sequencing. Nucleofected HUVECs grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (21Blagoveshchenskaya A.D. Hannah M.J. Allen S. Cutler D.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nucleofected HUVECs were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass-bottomed chambers (MatTek Corp.). Time-lapse images of EGFP fluorescence were recorded in release medium (medium 199 supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin), at room temperature or at 37 °C as indicated, on a Deltavision Imaging system (Applied Precision Inc., Seattle, WA) housed within a temperature-controlled incubator. Images were obtained using either an Olympus U-Plan-Apo ×100 objective 1.35 numerical aperture or PLANAPO ×60 1.4 numerical aperture objective in conjunction with a Prinston Instruments Micromax air-cooled interlined charge-coupled device camera. 490 ± 20 nm excitation and 528 ± 38 nm emission filters were used in conjunction with a 4-band pass standard Deltavision dichroic (Chroma; C13022–84100). Excitation light was attenuated with a 50% neutral density filter to reduce photo-bleaching of EGFP. For experiments using proregion-EGFP, images were acquired at ∼3.1 frames/s with continuous illumination. For experiments using VWF-EGFP, images were acquired for ∼90sat ∼1.3 frames/s with continuous illumination (during the period in which WPB exocytosis was evoked), followed by intermittent illumination (300-ms exposure once every 5 s) for a period of >30 min. Under these conditions, imaging for 30–35 min resulted in ∼10% loss of EGFP fluorescence due to bleaching. Secretion was evoked by application of 100 μm histamine. In some experiments, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to VWF (Dako Ltd.) conjugated to Alexa-546 using an anti-rabbit IgG Zeon Alexa Fluor 546 kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions was added along with histamine at a final bath dilution of 1:1000. In these experiments, EGFP and Alexa-546 fluorescence were acquired sequentially in time-lapse using 555 ± 38 nm excitation and 617 ± 73 nm emission filters for Alexa-546. The time course for changes in total WPB fluorescence following exocytosis was determined from time-lapse movies using the image analysis software Image J (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Briefly, a region of interest was selected to include a single fluorescent WPB, and the total fluorescence within the region of interest was determined frame by frame through the image sequence. The fluorescence signal was corrected for background fluorescence by frame-by-frame subtraction of fluorescence from an adjacent region of interest lacking fluorescent WPBs. Data were normalized to the peak fluorescence after WPB exocytosis, and the time taken for fluorescence intensity to decline by 50% was used to compare the times for dispersal of proregion or VWF-EGFP from the release sites. VWF-EGFP and Proregion-EGFP Are Correctly Targeted to WPBs When Expressed in HUVECs—Expression of VWF-EGFP (Fig. 1, a–c) or proregion-EGFP (Fig. 1, d–f) in HUVECs resulted in the appearance of fluorescent, rod-shaped organelles that contained VWF. The VWF-EGFP- or proregion-EGFP-positive organelles recruited the known WPB membrane proteins P-selectin (22Bonfanti R. Furie B.C. Furie B. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1109-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CD63 (23Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1993; 82: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although, as previously reported, the majority of CD63 is found in late endosomes/lysosomes (17Arribas M. Cutler D.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Vischer U.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 1993; 82: 1184-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi T. Vischer U.M. Rosnoblet C. Lebrand C. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Kruithof E.K. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1829-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (see Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Histamine Evokes Exocytosis of VWF-EGFP- and Proregion-EGFP-containing WPBs—Stimulation of VWF-EGFP-expressing HUVECs with histamine (100 μm, room temperature) caused the disappearance of fluorescent WPBs and the formation of distinctive patches of VWF-EGFP (Movie 1). Fig. 2A and Movie 2 confirm that the collapse of individual VWF-EGFP-containing WPBs represents true exocytosis. In this experiment, an extracellular Alexa-546-conjugated anti-VWF antibody was applied at the same time as histamine to detect newly secreted VWF. The rapid binding (within a few seconds of WPB collapse) and co-localization of the anti-VWF antibody with patches of fluorescent VWF-EGFP confirm the extracellular nature of the newly formed patches of fluorescent VWF-EGFP. Exposure of non-stimulated cells to the fluorescent VWF antibody alone did not evoke exocytosis or formation of extracellular patches of VWF (data not shown). Histamine also evoked exocytosis of proregion-EGFP-containing WPBs (Movie 3). Fig. 2B and Movie 4 show the exocytosis of a single proregion-EGFP-containing WPB evoked by histamine and in the presence of an extracellular Alexa-546-conjugated anti-VWF antibody. In this case, proregion-EGFP was seen to rapidly disperse from the release site and did not form extracellular patches. The fluorescent VWF antibody detected extracellular VWF (co-packaged in the WPBs with the proregion-EGFP) at the release site within a few seconds of WPB exocytosis. VWF-EGFP but Not Proregion-EGFP Is Lost Slowly from Release Site after WPB Exocytosis—Experiments were carried out at 37 °C. When imaged with subsecond time resolution, an abrupt increase in the fluorescence of intra-WPB-EGFP is seen prior to or coinciding with release of contents (e.g. Figs. 2B and 3). This increase in fluorescence is due to the collapse of the WPB intra-granule pH to that of the extracellular medium (pH 7.4) following WPB fusion to the plasma membrane, and it is described in more detail elsewhere (25Erent M. Hannah M.J. Skehel P. Moisoi N. Zupancic G. Manneville J-B. Ogden D. Carter T.D. Biophys. J. 2004; 86 (Abstr. LB60)Google Scholar). WPB exocytosis can occur on both the upper and lower surfaces of the HUVEC cell membrane, and the time course data analyzed here represent a mixture of both cases. Fig. 3 shows the total fluorescence of a WPB containing proregion-EGFP (Fig. 3A) or VWF-EGFP (Fig. 3B) during exocytosis. The data are normalized to the peak fluorescence seen at the point of fusion. Exocytosis of proregion-EGFP-containing WPBs (Fig. 3A) resulted in an abrupt increase in fluorescence (mean, 2.7 ± 0.7-fold, n = 32 WPBs) followed by a rapid decline to background levels. No persistent extracellular patches of fluorescence could be observed. The time taken for fluorescence to decline to 50% of the initial peak increase was 2.98 ± 1.88 s (±S.D., n = 32 WPBs). Exocytosis of VWF-EGFP-containing WPBs also resulted in an abrupt increase in fluorescence (mean, 2.6 ± 0.6-fold, n = 20 WPBs) (Fig. 3B). Following the peak of the fluorescence increase, the fluorescence of newly formed extracellular patches of VWF-EGFP declined slowly toward background levels. The decline in fluorescence of extracellular patches of VWF-EGFP was interpreted as the loss of VWF-EGFP from the cell surface. The time taken for fluorescence to decline to 50% of the initial peak increase was 323.5 ± 146.2 s (±S.D., n = 20 WPBs). Extracellular fluorescent patches of VWF-EGFP at sites of WPB exocytosis could be observed 30–40 min after exocytosis. The dramatic difference in the rate of dispersal of proregion-EGFP compared with VWF-EGFP is highlighted in Fig. 3C. For easier comparison, the normalized fluorescence data from Fig. 3A (black trace) and Fig. 3B (gray trace) were aligned at the point of WPB fusion and plotted on an expanded time scale to show the period immediately following fusion (Fig. 3C, iii). Images corresponding to the time points indicated by open circles in the traces in Fig. 3C, iii are shown in Fig. 3C, i (proregion-EGFP) and ii (VWF-EGFP). Circulating VWF comprises predominantly dimers and low molecular weight multimers of VWF derived from constitutive secretion from vascular endothelial cells (see Ref. 1Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These forms of soluble VWF do not readily adhere to the surface membrane of platelets or endothelial cells but can bind to exposed extracellular matrix components and promote platelet adhesion following vessel damage (26Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar). VWF stored in WPBs consists of a highly multimeric form of VWF (27Sporn L.A. Marder V.J. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 185-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 28Sporn L.A. Marder V.J. Wagner D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cultured endothelial cells with thrombin or histamine results in WPB exocytosis and the appearance of complex patches of this form of VWF on the cell surface (15Romani de Wit T. Rondaij M.G. Hordijk P.L. Voorberg J. van Mourik J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Sporn L.A. Marder V.J. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 185-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The function of WPB-derived VWF on the endothelial surface is not clear. Basolateral secretion (toward the basement membrane) has been suggested to increase endothelial adhesion to the extracellular matrix components through interactions between VWF, endothelial integrin receptors, and basement membrane components (see Ref. 29Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In vivo experiments have shown that apical secretion of VWF elicited by histamine supports platelet attachment and rolling on the endothelial cell membrane (6Andre P. Denis C.V. Ware J. Saffaripour S. Hynes R.O. Ruggeri Z.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3322-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course and extent of VWF-dependent platelet-endothelial surface interactions will depend in part on the kinetics of WPB exocytosis, VWF release, and the rate of its dispersal or loss from the endothelial cell surface. The time course for VWF-dependent platelet adhesion and rolling on the endothelial surface determined in vivo (6Andre P. Denis C.V. Ware J. Saffaripour S. Hynes R.O. Ruggeri Z.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3322-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) includes a delay between endothelial stimulation and platelet adhesion of 15–20 s before an abrupt increase in the numbers of adherent and rolling platelets is seen, peaking ∼30–60 s after stimulation, and followed by a slow decline in the numbers of adherent and rolling platelets over 5–6 min to a lower but significantly elevated level (6Andre P. Denis C.V. Ware J. Saffaripour S. Hynes R.O. Ruggeri Z.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3322-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that WPB exocytosis in response to elevated [Ca2+]i includes a delay of 10–20 s (25Erent M. Hannah M.J. Skehel P. Moisoi N. Zupancic G. Manneville J-B. Ogden D. Carter T.D. Biophys. J. 2004; 86 (Abstr. LB60)Google Scholar, 30Zupancic G. Ogden D. Magnus C.J. Wheeler-Jones C. Carter T.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 741-755Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which may account in part for the delay in platelet adhesion observed following endothelial activation in vivo (6Andre P. Denis C.V. Ware J. Saffaripour S. Hynes R.O. Ruggeri Z.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3322-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that WPB exocytosis in living HUVECs leads to the formation of complex extracellular patches of VWF-GFP identical to those observed in histological studies following hormone stimulation (27Sporn L.A. Marder V.J. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1986; 46: 185-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and in live HU-VECs (15Romani de Wit T. Rondaij M.G. Hordijk P.L. Voorberg J. van Mourik J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the latter study (15Romani de Wit T. Rondaij M.G. Hordijk P.L. Voorberg J. van Mourik J.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a time resolution of 60 s did not allow a detailed study of the formation and loss of VWF-EGFP from extracellular patches on the cell surface. Here we describe in more detail the slow, complex time course for loss of VWF-EGFP from extracellular patches with improved time resolution. There was some variability in the time course of VWF-EGFP loss from WPBs. This may reflect both a complex interplay of adhesive interactions between VWF-EGFP and components of endothelial surface and differences in the local environment in which the exocytotic events occurred (e.g. those that might exist on upper or lower surfaces of the cell). The overall slow time course for VWF-GFP dispersal seen here occurs over a similar time scale to the slow decrease in platelet adhesion and rolling observed in vivo (6Andre P. Denis C.V. Ware J. Saffaripour S. Hynes R.O. Ruggeri Z.M. Wagner D.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 3322-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the latter may be due in part to the slow loss of VWF from the endothelial surface membrane following WPB exocytosis. In contrast to VWF-EGFP, proregion-EGFP is rapidly lost from release sites (>2 orders of magnitude faster than VWF-EGFP), confirming that proregion does not form a strong association with either extracellular VWF or other endothelial surface components (9Wagner D.D.

Using stacked broadband records from the Gräfenberg array in Germany, we documented a high signal-to-noise phase, the arrival time and slowness of which agree with theoretical predictions for PKJKP. The back azimuth of this arrival is also consistent with predictions for PKJKP, as is the comparison with a pseudoliquid inner core model. Envelope modeling of the PKJKP waveform implies a shear velocity gradient with depth in the inner core that is slightly larger than that in the preliminary reference Earth model."

Overexpression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor USF2 and coactivator p300 enhanced the AEBSF-dependent response of the HO-1 promoter.

The homeostasis of cellular heme levels is controlled tightly, because heme is the prosthetic group of key enzymes such as inducible nitric-oxide synthase, cytochrome P450s, or soluble guanylate cyclase (2Wijayanti N. Katz N. Immenschuh S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

Med. 2000; 28: 289-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). More recently, the HO products carbon monoxide and biliverdin have been recognized to be of physiological significance (4Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). Carbon monoxide is an important signaling gas (5Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Choi A.M. Nat.

McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar).

The anti-inflammatory effect of HO-1 has initially been shown in a model of acute complement-dependent pleurisy (12Willis D. Moore A.R. Frederick R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) and has essentially been confirmed in a HO-1 knock-out mouse model and a case of genetic human HO-1 deficiency (13Poss K.D. Tonegawa S.

HO-1-deficient mice develop a chronic inflammatory state and are highly susceptible to organ damage by the prototypical inflammatory mediator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10925-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). In mononuclear phagocytes HO-1 gene expression is induced by LPS (16Camhi S.L. Alam J. Otterbein L. Sylvester S.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (17Muraosa Y.

LPS-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase is mediated by direct interaction of Toll-like receptor 4 with this enzyme (18Park H.S. Jung H.Y. Park E.Y. Kim J. Lee W.J. Bae Y.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and TPA is a prototypical activator of NAD(P)H oxidase in monocytes (19Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, gene expression of NAD(P)H oxidase and HO-1 has been demonstrated to be simultaneously increased in monocytes of diabetic patients (20Avogaro A. Pagnin E. Calo L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential regulatory role of NAD(P)H oxidase for the induction of HO-1 gene expression by LPS and TPA we applied the pharmacological NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) to monocytes. AEBSF, also known as Pefabloc, chemically modifies cytochrome b559 activity (21Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wikstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13292-13301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the differentiation of promyelocytic cells (22Bestilny L.J. Riabowol K.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and F-actin distribution in pancreatic cells (23Singh V.P. Saluja A.K. Bhagat L. Hietaranta A.J. Song A. Mykoniatis A. Van Acker G.J. Steer M.L. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1818-1827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we observed that AEBSF induces HO-1 gene expression in cell cultures of human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) and the mouse monocytic cell line RAW264.7. It is reported that the AEBSF-dependent induction of the HO-1 gene expression is regulated via activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling pathway as determined by the application of pharmacological inhibitors and overexpressed mutant isoforms of PKB. Moreover, activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is required in a PKB-dependent manner for the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 gene expression. An E-box motif and a cAMP response element (CRE)/AP-1 element of the proximal rat HO-1 gene promoter region are involved in the regulation of HO-1 gene expression by AEBSF. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 was obtained from Invitrogen, fetal bovine serum was from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany), Ficoll-Paque was from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany), CD14+ immunomagnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore. Falcon tissue culture dishes were from BD Biosciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and Roche Applied Science, unless otherwise indicated. Generation of Monocytes and Cell Culture—Human PBMC were isolated from buffy coats of healthy blood donors by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation. CD14+ monocytes were purified (>95%) using CD14+ immunomagnetic microbeads, and 3 × 106 cells were cultured in six-well flat bottom plates in 3 ml of RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 2 days, 50% of the supernatant was replaced with medium containing either AEBSF (250 μm), LPS (1 μg/ml), or TPA (0.5 μm). The studies with human blood samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board. RAW264.7 cells were from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cell cultures were kept under air/CO2 (19:1) at 100% humidity. Treatment of cells with AEBSF was performed with serum-free medium at 250 μm, unless otherwise indicated. The specific inhibitors of PI3K LY294002 (Calbiochem), PKB SH-5 (Alexis Biochemicals), MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase PD98059 (Calbiochem), of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) SP600125 (Biomol) and of p38 SB203580 or SB202190 (Calbiochem) were added to the culture medium at the indicated concentrations. Western Blot Analysis—After washing cell cultures twice with 0.9% NaCl, 300 μl of lysis buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% glycerol, bromphenol blue, 0.4 mol/liter dithiothreitol, 4% protease inhibitors) were added, and cells were scraped from culture dishes and then homogenized by passage through a 25-gauge needle (24Hess A.

The homogenate was incubated for 3 min at 95 °C, and the protein content was determined in the supernatant by the Bradford method (24Hess A. Wijayanti N. Neuschafer-Rube A.P. Katz N. Kietzmann T.

Total protein (60 μg) was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after electrophoresis. Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies against HO-1 (Stressgen, Victoria, BC, Canada), cyclooxygenase-2 (Alexis Biochemicals), inducible nitric-oxide synthase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (HyTest, Turku, Finland) were used at 1:1000 dilution. The primary antibodies for the detection of phosphorylated and total MAPKs, phosphorylated PKB (Thr308) and total PKB, were from Cell Signaling and were applied at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. The secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG (Acris Antibodies, Hiddenhausen, Germany) and used at 1:10,000. A commercial detection system (Lumi-Light, Roche Applied Science) was used for detecting chemiluminescence signals according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained chemiluminescent autoradiographic signals were scanned by videodensitometry and quantitated with Imagequant software (25Kietzmann T. Samoylenko A. Immenschuh S. J. Biol.

The reporter gene plasmid pNF-κB with four tandem copies of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) consensus sequence was obtained from Clontech, the plasmid pAP-1 with three AP-1 repeats in front of a minimal fos promoter was a gift from Dr. Craig A. Hauser (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) (28Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar), and pGal4-luc with five copies of the yeast Gal4 binding element was from Stratagene. Expression vectors for dominant negative PKB, constitutively active PKB (myrPKB), and wild type p300 have been described previously (29Roth U. Curth K. Unterman T.G. Kietzmann T. J. Biol.

Plasmid pFA-CHOP with the transactivation domain of the TF CHOP fused with the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4 and the empty control vector pFC2-dbd were from Stratagene. Expression vectors containing dominant negative mutants (AF) of p38α, β, γ, and δ isoforms were from Dr. Jiahuai Han (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The expression vectors for USF2 wild type and mutant (ΔbTDU1) were from Dr. Axel Kahn (Institut Cochin, Paris, France) (30Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J.

Transfection and Luciferase Assay—After growth for 24 h, transfection of plasmid DNA into RAW264.7 cells was performed by the liposome method using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (24Hess A.

Unless otherwise stated cells were transfected with 0.5–1 μg of reporter plasmid, and in cotransfection experiments with 0.1–1.5 μg of the indicated expression vectors. Cells were lysed with luciferase lysis reagent (Promega), and luciferase activity was determined with a commercial luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were either harvested 24 h after transfection or treated for another 18 h with AEBSF or other reagents, as indicated. Relative light units of luciferase activity were normalized with sample protein. Induction of HO-1 Gene Expression by the NAD(P)H Oxidase Inhibitor AEBSF in Cell Cultures of Human PBMC and Mouse RAW264.7 Cells—HO-1 gene expression has previously been shown to be up-regulated by the inflammatory mediator LPS (16Camhi S.L. Alam J. Otterbein L. Sylvester S.L. Choi A.M.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the phorbol ester TPA in monocytic cells (17Muraosa Y. Shibahara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7881-7991Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because LPS and TPA are activators of the monocyte NAD(P)H oxidase, we postulated that the chemical NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) would decrease the induction of HO-1 gene expression by these compounds. Unexpectedly, AEBSF treatment alone of both human PBMC and the mouse monocytic cell line RAW264.7 led to a marked induction of endogenous HO-1 gene expression as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). The magnitude of endogenous HO-1 gene induction by AEBSF was in the same range as that observed for LPS in human PBMC and that for LPS and TPA in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1, A and B). For a comparison, we also determined the effects of these stimuli on cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression, which has previously been shown to be induced by LPS and TPA in monocytes (31Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). In contrast to HO-1, cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression was markedly up-regulated by TPA and LPS but not by AEBSF in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 1B). A similar observation was made for the regulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene expression which was not affected by treatment with AEBSF but was strongly up-regulated by the known inducer LPS (data not shown). When added in combination with LPS or TPA, AEBSF had an additive effect on the LPS-dependent induction of HO-1 protein levels and caused no major alteration of HO-1 induction by TPA (Fig. 1C). Treatment with 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonamide (AEBSA), a homologue of AEBSF in which the fluoride of AEBSF is replaced by an amide group and has no inhibitory effect on NAD(P)H oxidase activity (21Diatchuk V. Lotan O. Koshkin V. Wikstroem P. Pick E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13292-13301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), did not affect the basal or LPS-induced HO-1 gene expression (Fig. 1C). The increase of HO-1 protein expression by AEBSF occurred in a time-dependent manner with a maximum after 8 h (Fig. 1D). The specificity of the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 was confirmed by dose-dependence experiments. The minimum concentration that reproducibly induced HO-1 gene expression was higher than 50 μm, and a maximum was observed at concentrations between 250 μm and 500 μm (data not shown). Concentrations higher than 1 mm appeared to be toxic in RAW264.7 cells. An increase of HO-1 gene expression by AEBSF was also observed in human umbilical cord endothelial cells but not in cell cultures of porcine kidney epithelial cells (LLC-PK1) or human cervix epithelial cells (HeLa cells), suggesting a cell-specific mode of HO-1 gene regulation by this compound (data not shown). The data indicate that AEBSF is a potent inducer of endogenous HO-1 gene expression in monocytic cells. Induction of HO-1 Promoter Activity by AEBSF—HO-1 gene regulation by most stimuli occurs at the transcriptional level (7Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 8Alam J. Igarashi K. Immenschuh S. Shibahara S. Tyrrell R.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To probe into the mechanism of AEBSF-dependent HO-1 gene induction, RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct containing the proximal 1338 bp of the rat HO-1 gene promoter (pHO-1338), which was markedly up-regulated by treatment with AEBSF. The level of AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 promoter activity was in a similar range as that observed for LPS, but lower than that observed for TPA (Fig. 2A). Simultaneous treatment with AEBSF plus LPS had an additive effect on HO-1 promoter activity. For a comparison, the effect of AEBSF was also examined in RAW264.7 cells transfected with reporter gene constructs containing multiple copies of the consensus recognition sequences for either NF-κB (pNF-κB) or AP-1 (pAP-1). Both NF-κB and AP-1 have previously been shown to be key TFs for LPS- and TPA-mediated gene regulation in mononuclear phagocytes (32Guha M. Mackman N. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). No induction by AEBSF was observed for luciferase activity of pAP-1 and pNF-κB (Fig. 2A), but LPS and TPA markedly induced luciferase activity of these reporter gene constructs (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, LPS-dependent induction of constructs pNF-κB and pAP-1 was reduced by simultaneous treatment with AEBSF (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Similarly, the TPA-dependent induction of pNF-κB, but not that of pAP-1, was inhibited by the presence of AEBSF (Fig. 2A, lower panel). No regulatory effect on the promoter activity of pHO-1338 was observed for the AEBSF homologue AEBSA (Fig. 2B), which agrees with the regulation of endogenous HO-1 gene expression (Fig. 1C). The data suggest that the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 gene expression is mediated via a transcriptional mechanism which seems to be independent of NF-κB and AP-1. Regulatory Role of the PI3K/PKB Pathway for AEBSF-dependent Activation of HO-1 Gene Expression—The PI3K/PKB signaling pathway has recently been demonstrated to be involved in the induction of HO-1 gene expression by carnosol (33Martin D. Rojo A.I. Salinas M. Diaz R. Gallardo G. Alam J. De Galarreta C.M. Cuadrado A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8919-8929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) and the 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin (34Lee T.S. Chang C.C. Zhu Y. Shyy J.Y. Circulation. 2004; 110: 1296-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To evaluate the regulatory role of this pathway for the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 expression various pharmacological inhibitors were used for pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells. Up-regulation of endogenous HO-1 expression and that of HO-1 promoter activity by AEBSF was markedly reduced by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the PKB inhibitor SH-5 caused a significant reduction of HO-1 promoter induction by AEBSF (Fig. 3B). To verify that AEBSF is an activator of PKB, cell extracts of AEBSF-treated RAW264.7 cells were analyzed for phosphorylated and total PKB. A marked increase of Thr308-phosphorylated PKB was observed upon AEBSF treatment (Fig. 3C). To confirm the functional relevance of PKB activation for AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 gene expression, we also determined the effects of overexpressed dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of PKB. Overexpression of dominant negative PKB slightly increased basal HO-1 promoter activity, but abolished the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 promoter activity (Fig. 3D). Overexpressed dominant negative phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, an effector molecule of PI3K that targets PKB, also inhibited the AEBSF-dependent activation of HO-1 promoter activity (data not shown). Finally, the specificity of HO-1 gene expression via the PKB pathway was examined by cotransfection of a constitutively active mutant of PKB (myrPKB), which led to a significant up-regulation of HO-1 gene promoter activity (Fig. 3E). The data indicate that the PI3K/PKB signaling cascade is crucially involved in the AEBSF-dependent regulation of HO-1 gene expression. Role of p38 MAPK for HO-1 Gene Regulation by AEBSF—To determine the potential regulatory role of MAPKs for the induction of HO-1 gene expression by AEBSF, the phosphorylation of MAPKs was analyzed by Western blotting in RAW264.7 cells. Phosphorylation of JNK and p38 was increased in AEBSF-treated cells with a maximum after 30 min. By contrast, no effect was observed for the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in AEBSF-treated cells (Fig. 4A). As a control, treatment with LPS led to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). Next, we examined the effects of specific MAPK inhibitors on the AEBSF-dependent regulation of the endogenous HO-1 gene expression. The p38 inhibitor SB203580, but not the ERK inhibitor PD98059 nor the JNK inhibitor SP600125, reduced the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 protein expression (Fig. 4, B–D). To investigate the role of MAPKs for the transcriptional regulation of the HO-1 gene by AEBSF, the effects of MAPK inhibitors on HO-1 promoter activity were determined. Although inhibitors of the ERK and JNK pathways, PD98059 and SP600125, respectively, had no effect (Fig. 5A), the p38 inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 abolished AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 promoter activity (Fig. 5B). The regulatory role of p38 for AEBSF-dependent HO-1 gene induction was further delineated by cotransfection of expression vectors with dominant negative mutants (AF) of the p38α, -β, -γ, and -δ isoforms. Overexpression of dominant negative p38α and p38β significantly reduced the induction of HO-1 promoter activity by AEBSF, but dominant negative forms of p38γ and p38δ had only minor inhibitory effects (Table I). Taken together, these data suggest that p38α and p38β play a major regulatory role for the induction of HO-1 gene expression by AEBSF.Table IComparative effects of overexpressed dominant negative p38 isoforms on AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 promoter activityContransfected plasmid-Fold induction of luciferase activity by AEBSFEmpty vector4.5 ± 0.5p38α dn1.3 ± 0.2aSignificant differences p38α dn + AEBSF versus empty vector + AEBSF, p38β dn + AEBSF versus empty vector + AEBSF; p ≤ 0.05.

Open table in a new tab p38 Is a Downstream Target of AEBSF-dependent PKB Activation—To find out whether PKB is required for AEBSF-dependent stimulation of p38 MAPK, p38 activity was determined with a fusion plasmid containing the transactivation domain of the TF CHOP and the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4 (pFA-CHOP). Transactivation via pFA-CHOP is specifically controlled by p38-dependent phosphorylation of two adjacent regulatory serine residues of the CHOP transactivation domain (35Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), which can be monitored via a cotransfected Gal4 luciferase reporter gene construct (pGal4-luc). Treatment with AEBSF strongly induced activity of pFA-CHOP in a similar range as the known p38 activator TPA (Fig. 6). AEBSF-dependent induction of pFA-CHOP was reduced by pretreatment with the PKB inhibitor SH-5 and overexpression of dominant negative PKB. As expected, the up-regulation of pFA-CHOP-mediated luciferase activity was inhibited by the p38 inhibitor SB202190. The data suggest that in RAW264.7 cells AEBSF-dependent activation of PKB is required for activation of p38. Role of the E-box and CRE/AP-1 Elements for AEBSF- and PKB-dependent Induction of HO-1 Promoter Activity—To identify the cis-acting regulatory element(s) that mediate(s) the AEBSF-dependent induction of HO-1 gene expression, various HO-1 promoter gene constructs were transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells.

These results suggest that the Rin/Rit-PAR6-Rac/Cdc42 ternary complex may work physiologically in the cells, such as in tumorigenesis. The Ras superfamily of small GTPases has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation (1Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). It functions as a molecular switch by cycling from the inactive GDP-bound state to the active GTP-bound state (1Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Activation of small GTPases requires guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and inactivation was promoted by GTPase-activating proteins that accelerate the rate of intrinsic GTPase activity (2Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the active GTP-bound state, they interact with many cellular targets to exhibit their biological effects (1Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 2Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The newly discovered GTPases Rin and Rit have been classified into the Ras superfamily (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wes P.D. Yu M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). They share high sequence identity with Ras and have a highly conserved but distinct G2 effector region (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, they display characteristics not observed in other members of the Ras superfamily, such as calmodulin binding activity and the lack of a typical C-terminal prenylation motif (CAAX motif) required for membrane association (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rin is expressed only in neurons, whereas Rit is ubiquitously expressed (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that Rin is activated by stimulation with a growth factor using a Rin pull down assay system (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and that Rin induces neurite out-growth through the activation of endogenous Rac/Cdc42 and its association with calmodulin in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (7Hoshino M. Nakamura S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rit also inhibits growth factor withdrawal-mediated apoptosis and induces neurite extension in pheochromocytoma cells (8Spencer M.L. Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20160-20168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like 3/Ras pathway modulator was reported to be an effector of GTP-bound Rit and Ras, to activate the small GTPase Ral and to inhibit Elk-1-dependent gene induction (9Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26914-26924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ehrhardt G.R.A. Korherr C. Wieler J.S. Knaus M. Schrader J.W. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These studies raised the possibility that Rin and Rit play important roles in the control of the calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling pathways. However, the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor-like 3/Ras pathway modulator is the only effector of Rit that has been characterized so far, and the intracellular functions or signal transduction pathways of Rin and Rit, especially the effectors, largely remain to be elucidated. Cell polarity is critical for many cellular functions. Polarized epithelial cells are organized into apical and basolateral surface domains (11Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar). Recent studies reveal that the partitioning-defective protein PAR6 is a pivotal component of the cell polarity-regulating molecular machinery (12Ohno S. Curr. Opin.

These proteins localize to the subapical region and are involved in the formation or maintenance of tight junctions in epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (18Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Hirose T. Izumi Y. Nagashima Y. Tamai-Nagai Y. Kurihara H. Sakai T. Suzuki Y. Yamanaka T. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2485-2495PubMed Google Scholar). The Rho GTPase family proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 participate in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell growth, and tumorigenesis (20Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). In Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, Rho regulates growth factor-stimulated stress fiber formation, whereas Rac and Cdc42 regulate growth factor-stimulated membrane ruffling and filopodium formation, respectively (20Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). To date, many Rho family effector proteins have been identified. For example, GTP-bound Rac and Cdc42 bind to p21-activated kinases through their CRIB domain and control the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (20Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also demonstrated that GTP-bound Cdc42 functions together with PAR6 in asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans (22Gotta M. Abraham M.C. Ahringer J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 482-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 23Kay A.J. Hunter C.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 474-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Here we show that Rin and Rit directly bind to the PDZ domain of PAR6 in a GTP-dependent manner and that they can form a ternary complex with PAR6 and the active form of Rac/Cdc42. These interactions are important for cell transformation or tumorigenesis in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-c-Myc 9E10 antibody and anti-PAR6 antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) high affinity antibody (3F10) was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-Rin antibody and anti-Rit antibody were from Calbiochem. pGEX vector, glutathione-Sepharose beads, and protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. All chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Expression Plasmids—Myc-Rin and HA-Rin mammalian expression pEF-Bos vectors were constructed as described previously (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mouse Rit and PAR6 expression constructs were produced as pEF-Bos or pCMV mammalian expression vectors with HA tag or Myc tag. Several PDZ domain mutants of PAR6 (PAR6-ΔPDZ mutant and PAR6 PDZ point mutant containing four alanine substitutions, R167A/P168A/L169A/G170A), Rin effector mutant (RinY57C; Rin-EM), and Rit effector mutant (RitY58C; Rit-EM) were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis, as described previously (14Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The coding region of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused PAR6 construct was generated by inserting PAR6 cDNA into the pGEX vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two-hybrid Screening and X-Gal Assay—Two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In X-gal assay, fresh colonies were transferred to a sterile nitrocellulose filter, submerged in a liquid nitrogen pool, and thawed. Then it was put on a pre-soaked filter in the Z buffer/X-gal solution (100 ml of Z buffer, 0.27 ml of 2-mercaptoethanol, 1.67 ml of 20 mg/ml X-gal solution; Z buffer: 16.1 g/liter Na2HPO4-7H2O, 5.5 g/liter NaH2PO4-H2O, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0), and the filters were incubated at 37 °C. The colors of colonies were examined periodically. Purification of Recombinant Rin and Rit Proteins—Recombinant HA-Rin and Rit proteins were produced and purified as described previously (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, Escherichia coli strain DH5α transformed with pGEX vector containing HA-tagged mouse Rin or mouse Rit cDNA was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and cultured over-night at 25 °C. After harvesting, bacterial pellets were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer and were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Bound GST-fused HA Rin or GST-Rit protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione and digested with thrombin for GST tag cleavage. Pull Down Assay and Immunoprecipitation—The pull down assay and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) Cell Cultivation and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), 2 mm l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) instead of fetal bovine serum. Semi-confluent cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, transfectants were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for assays. Western Blotting—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with a primary antibody in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk (BD Biosciences). The primary antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Focus-forming Assay—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% calf serum. Transfection was performed in triplicate using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The foci were enumerated 3 weeks after transfection, as described previously (16Qiu R-G. Abo A. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 697-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Rin Binds to the PDZ Domain of PAR6 in a GTP-dependent Manner—First we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with the constitutively active form of Rin (Rin-CA) (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After sequencing these positive clones, we found several partial cDNA fragments of the PDZ domain of PAR6 protein. To confirm the interaction between Rin and PAR6 within yeast cells, X-gal assay in the yeast L40 strain was performed. As shown in Fig. 1A, two independent transformants containing Rin-CA (bait) and Par6 (prey) genes developed blue color on the filter at 37 °C. However, both cotransformants of empty bait vector and Par6 genes and that of Rin-dominant negative and Par6 genes remained white, indicating that the interaction between Rin-CA and PAR6 in the yeast cells is specific (Fig. 1A). Next we examined whether Rin actually binds to PAR6 GTP-dependently using a GST-PAR6 pull down assay system. COS-7 cells transfected with Myc-tagged wild type Rin protein were lysed, and the lysates were used as Myc-Rin lysates. These cell lysates were preloaded with either GDP or GMPPNP (a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue) and incubated in the presence of GST-PAR6-prebound glutathione-Sepharose beads. Fig. 1B shows that GMPPNP-pre-loaded Rin tightly binds to the GST-full-length PAR6 protein after 2× buffer wash and that GDP-bound Rin has no affinity for it. Rin did not bind to GST proteins (Fig. 1B). In order to define the PDZ domain in PAR6 responsible for the interaction with the GTP-Rin protein, we constructed a fusion protein comprising GST and the PDZ domain of PAR6. As shown in Fig. 1B, both GDP-bound and GMPPNP-bound Rin associated with the PDZ domain. Moreover, Rin protein failed to associate with either the PAR6-ΔPDZ mutant (PDZ domain-deleted mutant of PAR6) or PAR6-PDZ point mutant (PAR6 mutant containing alanine mutations of four consecutive residues within the PDZ domain) (Fig. 1B). These residues were reported to be critical for interaction with target proteins, such as Par3 (14Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The dependence of GTP on the association with the full-length PAR6 suggests that PAR6 may be an effector molecule of Rin. To investigate whether PAR6 is an effector of Rin, a pull down assay using a Rin effector mutant (RinY57C; Rin-EM) was performed. The cognate Y40C mutant in Ras was point-mutated in the effector region, shown not to bind to effector molecules, and regarded as an effector mutant (1Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Kozasa T. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 349-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, Rin-EM did not associate with PAR6. Not GDP-preloaded but GMPPNP-preloaded GST-Rin protein successfully pulled down the full-length PAR6 (Fig. 1D). To determine whether an active form of Rin directly associates with PAR6, we used recombinant Rin protein purified from E. coli instead of COS-7 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 1E, recombinant Rin protein bound to PAR6 in a GTP-dependent manner. These results suggest that Rin directly associates with PAR6 GTP-dependently and that the PDZ domain of PAR6 is necessary and sufficient for the association. PAR6 Coimmunoprecipitated Rin—To investigate whether PAR6 interacts with Rin in vivo, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with pEF-Bos expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged PAR6 and a HA-tagged wild type Rin or constitutively active form of Rin (Rin-CA) and were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody. Fig. 2A shows that Myc-full-length PAR6 coimmunoprecipitated both wild type HA-Rin and HA-Rin-CA. Myc-PAR6-ΔPDZ mutant failed to coimmunoprecipitate Rin protein (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that PAR6 associates with Rin through its PDZ domain not only in vitro but also in living cells. To test for an endogenous interaction between Rin and PAR6, endogenous PAR6 protein from Rin-expressing cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PAR6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, Rin protein was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PAR6 protein. GTP-Rit Also Binds to the PDZ Domain of PAR6—Rit is a very close relative of Rin, and the expression of Rin is restricted to the developing and adult brain, whereas Rit is expressed in almost all tissues (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined whether Rit also binds to the PDZ domain of PAR6 in a GTP-dependent manner. COS-7 cell lysates containing Myc-tagged wild type Rit were subjected to a GST-PAR6 pull down assay. As shown in Fig. 3A, GMPPNP-preloaded Myc-Rit protein bound to GST-full-length PAR6, but the GDP-preloaded protein did not. Rit did not bind to GST proteins (Fig. 3A). Both GDP- and GMPPNP-preloaded Myc-Rit associated with the PDZ domain of PAR6 (Fig. 3A). Neither the PDZ domain-deleted nor the PDZ point mutant of PAR6 could bind to Rit (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether PAR6 is an effector of Rin, a pull down assay using Rit effector mutant (RitY58C; Rit-EM) was performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, Rit-EM did not associate with PAR6. GMPPNP-preloaded GST-Rit protein successfully pulled down PAR6 (Fig. 3C), but the GDP-preloaded protein did not. As shown in Fig. 3D, recombinant Rit protein also bound to PAR6 in a GTP-dependent manner. To investigate this interaction in a mammalian cell, we examined whether Myc-full-length PAR6 coimmunoprecipitated Rit protein using Myc-PAR6 and HA-Rit (both wild type and constitutively active mutant)-coexpressing cell lysates (Fig. 4A). Myc-PAR6-ΔPDZ mutant failed to coimmunoprecipitate the Rit protein (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, Rit protein was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PAR6 protein by using Rit-expressing cell lysates. These results suggest that Rit directly associates with the PDZ domain of PAR6 dependent on GTP both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we performed GST-PAR6 pull down assay using another Ras family small GTPase, H-Ras, to examine the specificity of PAR6-binding properties of Rin/Rit. Rin and Rit have a highly conserved but distinct G2 effector region (HDPTIEDAY) with H-Ras in which histidine is substituted for tyrosine at position 32, and alanine is substituted for serine at position 39 (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3E, constitutively active H-Ras, which is referred to as a GTP-bound state of H-Ras protein, did not bind to the PAR6 protein but did show the affinity for the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1, a well known Ras effector. These results suggest that the PAR6 may be a Rin/Rit-specific effector. Rin and Rit Can Form a Ternary Complex with PAR6 and Rac/Cdc42—It has been demonstrated that PAR6 interacts with Rac and Cdc42 in a GTP-dependent manner through a semi-CRIB motif and a PDZ domain (14Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 15Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Qiu R-G. Abo A. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 697-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To test whether Rin and Rit are capable of forming a complex with PAR6 and Rac/Cdc42 and whether PAR6 is responsible for binding to both Rin/Rit and Rac/Cdc42, we carried out a GST-Rac/Cdc42 pull down assay using recombinant Rin/Rit and PAR6 proteins. Fig. 5 shows that GST-Rac/Cdc42 successfully pulled down both Rin and Rit only in the presence of full-length PAR6 protein GTP-dependently. GST-Rac/Cdc42 pulled down neither Rin nor Rit even in the presence of the PAR6-PDZ point mutant protein (Fig. 5). To investigate whether the ternary complex is formed in vivo, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged Rac/Cdc42, HA-tagged PAR6, and HA-tagged Rin/Rit and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody. Fig. 6, A and B, shows that HA-Rin/Rit interacted with Myc-Rac/Cdc42 only in the presence of full-length HA-PAR6 (Fig. 6, A for Rac and B for Cdc42). Taken together, these results suggest that Rin/Rit links to Rac/Cdc42 through PAR6 in a GTP-dependent manner and that it can form a ternary complex with PAR6 and Rac/Cdc42.Fig. 6Ternary complex formation in vivo. COS-7 cells were transfected with pEF-Bos Myc-Rac (A)/Myc-Cdc42 (B) vector, pEF-Bos HA-PAR6 full-length, and pEF-Bos HA-Rin/pCMV HA-Rit vectors using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h, cells were lysed with an ice-cold lysis buffer, immunoprecipitated (IP) with an anti-Myc antibody, washed twice with the lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a membrane, and probed with an anti-HA antibody. Data are representative of three independent experiments, which gave essentially identical results. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rin and Rit Potentiate Cell Transformation Activity by Rac/Cdc42 through PAR6—It has been shown previously that PAR6 potentiates cell transformation activity by directly interacting with the constitutively active Rac/Cdc42 in NIH3T3 cells (16Qiu R-G. Abo A. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 697-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To provide evidence that a ternary complex consisting of Rin/Rit, PAR6, and Rac/Cdc42 might have a functional role in the cells, a focus-forming assay was carried out in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, Rin-CA/Rit-CA, PAR6, or Rac-CA/Cdc42-CA alone showed weak transformation activity (Fig. 7, A for Rac and B for Cdc42). In contrast, cotransfection of Rin-CA/Rit-CA with PAR6 and Rac-CA/Cdc42-CA resulted in synergistic transformation activity, but either deletion of the PDZ domain of PAR6 or the Rin/Rit effector mutant significantly abolished this synergistic effect (Fig. 7, A and B). These results indicate that Rin and Rit show synergistic cell transformation activity by interacting with Rac/Cdc42 and PAR6 through the PDZ domain of PAR6 and that this ternary complex does have a functional role in vivo, at least in NIH3T3 cells. In this study we described the GTP-dependent interaction of Rin/Rit with the partition-defective protein PAR6 and the effect of this complex on biological functions such as tumorigenesis. The brain-specific protein Rin and ubiquitously expressed Rit are very similar to each other and are members of the Ras superfamily (3Lee C-H.J. Della N.G. Chew C.E. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wes P.D. Yu M. Montell C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5839-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The effector domains of Rin and Rit are identical, suggesting that they share the greater role of an effector, even if some differences do exist. In order to identify the binding partner of Rin, we screened a mouse brain-derived cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system by using a constitutively active mutant of Rin as bait. With this system, we have repeatedly isolated a gene encoding the PDZ domain of PAR6, a pivotal component of the cell polarity-regulating molecular machinery. Two-hybrid analysis and in vitro binding assay demonstrated that the interaction of Rin/Rit with PAR6 requires its PDZ domain and that PAR6 shows preferential binding to the active, GTP-bound form. The PDZ domain is a modular protein interaction domain and is shown to either form a homo/heterodimer with another PDZ-containing protein or bind to a unique C-terminal consensus motif of target proteins (17Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, Rin/Rit has neither a PDZ domain nor a unique C-terminal binding motif. To our knowledge, it is the first time that a small GTP-binding protein is shown to bind directly to the PDZ domain in a GTP-dependent manner. Considering the GTP- and effector region-dependent association of Rin/Rit with PAR6, PAR6 is one of the effector molecules of Rin/Rit. We also showed that H-Ras fails to bind to PAR6; however, it remains to be examined whether another Ras family protein directly binds to the PDZ domain of the effector protein and whether Rin/Rit bind to another PDZ-containing protein besides PAR6. We found that the isolated PDZ domain interacted with both GTP- and GDP-Rin/Rit and that it did not show a GTP-dependent association with Rin. We tried to determine whether Cdc42 regulates the binding of GTP-bound Rin/Rit to PAR6 by using a GST-CRIB-PDZ domain pull down assay. However, we failed to clarify whether Cdc42 regulates the nucleotide dependence of the Rin/Rit association with PAR6 (data not shown). Another sequence in PAR6 might dictate the nucleotide-dependent association with Rin/Rit. Moreover, by using a coimmunoprecipitation method, we detected the interaction of PAR6 with Rin/Rit in vivo. These results suggest that PAR6 acts as a physiological effector for Rin/Rit. We found that wild type Rin/Rit as well as constitutively active Rin/Rit was coimmunoprecipitated with PAR6. We (6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 7Hoshino M. Nakamura S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Spencer et al. (8Spencer M.L. Shao H. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20160-20168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) observed previously that basal levels of GTP-bound wild type Rin/Rit remain quite high and that the amount of wild type Rin precipitated from the COS-7 cell lysates is almost the same as that of constitutively active Rin using a Rin pull down assay system (see Ref. 6Hoshino M. Nakamura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and data not shown). It may be that most Rin/Rit proteins remain in an active GTP-bound state in the cells. We further demonstrated that Rin/Rit, PAR6, and Rac/Cdc42 form a ternary complex in vitro, and this complex functions biologically in a NIH3T3 focus-forming assay. In our previous study (7Hoshino M. Nakamura S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), Rin activated endogenous Rac/Cdc42 in PC12 cells. To examine whether Rin directly associates with Rac/Cdc42, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. However, we failed to detect any direct interaction between Rin and Rac/Cdc42. We further examined whether PAR6 has guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity by using a Rac/Cdc42 pull down assay. However, we did not find evidence that PAR6 is a Rac/Cdc42 activator (data not shown). There may be a linking molecule(s) that has guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity between Rin and Rac/Cdc42, distinct from PAR6. Further investigation is needed to identify the molecule(s) between Rin/Rit and Rac and the activator(s) of Rac/Cdc42 in this Rin/Rit-mediated signaling cascade. In the focus-forming assay, we observed that the cell transformation activity is promoted by a ternary complex consisting of Rin/Rit, PAR6, and Rac/Cdc42 acting in concert. We observed that deletion of the PDZ domain of PAR6 almost completely abolished the synergistic effect of this ternary complex consisting of Rin/Rit, PAR6, and Cdc42. However, deletion of the PDZ domain partially, but not completely, abolished this synergistic effect of the ternary complex of Rin/Rit, PAR6, and Rac. The results raised the possibility that endogenous PAR6 in NIH3T3 cells could form a Rin/Rit-PAR6-Rac complex even in the presence of the PAR6-ΔPDZ mutant, leading to the formation of foci. We cannot rule out the possibility that there may exist another signaling pathway leading to cell transformation that is independent of the formation of a Rin/Rit-PAR6-Rac complex. It was demonstrated previously that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) can form a complex through the N-terminal region of PAR6 and that Par3 also can form a complex through the PDZ domain of PAR6 (24Suzuki A. Yamanaka T. Hirose T. Manabe N. Mizuno K. Shimizu M. Akimoto K. Izumi Y. Ohnishi T. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Another study revealed that the Cdc42-PAR6 system might functionally contribute to cancer through aPKC-GSK-3-APC complex (25Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Whether Rin/Rit participates in the aPKC-Par3-PAR6 complex, whether the kinase activity of aPKC potentiates the focus-forming activity of Rin/Rit, PAR6, and Rac/Cdc42, and whether aPKC adds some biological activity to the complex, such as the formation of cancer through the GSK-3-APC system, remain to be clarified. Besides cell transformation, it might be that neuron-specific Rin is also involved in neuronal polarity. A previous study (26Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) showed that PAR6 is concentrated in the axon of the hippocampal neuron, especially at the tip, and that overexpression of PAR6 resulted in neurons with no axon and a loss of polarity. Whether Rin also colocalizes with PAR6 at the axonal tip of neurons remains to be clarified. It might be an interesting hypothesis that Rin and PAR6 cooperatively regulate neuronal polarity and axon formation. In conclusion, we have identified a novel interaction between Rin/Rit and PAR6. However, many problems about the Rin/Rit-PAR6 signaling pathway, such as the regulation of neuronal polarity and cellular transformation, remain to be elucidated. Further study focusing on these problems will shed light on our understanding of the roles of the novel small GTPases Rin and Rit in tumorigenesis, cancer pathology, cellular polarity, and asymmetrical cell division.

https://openalex.org/W1980756273,"β-catenin is a multifunctional protein involved in both cadherin-mediated adhesion and the wnt signaling cascade. Mutations in exon 3 of β-catenin have been identified in many cancers. In addition to disruption of key serine and threonine residues, mutations are frequently reported in other residues in exon 3 that are not kinase substrates. The most frequently mutated nonserine/threonine residues are D32 and G34. Since D32 and G34 are part of the ubiquitination destruction motif, DSGΦXS, we hypothesize that this motif may contribute to disruption of β-catenin homeostasis and lead to cellular transformation. We demonstrate that the mutants D32A and G34A exhibit no change in phosphorylation by GSK3β, but display reduced ubiquitination compared to wild-type and S33A mutant β-catenin. To assess the functional implications of these mutations, we created stable MDCK cell lines expressing these constructs. We found that stable cell lines harboring D32A-mutated β-catenin were highly transformed, while S33A and G34 demonstrated only weak transforming properties in our assays. Despite altered ubiquitination status and increased transformation, the D32A mutant cell line does not display transcriptional activation of standard target genes. Therefore, D32A mutation may mediate transformation by an alternative β-catenin-mediated signaling pathway."

Isothermal titration calorimetry is now used to examine the binding nature of various UDP-sugars in H2O and D2O solutions. UDP-N-acetylhexosamines bind to EXTL2 with a high affinity in both solutions, resulting in a relatively large increase of entropy, whereas the weak binding of UDP-galactose and -glucose, which occurred only in D2O solution, only slightly increased entropy. Thus, specific donor binding appears to undergo two distinct steps, beginning with the N-acetyl group expelling water from the donor· enzyme complex into the bulk solvent followed by positioning of the donor into the binding site for the subsequent interactions with the enzyme.

Thus, specific donor binding appears to undergo two distinct steps, beginning with the N-acetyl group expelling water from the donor· enzyme complex into the bulk solvent followed by positioning of the donor into the binding site for the subsequent interactions with the enzyme. Glycosyltransferases comprise one of the largest families of enzymes found in nature. Their function is to catalyze the transfer of sugars from an activated donor substrate to various acceptor molecules, producing extremely diverse structures that are critical to a wide range of functions in all living organisms. These functions include storage of energy in the form of glycogen, synthesis of cell surface polysaccharides that mediate cell growth, cell-cell interactions, and the regulation of transcription of several genes (1Perrimon N.

The x-ray crystal structures obtained to date have revealed that glycosyltransferases are similar in structure, with the N-terminal donor binding subdomain nearly identical in all of the structures (5Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Tarbouriech N. Charnook S.J. Davies G.J. J. Mol.

However, the underlying principles of glycosyltransferase substrate specificity remain unknown. Human α-1,4-N-acteylhexosaminyltransferase (EXTL2), 1The abbreviations used are: EXTL2, exostosin-like protein 2; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. a member of the exostosin (EXT)-related family of enzymes, was originally characterized as the enzyme that transfers N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc to the nonreducing end of the common linker region of glucosaminylglycans, completing the specific linker region of the heparan chain (8Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystal structures of EXTL2, solved in the presence of donor UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc molecule, reveal that the sugar moiety of the donor forms only 4 hydrogen bonds with 4 enzyme residues, compared with the UDP moiety, which forms 15 hydrogen bonds with 10 enzyme residues (9Pedersen L.C. Dong J. Taniguchi F. Kitagawa H. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.G. Sugahara K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14420-14428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For those interactions with the sugar moiety, residue Arg-135 interacts with the 3-OH and 4-OH of GalNAc and GlcNAc molecules, respectively, whereas residue Arg-293 forms interactions with the 6-hydroxyl group of both molecules. In addition to its interaction with Arg-293, residue Asp-246 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the 3-hydroxyl group of the GlcNAc moiety. Most noticeably, however, the signature N-acetyl group of the donor sugar molecules resides in an open space and forms no interaction with the enzyme. Given the available structural information, EXTL2 provides an excellent model to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying specific donor-enzyme interactions. Here we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and enzyme kinetics to explore these interactions. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pMAL-2c EXTL2 were grown and harvested as reported previously (9Pedersen L.C. Dong J. Taniguchi F. Kitagawa H. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.G. Sugahara K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14420-14428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cells were then disrupted in a French press at room temperature under pressures varying between 8,000 and 24,000 p.s.i. EXTL2-MAL fusion protein was then purified following ultracentrifugation from the supernatants by absorption onto amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and eluted with 20 mm maltose. The eluted protein was then dialyzed overnight into 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2. The pH of the HEPES buffer was adjusted as necessary. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements were carried out in HEPES buffer using a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (Micro Cal, Inc.) at 30 °C. Substrate solution was injected into a reaction cell containing the protein. Twenty-six injections of 6 μl were done at intervals of 180 s. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using the MicroCal Origin software package. Data analysis was performed by generating a binding isotherm and best fit using the following fitting parameters, n (number of sites), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/degree), and K (binding constant in m–1), and the standard Levenberg-Marquardt methods (10Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1989Google Scholar). Following data analysis, K (m–1) was then converted to Kd (μm). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the protocols described in the accompanying instruction manual. The pairs of primers used for D246A, R293A, and R135A mutations were 5′-ACGCAGAACTGTGACGCCATCGCTATGAATTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAATTCATAGCGATGGCGTCACAGTTCTGCGT-3′, 5′-AGCACTTTCTGCAGGCATCCTACTGTATAAAT-3′ and 5′-ATTTATACAGTAGGATGCCTGCAGAAAGTGCTC-3′, and 5′-AACAAAATGAGAAACGCACTCCAGGTCTTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAAGACCTGGAGTGCGTTTCTCATTTTGTT-3′, respectively. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing with the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit (Applied Biosystems). Enzyme Assays—Hydrolysis was determined as follows. Fifty-three μg of protein were tested in an assay mixture containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 μl of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (36.0 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). pH of the HEPES buffer was adjusted when necessary. Assay mixtures containing radioactive plus nonradioactive UDP-GlcNAc at final concentrations of 16.0, 28.0, 40.0, 52.0, and 80.0 μm were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The incubation mixtures were boiled for 2 min, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 20,400 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants were subjected to a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 30-pg column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 250 mm NH4HCO3 containing 7% 1-propanol using the ÄKTA purifier (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were collected at a rate of 1 ml/min, and the amount of the hydrolyzed product was quantified with a scintillation counter. Data analysis was performed using the Origin version 7.0 software programmed to fit data to an (s/v)-s plot to calculate the Km value and Vmax value using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. K′eq values for UDP-GlcNAc hydrolysis by EXTL2 were determined at 20, 30, 40, and 50 °C by using the final concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc (3.2, 6.4, 9.6, 12.8, and 16 μm). Entropy was calculated by plotting log K′eqversus 1/degrees kelvin (11Segel Irwin H. Biochemical Calculations. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry was utilized to study the nature of donor-EXTL2 interactions in solution. Fig. 1 shows the calorimetric profiles of two binding experiments, demonstrating the clear binding of UDP-GlcNAc but not UDP-Glc to wild type EXTL2. UDP, UDP-GlcNAc, and UDP-GalNAc were all found to bind to EXTL2 at a 1 to 1 ratio (Table I), which was consistent with the x-ray crystal structure showing only 1 donor molecule/EXTL2 molecule (9Pedersen L.C.

The binding affinities were similar; the Kd value of UDP binding was 23 μm, and those of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc were ~61 μm. ITC has been employed previously with α-1,3-galactosyltransferase, which displayed a Kd of 60 μm for its binding to UDP-Gal (12Boix E. Zhang Y. Swaminathan J. Brew K. Achaya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28310-28313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Contrary to our previous supposition that UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc would bind to EXTL2 (5Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the present ITC data clearly demonstrate that neither bind (Table I). Thus, these observations provide direct evidence that despite having no direct interaction with the enzyme, the N-acetyl group determines the binding of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines to EXTL2.Table IThermodynamic parameters, ΔG (cal/mol), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/degree), and n (number of binding sites), for donor binding with wild type EXTL2 in H2O solution at 303 KSubstrateΔGΔHΔSKdnμmUDP−6443.4 ± 193.7−6034 ± 193.71.35122.620.869UDP-GalNAc−5839.1 ± 72.14−2097 ± 72.1412.3561.460.968UDP-GlcNAc−5844.3 ± 68.32−1975 ± 68.3212.7760.801.106UDP-GalNDNDNDNDNDUDP-GlcNDNDNDNDND Open table in a new tab At the donor binding site, the N-acetylhexosamine moiety adopts the conformation and orientation characteristic of substrates binding to glycosyltransferases, rotating at the C-1 atom to bend the unit under the UDP moiety and expose it to the hydroxyl group of the acceptor substrate (13Pedersen L.C. Darden T.A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21869-21873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These characteristics are conserved in the binding of UDP-GlcA and UDP-Gal in the x-ray crystal structures of β-1,3-glucuronsyltransferase and α-1,4-galactosyltransferase, respectively (5Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Boix E. Zhang Y. Swaminathan J. Brew K. Achaya K.R. J.

Biol. 2001; 8: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The binding conformation and orientation are supported by the interactions of the hydroxyl groups of the N-acetylhexosamine moiety with residues (e.g. Arg-135, Arg-293, and Asp-246) at the active site of EXTL2 (9Pedersen L.C. Dong J. Taniguchi F. Kitagawa H. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.G. Sugahara K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14420-14428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The two Arg residues are in position to form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the GlcNAc moiety, whereas the Asp residue is interacting with Arg-293. In mouse and human EXT1, EXT2, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3, Arg-135 and Asp-246 are invariant, with Arg-293 only differing in the mouse and human EXTL1 sequence. Arg-135 forms a characteristic “triad”-like interaction with the 3-OH group of GlcNAc and the side chain of Asp-151, the first Asp of the signature motif DXD in all glycosyltransferases (5Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These characteristic triads are observed in the known structures of other glycosyltransferases (5Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To examine whether these residues play a role in the binding of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, their alanine mutants, known to abrogate transfer activity (9Pedersen L.C. Dong J. Taniguchi F. Kitagawa H. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.G. Sugahara K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14420-14428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), were subjected to ITC experiments. The results of the ITC experiments (Table II) clearly demonstrate that all of the mutants bind to UDP-N-acetylhexosamines at pH 7.5 and that these hydrogen bonding interactions between the N-acetylhexosamine and EXTL2 do not appear to be essential for binding. However, their Kd values for donor binding are also lower than that of wild type EXTL2, suggesting that these residues can be determining factors for binding affinity. EXTL2 hydrolyzes UDP-GlcNAc at a Km value that is similar to its Kd value (Table II). Consistent with their Kd values, the mutants also decrease their Km values for the hydrolysis of UDP-GlcNAc, and, moreover, they exhibit similar Kd and Km values. Because these residues that interact with the N-acetylhexosamine moiety are all charged residues, ITC experiments were performed at pH 5.0 and 9.0 to confirm the role that charge plays in determining the affinity of donor binding. The affinity of wild type EXTL2 increases 10-fold at pH 5.0 compared with the original value at pH 7.5. Conversely, the mutants only slightly alter their binding affinity to UDP-GlcNAc at pH 5.0; among the mutants, the R135A mutant displays the highest increase of 2.5-fold, whereas the D246A mutant decreases the binding affinity 1.7-fold. Wild type EXTL2 increases binding affinity only 3.5-fold at pH 9.0, whereas none of the mutants alters its binding affinity at this pH. The most significant change observed by altering pH was seen in the Vmax values (Fig. 2). The R135A and R293A mutants had significant increases in their Vmax values at pH 5.0, whereas the D246A mutant was not affected at this pH. The Vmax values at pH 9.0 were only slightly decreased, and all of the enzymes had a similar Vmax value. The increase of the Vmax values in acidic conditions suggests that the positive charges of Arg-135 and Arg-293 may serve to regulate the rate of hydrolysis.Table IIBinding and hydrolysis of UDP-GlcNAc by wild type EXTL2 and mutants at different pH valuesEnzymepH 5.0pH 7.5pH 9.0Binding KdaSubstrate concentrations varied from 0.5 to 4 mm, depending upon the concentration of a given enzyme that varied from 5 to 70 μm.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme function can be driven by changes in enthalpy or entropy. When driven by a change in enthalpy, catalysis is initiated by reducing the heat of activation (15Sievers A. Beringer M. Rodina M.V. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the mechanism driven by a change in entropy, enzymes properly position substrates and/or exclude water within their active sites allowing for the reaction to proceed; a process first described by Koshland (16Koshland D.E. Adv. Enzymol. 1960; 22: 45-97PubMed Google Scholar) and later dubbed the “entropy trap” by Westheimer (17Westheimer F.H. Adv. Enzymol. 1962; 24: 441-482PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism works by overcoming the unfavorable entropy of activation usually inherent in a chemical reaction (15Sievers A. Beringer M. Rodina M.V. Wolfenden R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 16Koshland D.E. Adv. Enzymol. 1960; 22: 45-97PubMed Google Scholar, 17Westheimer F.H. Adv. Enzymol. 1962; 24: 441-482PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated by the fact that the absolute ΔS values multiplied by the temperature of the reaction (TΔS) are larger than the absolute ΔH values (Table I), the binding reactions of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc are driven by a change in entropy. The N-acetyl group is the determining factor for this increase of entropy in the binding of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines to EXTL2. This is further supported by the fact that UDP binding only slightly (one-tenth of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamines) increases entropy and is driven by a change in enthalpy. Because increases in entropy in systems at constant temperature are strongly correlated with the loss of previously oriented waters of hydration (18Velazquez-Campoy A. Todd M.J. Freire E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the N-acetyl group may expel water from the area of enzyme·donor complex into the bulk solvent to position UDP-N-acetylhexosamine within the binding site. To provide further evidence that water molecules may be involved in determining the specific donor binding of EXTL2, we performed ITC experiments in the denser and more viscous deuterium oxide (D2O) that forms stronger bonds than the analogous hydrogen bonds formed by H2O (19Kushner D.J. Baker A. Dunstall T.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 77: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Both UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc maintain their ability to bind to EXTL2 in D2O solution with slightly decreased but similar affinities (Kd) to those observed in H2O solution (Table III). Their binding produces positive ΔS values, roughly equal in magnitude to those in H2O solution, indicating that water molecules are critically involved in the binding of EXTL2 to UDP-N-acetylhexosamines. Further evidence substantiating the role of water as well as that of the N-acetyl group in binding was obtained from the findings that both UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc were capable of binding to EXTL2 in D2O solution (Table III). Although their affinities (Kd values) to EXTL2 were still 4–5-fold weaker than those of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, the binding of UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc was accompanied with a very slight increase (nearly zero ΔS) in entropy. No hydrolysis of donor substrate occurs in D2O solution; thus the ΔS values obtained from the ITC experiments in D2O solution are solely the result of donor binding. To corroborate the ΔS values obtained from the ITC experiments, kinetic analysis of the hydrolysis reaction by EXTL2 at temperatures ranging from 20 to 50 °C was performed to obtain an ΔS value for the hydrolysis. This analysis produced a similar ΔS value (17.83 μm) to those produced by ITC experiments (Fig. 3). This similar and positive ΔS value for the hydrolysis further substantiates the characteristic nature of donor binding. Moreover, it is reasonable to conclude that the binding and proper positioning of the donor substrate may be all that is necessary for a reaction to occur.Table IIIThermodynamic parameters, ΔG (cal/mol), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/degree), and n (number of binding sites), for donor binding with wild type EXTL2 in D20 solution at 303 KSubstrateΔGΔHΔSKdnμmUDP−6675.1 ± 278.3−6600 ± 278.30.24815.391.281UDP-GalNAc−6083.4 ± 221.1−3014 ± 221.110.1340.891.094UDP-GlcNAc−6038.3 ± 474.2−3161 ± 474.29.49644.191.279UDP-Gal−5214.2 ± 66.14−4374 ± 66.142.773173.821.174UDP-Glc−5097.1 ± 61.01−4958 ± 61.010.459214.421.001 Open table in a new tab In principle, water can be involved in intermolecular interactions through two processes: by being expelled into the bulk solvent from the site of interaction or by assuming an ordered position within the active site to mediate the interaction (18Velazquez-Campoy A. Todd M.J. Freire E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Quiocho et al. (20Quiocho F.A. Wilson D.K. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have already shown that a bound water molecule determines the sugar specificity of l-arabinose-binding protein. In fact, re-examination of the x-ray crystal structures of EXTL2 reveals a water molecule that is in position to form hydrogen bonds with the phenolic OH of Tyr-193 and the N-acetyl group of UDP-GlcNAc (but not UDP-GalNAc) (9Pedersen L.C.

We mutated this residue to alanine and found that the Y193A mutant fully retains binding ability (with nearly identical values for Kd and ΔS) to UDP-N-acetylhexosamines (Table IV). Thus, this water and its bridging interaction with the N-acetyl group and the phenolic OH are not required for the binding of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines to EXTL2 nor are they the reason for UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc not being able to bind to this enzyme.Table IVThermodynamic parameters, ΔG (cal/mol), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/degree), and n (number of binding sites), for donor binding to EXTL2 mutant Y193A at 303 KSubstrateΔGΔHΔSKdnμmUDP-GalNAc−5917.7 ± 123.1−981.8 ± 123.116.2953.790.909UDP-GlcNAc−6136.9 ± 70.93−788.9 ± 70.9317.6537.440.812UDP-GalNDNDNDNDNDUDP-GlcNDNDNDNDND Open table in a new tab GlcA is another modified monosaccharide component of the heparan chain, and it has been suggested that UDP-GlcA is incapable of binding to EXTL2 because the 6-carboxyl group of the GlcA moiety would clash with the conserved residues within the binding pocket of EXTL2 (5Negishi M. Dong J. Darden T.A. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Contrary to this suggestion, the present results from ITC experiments clearly show that UDP-GlcA binds to EXTL2 with almost identical entropy and a stronger affinity to those of the UDP-N-acetylhexosamines in H2O solution (Table V). With respect to its binding activity, UDP-GlcA appears to expel water like the UDP-N-acetylhexosamines as suggested by its positive ΔS value. Additionally, UDP-GlcA also binds to EXTL2 in D2O solution; its binding in D2O is also accompanied with an increase in entropy, suggesting that the carboxyl group may be facilitating this binding activity in the same manner as the N-acetyl group does for the UDP-N-acteylhexosamines. Contrary to the binding of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines, that of UDP-GlcA significantly increased the binding affinity (Kd), whereas the entropy of binding remained identical to that in H2O solution (Table V). Despite its binding capability, UDP-GlcA is not hydrolyzed by EXTL2. Consistent with this capability, however, UDP-GlcA does inhibit the hydrolysis of UDP-N-acetylhexosamines by EXTL2 (data not shown). In addition to wild type EXTL2, UDP-GlcA binds to the R293A mutant, whereas it cannot bind to the mutants R135A and D246A. The binding to the R293A mutant but not to the R135A and D246A mutants indicates that the GlcA molecule may adopt the same conformation and orientation of the N-acetylhexosamines at the binding site, resulting in directing the 6-carboxyl group toward Arg-135 and Asp-246. Although the x-ray crystal structure of an EXTL2·UDP-GlcA complex should provide us with more insight of the molecular basis for UDP-GlcA binding in the future, these results support the hypothesis that the increase in entropy caused by UDP-GlcA binding is the general mechanism that enables modified monosaccharides to bind to glycosyltransferases.Table VThermodynamic parameters, ΔG (cal/mol), ΔH (cal/mol), ΔS (cal/mol/degree), and n (number of binding sites), for UDP-GlcA binding with wild type EXTL2 and mutants at 303 KEnzymeΔGΔHΔSKdnμmWT*1−6283.3 ± 161.3−1805 ± 161.314.7829.410.995WT*2−7131.1 ± 39.26−1971 ± 39.2617.037.171.106R293A−6323.7 ± 34.85−2209 ± 34.8513.5827.430.760D246ANDNDNDNDNDR135ANDNDNDNDND Open table in a new tab The data presented in this article suggest that the expulsion of water from the donor·EXTL2 complex into the bulk solvent positions the donor to form the hydrogen bond with the conserved residues of EXTL2. Thus, the water expulsion by the N-acetyl group determines the donor specificity of EXTL2. Subsequent interactions allow for the donor molecule to adopt the proper conformation, orientation, and affinity within the active site so as to confer the enzyme with catalytic capability. Although the mechanism by which modifying groups such as N-acetyl and 6-carboxyl groups expel water is unknown at the present time, the characterization of water expulsion as the determining factor for donor substrate specificity suggests that there may be a water barrier that prevents the ligand from moving into the binding site of the protein, and the expulsion of water by modifying groups as the mechanism for donor recognition has uncovered a new concept in understanding molecule-molecule interactions. Our interpretation of the ITC data is also based upon the x-ray crystal structures of EXTL2 in which no specific interaction between the NAc groups with EXTL2 is present. If such an interaction occurs in solution, the underlying mechanism of donor recognition and catalysis may not be understood only by the observed increase in ΔS associated with the modifying groups. The concept of entropy-driven mechanisms for enzyme functions is not a novel one, nor is it limited to EXTL2. Recently, ribosome-catalyzed peptide bond formation and the function of cytidine deaminase have been reported to utilize the entropy trap to process their reactions (15Sievers A. Beringer M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Clearly, the role of entropy and substrate positioning in enzymes and the advantages and disadvantages of using such a mechanism is an area ripe for further exploration."
