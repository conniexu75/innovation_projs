Weis et al. (p. 1520 , published online 11 November) now report electromagnetically induced transparency in an optomechanical system whereby the coupling of a cavity to a light pulse is used to control the transmission of light through the cavity. This approach may help to allow the engineering of light storage and routing on an optical chip."

The iron component transfers oxygen to compounds that are often highly resistant to chemical reaction, but we know very little about the mechanism of this vital detoxification process. Rittle and Green (p. 933 ; see the Perspective by Sligar ) have managed to capture the P450 reaction intermediate by freezing a solution of the enzyme as it reacts with an oxidant. Spectroscopic techniques and kinetic studies then revealed an iron(IV)oxo intermediate that passes its oxygen along to the substrate with remarkable speed."

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain responses to spoken and written language, visual faces, houses, tools, and checkers in adults of variable literacy (10 were illiterate, 22 became literate as adults, and 31 were literate in childhood). As literacy enhanced the left fusiform activation evoked by writing, it induced a small competition with faces at this location, but also broadly enhanced visual responses in fusiform and occipital cortex, extending to area V1. Literacy also enhanced phonological activation to speech in the planum temporale and afforded a top-down activation of orthography from spoken inputs. Most changes occurred even when literacy was acquired in adulthood, emphasizing that both childhood and adult education can profoundly refine cortical organization."

https://openalex.org/W2124557609,"Perfect Imperfections Graphene is composed of six-atom rings, but will include a number of five- and seven-atom rings as defects. Using simulations, Grantab et al. (p. 946 ) show that more defects do not necessarily lead to greater deterioration of mechanical properties. Mismatches caused by differences in the orientation of neighboring crystals are divided into low- and high-angle grain boundaries, and typically it is the lower-angle boundaries that are stronger. In graphene, by contrast, the larger-angle boundaries, which consist of higher-defect densities, are better able to accommodate the strain and prevent failure that originates in the breakup of the seven-member graphene rings. This suggests ways for synthesizing imperfect graphene sheets that will have mechanical properties that are close to those of perfect graphene."
https://openalex.org/W1981044491,"The role of different amygdala nuclei (neuroanatomical subdivisions) in processing Pavlovian conditioned fear has been studied extensively, but the function of the heterogeneous neuronal subtypes within these nuclei remains poorly understood. Here we use molecular genetic approaches to map the functional connectivity of a subpopulation of GABA-containing neurons, located in the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala (CEl), which express protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ). Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in amygdala slices and cell-specific viral tracing indicate that PKC-δ+ neurons inhibit output neurons in the medial central amygdala (CEm), and also make reciprocal inhibitory synapses with PKC-δ− neurons in CEl. Electrical silencing of PKC-δ+ neurons in vivo suggests that they correspond to physiologically identified units that are inhibited by the conditioned stimulus, called CEloff units. This correspondence, together with behavioural data, defines an inhibitory microcircuit in CEl that gates CEm output to control the level of conditioned freezing. The central amygdala, composed mainly of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, is the part of the brain that processes Pavlovian conditioned fear. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature use different yet complementary experimental approaches to arrive at similar conclusions about the functional architecture that underlies the conditioned fear response. They find that two microcircuits are involved, one required for fear acquisition and the other for conditioned fear responses. Haubensak et al. use genetically based functional manipulations to identify a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons that has a key role in gating learned fear. Ciocchi et al. use a combination of in vivo electrophysiological, optogenetic and pharmacological approaches in mice to identify three functionally distinct types of neurons that are embedded in a highly organized local disinhibitory network. The central amygdala relies on inhibitory circuitry to encode fear memories, but how this information is acquired and expressed in these connections is unknown. Two new papers use a combination of cutting-edge technologies to reveal two distinct microcircuits within the central amygdala, one required for fear acquisition and the other critical for conditioned fear responses. Understanding this architecture provides a strong link between activity in a specific circuit and particular behavioural consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2046037975,"There is growing evidence to suggest that endothelial cells are not simply passive conduits for delivering oxygen and nutrients. During embryogenesis, for instance, they induce organogenesis before the circulation has developed. Experiments in a 70% partial hepatectomy liver regeneration model in mice now reveal a molecular pathway by which endothelial cells can sustain liver regeneration after surgical resection. VEGFR2 activation in a defined subpopulation of liver endothelial cells leads to the upregulation of the endothelial-specific transcription factor Id1, which in turn induces the secretion of Wnt2 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which trigger hepatocyte proliferation. This suggests that vascular niche-derived inductive signals that promote liver regeneration could be utilized to initiate and accelerate liver recovery after these surgical procedures. These authors describe a molecular pathway by which endothelial cells sustain liver regeneration after surgical resection. Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor-A receptor-2 in a defined subpopulation of liver endothelial cells leads to the upregulation of the endothelial-specific transcription factor Id1, which in turn induces Wnt2 and hepatocyte growth factor, which are secreted from the endothelial cells and trigger hepatocyte proliferation. During embryogenesis, endothelial cells induce organogenesis before the development of circulation1,2,3,4. These findings suggest that endothelial cells not only form passive conduits to deliver nutrients and oxygen, but also establish an instructive vascular niche, which through elaboration of paracrine trophogens stimulates organ regeneration, in a manner similar to endothelial-cell-derived angiocrine factors that support haematopoiesis5,6,7. However, the precise mechanism by which tissue-specific subsets of endothelial cells promote organogenesis in adults is unknown. Here we demonstrate that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) constitute a unique population of phenotypically and functionally defined VEGFR3+CD34−VEGFR2+VE-cadherin+FactorVIII+CD45− endothelial cells, which through the release of angiocrine trophogens initiate and sustain liver regeneration induced by 70% partial hepatectomy. After partial hepatectomy, residual liver vasculature remains intact without experiencing hypoxia or structural damage, which allows study of physiological liver regeneration. Using this model, we show that inducible genetic ablation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A receptor-2 (VEGFR2) in the LSECs impairs the initial burst of hepatocyte proliferation (days 1–3 after partial hepatectomy) and subsequent reconstitution of the hepatovascular mass (days 4–8 after partial hepatectomy) by inhibiting upregulation of the endothelial-cell-specific transcription factor Id1. Accordingly, Id1-deficient mice also manifest defects throughout liver regeneration, owing to diminished expression of LSEC-derived angiocrine factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Wnt2. Notably, in in vitro co-cultures, VEGFR2-Id1 activation in LSECs stimulates hepatocyte proliferation. Indeed, intrasplenic transplantation of Id1+/+ or Id1−/− LSECs transduced with Wnt2 and HGF (Id1−/−Wnt2+HGF+ LSECs) re-establishes an inductive vascular niche in the liver sinusoids of the Id1−/− mice, initiating and restoring hepatovascular regeneration. Therefore, in the early phases of physiological liver regeneration, VEGFR2-Id1-mediated inductive angiogenesis in LSECs through release of angiocrine factors Wnt2 and HGF provokes hepatic proliferation. Subsequently, VEGFR2-Id1-dependent proliferative angiogenesis reconstitutes liver mass. Therapeutic co-transplantation of inductive VEGFR2+Id1+Wnt2+HGF+ LSECs with hepatocytes provides an effective strategy to achieve durable liver regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2054607874,"Cryptic Sulfur Cycling Aerobic bacteria and ocean circulation patterns control the formation and distribution of oxygen-minimum zones at moderate depth in the oceans. These habitats host microorganisms that thrive on other metabolic substrates in the absence of oxygen—most commonly, metabolizing thermodynamically favorable nitrogen compounds like nitrate. Off the coast of Chile, however, Canfield et al. (p. 1375 , published online 11 November; see the Perspective by Teske ) suggest that bacteria may often reduce sulfate as well. Metagenomic sequencing revealed the presence of both sulfate-reducing and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. With the coincidence of sulfate and nitrate reduction, the sulfur and nitrogen cycles may be intimately linked; for example, sulfate reduction could provide nitrogen-rich ammonium for bacteria that ultimately transform it into nitrogen gas."

The forests managed by groups with larger proportions of conditional cooperators—that is, individuals who will behave in a cooperative fashion if others do so as well—produced more potential crop trees per hectare.

https://openalex.org/W2024369960,"Compound semiconductor materials such as gallium arsenide and indium arsenide have outstanding electronic properties, but are costly to process and cannot, on their own, compete with silicon when it comes to low-cost fabrication. But as the relentless miniaturization of silicon electronics is reaching its limits, an alternative route of enhanced device performance is becoming more attractive: the integration of compound semiconductors within silicon. Ali Javey and colleagues now present a promising new concept to integrate ultrathin layers of single-crystal indium arsenide on silicon-based substrates with an epitaxial transfer method, a technique borrowed from large-area optoelectronics. With this technique, involving the use of an elastomeric stamp to lift off indium arsenide nanowires and transfer them to a silicon-based substrate, the authors fabricate thin film transistors with excellent device performance. A potential route to enhancing the performance of electronic devices is to integrate compound semiconductors, which have superior electronic properties, within silicon, which is cheap to process. These authors present a promising new concept to integrate ultrathin layers of single-crystal indium arsenide on silicon-based substrates with an epitaxial transfer method borrowed from large-area optoelectronics. With this technique, the authors fabricate thin-film transistors with excellent device performance. Over the past several years, the inherent scaling limitations of silicon (Si) electron devices have fuelled the exploration of alternative semiconductors, with high carrier mobility, to further enhance device performance1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. In particular, compound semiconductors heterogeneously integrated on Si substrates have been actively studied7,9,10: such devices combine the high mobility of III–V semiconductors and the well established, low-cost processing of Si technology. This integration, however, presents significant challenges. Conventionally, heteroepitaxial growth of complex multilayers on Si has been explored9,11,12,13—but besides complexity, high defect densities and junction leakage currents present limitations in this approach. Motivated by this challenge, here we use an epitaxial transfer method for the integration of ultrathin layers of single-crystal InAs on Si/SiO2 substrates. As a parallel with silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology14, we use ‘XOI’ to represent our compound semiconductor-on-insulator platform. Through experiments and simulation, the electrical properties of InAs XOI transistors are explored, elucidating the critical role of quantum confinement in the transport properties of ultrathin XOI layers. Importantly, a high-quality InAs/dielectric interface is obtained by the use of a novel thermally grown interfacial InAsO x layer (~1 nm thick). The fabricated field-effect transistors exhibit a peak transconductance of ~1.6 mS µm−1 at a drain–source voltage of 0.5 V, with an on/off current ratio of greater than 10,000."
https://openalex.org/W2016538425,"Fungal Invasion or Pollination? When pollen finds a compatible flower, it grows a pollen tube which must find the egg cell and release the sperm it carries. In searching for genes that affect pollen tubes in Arabidopsis , Kessler et al. (p. 968 ; see the Perspective by Govers and Angenent ) found a gene previously implicated in susceptibility to powdery mildew infection (the NTA gene). The NTA gene encodes a seven-pass transmembrane protein, which, in combination with a receptor-like kinase called Fer, is needed for successful pollen tube growth; both sets of proteins are also needed for successful powdery mildew invasion. These processes hence share common mechanisms of cell invasion, but where they diverge is in the outcome: embryogenesis or pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2027220714,"Lynx Vision Early in development, correct visual experiences during the so-called “critical period” build the foundations for visual function in adulthood. Hence, when one eye is not working together with the other, an adult may be left with imperfect vision. The plasticity characteristic of the critical period does not persist into adulthood, and later readjustments to visual function may not be fully successful. Morishita et al. (p. 1238 , published online 11 November; see the Perspective by Higley and Strittmatter ) have identified a gene in mice called Lynx1 , which shows increased expression after the critical period. The Lynx1 protein binds to and reduces the sensitivity of acetylcholine receptors, but if mice were treated to enhanced cholinergic signaling, their adult visual plasticity was improved and if mice lacked the Lynx1 gene altogether, they were able to recover visual function even in adulthood."

https://openalex.org/W2126018286,"To establish productive infection, a retrovirus must insert a DNA replica of its genome into host cell chromosomal DNA. This process is operated by the intasome, a nucleoprotein complex composed of an integrase tetramer (IN) assembled on the viral DNA ends. The intasome engages chromosomal DNA within a target capture complex to carry out strand transfer, irreversibly joining the viral and cellular DNA molecules. Although several intasome/transpososome structures from the DDE(D) recombinase superfamily have been reported, the mechanics of target DNA capture and strand transfer by these enzymes remained unclear. Here we report crystal structures of the intasome from prototype foamy virus in complex with target DNA, elucidating the pre-integration target DNA capture and post-catalytic strand transfer intermediates of the retroviral integration process. The cleft between IN dimers within the intasome accommodates chromosomal DNA in a severely bent conformation, allowing widely spaced IN active sites to access the scissile phosphodiester bonds. Our results resolve the structural basis for retroviral DNA integration and provide a framework for the design of INs with altered target sequences."

Climate alteration during the PETM has been extensively studied in the marine realm, and from a few temperate to polar terrestrial localities, but little is known about how the tropics responded to the high temperatures and high levels of CO 2 . Using evidence from pollen analysis, Jaramillo et al. (p. 957 ) show that rapid tropical forest diversification occurred during the PETM, without plant extinction or regional aridity. Unexpectedly, diversity seemed to increase at higher temperatures, contradicting previous assumptions that tropical flora will succumb if temperatures become excessive."
https://openalex.org/W2115716038,"Plumbing in the Brain Superficial similarities of vasculature in different parts of the body may mask organ-specific developmental nuances. The vasculature of the brain uniquely has to insulate the organ from insults that the rest of the body must tolerate. Kuhnert et al. (p. 985 ) analyzed the developmental uniqueness of the brain's vasculature through study of a G protein–coupled receptor, GPR124, initially identified by its actions in the vasculature of colon cancer. GPR124 is also involved in normal development of the brain's vasculature. Mice expressing low levels of GPR124 did not develop adequate vasculature in the brain and died from hemorrhages. Mice with too much GPR124 developed a tangled, thin-walled, excessive vasculature in the brain. Although the overexpressing mice survived, they were prone to neurological symptoms such as ataxia. GPR124 seems to control the normal development of the endothelial cells, particularly in the forebrain and ventral neural tube."
https://openalex.org/W2085950149,"The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates a variety of cellular processes by activating specific transcriptional and translational programs. Ras/MAPK signaling promotes mRNA translation and protein synthesis, but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an essential role in this process. Here, we show that Raptor, an essential scaffolding protein of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), becomes phosphorylated on proline-directed sites following activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. We found that ERK1 and ERK2 interact with Raptor in cells and mediate its phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Using mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we found three proline-directed residues within Raptor, Ser(8), Ser(696), and Ser(863), which are directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2. Expression of phosphorylation-deficient alleles of Raptor revealed that phosphorylation of these sites by ERK1/2 normally promotes mTORC1 activity and signaling to downstream substrates, such as 4E-BP1. Our data provide a novel regulatory mechanism by which mitogenic and oncogenic activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway promotes mTOR signaling."

Data from Sweden, where national vaccination for whooping cough was discontinued for 17 years, before resumption in 1996, was used by Rohani et al. (p. 982 ) to build a model that showed that age-specific social contacts were an important influence on the spread of infection. The model helped to explain why resumption of vaccination was so successful in curbing infant whooping cough but had no effect on pertussis in adolescents. The model thus demonstrated how potentially important it is to take account of age-stratification in a population when considering public health policy."
https://openalex.org/W2084402216,"Few-Body Problem Seemingly simple, quantum mechanical few-body systems are notoriously difficult to describe. Efimov trimers, three-body bound states with interactions tuned to be in close vicinity of the formation of two-body bound states, are the most tractable of these systems, with relevance, for example, in nuclear physics. Observed recently in ultracold atomic gases through their signatures in the rate of inelastic three-body collisions, Efimov trimers are predicted to appear at interaction strengths whose ratios are universally specified. By measuring binding energy as a function of interaction strength, Lompe et al. (p. 940 ) directly observed the association of three distinguishable atoms into a bound state. This technique may enable more precise studies of the trimer state, potentially revealing the nature of nonuniversal corrections suggested by prior experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2009729081,"Recent findings suggest that rare variants play an important role in both monogenic and common diseases. Due to their rarity, however, it remains unclear how to appropriately analyze the association between such variants and disease. A common approach entails combining rare variants together based on a priori information and analyzing them as a single group. Here one must make some assumptions about what to aggregate. Instead, we propose two approaches to empirically determine the most efficient grouping of rare variants. The first considers multiple possible groupings using existing information. The second is an agnostic “step-up” approach that determines an optimal grouping of rare variants analytically and does not rely on prior information. To evaluate these approaches, we undertook a simulation study using sequence data from genes in the one-carbon folate metabolic pathway. Our results show that using prior information to group rare variants is advantageous only when information is quite accurate, but the step-up approach works well across a broad range of plausible scenarios. This agnostic approach allows one to efficiently analyze the association between rare variants and disease while avoiding assumptions required by other approaches for grouping such variants."
https://openalex.org/W2009278066,"The efficacy of the diphenol curcumin as a cancer chemopreventive agent is limited by its chemical and metabolic instability. Non-enzymatic degradation has been described to yield vanillin, ferulic acid, and feruloylmethane through cleavage of the heptadienone chain connecting the phenolic rings. Here we provide evidence for an alternative mechanism, resulting in autoxidative cyclization of the heptadienone moiety as a major pathway of degradation. Autoxidative transformation of curcumin was pH-dependent with the highest rate at pH 8 (2.2 μM/min) and associated with stoichiometric uptake of O(2). Oxidation was also catalyzed by recombinant cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (50 nm; 7.5 μM/min), and the rate was increased ≈10-fold by the addition of 300 μM H(2)O(2). The COX-2 catalyzed transformation was inhibited by acetaminophen but not indomethacin, suggesting catalysis occurred by the peroxidase activity. We propose a mechanism of enzymatic or autoxidative hydrogen abstraction from a phenolic hydroxyl to give a quinone methide and a delocalized radical in the heptadienone chain that undergoes 5-exo cyclization and oxygenation. Hydration of the quinone methide (measured by the incorporation of O-18 from H(2)(18)O) and rearrangement under loss of water gives the final dioxygenated bicyclopentadione product. When curcumin was added to RAW264.7 cells, the bicyclopentadione was increased 1.8-fold in cells activated by LPS; vanillin and other putative cleavage products were negligible. Oxidation to a reactive quinone methide is the mechanistic basis of many phenolic anti-cancer drugs. It is possible, therefore, that oxidative transformation of curcumin, a prominent but previously unrecognized reaction, contributes to its cancer chemopreventive activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090929626,"Mononuclear iron-containing oxygenases conduct a diverse variety of oxidation functions in biology, including the oxidative demethylation of methylated nucleic acids and histones. Escherichia coli AlkB is the first such enzyme that was discovered to repair methylated nucleic acids, which are otherwise cytotoxic and/or mutagenic. AlkB human homologues are known to play pivotal roles in various processes. Here we present structural characterization of oxidation intermediates for these demethylases. Using a chemical cross-linking strategy, complexes of AlkB-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) containing 1,N(6)-etheno adenine (εA), N(3)-methyl thymine (3-meT) and N(3)-methyl cytosine (3-meC) are stabilized and crystallized, respectively. Exposing these crystals, grown under anaerobic conditions containing iron(II) and α-ketoglutarate (αKG), to dioxygen initiates oxidation in crystallo. Glycol (from εA) and hemiaminal (from 3-meT) intermediates are captured; a zwitterionic intermediate (from 3-meC) is also proposed, based on crystallographic observations and computational analysis. The observation of these unprecedented intermediates provides direct support for the oxidative demethylation mechanism for these demethylases. This study also depicts a general mechanistic view of how a methyl group is oxidatively removed from different biological substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2070900542,"The elucidation of the pseudogap phenomenon of the cuprates, a set of anomalous physical properties below the characteristic temperature T* and above the superconducting transition temperature Tc, has been a major challenge in condensed matter physics for the past two decades. Following initial indications of broken time-reversal symmetry in photoemission experiments, recent polarized neutron diffraction work demonstrated the universal existence of an unusual magnetic order below T*. These findings have the profound implication that the pseudogap regime constitutes a genuine new phase of matter rather than a mere crossover phenomenon. They are furthermore consistent with a particular type of order involving circulating orbital currents, and with the notion that the phase diagram is controlled by a quantum critical point. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results for HgBa2CuO4+x (Hg1201) that reveal a fundamental collective magnetic mode associated with the unusual order, and that further support this picture. The mode's intensity rises below the same temperature T* and its dispersion is weak, as expected for an Ising-like order parameter. Its energy of 52-56 meV and its enormous integrated spectral weight render it a new candidate for the hitherto unexplained ubiquitous electron-boson coupling features observed in spectroscopic studies."

Then, by lifting their tongues rapidly, a column of liquid grows by inertia until gravity induces its breakage and the cats close their jaws to capture the liquid.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 9Gruen M. Gautel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 933-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). When dephosphorylated, the C1–C2 region interacts with myosin. Upon phosphorylation, MyBPC dissociates from S2, which is thought to increase the probability of myosin head interactions with actin. The phosphorylation sites are located in the MyBPC motif, which is a linker connecting the C1 and C2 domains. The number of phosphorylation sites appears to differ between species, but the cardiac isoforms consistently have more sites (usually three).Interestingly, yeast two-hybrid assay identified interactions between domains C5 and C8, and between domains C7 and C10 of MyBPC (10Moolman-Smook J. Flashman E. de Lange W. Li Z. Corfield V. Redwood C. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An interaction between domains C6 and C9 was also predicted to occur. As a result, a model of three MyBPC molecules binding serially to one another and forming a collar around the myosin thick filament was developed. According to this model, domains C0–C4 extend into the interfilament space and interact with myosin S2 (10Moolman-Smook J. Flashman E. de Lange W. Li Z. Corfield V. Redwood C. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An alternative model of MyBPC has the C-terminal domains C7–C10 running parallel to the myosin rod and the N terminus extending perpendicularly toward the thin filaments (11Squire J.M. Luther P.K. Knupp C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This model takes into account the fact that MyBPC, which binds to myosin, has a greater periodicity than the myosin repeat along the thick filament as assessed in x-ray diffraction patterns. The model explains the observed spacing by allowing the N terminus of MyBPC to interact with actin.Earlier in vitro studies of native MyBPC purified from skeletal and cardiac muscles also suggested a MyBPC-actin interaction, with apparent inhibition by EGTA and restoration by Ca2+ in regulated but not unregulated thin filaments (12Yamamoto K. Moos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8395-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yamamoto K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 208: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, evidence for such an interaction in the intact filament lattice is lacking. Moreover, the location of such a binding site on MyBPC has not yet been determined clearly. From structural modeling and sequence analysis, the putative actin-binding site was proposed to be on the proline-alanine-rich linker that is located just before the C1 domain of MyBPC (11Squire J.M. Luther P.K. Knupp C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In experiments on skinned trabeculae, maximal force was reduced by the addition of a high concentration of a C0-proline-alanine-rich fragment that was shown to co-immunoprecipitate and co-sediment with actin. The effect was only seen when endogenous MyBPC was phosphorylated (i.e. when C1–C2 would not be bound to myosin S2), leading to the conclusion that the C0-proline-alanine-rich region not only interacts with actin but that this interaction is physiologically relevant (14Kulikovskaya I. McClellan G. Flavigny J. Carrier L. Winegrad S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, actin-binding analysis of various combinations of N-terminal domains of MyBPC suggested that MyBPC may interact with actin via multiple binding sites located in its motif and in the C1 region (15Shaffer J.F. Kensler R.W. Harris S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, neutron contrast variation analysis provided evidence that a C0-C2-actin interaction occurs via the C0–C1 end of the molecule, with the MyBPC motif and C2 domains projected out into solution (16Whitten A.E. Jeffries C.M. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2008; 105: 18360-18365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Here, we expressed full-length mouse cardiac MyBPC (cMyBPC) and its fragments in a baculovirus expression system. We further characterized the actin binding properties of each recombinant protein and demonstrated that cMyBPC interacts with F-actin and reconstituted thin filaments in a saturable manner via a single moderate affinity site localized to the C-terminal half of the protein; no region spanning domains C0 to C4 is responsible for MyBPC binding to actin in vitro. Regarding regulation of cMyBPC binding to actin, we observed no effect on binding due to the protein phosphorylation state or the presence of calmodulin. The presence of tropomyosin on the actin filament caused only a slight decrease in the binding of cMyBPC to actin, indicating that both proteins can interact with the same actin filament simultaneously.RESULTSTo characterize the actin binding properties of MyBPC, we expressed full-length cMyBPC in a baculovirus expression system. We also generated truncated proteins encoding various domains of cMyBPC (Fig. 1A). The domain assignments were performed based on the alignment of MyBPC isoforms from different species (24Oakley C.E. Hambly B.D. Curmi P.M. Brown L.J. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein C0–C1 included the proline-alanine-rich domain that was suggested to interact with actin based on a structural modeling (11Squire J.M. Luther P.K. Knupp C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether this region is indispensable for actin binding, we also generated ΔC0-C1 MyBPC protein from which the C0, C1, and proline-alanine-rich domains were deleted (Fig. 1A). To remove all of the domains of MyBPC that were previously shown to interact with actin (15Shaffer J.F. Kensler R.W. Harris S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Whitten A.E. Jeffries C.M. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2008; 105: 18360-18365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), we produced a C5–C10 protein. Fragment C0–C4 was designed to prevent possible interactions between domains C5 and C8, and domains C7 and C10 (10Moolman-Smook J. Flashman E. de Lange W. Li Z. Corfield V. Redwood C. Watkins H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These interactions, if strong enough, would result in protein multimerization and therefore complicate quantitative analysis of cMyBPC binding to actin. Finally, a C0–C5 protein represents the largest N-terminal region of MyBPC that is known to be free from interaction with myosin rod and with titin. All the constructs were designed with the FLAG epitope on the amino termini and purified on anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Fig. 1B). All recombinant proteins were highly soluble and migrated on SDS-PAGE according to their predicted molecular weights (Table 1). In all cases, protein purity and quantity were more than sufficient to analyze its actin binding properties.TABLE 1Molecular weights of MyBPC proteins expressed in baculovirusProteinC0–C1C0–C4C0–C5ΔC0–C1C5–C10cMyBPCPredicted Mr28,22470,78685,391115,00271,032141,815Denatured Mr34,10574,54092,047114,21171,433139,714 Open table in a new tab To gain insight into the multimerization/aggregation state of the purified full-length protein, we analyzed cMyBPC by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2). cMyBPC eluted from the column as a single symmetrical peak along with the globular protein standard catalase with a Stokes' radius of 51 Å. Approximately 95% of the protein loaded onto the column was recovered in this peak. It is clear from Fig. 2, that cMyBPC eluted more rapidly than if it was a globular monomer. On the other hand, if cMyBPC was a stable globular dimmer (284 Kda), it would be eluted from the column in between the protein standards ferritin and catalase. These observations, along with the published molecular dimensions for MyBPC purified from heart (25Hartzell H.C. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), strongly suggest that cMyBPC purified from infected insect cell lysates is an elongated monomer.FIGURE 2Determination of the self-association/aggregation state of MyBPC expressed in the baculovirus system. 900 μg of purified cMyBPC were analyzed by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300. A, cMyBPC eluted as a single symmetrical peak along with the globular protein standard catalase (232 kDa). B, a Stokes radius of 51 Å for cMyBPC (○) was estimated based on following protein standards (●): ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30.5 Å), aldolase (158 kDa, 48.1 Å), catalase (232 kDa, 52.2 Å), and ferritin (440 kDa, 61 Å).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further used the co-sedimentation assay to investigate whether baculovirus-expressed MyBPC constructs interacted with actin. In this assay, F-actin can be sedimented at 100,000 × g due to its filamentous nature, whereas nonfilamentous or noninteracting proteins remain in the supernatant. As shown in Fig. 3, all purified MyBPC proteins remained in supernatant fractions in the absence of actin. When skeletal muscle F-actin was added, virtually no C0–C1 was found in the pellet, whereas C0–C4, C0–C5, ΔC0–C1, C5–C10, and cMyBPC proteins consistently co-sedimented with actin to various extents. Of these, only cMyBPC, ΔC0–C1, and C5–C10 bound actin in a saturable manner with Kd values of 4.3 ± 1.1 μm, 1.3 ± 0.3 μm, and 4.2 ± 1.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 4B and Table 2). The Bmax values for cMyBPC (1.1 ± 0.1), ΔC0–C1 (1.1 ± 0.1), and C5–C10 (1.0 ± 0.2) indicate the proteins bound to actin in a 1:1 molar ratio. In contrast, the co-sedimentation of C0–C1, C0–C4, and C0–C5 with actin was nonsaturable in the range of concentrations from 0.5 to 40 μm, (Fig. 4A). Nonsaturable co-sedimentation in the range of concentrations from 0.5 to 90 μm was also observed for the His-tagged C0–C1 fragment of MyBPC expressed in E. coli (supplemental Fig. S1A). Similar results were obtained when MyBPC proteins were co-sedimented with bovine cardiac muscle actin (data not shown). Because it was shown that the amounts of C1–C2 fragment and native MyBPC found in the pellet with F-actin were reduced by increased ionic strength (26Razumova M.V. Shaffer J.F. Tu A.Y. Flint G.V.

As shown in Fig. 4C, the binding of cMyBPC to F-actin is not strongly affected by rising ionic strength, exhibiting an IC50 of 0.5 m.FIGURE 3Co-sedimentation of recombinant MyBPC proteins with actin.

Rybakova I.N. Xu Q. Moss R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2009; 106: 12658-12663Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Qualitatively, the phosphorylation pattern of recombinant cMyBPC (Ser-273, Ser-282, and Ser-302) is remarkably similar to that described for native protein (8Gautel M. Zuffardi O. Freiburg A. Labeit S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1952-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). However, purified recombinant cMyBPC was heterogeneous, as it was comprised of mono-, bis-, and tris-phosphorylated protein products. To maximize the ratio of tris-phosphorylated versus underprocessed protein products, we performed in vitro phosphorylation of purified cMyBPC using the catalytic subunit of PKA. Also, to release phosphate groups from cMyBPC, it was treated with λ-phosphatase. The phosphorylation state of PKA and λ-phosphatase treated cMyBPC was analyzed on Pro Q Diamond-stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Both dephosphorylated cMyBPC and cMyBPC with enhanced phosphorylation state were compared for their abilities to interact with actin. As shown in Fig. 5B, actin binding activities of PKA and λ-phosphatase-treated cMyBPC were similar to one another and to those measured for heterogeneously phosphorylated preparation of the recombinant protein (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 5Actin binding analysis of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cMyBPC. In A, purified cMyBPC was treated with PKA or λ-phosphatase and subjected to gel electrophoresis. The resulting SDS-PAGE was stained with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain (PQ) and subsequently with SYPRO Ruby total protein stain (SR). Absence of Pro-Q Diamond staining indicates loss of all phosphates (λ-phosphatase (λ-PPase)-treated cMyBPC). The greater intensity of Pro-Q Diamond staining corresponds to PKA-treated cMyBPC and indicates that the phosphorylation state of the protein was enhanced. B, increasing amounts of cMyBPC treated with λ-phosphatase (●) or PKA (○) were co-sedimented with 5 μm F-actin. The amounts of free and bound protein were determined densitometrically from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE loaded with equal volumes of resulting supernatants and pellets. Symbols denote data from two independent side-by-side experiments. Nonlinear regression analysis represented by lines yielded Kd values of 3.1 ± 1.1 and 4.0 ± 1 μm for λ-phosphatase (solid line) and PKA (dashed line)-treated cMyBPC, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Besides PKA, MyBPC can be phosphorylated by Ca2+-calmodulin-activated kinase, and Ca2+-calmodulin-activated kinase was shown to co-purify with MyBPC from cardiac muscle (29Hartzell H.C. Glass D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15587-15596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore not inconceivable that the MyBPC-actin interaction could be regulated by calmodulin. As shown in Fig. 6A, no effect of calmodulin on cMyBPC cosedimentation with actin was observed in the presence of either 1 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2. It is also clear from Fig. 6A that cMyBPC binding to actin was not sensitive to the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA. Furthermore, virtually no calmodulin co-sedimented with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated cMyBPC and actin, indicating that there is no interaction between the proteins (data not shown).FIGURE 6Lack of effect of calcium, calmodulin, and tropomyosin on cMyBPC binding to F-actin. In A, 5 μm cMyBPC was co-sedimented with 5 μm F-actin in the presence or absence of 5 μm calmodulin (CaM) and 0.2 mm CaCl2. The binding data (S.D., n = 3) were normalized against the amount of actin pelleted and expressed as the percentage of cMyBPC co-sedimented with F-actin in a buffer containing 1 mm EGTA where 100% equals 0.49 ± 0.02 mol of cMyBPC bound per mol of actin. cMyBPC was treated with PKA (1) or λ-phosphatase (2) prior to cosedimentation assays. In B, increasing amounts of cMyBPC were sedimented side-by-side with F-actin alone (open bars) or F-actin saturated with tropomyosin (filled bars). Actin and tropomyosin were present at 2.4 and 0.6 μm, respectively. The amount of cMyBPC bound to F-actin in the presence of tropomyosin was expressed as the percentage of cMyBPC cosedimented with actin in the absence of tropomyosin. The data represent the average of two independent side-by-side experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because in muscle fibers, actin is the major component of the thin filaments, it became relevant to determine whether the MyBPC-actin interaction is regulated by the presence of other thin filament proteins such as tropomyosin and troponin. Recent studies also suggested that tropomyosin and the N-terminal domains of MyBPC share binding sites on actin filaments, and therefore, MyBPC might compete with tropomyosin and displace it from F-actin (15Shaffer J.F. Kensler R.W. Harris S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Whitten A.E. Jeffries C.M. Harris S.P. Trewhella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2008; 105: 18360-18365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). With regard to competitive binding of tropomyosin and MyBPC to F-actin, actin was first saturated with tropomyosin and the binding of increasing amounts of cMyBPC to the tropomyosin-actin complex was assayed. As shown in Fig. 6B, saturation of actin filaments with tropomyosin caused only a slight decrease in the binding of cMyBPC to actin. The interaction of cMyBPC with actin was not prevented, even when F-actin was preincubated with tropomyosin at molar ratios as high as 1:1 prior to the addition of cMyBPC (data not shown), indicating that both proteins can interact with the same actin filament simultaneously. Full-length MyBPC and its N-terminal (C0–C5) and C-terminal (C5–C10) fragments were also probed for interactions with reconstituted thin filaments. As is the case with F-actin, full-length MyBPC and its C-terminal fragment co-sedimented with thin filaments in a saturable manner (Fig. 7, A and B and Table 3). At the same time, C0–C5 binding to actin in the presence of tropomyosin and troponin did not saturate over the range of C0–C5 concentrations (Fig. 7C). The saturable or nonsaturable nature of binding did not depend on the presence or absence of Ca2+. However, the presence of Ca2+ caused a slight increase in cMyBPC and C5–C10 co-sedimentation with thin filaments (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Quantitative analysis of binding of recombinant MyBPC proteins to reconstituted thin filaments. Increasing amounts of cMyBPC (A), C5–C10 (B), or C0–C5 (C) were incubated with reconstituted thin filaments in the presence (○) and absence of Ca2+ (●) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g.

Although both structural and regulatory roles have been proposed for MyBPC, the nature of putative interactions with myosin and sarcomeric proteins remain obscure, and detailed biochemical and biophysical characterizations of MyBPC are lacking. In the present study, we expressed the full-length cardiac isoform of MyBPC to further characterize its actin binding properties.Prior to actin binding analysis, we assessed the multimerization/aggregation state of cMyBPC. Size exclusion chromatography yielded a Stokes' radius of 51Å for recombinant cMyBPC, which is in a good agreement with the previously published value of 50.7 Å for native MyBPC purified from cardiac muscle (25Hartzell H.C. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There are two possible explanations for a Stokes' radius of 51Å, which is larger than expected from a globular protein of 142 kDa. First, the protein exists in an oligomeric form, such as dimers or trimers formed via interactions of domains C5/C8 and C7/C10 of adjacent MyBPC monomers. However, dimers (284 kDa) and trimers (426 kDa) would be expected to migrate through the gel filtration column faster than the protein standard catalase (232 kDa). Furthermore, the oligomeric protein is likely to elute from the column as one broad peak or as multiple peaks, corresponding to multimers of different size. Instead, cMyBPC eluted from the gel filtration column as a single sharp peak (Fig. 2A). The alternative and more likely explanation for the observed Stokes' radius is that cMyBPC purified from infected insect cell lysates is an elongated monomer. Indeed, hydrodynamic analysis of native MyBPC from skeletal (30Offer G. Moos C. Starr R. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 653-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and cardiac (12Yamamoto K. Moos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8395-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) muscles suggested that both proteins were asymmetric molecules. Electron microscopy images of MyBPC purified from cardiac muscle revealed predominantly V-shaped particles in which the V-arm was ∼22 nm long and 4 nm wide (25Hartzell H.C. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At the same time, it was not determined whether the MyBPC particles represented monomers or dimers. According to structural analysis, the average length of MyBPC Ig I domains is ∼3.3 nm, and the width is ∼2.2 nm (31Idowu S.M. Gautel M. Perkins S.J. Pfuhl M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 745-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Govada L. Carpenter L. da Fonseca P.C. Helliwell J.R. Rizkallah P. Flashman E. Chayen N.E. Redwood C. Squire J.M. J. Mol.

Joshi P. Hendrickson W.A. Proteins. 1994; 19: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The width of MyBPC molecule is thus no smaller than 2.2–2.5 nm. The length of MyBPC monomer composed of eight Ig I and three Fn type III domains is ∼40 nm long. This rough estimate fits with double the length of the V-arm (2 × 22 nm)"

Biochemical analysis proved an association of desmosomal cadherin desmocollin 2 (Dsc2) in cholesterol-enriched fractions that contain membrane raft markers caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 and the novel raft marker ostreolysin. Cold detergent extraction of biotinylated plasma membranes revealed that ∼60% of Dsc2 associates with membrane rafts while the remainder is present in nonraft and cholesterol-poor membranes. The results of immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed colocalization of Dsc2 and ostreolysin. Partial depletion of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin disturbs desmosome assembly, as revealed by sequential recordings of live cells. Moreover, cholesterol depletion significantly reduces the strength of cell-cell junctions and partially releases Dsc2 from membrane rafts. Our data indicate that a pool of Dsc2 is associated with membrane rafts, particularly with the ostreolysin type of membrane raft, and that intact membrane rafts are necessary for desmosome assembly. Taken together, these data suggest cholesterol as a potential regulator that promotes desmosome assembly.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cell membrane organization, with its structurally, compositionally, and functionally distinct domains, contributes to the distribution of membrane proteins. Plasma membrane is composed of certain domains enriched with cholesterol and sphingomyelin, termed membrane rafts (MRs). The concept of MRs has evolved over the years; currently, they are defined as small (10–200 nm in diameter), heterogeneous, and highly dynamic domains. However, these nanostructures can coalesce into larger, stable raft clusters (2Kusumi A. Koyama-Honda I. Suzuki K. Traffic. 2004; 5: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The majority of MRs are found in plasma membranes, while the remainder are present in exocytotic and endocytotic vesicles, in the Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum (3Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 4Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3149-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). MRs have been shown to accumulate proteins selectively, which in some cases directly interact with cholesterol, and this interaction can affect the properties of the proteins (5Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar, 6Epand R.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For example, MRs can dynamically organize specific membrane proteins (7Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and promote the association and assembly of specific proteins. Consequently, MRs facilitate signal transduction, protein import, and trafficking (5Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar, 8Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). In relation to rafts, membrane proteins are assigned to three categories: those that are found mainly in rafts, those that are present in nonraft membranes, and those that represent an intermediate state, moving in and out of rafts (9Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). On the basis of electron microscopic observations, Lillemeier et al. (10Lillemeier B.F. Pfeiffer J.R. Surviladze Z. Wilson B.S. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18992-18997Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) concluded that most or all plasma membrane-associated proteins are resident in cholesterol-enriched “islands,” which they further subdivided into raft and nonraft domains. However, in general, it is still believed that cell membranes are divided into high cholesterol raft domains and low cholesterol nonraft domains. The transmembrane proteins of cell-cell junctions, such as N-cadherins of adherens junctions (11Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Nakai Y. Kamiguchi H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1097-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and occludin and specific claudins (4Browman D.T. Resek M.E. Zajchowski L.D. Robbins S.M. J.

Gessner R. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and β1 integrins (12Nakai Y. Kamiguchi H. J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1771-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of focal contacts are excluded from these membrane domains. MRs contain various connexins but not complexes of gap junctions, showing that sometimes only individual junctional proteins cosediment with rafts (17Locke D. Liu J. Harris A.L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13027-13042Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The fact that there is a significant diversity in the composition of different raft preparations suggests that diversity among rafts exists. The most commonly used assay for the study of rafts is isolation of the buoyant detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) after extraction in cold Triton X-100. DRMs and, extrapolating, MRs can be identified by their marker proteins caveolin-1 (Cav), flotillin-1 (Flot), and a novel raft marker, ostreolysin (Oly). Oly is a protein from the oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), which specifically recognizes the cholesterol/sphingomyelin-rich lipid phase, probably corresponding to the physical state of MRs (18Sepciæ K. Berne S. Rebolj K. Batista U. Plemenitas A. Sentjurc M. Macek P. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Chowdhury H.H. Rebolj K. Kreft M. Zorec R. Macek P. Sepciæ K. Toxicon. 2008; 51: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It should be kept in mind, however, that isolated DRMs do not fully represent biological rafts in size, structure, and composition because detergents can themselves induce the formation of ordered domains (20Heerklotz H. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 21Lichtenberg D. Goñi F.M. Heerklotz H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 430-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To avoid those artifacts, a nondetergent sodium carbonate method or magnetic bead immunoisolation approach should be used as an alternative for isolation of raft membrane fractions (22Shah M.B. Sehgal P.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 398: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ultimately, a MR must be defined by its function, not by the method of isolation (23Pike L.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Despite the structural significance of MRs for individual desmosomal proteins desmoplakin (DP), plakoglobin, and Dsg2, as published elsewhere (24Nava P. Laukoetter M.G. Hopkins A.M. Laur O. Gerner-Smidt K. Green K.J. Parkos C.A. Nusrat A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4565-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25Morel E. Fouquet S. Chateau D. Yvernault L. Frobert Y. Pincon-Raymond M. Chambaz J. Pillot T. Rousset M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1499-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it has not yet been confirmed whether Dsc2 and desmosomes as whole structures are associated with MRs. Additionally, the functional relationship between MRs and desmosomes has not yet been clarified. The aims of this study were thus to examine the associations of desmosomal proteins with MRs and the role of cholesterol-enriched membrane domains for desmosome assembly and the strength of newly formed (after 3 h of assembly) and well established (after 1 day of assembly) cell-cell junctions. We determined that Dsc2, a broadly expressed desmosomal cadherin (26Nuber U.A. Schäfer S. Schmidt A. Koch P.J. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 69-74PubMed Google Scholar), is associated with MRs. Remarkably, other major desmosomal components, such as Dsg2, DP, and cytokeratins (CKs), were also found in MRs, suggesting that complete desmosomes are raft-associated. The functional aspect of cholesterol participation in desmosomal structure was proven by its depletion with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD), which prevented efficient desmosome assembly and weakened the strength of newly formed and well established cell-cell junctions. On a biochemical level, MCD treatment resulted in partial release of Dsc2 from raft membranes, retaining distribution of Dsc2 in rafts when applying MCD loaded with cholesterol. The data suggest that assembly of desmosomes and the stability of cell-cell junctions are influenced by plasma membrane cholesterol. The following antibodies against raft markers were used: anti-Cav, anti-Flot, anti-Oly (27Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F. Turk T. Macek P. Sepciæ K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Oly protein (27Berne S. Krizaj I. Pohleven F. Turk T. Macek P. Sepciæ K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1570: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study were: anti-transferrin receptor (TrfR), anti-GFP, anti-Dsc2, anti-DP, anti-Dsg2, anti-CK7, and anti-CK18 (mouse monoclonal; from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). All the aforementioned antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and were rabbit polyclonal unless stated otherwise. Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cyanine 3-steptavidin was from Sigma-Aldrich. MCD, cholesterol, cholesterol oxidase, and EGTA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. We used wild-type MDCK cells and MDCK cells stably transfected with cDNA coding for Dsc2a-enhanced YFP, designated MDc-2 cells (28Windoffer R. Borchert-Stuhlträger M. Leube R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1717-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDc-2 cells were maintained in a control medium composed of Advance DMEM/F12 (1:1), 10% FCS, 50 units/ml crystacylin (Pliva, Zagreb, Croatia), 50 units/ml streptofatol (Fatol, Griefswald, Germany) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were grown on plastic dishes (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and were subcultured with TrypLE Select at 90–100% confluence. Culture media and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen unless stated otherwise. To deplete membrane cholesterol from MDc-2 cells, we added sterile-filtered MCD medium (10 mm MCD solution made in a control medium with cholesterol-free serum (HyClone, South Logan, UT)) for the indicated period of time. MCD-cholesterol complexes were prepared as described in Ref. 29Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar. Briefly, 6 mg of cholesterol was dissolved in 80 μl of isopropyl alcohol:CHCl3 (2:1). Two hundred mg of MCD was dissolved in 2.2 ml of water and heated to 80 °C. Cholesterol was added in small aliquots until the solution was clear. The MCD-cholesterol solution was filtered and added to cells with a final concentration of 10 mm. Cholesterol oxidase (1 unit/ml) was added to a cholesterol-free medium for 2 h. EGTA solution (8 mm) was prepared in a control medium, sterile-filtered, and applied to cells for 1 h. The assay was adapted from a previously described method (30Huen A.C. Park J.K. Godsel L.M. Chen X. Bannon L.J. Amargo E.V. Hudson T.Y. Mongiu A.K. Leigh I.M. Kelsell D.P. Gumbiner B.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1005-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In brief, MDc-2 cells were seeded in triplicate on 30-mm plastic Petri dishes. At ∼70%, confluence cells were treated with or without 10 mm MCD for 30 min, 1 h and 4 h or with MCD-cholesterol for 1 h. The cultures were then washed twice with warm (37 °C) PBS and incubated with 1.5 units/ml dispase (Roche Diagnostic GmbH) for 15 min. The dispase solution was then carefully removed. Detached monolayers were dissolved in PBS and further subjected to 20 rounds of pipetting through a 200-μl pipette. Cell dissociation was quantified by counting single cells per field of view (magnification, ×100; Leica DM IL). Experiments were performed three times in triplicate. MCD-treated and untreated subconfluent MDc-2 cells were surface-labeled with cell-impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. DRM isolation was then performed in cold Triton X-100 as described below. DRM fractions (6Epand R.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 279-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 7Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and non-DRM fractions (1–5 and 8–12) were collected in equal amounts and incubated with streptavidin beads. Biotinylated plasma membrane proteins were finally eluted by SDS-PAGE buffer and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting as described below. In parallel, MDc-2 cells grown on coverslips were biotinylated as recommended and fixed with 4% formaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were incubated with cyanine 3-conjugated streptavidin (1:100) for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed with PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed using an oil immersion objective (×63 oil/NA 1.40) on a fluorescent microscope AxioImager Z1 (Carl Zeiss) supplemented with an ApoTome device. ∼70% confluent cells from 15-cm plastic Petri dishes (∼2.3 × 107 cells; TPP) were cultured in control medium or were treated as indicated. After incubation, they were washed with cold PBS and collected by scraping and centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min. The pelleted cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C by 0.5% Triton X-100 in buffered saline (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostic GmbH)), pH 6.5. Cell suspensions were passed 10 times through 22-gauge needles during lysis and then mixed (1/1, v/v) with 85% sucrose (w/v) in buffered saline without Triton X-100. In a centrifuge tube, the resulting 42.5% sucrose mixture was overlaid successively with 35 and 5% (w/v) sucrose in buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm Na3VO4. Following 18 h centrifugation at 4 °C (36,000 rpm, SW40 rotor, Beckman L8-M preparative centrifuge), 1-ml fractions were harvested from top to bottom; 400 μl of each fraction was harvested for cholesterol measurements. For detergent-free purification, we followed the method described by Song et al. (31Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into 500 mm carbonate buffer, pH 11, and homogenization and sonification were carried out sequentially. The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (5% sucrose/35% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 18 h. Twelve 1-ml fractions were harvested from top to bottom of the gradient. Lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Extracts were dried under a stream of N2 and lipids redissolved in isopropyl alcohol. To determine the cholesterol concentration, we used Cholesterol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of 50 μl were taken from each 1-ml fraction of the sucrose gradients of treated and untreated cells, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid/acetone on ice, and resuspended in Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, and 2× Laemmli buffer at 37 °C. Samples were separated on either 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), followed by incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies. Dsc2-YFP fusion proteins were detected with polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies, which are reactive against all variants of Aequorea victoria GFP, such as S65T-GFP, RS-GFP, YFP, and EGFP. The bound primary antibodies were subsequently detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in conjunction with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were visualized by exposure to and development of x-ray film. The gray values of band intensities were analyzed semiquantitatively with Doc-ItLS image analysis software (UVP, Cambridge, UK). A semiquantitative amount of protein (arbitrary units) was defined as Nx/(N1 + N2 + …N12) × 100%, where Nx is the intensity of an individual fraction band. MDc-2 cells were cultured on glass-bottom dishes with grid (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). After 1 h of EGTA treatment, EGTA was exchanged either with control or 10 mm MCD medium. Cells in culture dishes were immediately put on a microscope stage, and locations on grid were selected. Three hours later, the cells were taken from the cell incubator, and the desmosome assembly between cells at the same locations was examined with a fluorescent microscope AxioImager Z1 using a 20× or 63× (water) objective. We examined colocalization of Dsc2-YFP with Cav, Flot, or Oly in control cells and cells treated with 10 mm MCD for 1 h. Cells were grown on glass coverslips. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 10 min at 4 °C, and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4 °C. After 30-min blocking with 2% BSA with 0.2% sodium azide (in PBS) at 37 °C, cells were incubated with anti-Cav (1:1000) or anti-Flot (1:500) primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 45 min at 37 °C. For labeling with Oly, the cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml Oly for 30 min at 37 °C followed by Oly anti-rabbit antibodies (1:2500) and then Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000). Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield and analyzed using an oil immersion objective (63× oil/NA 1.40) on a fluorescent microscope AxioImager Z1 supplemented with an ApoTome device for optical sections generation. Images were acquired using the AxioVision program. The presence of Dsc2 in MRs was examined in isolated rafts, acquired after cold detergent extraction, which are operationally termed detergent-resistant membranes. As an alternative method, rafts were isolated by alkaline carbonate extraction. On the basis of protocols developed for MDCK cells (33Schuck S. Honsho M. Ekroos K. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 5795-5800Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we isolated DRMs with cold 0.5% Triton X-100 from light sucrose gradient fractions. Using this method, we tested whether Dsc2-YFP is associated with DRMs, identified by the raft markers Oly (Fig. 1A, fraction 6), Cav (Fig. 1A, fractions 6 and 7), Flot (Fig. 1A, fractions 6 and 7) or cholesterol enrichment (Fig. 1B, fractions 5, 6, and 7). When those criteria were satisfied, we defined membrane fractions 6 and 7 as DRM fractions. Our isolated DRMs contained no TrfR, a marker of non-DRM regions (34Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), confirming the complete solubilization of nonraft membranes (Fig. 1A). Fractions 1–5 and 8–12, with a low cholesterol concentration (Fig. 1B, bars 1–4 and 8–12) and none or weak Oly, Cav, or Flot band intensity (Fig. 1A, fractions 1–5 and 8–12), were defined as non-DRM fractions (fractions 1–5 and 8–12). Protein profile analysis of the fractions from the sucrose gradient of whole cell membranes indicates that Dsc2-YFP is present in DRM fractions (Fig. 1C, fractions 6 and 7). A similar Dsc2 distribution in rafts was obtained in wild-type MDCK cells (Fig. 1C), excluding the possibility that the presence of Dsc2 in rafts is due to protein overexpression. Additionally, it is known from previous work that Dsc2-YFP chimeras from MDc-2 cells are integrated into normal desmosomes, and the fluorescence pattern is indistinguishable from that observed by immunofluorescence microscopy in wild-type MDCK cells. Dsc2-YFP colocalizes with the desmosomal proteins plakoglobin, desmoplakin, desmoglein, plakophilin 2 and 3, indicating that transgene expression does not affect desmosome formation and composition (28Windoffer R. Borchert-Stuhlträger M. Leube R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1717-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dsg2, DP, and CK7 and CK18 were also found in DRMs. The highest Dsc2 content, calculated from volume intensity measurements of 50-μl aliquots, was found in DRM fraction 6 (Fig. 1D). The possibility of raft fusion caused by detergent extraction, as well as lipid exchange between membranes, led us to prepare membrane fractions with nondetergent isolation in a sodium carbonate buffer. Dsc2-abundant fractions contained Cav and Flot but not TrfR (Fig. 1E). This result verified Dsc2 association with MRs acquired with detergent isolation. For colocalization of Dsc2 with raft markers, cells were immunostained for Oly, Cav, and Flot. Cav and Flot were labeled with primary and secondary antibodies, whereas Oly was first applied to bind to rafts and further assessed with primary and secondary antibodies. The colocalization of Oly, Cav, and Flot with Dsc2 was analyzed on optical sections. We observed that only Dsc2 and Oly colocalize significantly (Fig. 2A). No clear colocalization between Dsc2 and Cav (Fig. 2B) and Dsc2 and Flot (Fig. 2C) was detected. We restricted our further analysis to plasma membrane Dsc2, which actually contributes to desmosomal adhesion. To ascertain whether Dsc2 is associated with plasma membrane DRMs, we performed biotinylation of cell surfaces. Cell surfaces were labeled with impermeable EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin on ice to prevent biotinylation of intracellular membranes, enabling proper isolation of the plasma membrane. According to cyanine 3-streptavidin fluorescent labeling, Dsc2s were successfully biotinylated (Fig. 3A). Equal biotinylated aliquots were pooled from DRM and non-DRM fractions and analyzed with Western blotting. Of the plasma membrane fraction, ∼60% of Dsc2 is related to DRMs and ∼40% to non-DRMs (p < 0.01; Fig. 3, B and C). Cav detection in biotinylated DRMs verified DRM purification. Comparable with our immunofluorescence studies, Flot was absent from plasma membrane DRM fractions and was present in unbiotinylated DRMs from endomembranes (Fig. 3B). Biotinylation studies revealed two distinct pools of plasma membrane Dsc2: the bulky one associated with DRM domains and related to high cholesterol levels and the second associated with non-DRM. The aforementioned results led us to examine whether MR disruption caused by cholesterol sequestration have any impact on desmosome assembly. The Ca2+-chelating agent EGTA provoked separation of desmosome halves, a process that was followed by cell rounding and Dsc2 internalization, which has been described elsewhere (35Mattey D.L. Garrod D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 85: 113-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A, A′, C, and C′). Cells were then left for 3 h to assemble desmosomes in control or MCD medium. Culturing in control medium led to a confluent state in which cells revealed the original polygonal cell shape with well established desmosomes (Fig. 4, D, D′, and D“). Cells in MCD medium did not reach cell confluence to the same extent as in the control medium, intercellular spaces frequently remained (Fig. 4, B′, asterisk and arrowhead, and B”), and desmosomes were not assembled on entire cell surfaces (Fig. 4, B, B′, and B“). Additionally, MCD prevented a polygonal cell shape. The stability of cell junctions in the MCD medium was decreased because the strength of cell-cell junctions was weaker when assembled in MCD medium. The strength of newly formed cell-cell junctions was presented with reference to well established cell-cell junctions built after 24 h of culturing (control cells). The ratios between dissociated cells after 3 h of assembly in MCD and the control medium in relation to well established cell-cell junctions built after 24 h of culturing were 3.9 and 2.8 (p < 0.05), respectively. These data indicate that MRs are necessary for normal desmosome assembly and stabilization of newly formed cell junctions. We investigated how cholesterol sequestration affects the strength of well established cell-cell junctions (established after 1 day of culturing). For desmosome-mediated adhesion in MDCK cells, it is known that desmosomal adhesion develops progressively over a period of time, reaching a plateau at 24–32 h (36Mattey D.L. Burdge G. Garrod D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 689-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, the cells were cultured for 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h in 10 mm MCD. Using a dispase-based dissociation assay, the ratios between dissociated cells treated for 30 min in MCD and cells in control was 1.2 (±0.057) and increased to 2.3 (±0.258) when cells were treated with MCD for 1 h. Four-hour incubation in MCD raised the ratio to 3.9 (±0.343) (Fig. 5). The strength of cell-cell junctions was retained, compared with the control, when complexes of MCD-cholesterol were added (1 ± 0.356). With 30-min (Fig. 5A) and 1-h incubation (Fig. 5B) in MCD, the Dsc2 distribution remained continuous. After a 4-h incubation in MCD, free extracellular spaces at the cell edges appeared, resulting in discontinuous Dsc2 distribution, although desmosomes were still maintained (Fig. 5C). Cell viability tested with trypan blue staining after a 4-h incubation in MCD had not declined (data not shown). After MCD treatment (1 h in 10 mm MCD), Oly labeling was dramatically decreased, showing successful disruption of the rafts (Fig. 6A, MCD treatment). MCD treatment revealed a partial release of Dsc2 from DRM and non-DRM fractions. The release was significant for DRM fractions 6 and 7 compared with the control (Fig. 6B), although some Dsc2 still pe"
https://openalex.org/W2019215200,"Integrin α9β1 mediates accelerated cell adhesion and migration through interactions with a number of diverse extracellular ligands. We have shown previously that it directly binds the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) A, C, and D and contributes to VEGF-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Until now, the α9β1 binding site in VEGF has not been identified. Here, we report that the three-amino acid sequence, EYP, encoded by exon 3 of VEGF-A is essential for binding of VEGF to integrin α9β1 and induces adhesion and migration of endothelial and cancer cells. EYP is specific for α9β1 binding and neither requires nor activates VEGFR-2, the cognate receptor for VEGF-A. Following binding to EYP, integrin α9β1 transduces cell migration through direct activation of the integrin signaling intermediates Src and focal adhesion kinase. This interaction is biologically important because it mediates in vitro endothelial cell tube formation, wound healing, and cancer cell invasion. These novel findings identify EYP as a potential site for directed pharmacotherapy. Integrin α9β1 mediates accelerated cell adhesion and migration through interactions with a number of diverse extracellular ligands. We have shown previously that it directly binds the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) A, C, and D and contributes to VEGF-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Until now, the α9β1 binding site in VEGF has not been identified. Here, we report that the three-amino acid sequence, EYP, encoded by exon 3 of VEGF-A is essential for binding of VEGF to integrin α9β1 and induces adhesion and migration of endothelial and cancer cells. EYP is specific for α9β1 binding and neither requires nor activates VEGFR-2, the cognate receptor for VEGF-A. Following binding to EYP, integrin α9β1 transduces cell migration through direct activation of the integrin signaling intermediates Src and focal adhesion kinase. This interaction is biologically important because it mediates in vitro endothelial cell tube formation, wound healing, and cancer cell invasion. These novel findings identify EYP as a potential site for directed pharmacotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039624926,"Axonal degeneration is an early and important component of many neurological disorders. Overexpression of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (Nmnat), a component of the slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(s)) protein, protects axons from a variety of insults. We found that transduction of Nmnat protein into severed axons via virus-like particles prevented axonal degeneration. The post-injury efficacy of Nmnat indicates that its protective effects occur locally within the axon and provides an opportunity to develop novel agents to treat axonal damage."
https://openalex.org/W2106308853,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, triacylglycerol mobilization for phospholipid synthesis occurs during growth resumption from stationary phase, and this metabolism is essential in the absence of de novo fatty acid synthesis. In this work, we provide evidence that DGK1-encoded diacylglycerol kinase activity is required to convert triacylglycerol-derived diacylglycerol to phosphatidate for phospholipid synthesis. Cells lacking diacylglycerol kinase activity (e.g. dgk1Δ mutation) failed to resume growth in the presence of the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor cerulenin. Lipid analysis data showed that dgk1Δ mutant cells did not mobilize triacylglycerol for membrane phospholipid synthesis and accumulated diacylglycerol. The dgk1Δ phenotypes were partially complemented by preventing the formation of diacylglycerol by the PAH1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase and by channeling diacylglycerol to phosphatidylcholine via the Kennedy pathway. These observations, coupled to an inhibitory effect of dioctanoyl-diacylglycerol on the growth of wild type cells, indicated that diacylglycerol kinase also functions to alleviate diacylglycerol toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2071747136,"Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) has been implicated as an important virulence factor in several gram-negative bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli K1, a leading cause of neonatal meningitis associated with significant mortality and morbidity. In this study, we generated E. coli K1 mutants that express OmpA in which three or four amino acids from various extracellular loops were changed to alanines, and we examined their ability to survive in several immune cells. We observed that loop regions 1 and 2 play an important role in the survival of E. coli K1 inside neutrophils and dendritic cells, and loop regions 1 and 3 are needed for survival in macrophages. Concomitantly, E. coli K1 mutants expressing loop 1 and 2 mutations were unable to cause meningitis in a newborn mouse model. Of note, mutations in loop 4 of OmpA enhance the severity of the pathogenesis by allowing the pathogen to survive better in circulation and to produce high bacteremia levels. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the roles played by different regions of extracellular loops of OmpA of E. coli K1 in the pathogenesis of meningitis and may help in designing effective preventive strategies against this deadly disease."
https://openalex.org/W1980974663,"Expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1, fragile X mental retardation 1, gene results in suppression of protein expression for this gene and is the underlying cause of Fragile X syndrome. In unaffected individuals, the FMRP protein, together with two additional paralogues (Fragile X Mental Retardation Syndrome-related Protein 1 and 2), associates with mRNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex in the nucleus that is transported to dendrites and spines of neuronal cells. It is thought that the fragile X family of proteins contributes to the regulation of protein synthesis at sites where mRNAs are locally translated in response to stimuli.Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of the non-canonical nuclear localization signals of the FXR1 and FXR2 autosomal paralogues of FMRP, which were determined at 2.50 and 1.92 Å, respectively. The nuclear localization signals of the FXR1 and FXR2 comprise tandem Tudor domain architectures, closely resembling that of UHRF1, which is proposed to bind methylated histone H3K9.The FMRP, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins comprise a small family of highly conserved proteins that appear to be important in translational regulation, particularly in neuronal cells. The crystal structures of the N-terminal tandem Tudor domains of FXR1 and FXR2 revealed a conserved architecture with that of FMRP. Biochemical analysis of the tandem Tudor domains reveals their ability to preferentially recognize trimethylated peptides in a sequence-specific manner.This article can also be viewed as an enhanced version in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

Vinculin can assume an inactive (closed) conformation in which Vh and Vt bind to each other, masking the binding sites for actin and talin, and an active (open) conformation in which the binding sites for talin and actin are exposed. We hypothesized that the contractile activation of smooth muscle tissues might regulate the activation of vinculin and thereby contribute to the regulation of contractile tension. Stimulation of tracheal smooth muscle tissues with acetylcholine (ACh) induced the recruitment of vinculin to cell membrane and its interaction with talin and increased the phosphorylation of membrane-localized vinculin at the C-terminal Tyr-1065. Expression of recombinant vinculin head domain peptide (Vh) in smooth muscle tissues, but not the talin-binding deficient mutant head domain, VhA50I, inhibited the ACh-induced recruitment of endogenous vinculin to the membrane and the interaction of vinculin with talin and also inhibited vinculin phosphorylation. Expression of Vh peptide also inhibited ACh-induced smooth muscle contraction and inhibited ACh-induced actin polymerization; however, it did not affect myosin light chain phosphorylation, which is necessary for cross-bridge cycling. Inactivation of RhoA inhibited vinculin activation in response to ACh. We conclude that ACh stimulation regulates vinculin activation in tracheal smooth muscle via RhoA and that vinculin activation contributes to the regulation of active tension by facilitating connections between actin filaments and talin-integrin adhesion complexes and by mediating the initiation of actin polymerization.

https://openalex.org/W2004207509,"Liquid Rock Beginnings It has long been known that the lunar farside highlands constitute the highest region on the Moon. Garrick-Bethell et al. (p. 949 ) show that the topography and crustal thickness variations of this elevated region obey a single, simple mathematical function that overall describes one-quarter of the Moon. The key to explaining this find may lie with a similarity between the hot, ancient Moon and one of the icy moons of Jupiter, Europa. Like today's Europa, the Moon's crust once floated on a subsurface ocean, except that it was made of liquid rock, not water. The same tidal effect that operates on Europa's crust, caused by Jupiter's gravitational force, would have also operated on the early Moon because of Earth's influence, and would have produced a pattern of crustal thickness variations similar to that observed in the farside highlands."
https://openalex.org/W1990864709,"Prestin is a voltage-dependent membrane-spanning motor protein that confers electromotility on mammalian cochlear outer hair cells, which is essential for normal hearing of mammals. Voltage-induced charge movement in the prestin molecule is converted into mechanical work; however, little is known about the molecular mechanism of this process. For understanding the electromechanical coupling mechanism of prestin, we simultaneously measured voltage-dependent charge movement and electromotility under conditions in which the magnitudes of both charge movement and electromotility are gradually manipulated by the prestin inhibitor, salicylate. We show that the observed relationships of the charge movement and the physical displacement (q-d relations) are well represented by a three-state Boltzmann model but not by a two-state model or its previously proposed variant. Here, we suggest a molecular mechanism of prestin with at least two voltage-dependent conformational transition steps having distinct electromechanical coupling efficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2079789962,"The lysyl oxidase family is made up of five members: lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl oxidase-like 1–4 (LOXL1-LOXL4). All members share conserved C-terminal catalytic domains that provide for lysyl oxidase or lysyl oxidase-like enzyme activity; and more divergent propeptide regions. LOX family enzyme activities catalyze the final enzymatic conversion required for the formation of normal biosynthetic collagen and elastin cross-links. The importance of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity to normal bone development has long been appreciated, but regulation and roles for specific LOX isoforms in bone formation in vivo is largely unexplored. Fracture healing recapitulates aspects of endochondral bone development. The present study first investigated the expression of all LOX isoforms in fracture healing. A remarkable coincidence of LOXL2 expression with the chondrogenic phase of fracture healing was found, prompting more detailed analyses of LOXL2 expression in normal growth plates, and LOXL2 expression and function in developing ATDC5 chondrogenic cells. Data show that LOXL2 is expressed by pre-hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes in vivo, and that LOXL2 expression is regulated in vitro as a function of chondrocyte differentiation. Moreover, LOXL2 knockdown studies in vitro show that LOXL2 expression is required for ATDC5 chondrocyte cell line differentiation through regulation of SNAIL and SOX9, important transcription factors that control chondrocyte differentiation. Taken together, data provide evidence that LOXL2, like LOX, is a multifunctional protein. LOXL2 promotes chondrocyte differentiation by mechanisms that are likely to include roles as both a regulator and an effector of chondrocyte differentiation.

All five members share a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain that provides for lysyl oxidase or lysyl oxidase-like enzyme activity, and more divergent propeptide regions.

The importance of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity to normal bone development has long been known, and is based in part on studies in which enzyme activities are inhibited by lathyrogens in vivo (3Selye H. Rev. Can. Biol. 1957; 16: 1-82PubMed Google Scholar), including β-aminopropionitrile, a potent inhibitor of LOX and LOX isoform activity (4Tang S.S. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4331-4338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The LOX family can be subdivided into two subgroups. Although all members have similarities in the catalytic C-terminal region, LOX and LOXL1 are more closely related to each other than they are to LOXL2-LOXL4. Moreover, the pro-peptide regions of LOX and LOXL1 have very little similarity to each other and no similarity to LOXL2-LOXL4. The pro-regions of LOXL2-LOXL4 each contain four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains whose functions are likely to depend on interactions with other proteins (1Csiszar K. Prog.

Fugene 6 reagent was bought from Roche (Basel, Switzerland) and p24 ELISA kit was purchased from Cell Biolabs, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Research was conducted in conformity with all Federal and USDA guidelines under an IACUC approved protocol at the Boston University School of Medicine in Boston, MA. For fracture studies, 8–10 week postbirth C57BL/6J (B6) male mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and housed at the Boston University Medical Center animal housing facility for the duration of each study plus 3 days of acclimation. Growth plate studies were carried out on days 7 and 14 postnatal male mice. Unilateral fractures were produced in the right femur of 8–10-week-old male mice as previously described (17Jepsen K.J.

Fracture configurations that were comminuted or were not localized to the mid-diaphyseal region were excluded from the study. Days 10 and 14 time points during fracture healing were chosen for the histological studies because the B6 mouse strain has a corresponding peak period of cartilage formation and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation (17Jepsen K.J.

For molecular biological studies of fracture healing, mRNA was extracted from callus tissues on day 0 (no fracture) and at intervals up to day 21 of healing. For histological assessment of fractures, femora with surrounding muscle and soft tissues were fixed, decalcified, sectioned, and stained as previously described (18Gerstenfeld L.C. Alkhiary Y.M.

For growth plate assessments, femora from either 7- or 14-day-old mice were used. ATDC5 cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C and 5% CO2. For differentiation studies, ATDC5 cells in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates until they reached full confluence. Seven days after reaching visual confluence, culture media were replaced with medium containing in addition 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, 3 × 10−8 m sodium selenite (GIBCO®; ITS) and 37.5 μg/ml of ascorbate 2-phosphate. Media were changed every other day throughout the length of the experiment. Total RNA from ATDC5 cells was extracted using the RNeasy® Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, culture media were aspirated completely from culture plates, cells were disrupted by addition of buffer RLT, and the cell layer was collected. The cell lysate was transferred directly into a Qiashredder spin column, placed in a collection tube and centrifuged at full speed for 2 min. One volume of 70% ethanol was added to the homogenized lysate and mixed by pipetting. Then the sample was transferred into an RNeasy spin column for RNA binding, followed by washing with buffer RW1 and buffer RPE. Bound RNA was eluted in RNase-free water. RNA samples were then stored at −80 °C. RNA samples from fractured femurs, including early fracture callus were harvested at different time points as described (19Kayal R.A. Tsatsas D.

RNA obtained was analyzed on 1% agarose gels to ensure RNA quality by visualizing 18 S and 28 S rRNA in proper relative proportions after ethidium bromide staining. RNA was quantified via spectrophotometry (NanoDrop, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and 1 μg of RNA per treatment condition was added to 30 μl of reverse transcription reactions (1× RT buffer, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm per dNTP, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor, and 3.125 units/μl MultiScribe reverse transcriptase) using the Applied Biosystems Reverse Transcription kit. The reverse transcription thermal cycling conditions are: 25 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 60 min and 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 4 °C on hold. cDNA was stored at −20 °C prior to use in real-time PCR. 2 μl of each reverse transcription reaction was used for 25 μl of real-time PCR reaction (12.5 μl of Taqman Universal PCR master mix, 1.25 μl specific primer and 2 μl of template) using the 96-well format. TaqMan probe sets (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) employed were for LOX (Mm00495386), LOXL1 (Mm01145738), LOXL2 (Mm00804740), LOXL3 (Mm00442953), LOXL4 (Mm00446385), SOX9 (mm00448840_m), COLII (Mm00491889), COLX (Mm00487041), and Aggrecan (Mm00545794). GAPDH (Mm99999915) was used as an endogenous control. The fold change in the target gene, normalized to endogenous control and relative to the expression of the calibrator sample, was calculated by the 2−ΔΔct method (20Huggett J. Dheda K. Bustin S. Zumla A. Genes Immun. 2005; 6: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts from ATDC5 cells at different time intervals were obtained by lysing cells in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol). Protein concentrations were determined with the Nano-Orange protein quantitation kit using bovine serum albumin as standard following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein samples (20 μg) were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) overnight in blotting buffer (0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk dissolved in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween), for 1 h. Then, the membranes were incubated with blocking solution containing goat anti-LOXL2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) (1:400) and kept overnight at 4 °C with mild shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T for 10 min each and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:2500) for 1 h in blocking solution at room temperature with light shaking, and washed with TBS-T three times for 10 min each. Chemiluminescent detection of bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies was determined using the ECL Western blotting Detection Reagents (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ) and exposed to film. Membranes were subsequently stripped using Restore Western Stripping Solution (Thermo Scientific/Pierce, Pittsburgh, PA) and re-probed with β-actin antibody (Cell Signaling) for loading control as required. Densitometry was carried out only on films with non-saturating exposures utilizing a Bio-Rad Versadoc Photodocumentation System and Quantity One software. Femurs of 9-week-old mice were fractured as described, and tissues collected at intervals of healing (19Kayal R.A. Tsatsas D. Bauer M.A. Allen B. Al-Sebaei M.O. Kakar S. Leone C.W. Morgan E.F.

Legs from uninjured mice were obtained from 7- and 14-day-old mice, for analysis of epiphyseal growth plates. Samples were fixed and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Microwave heating in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer at pH 6, was used for endogenous antigen retrieval, and then sections were allowed to cool for 20 min. Immunohistochemistry was next carried out as we have previously described in detail (21Uzel M.I. Kantarci A. Hong H.H. Uygur C. Sheff M.C. Firatli E. Trackman P.C. J.

Secondary antibodies utilized were biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for LOX-PP and biotinylated anti-goat IgG for LOXL2. Non-immune rabbit IgG and goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) served as negative controls for corresponding primary antibodies. Slides were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C, and were then processed and photographed as previously described (21Uzel M.I. Kantarci A. Hong H.H. Uygur C. Sheff M.C. Firatli E. Trackman P.C. J. Periodontol. 2001; 72: 921-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All work with lentivirus was performed under BL2 conditions. Viral constructs were bought from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) except for the non-target construct (23Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5179) Google Scholar) that was obtained via Addgene (Cambridge, MA) and plasmids were isolated using Qiagen Maxi prep kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). The shRNA sequences were: Virus 8 (TRCN0000076708) CCGGGCTGAGAAGAAAGGTGCTCATCTCGAGATGAGCACCTTTCTTCTCAGCTTTTTG; Virus 9 (TRCN0000076709) CCGGGCATGGAAATATCTTCGCCAACTCGAGTTGGCGAAGATATTTCCATGCTTTTTG; Virus 10 (TRCN0000076710) CCGGCCTGGTGCTTAATGCTGAGATCTCGAGATCTCAGCATTAAGCACCAGGTTTTTG; Virus 11 (TRCN0000076711) CCGGCCAAATAGAGAGCCTAAATATCTCGAGA-TATTTAGGCTCTCTATTTGGTTTTTG; Virus 12 (TRCN0000076712) CCGGCAACCAAATAGAGAGCCTAAACTCGAGTTTAGGCTCTCTATTTGGTTGTTTTTG; non-target control virus (plasmid 1864) CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCGCTCGAGCGAGGGCGACTT-AACCTTAGG. Lentiviruses were produced by plating 293-T cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 10 cm2 at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM high glucose media, supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. Cells were co-transfected using Fugene 6 reagent (150 μl) (Roche), and 3 plasmids: lentivirus plasmid, pcMV-VSV-G and pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr at the ratio of 8:1:8. Non-Target lentivirus plasmid served as a negative control (24Bais M.V. Wigner N. Young M. Toholka R. Graves D.T. Morgan E.F. Gerstenfeld L.C. Einhorn T.A. Bone. 2009; 45: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The supernatant fluid was collected at 24-h intervals for three consecutive days and was replaced with fresh differentiation media (35 ml). Virus particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 16,500 × g for 90 min and were resuspended in PBS and stored at −70 °C. Virus titer was determined by using a p24 ELISA kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. ATDC5 cells were plated in 6-well plates. Seven days after confluence, the lentivirus transduction was carried out in differentiation media containing 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide. The media were changed the next day and then every other day thereafter. Alcian blue staining of ATDC5 cultures was performed after fixation of ATDC5 cells with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed with water three times and air dried. The staining was performed with the commercially available 1% Alcian Blue solution, pH 2.5 (American Mastertech), for 5 h and washed several times with distilled water before being photographed (25Nakatani S. Mano H. Im R. Shimizu J. Wada M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2007; 30: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Alizarin red staining was carried out as described previously (10Vora S.R. Palamakumbura A.H. Mitsi M. Guo Y. Pischon N. Nugent M.A. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2384-2393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Two way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests were performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego) software version 5.02 for Windows; data were considered significant at p < 0.05. The expression pattern of lysyl oxidase, and its isoforms during fracture repair was first determined. Total RNA samples from mouse fractured femur calluses were extracted at different time points after fracture, and samples were subjected to qPCR. Results show that mRNA levels of LOX, LOXL1, LOXL3, and LOXL4 all had similar bi-phasic expression patterns throughout the healing process with peaks of expression on days 7 and 21 (Fig. 1, A, B, D, and E). The expression pattern for LOXL2, however, was found to be different from the other isoforms with a peak of expression seen on day 7 after fracture (Fig. 1C). This time point corresponds to the onset of the chondrogenic phase of fracture healing (26Ferguson C. Alpern E. Miclau T. Helms J.A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We, therefore, developed the hypothesis that LOXL2 could have unique importance in chondrogenesis. To investigate directly whether LOXL2 is expressed by chondrocytes in vivo, immunohistochemistry studies were carried out on healing fractures introduced into 10-week-old mice and were analyzed on post-fracture days 10 and 14, and on normal epiphyseal growth plates on postnatal days 7 and 14. In healing fractures, LOXL2 protein was strongly detected in chondrocytes abundant on day 10 of healing (supplemental Fig. S1). LOX staining was found to be strongest in osteoblasts lining bone that were highly abundant on day 14, while LOX expression is weaker in chondrocytes. Weaker LOXL2 staining is seen in cells lining bone (osteoblasts) at all time points (supplemental Fig. S2). Similarly, in epiphyseal growth plates, strong staining for LOXL2 was detected in chondrocytes present within the hypertrophic and proliferating zones, and in calcified cartilage (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that LOXL2 is a predominant lysyl oxidase isoform made by chondrocytes in vivo. We next wished to determine whether LOXL2 expression is regulated as a function of chondrocyte differentiation. The ATDC5 cell line undergoes a well characterized program of chondrocyte differentiation (27Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-well plates in DMEM-F12 growth medium. Seven days after visual confluence, the growth medium was supplemented with ascorbate and insulin-transferrin-selenite solution. Total RNA was isolated at different time points and subjected to quantitative real time PCR. LOX, LOXL1, LOXL3, and LOXL4 mRNA levels showed small changes in expression compared with the robust changes in LOXL2 (Fig. 3). Total mRNA expression of LOXL2 in differentiating ATDC5 cells showed an approximate 4.5-fold increase by day 7, increasing to 12-and 14-fold by day 14–21, and then dramatically reaching its highest level of 43-fold on day 28, decreasing to 18-fold on day 35 (Fig. 3C). To investigate LOXL2 expression in relation to well characterized chondrogenic markers, we examined the expression of collagen type II, X, and aggrecan. Expression of chondrogenic markers was dramatically increased with time as expected (Fig. 4). The sequence of expression of these chondrogenic markers followed the normal pattern of type II collagen expression preceding aggrecan, followed by expression of type X collagen (Fig. 4). Interestingly, LOXL2 expression was significantly elevated as early as day 7 of differentiation, but the peak of LOXL2 mRNA expression was later than the peak of type II collagen expression, but earlier than that of type X collagen.FIGURE 4Quantitative real-time PCR analyses of (A) type II collagen, (B) aggrecan, and (C) type X collagen in differentiating ATDC5 cells. RNA was extracted at different time points. The mRNA expression relative to GAPDH was determined, and the fold changes were calculated relative to day 0. (*, p < 0.05; ANOVA; n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next wished to determine LOX and LOXL2 protein expression in developing ATDC5 cells. Cells were grown to full confluence and then induced to differentiate as described above. Cells layers were extracted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer at intervals, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for LOX and LOXL2. Data show that LOX proenzyme levels decrease with differentiation, whereas LOXL2 pro-protein increases ∼40-fold during the first 14 days of differentiation, and remains high through day 35 (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with mRNA regulation seen in Fig. 3. We next wished to determine if LOXL2 plays any role in chondrocyte differentiation, or whether the regulated expression of LOXL2 is simply a consequence of chondrocyte differentiation. Five commercially available lentiviral LOXL2 shRNA constructs were screened for their ability to prevent LOXL2 mRNA increases on day 7 of differentiation. Lentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of 293-T cells with 3 plasmid vectors (lentivirus, pcMV-VSV-G, and pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr) at a ratio of 8:1:8. A Non-Target Virus served as a control (23Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5179) Google Scholar). As virus 11 gave the most effective knockdown (data not shown), all subsequent studies were performed with this virus, and the non-target virus control. This shRNA clone has no potential to directly knockdown other LOX isoforms, as confirmed by BLAST analyses (supplemental Fig. S3) that shows no common sequence with any other lysyl oxidase isoform, or sufficient similarity to any murine mRNA or gene coding sequence (28Du Q. Thonberg H. Wang J. Wahlestedt C. Liang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1671-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 29Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 6 demonstrate that LOXL2 protein levels are diminished in differentiating ATDC5 cells compared with the non-target virus control, confirming that the shRNA lentivirus successfully diminished LOXL2 production. We next determined the effect of LOXL2 knockdown on the expression of chondrocyte-specific differentiation marker mRNAs. Data in Fig. 7 show remarkable inhibition of expression of the chondrocyte differentiation markers: SOX9, type II collagen, type X collagen, and aggrecan. Alcian blue (Fig. 8) and alizarin red (Fig. 9) staining of differentiating LOXL2 knockdown and non-target lentivirus transduced ATDC5 cells show nearly complete inhibition of chondrocyte-like extracellular matrix, and mineralized nodule formation in LOXL2 knockdown cultures. Interestingly, though LOXL2 shRNA clone 11 is specific LOXL1, LOXL3, and LOXL4, but not LOX mRNAs, were also significantly down-regulated compared with non-target shRNA (supplemental Fig. S4, two way ANOVA). Taken together, these data indica"

Although the mechanism by which cytosine (C) is selected at position 75 of tRNA has been established, the mechanism by which adenine (A) is selected at position 76 remains elusive. Here, we report five cocrystal structures of the enzyme complexed with both a tRNA mimic and nucleoside triphosphates under catalytically active conditions. These structures suggest that adenosine 5'-monophosphate is incorporated onto the A76 position of the tRNA via a carboxylate-assisted, one-metal-ion mechanism with aspartate 110 functioning as a general base. The discrimination against incorporation of cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP) at position 76 arises from improper placement of the α phosphate of the incoming CTP, which results from the interaction of C with arginine 224 and prevents the nucleophilic attack by the 3' hydroxyl group of cytidine75."
https://openalex.org/W1998831263,"Activated by the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway, MSK1 is recruited to immediate-early gene (IEG) regulatory regions, where it phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser-10 or Ser-28. Chromatin remodelers and modifiers are then recruited by 14-3-3 proteins, readers of phosphoserine marks, leading to the occupancy of IEG promoters by the initiation-engaged form of RNA polymerase II and the onset of transcription. In this study, we show that this mechanism of IEG induction, initially elucidated in parental 10T1/2 murine fibroblast cells, applies to metastatic Hras1-transformed Ciras-3 cells. As the RAS-MAPK pathway is constitutively activated in Ciras-3 cells, MSK1 activity and phosphorylated H3 steady-state levels are elevated. We found that steady-state levels of the IEG products AP-1 and COX-2 were also elevated in Ciras-3 cells. When MSK1 activity was inhibited or MSK1 expression was knocked down in Ciras-3 cells, the induction of IEG expression and the steady-state levels of COX-2, FRA-1, and JUN were greatly reduced. Furthermore, MSK1 knockdown Ciras-3 cells lost their malignant phenotype, as reflected by the absence of anchorage-independent growth.

IntroductionMSK1 (mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1) is activated by the RAS-MAPK (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) and p38 MAPK pathways and mediates the primary response by connecting mitogenic and stress extracellular stimuli with immediate-early gene (IEG) 4The abbreviations used are: IEGimmediate-early geneTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateα-MEMα-minimal essential mediumRNAPIIRNA polymerase II. expression (1Deak M.

Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). IEGs are identified by their rapid and transient transcriptional induction, requiring no new protein synthesis. MSK1 substrates include histone H3, the nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1, and transcription factors such as the p65 subunit of NF-κB, ATF1 (activating transcription factor 1), ER81, and CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) (3Arthur J.S. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 5866-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Stimulation of mouse fibroblasts with phorbol esters such as the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and EGF results in the phosphorylation of H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 and of HMGN1 at Ser-6, events termed the “nucleosomal response” (2Soloaga A.

Pérez-Cadahía B. Yu J. Kung S.K. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3196-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we showed that MSK1 is a component of a multiprotein complex including BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF remodeler, and phosphoserine adaptor 14-3-3 proteins. This complex is recruited to the upstream promoter elements of target genes by transcription factors, resulting in MSK1-mediated H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10 or Ser-28. We proposed a model in which 14-3-3 proteins bind to H3 phosphorylated at Ser-10 (H3S10ph) or Ser-28 (H3S28ph) and, acting as scaffolds, stabilize the SWI/SNF complex at the IEG upstream promoter elements, possibly increasing the residence time of the chromatin remodelers and transcription factors. The recruited SWI/SNF remodels nucleosomes around the promoter, enabling the binding of transcription factors and the onset of transcription (4Drobic B. Pérez-Cadahía B. Yu J. Kung S.K. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3196-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The RAS-MAPK pathway is abnormally active in ∼30% of human cancers (e.g. colon, pancreatic, thyroid, lung, and aggressive breast cancers) (5Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 6Calipel A. Lefevre G. Pouponnot C. Mouriaux F. Eychène A. Mascarelli F. J. Biol.

Hence, we aimed to elucidate the physiological role of MSK1 and to explore the relevance of MSK1 activity to the malignant potential of cells with an overactive RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. As a model system, we used Ciras-3, an Hras1-transformed 10T1/2 mouse fibroblast cell line that is tumorigenic and metastatic and has a constitutively activated RAS-MAPK pathway (8Egan S.E. McClarty G.A. Jarolim L. Wright J.A. Spiro I. Hager G. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Ciras-3 cells also exhibit a less condensed chromatin structure and a higher incidence of chromosomal instability than the non-tumorigenic parental 10T1/2 cells (9Dunn K.L. He S. Wark L. Delcuve G.P. Sun J.M. Yu Chen H. Mai S. Davie J.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009; 48: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that Ciras-3 cells have elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (the hallmark of an activated RAS-MAPK pathway), increased MSK1 activity (but not MSK1 protein), and elevated steady-state levels of H3S10ph, H3S28ph, and HMGN1S6ph compared with the parental 10T1/2 cell line (9Dunn K.L. He S. Wark L. Delcuve G.P. Sun J.M. Yu Chen H. Mai S. Davie J.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009; 48: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Drobic B. Espino P.S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9076-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The histone H3 phosphatase PP1 activity is similar in both cell lines. As is the case for parental 10T1/2 cells, TPA stimulation of serum-starved Ciras-3 cells results in the phosphorylation of H3 Ser-10 or Ser-28 and HMGN1 Ser-6, as well as IEG induction (9Dunn K.L. He S. Wark L. Delcuve G.P. Sun J.M. Yu Chen H. Mai S. Davie J.R. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009; 48: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Strelkov I.S. Davie J.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 75-78PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether the mechanism by which MSK1-induced chromatin remodeling of IEG regulatory regions is altered in Ciras-3 cells as a consequence of a deregulated RAS-MAPK pathway.In this study, we provide evidence that the mechanism of MSK1-induced chromatin remodeling at IEG regulatory elements in Ciras-3 cells is similar to that in parental 10T1/2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased activity of MSK1 in Hras1-transformed cells results in higher steady-state levels of IEG products than in parental cells and confers to the cells their malignant properties.DISCUSSIONThe MSK1-mediated nucleosomal response plays a critical role in several physiological processes, including inflammation, neuronal plasticity, and function such as memory formation, learning, and responses to external stimuli (e.g. fear or drug exposure) (3Arthur J.S. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 5866-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Brami-Cherrier K. Roze E. Girault J.A. Betuing S. Caboche J. J. Neurochem. 2009; 108: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is involved in cell cycle regulation and is required for tumor promoter-induced cell transformation (15Kim H.G. Lee K.W. Cho Y.Y. Kang N.J. Oh S.M. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2538-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MSK1 deregulation may be involved in mechanisms underlying diseases such as Huntington or psoriasis (16Roze E. Betuing S. Deyts C. Marcon E. Brami-Cherrier K. Pagès C. Humbert S. Mérienne K.

Furthermore, >30% of human cancers have an overactive RAS-MAPK pathway and presumably elevated MSK1 activity (5Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 6Calipel A. Lefevre G.

Davie J.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Serum-starved 10T1/2 and Ciras-3 cells have low levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Upon TPA stimulation, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 increase to comparable levels in both cell lines, leading to the MSK1-mediated nucleosomal response targeting IEG regulatory regions, the binding of the 14-3-3 phosphoserine mark readers, the recruitment of chromatin remodelers and modifiers, and the initiation of transcription. Thus, MSK1 sets off identical mechanistic processes in both parental 10T1/2 and tumorigenic Ciras-3 cells, even though cellular backgrounds differ, with Ciras-3 cells having a more open chromatin structure and elevated AP-1 transcription factor levels.However, the RAS-MAPK pathway is constitutively activated in Ciras-3 cells, and the steady-state levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 are elevated, generating increased MSK1 activity and elevated steady-state levels of FRA-1, JUN, and COX-2. This may result in a permanently altered gene expression program that will facilitate the progress of transformed cells toward the next stage of tumor formation or metastasis. AP-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, transformation, and cancer cell invasion (18Mariani O. Brennetot C. Coindre J.M. Gruel N. Ganem C. Delattre O. Stern M.H.

In addition, amplification or overexpression of genes coding for JUN and FRA-1 induces transformation in vivo (18Mariani O. Brennetot C. Coindre J.M. Gruel N. Ganem C. Delattre O. Stern M.H.

COX-2 synthesizes prostaglandin E2, a stimulator of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL-2, and is highly expressed in several human malignancies, including colorectal, gastric, prostate, breast, lung, and endometrial cancers (25Tsatsanis C. Androulidaki A. Venihaki M. Margioris A.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 26Sahin M. Sahin E. Gümüslü S. Angiology. 2009; 60: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The regulation of each of these three genes, Jun, Fosl1, and Cox-2, is orchestrated by numerous transcription factors, which themselves must be activated. Moreover, transcriptional autoregulation and post-transcriptional stabilization are also involved. Nonetheless, we have shown that MSK1 activity is critical in maintaining high levels of JUN, FRA-1, and COX-2 and in sustaining their ability to drive the cancer process. Chemical or genetic interference with MSK1 activity causes decreased steady-state levels of FRA-1, JUN, and COX-2 and the loss of Ciras-3 cell metastatic properties. Our studies provide mechanistic understanding to previous data showing the importance of MSK1 and the nucleosomal response in the malignant transformation of mouse epidermal cells and v-Src-transformed rat fibroblast cells (15Kim H.G.

Because MSK knock-out mice are viable and fertile (28Wiggin G.R. Soloaga A. Foster J.M. Murray-Tait V. Cohen P. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), inhibition of MSK1 activity would likely not have significant adverse effects on normal cells, and due to oncogenic addiction of cancer cells, it might result in differentiation or apoptosis of cancer cells (29Weinstein I.B.

Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). IEGs are identified by their rapid and transient transcriptional induction, requiring no new protein synthesis. MSK1 substrates include histone H3, the nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1, and transcription factors such as the p65 subunit of NF-κB, ATF1 (activating transcription factor 1), ER81, and CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein) (3Arthur J.S. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 5866-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Stimulation of mouse fibroblasts with phorbol esters such as the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and EGF results in the phosphorylation of H3 at Ser-10 and Ser-28 and of HMGN1 at Ser-6, events termed the “nucleosomal response” (2Soloaga A.

Pérez-Cadahía B. Yu J. Kung S.K. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3196-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we showed that MSK1 is a component of a multiprotein complex including BRG1, the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF remodeler, and phosphoserine adaptor 14-3-3 proteins. This complex is recruited to the upstream promoter elements of target genes by transcription factors, resulting in MSK1-mediated H3 phosphorylation at Ser-10 or Ser-28. We proposed a model in which 14-3-3 proteins bind to H3 phosphorylated at Ser-10 (H3S10ph) or Ser-28 (H3S28ph) and, acting as scaffolds, stabilize the SWI/SNF complex at the IEG upstream promoter elements, possibly increasing the residence time of the chromatin remodelers and transcription factors. The recruited SWI/SNF remodels nucleosomes around the promoter, enabling the binding of transcription factors and the onset of transcription (4Drobic B. Pérez-Cadahía B. Yu J. Kung S.K. Davie J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 3196-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The RAS-MAPK pathway is abnormally active in ∼30% of human cancers (e.g. colon, pancreatic, thyroid, lung, and aggressive breast cancers) (5Bos J.L.

Hence, we aimed to elucidate the physiological role of MSK1 and to explore the relevance of MSK1 activity to the malignant potential of cells with an overactive RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. As a model system, we used Ciras-3, an Hras1-transformed 10T1/2 mouse fibroblast cell line that is tumorigenic and metastatic and has a constitutively activated RAS-MAPK pathway (8Egan S.E.

Ciras-3 cells also exhibit a less condensed chromatin structure and a higher incidence of chromosomal instability than the non-tumorigenic parental 10T1/2 cells (9Dunn K.L. He S. Wark L. Delcuve G.P.

It was demonstrated that Ciras-3 cells have elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (the hallmark of an activated RAS-MAPK pathway), increased MSK1 activity (but not MSK1 protein), and elevated steady-state levels of H3S10ph, H3S28ph, and HMGN1S6ph compared with the parental 10T1/2 cell line (9Dunn K.L.

However, it is unknown whether the mechanism by which MSK1-induced chromatin remodeling of IEG regulatory regions is altered in Ciras-3 cells as a consequence of a deregulated RAS-MAPK pathway.In this study, we provide evidence that the mechanism of MSK1-induced chromatin remodeling at IEG regulatory elements in Ciras-3 cells is similar to that in parental 10T1/2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased activity of MSK1 in Hras1-transformed cells results in higher steady-state levels of IEG products than in parental cells and confers to the cells their malignant properties.

DISCUSSIONThe MSK1-mediated nucleosomal response plays a critical role in several physiological processes, including inflammation, neuronal plasticity, and function such as memory formation, learning, and responses to external stimuli (e.g. fear or drug exposure) (3Arthur J.S.

MSK1 deregulation may be involved in mechanisms underlying diseases such as Huntington or psoriasis (16Roze E. Betuing S. Deyts C. Marcon E. Brami-Cherrier K. Pagès C. Humbert S. Mérienne K.

Furthermore, >30% of human cancers have an overactive RAS-MAPK pathway and presumably elevated MSK1 activity (5Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 6Calipel A. Lefevre G.

Davie J.R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Serum-starved 10T1/2 and Ciras-3 cells have low levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2. Upon TPA stimulation, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 increase to comparable levels in both cell lines, leading to the MSK1-mediated nucleosomal response targeting IEG regulatory regions, the binding of the 14-3-3 phosphoserine mark readers, the recruitment of chromatin remodelers and modifiers, and the initiation of transcription. Thus, MSK1 sets off identical mechanistic processes in both parental 10T1/2 and tumorigenic Ciras-3 cells, even though cellular backgrounds differ, with Ciras-3 cells having a more open chromatin structure and elevated AP-1 transcription factor levels.However, the RAS-MAPK pathway is constitutively activated in Ciras-3 cells, and the steady-state levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 are elevated, generating increased MSK1 activity and elevated steady-state levels of FRA-1, JUN, and COX-2. This may result in a permanently altered gene expression program that will facilitate the progress of transformed cells toward the next stage of tumor formation or metastasis. AP-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in proliferation, apoptosis, transformation, and cancer cell invasion (18Mariani O. Brennetot C. Coindre J.M. Gruel N. Ganem C. Delattre O. Stern M.H.

In addition, amplification or overexpression of genes coding for JUN and FRA-1 induces transformation in vivo (18Mariani O. Brennetot C. Coindre J.M. Gruel N. Ganem C. Delattre O. Stern M.H.

Talotta F. Yaniv M. Weitzman J.B. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2633-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). COX-2 synthesizes prostaglandin E2, a stimulator of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL-2, and is highly expressed in several human malignancies, including colorectal, gastric, prostate, breast, lung, and endometrial cancers (25Tsatsanis C. Androulidaki A. Venihaki M. Margioris A.N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1654-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 26Sahin M. Sahin E. Gümüslü S. Angiology. 2009; 60: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The regulation of each of these three genes, Jun, Fosl1, and Cox-2, is orchestrated by numerous transcription factors, which themselves must be activated. Moreover, transcriptional autoregulation and post-transcriptional stabilization are also involved. Nonetheless, we have shown that MSK1 activity is critical in maintaining high levels of JUN, FRA-1, and COX-2 and in sustaining their ability to drive the cancer process. Chemical or genetic interference with MSK1 activity causes decreased steady-state levels of FRA-1, JUN, and COX-2 and the loss of Ciras-3 cell metastatic properties. Our studies provide mechanistic understanding to previous data showing the importance of MSK1 and the nucleosomal response in the malignant transformation of mouse epidermal cells and v-Src-transformed rat fibroblast cells (15Kim H.G.

Site-directed mutagenesis in a recombinant bacterial collagen system was used to explore the effects of the Gly mutation position and of the identity of the residue replacing Gly in a homogeneous collagen molecular population. Homotrimeric bacterial collagen proteins with a Gly-to-Arg or Gly-to-Ser replacement formed stable triple-helix molecules with a reproducible 2 °C decrease in stability. All Gly replacements led to a significant delay in triple-helix folding, but a more dramatic delay was observed when the mutation was located near the N terminus of the triple-helix domain. This highly disruptive mutation, close to the globular N-terminal trimerization domain where folding is initiated, is likely to interfere with triple-helix nucleation. A positional effect of mutations was also suggested by trypsin sensitivity for a Gly-to-Arg replacement close to the triple-helix N terminus but not for the same replacement near the center of the molecule. The significant impact of the location of a mutation on triple-helix folding and conformation could relate to the severe consequences of mutations located near the C terminus of type I and type III collagens, where trimerization occurs and triple-helix folding is initiated."
https://openalex.org/W1996681913,"Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A), a member of the atypical α-kinase family, phosphorylates sites in the myosin II tail that block filament assembly. Here we show that the catalytic activity of A-CAT, the α-kinase domain of MHCK A (residues 552–841), is severely inhibited by the removal of a disordered C-terminal tail sequence (C-tail; residues 806–841). The key residue in the C-tail was identified as Thr825, which was found to be constitutively autophosphorylated. Dephosphorylation of Thr825 using shrimp alkaline phosphatase decreased A-CAT activity. The activity of a truncated A-CAT lacking Thr825 could be rescued by Pi, phosphothreonine, and a phosphorylated peptide, but not by threonine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or an unphosphorylated peptide. These results focused attention on a Pi-binding pocket located in the C-terminal lobe of A-CAT. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the Pi-pocket was essential for A-CAT activity. Based on these results, it is proposed that autophosphorylation of Thr825 activates ACAT by providing a covalently tethered ligand for the Pi-pocket. Ab initio modeling studies using the Rosetta FloppyTail and FlexPepDock protocols showed that it is feasible for the phosphorylated Thr825 to dock intramolecularly into the Pi-pocket. Allosteric activation is predicted to involve a conformational change in Arg734, which bridges the bound Pi to Asp762 in a key active site loop. Sequence alignments indicate that a comparable regulatory mechanism is likely to be conserved in Dictyostelium MHCK B-D and metazoan eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinases.

FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites results in the disassembly of myosin II bipolar filaments and inhibits processes, such as cytokinesis, that depend on myosin II contractile activity (5Kolman M.F.

Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). MHCK A is 130-kDa in size and consists of an N-terminal α-helical coiled-coil domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal WD-repeat domain (7Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain assembles into trimers or tetramers, binds, and cross-links actin filaments and is responsible for targeting MHCK A to actin-rich cellular protrusions (8Steimle P.A. Licate L.

The WD-repeat domain interacts with filamentous myosin II and is required for MHCK A to efficiently phosphorylate myosin II (10Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol.

The kinase domain of MHCK A bears no sequence similarity to the superfamily of “conventional” eukaryotic protein kinases but instead belongs to a small but widespread family of atypical protein kinases termed the α-kinases (12Middelbeek J. Clark K. Venselaar H. Huynen M.A. Van Leeuwen F.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

In addition to MHCK A, D. discoideum expresses five proteins with α-kinase domains. Three of the proteins, termed MHCK B, C, and D, are closely related to MHCK A and at least two to them, MHCK B and C, function cooperatively to regulate myosin II filament assembly in vivo (13Yumura S.

BMC Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The other two α-kinases, AK1 and VwkA, have domain structures unrelated to MHCK A. AK1 contains an Arf GTPase-activating protein domain and VwkA contains an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A-like domain. The function of AK1 is not known, whereas VwkA is involved in the regulation of contractile vacuole function (16Betapudi V. Mason C. Licate L. Egelhoff T.T. Mol. Biol.

Mammals express six multidomain proteins with α-kinase domains (12Middelbeek J. Clark K. Venselaar H. Huynen M.A. Van Leeuwen F.N. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These include TRPM6 and TRPM7, which function as divalent cation channels and phosphorylate the tail of non-muscle myosin II (18Clark K. Langeslag M. van Leeuwen B. Ran L. Ryazanov A.G. Figdor C.G.

J. 2007; 403: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The isolated α-kinase domain of MHCK A, termed A-CAT, displays a high level of protein kinase activity and strongly prefers to phosphorylate threonine residues (21Luo X. Crawley S.W. Steimle P.A. Egelhoff T.T. Cote G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17836-17843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of A-CAT reveals that it is composed of an N-terminal and C-terminal lobe with the active site situated in a cleft at the interface between the two lobes (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An invariant catalytic residue in the active site (Asp766) can be phosphorylated, suggesting that the α-kinase catalytic mechanism differs from that of conventional eukaryotic protein kinases. A-CAT contains a tightly bound zinc atom that is required for stability and binds two Mg2+ ions, one in an active site pocket and one at the center of the glycine-rich N/D-loop. The Mg2+ binding sites are regulatory, because millimolar concentrations of Mg2+, in excess of that required to bind to ATP, are required for A-CAT to exhibit maximal catalytic activity (22Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A-CAT also binds a Pi molecule at a highly basic site in the C-terminal lobe that we term the Pi-pocket (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of MHCK A is enhanced at least 50-fold by autophosphorylation (24Medley Q.G. Gariépy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cellular signaling mechanisms that activate MHCK A remain to be elucidated, but in vitro the rate of autophosphorylation is stimulated by actin filaments, myosin II, and negatively charged compounds, such as DNA and acidic phospholipids (25Egelhoff T.T. Croft D. Steimle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2879-2887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Medley Q.G. Bagshaw W.L. Truong T. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1175: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MHCK A incorporates up to 10 mol of phosphate/mol, but 3 mol of phosphate are sufficient for maximal activation (24Medley Q.G. Gariépy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we identify Thr825 as a key autophosphorylation site that is required for the activity of A-CAT and MHCK A. Thr825 is located within a disordered sequence that links the α-kinase domain to the WD-repeat domain. We further demonstrate that the Pi-pocket functions as a positive allosteric binding site, and propose a model in which the phosphorylated Thr825 (Thr(P)825) activates A-CAT by providing a covalently tethered ligand for the Pi-pocket. Sequence alignments indicate that the proposed regulatory mechanism is conserved in the other MHCKs and the metazoan eEF2Ks. Peptides used in this study were synthesized by the Sheldon Biotechnology Facility, McGill University. ATP, MBP, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, threonine, and phosphothreonine were purchased from Sigma and [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Truncation and deletion constructs of the MHCK A α-kinase domain (A-CAT; residues 552–841) were created using PCR (22Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DNA constructs encoding site-directed mutants of A-CAT were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Constructs were cloned in-frame into the NcoI and XhoI sites of the pET-28a vector (Novagen) to add an N-terminal His tag and a TEV protease site as described (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Full-length MHCK A constructs (NCBI accession XP_635600) were cloned into the plasmid pTX-FLAG vector (28Levi S. Polyakov M. Egelhoff T.T. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that had been adapted to GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen). Briefly, the parent plasmid pTX-FLAG was digested by BamHI and XhoI and blunted with T4 DNA polymerase. The Gateway recombination cassette (reading frame cassette B) was then inserted to create destination vector pTX-FLAG-GATE. Expression constructs encoding MHCK A were then created using pTX-FLAG-GATE according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type and mutant forms of A-CAT were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by chromatography over a His-Bind column (Novagen) as described (supplemental Fig. S1) (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Crawley S.W. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged MHCK A was expressed in the D. discoideum AX3 cell line (30Hadwiger J.A. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 38-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on 9-cm plastic Petri dishes in HL5 medium (31Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10,000 units/ml of penicillin and 10 mg/ml of streptomycin (Sigma). Plasmids were introduced into AX3 cells by electroporation at 0.85 KV and 25 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II Electroporation System (32Knecht D.A. Shelden E. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged MHCK A were produced by dilution plating and selection in 20 μg/ml of geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed by homogenization in 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing one complete mini protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Diagnostics) per 50 ml of buffer at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 h was passed over a column of anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (Sigma) (33Crawley S.W. de la Roche M.A. Lee S.F. Li Z. Chitayat S. Smith S.P. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6307-6315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). FLAG-MHCK A was eluted with TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 200 μg/ml of FLAG peptide and dialyzed against 20 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. ATPase and kinase activity was assayed at 22 °C in kinase buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm ATP, and 20 mm TES, pH 7.0) containing [γ-32P]ATP at a specific activity of 5–500 cpm/pmol of ATP. Kinase assays included MBP or the MH-3 synthetic peptide (RKKFGEAEKTKAKEFL) at a concentration of 30 or 300 μm, respectively. Other additions to the kinase and ATPase assays are described in the figure legends. Assays were initiated by the addition of 1.45 μm A-CAT or 38.8 nm MHCK A. Aliquots were removed at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min for kinase assays and 5, 10, 20, and 40 min for ATPase assays. In some cases kinase assays were performed at 4 °C and aliquots were removed at 20, 40, 60, and 90 s. ATP hydrolysis was measured by following the release of 32P (34Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity was measured by spotting 20-μl aliquots onto squares of Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper (35Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The squares were washed in 1% phosphoric acid, immersed in ScintiVerse Universal LS Mixture (Fisher Scientific), and counted using a Beckman LS 9000 scintillation counter. Over the assay time courses linear rates of ATPase activity and phosphate incorporation were obtained. Under the assay conditions used here A-CAT exhibited an ATPase activity of 0.022 ± 0.002 s−1 and a kinase activity of 0.047 ± 0.004 s−1 and 0.101 ± 0.0029 s−1 toward MBP and MH-3, respectively. MHCK A exhibited a kinase activity of 0.19 ± 0.033 s−1 toward MBP. Autophosphorylation assays contained 14.5 μm A-CAT-5xA and were carried out in kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP at a specific activity of 500 cpm/pmol of ATP. Aliquots of 20 μl were taken at 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Blue the A-CAT-5xA band was excised and counted in scintillation fluid to measure incorporation of 32P. For some assays A-CAT-5xA was dephosphorylated by treatment at room temperature for 1 h with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase-agarose beads (Sigma) or for 5 h with 10 units of SAP (Fermentas). A total of 200 μg of A-CAT-RRGT or A-CAT-RRGS were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant PKA catalytic subunit (Active Motif) for 30 min at 22 °C in kinase buffer. Following dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, kinase assays were carried out using the MH-3 peptide as described above. Data were fit to a hyperbolic equation by nonlinear regression analysis using the program SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.). Where shown, mean ± S.D. are derived from 3 to 6 determinations. A-CAT truncated at Leu809 (A-CAT-Δ809) was concentrated to 230 μm using a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Ultrafree-4 Centrifugal Filtration Unit (Millipore). The His tag was cleaved off by incubation overnight at 4 °C with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen), and the protease was removed by chromatography over a His-Bind column. A 1-μl aliquot of A-CAT-Δ809 was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2 m NaH2PO4, and 18% (w/v) PEG 8000. Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. Crystals of A-CAT-Δ809 appeared after a few days and grew to their maximum size in 10 days. Crystals were flash frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen after dipping them in a cryoprotectant solution that consisted of the mother liquor component and 25% (w/v) ethylene glycol. A 1.9-Å dataset for the A-CAT-Δ809 crystal was collected at the F1 beamline at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). The dataset was processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK or with the HKL2000 suite program (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C. Sweet R. Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and solved by molecular replacement with the initially solved A-CAT structure (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as the search model with PHASER software (37McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). CNS and REFMAC5 were used to build and refine the final model (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Ab initio structure prediction methods were used to generate a three-dimensional model of the C-terminal tail sequence (C-tail) with Thr825 at the Pi-pocket or the active site. Residues 806 to 830 were first added in an extended conformation (±135° φ/ψ angles) to the crystal structure of A-CAT (Protein Data Bank code 3LLA, chain B). The side chains of the starting model were prepacked using the Rosetta-fixed backbone design/packing application (using the parameters -ex1, -ex2, use_input_sc). A three-stage modeling protocol was then applied. In the first step the FloppyTail protocol was used to generate 5500 structural models of the C-tail using a Rosetta fragment library for 3-mer (40Kleiger G. Saha A. Lewis S. Kuhlman B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2009; 139: 957-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the second step, the positions of residues 823–830 from the two top scoring FloppyTail models were refined by applying the FlexPepDock protocol, which accurately models the conformation of peptides that fold upon binding to their receptors (41Raveh B. London N. Schueler-Furman O. Proteins. 2010; 78: 2029-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the last step, the Rosetta loop refinement protocol over residues 806–824 was used to connect the FlexPepDock model with the rest of the FloppyTail model (42Wang C. Bradley P. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To model the C-tail at the Pi-pocket, the protocol was constrained to force the phosphate group of Thr825 to create similar hydrogen bonds and salt bridges as the original Pi molecule solved in the crystal structure. To model the C-tail at the active site a soft constraint was imposed in the initial low resolution step that required that the Cβ atom of Thr825 be within 3–6 Å of the Cβ atom of Asp756, which is presumed to act as the catalytic base in the phosphotransferase reaction (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This constraint was removed in the subsequent high-resolution modeling steps of all three stages. An ATP molecule at the active site was included, starting from its orientation in the A-CAT-D766A structure (PDB code 3LMI). A-CAT is a catalytically active fragment of MHCK A that encompasses the α-kinase domain (residues 552–805) as well as part of the flexible linker that connects the α-kinase domain to the WD-repeat domain (residues 806–841) (Fig. 1A) (22Côté G.P. Luo X. Murphy M.B. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6846-6849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the x-ray crystal structure of A-CAT, residues 806–841 lack defined electron density and thus form a disordered C-terminal tail (C-tail) (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Truncation of the C-tail at residue 831 did not alter the kinase activity of A-CAT, but truncation at residues 823 or 809 resulted in the loss of 90–95% of kinase activity (Fig. 1B, left panel). The severe loss of kinase activity was observed with both myelin basic protein and the MH-3 peptide, which corresponds to the Thr2029 site in the myosin II tail, as substrate (24Medley Q.G.

In the absence of a protein or peptide substrate A-CAT exhibits a basal rate of ATPase activity (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Truncation of the C-tail at residues 823 or 809 reduced the ATPase activity of A-CAT by ∼95% (Fig. 1B, right panel). A section of the C-tail between residues 823 and 831 is therefore required for both the kinase and ATPase activities of A-CAT. A multiple sequence alignment of the C-tail regions of D. discoideum MHCK A-D and AK1 reveals a conserved Gly-Thr-hydrophobic motif (Fig. 2A). In A-CAT the conserved threonine residue is Thr825, which lies within the region defined by truncation analysis (residues 823–831) as being critical for A-CAT activity. Thr825 has been identified by mass spectrometry as one of six autophosphorylation sites in A-CAT (23Ye Q. Crawley S.W. Yang Y. Côté G.P. Jia Z. Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The other five autophosphorylation sites (Ser553, Thr612, Thr613, Thr614, and Thr634) are located within the N-terminal lobe. Mutation of Ser553, Thr612, Thr613, Thr614, and Thr634 to alanine (A-CAT-5xA) had little effect on the kinase or ATPase activities of A-CAT (Fig. 2B). In contrast, mutation of Thr825 to alanine decreased kinase and ATPase activities by 95% (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that autophosphorylation of Thr825 is critical for the activity of A-CAT. Mutation of Thr825 to glutamic acid or aspartic acid resulted in the loss of ∼90 and 75% of kinase activity, respectively, indicating that a negatively charged residue only weakly compensates for the loss of phosphothreonine (Fig. 2B). A mutant with serine in place of Thr825 also exhibited low kinase and ATPase activity (Fig. 2B). Serine residues are poor substrates for A-CAT, suggesting that the low activity may reflect the incomplete autophosphorylation of Ser825 (21Luo X. Crawley S.W. Steimle P.A. Egelhoff T.T. Cote G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17836-17843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Crawley S.W. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1784: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Incubation of A-CAT-5xA with [γ-32P]ATP resulted in the incorporation of less than 0.1 mol of phosphate/mol (Fig. 3A). The amount of phosphate incorporated into A-CAT-5xA increased to 0.2 mol/mol after a 1-h treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and to 0.33 mol/mol after a 5-h treatment with SAP (Fig. 3A). We interpret these results to indicate that Thr825 is nearly fully phosphorylated in bacterially expressed A-CAT-5xA and that it is only partially dephosphorylated even after extensive phosphatase treatment. The phosphorylated state of Thr825 was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Kinase assays showed that SAP treatment produced only a small decrease in the kinase activity of A-CAT-5xA (Fig. 3B). It was reasoned that this may reflect the ability of A-CAT-5xA to rapidly autophosphorylate Thr825 in the kinase assay (Fig. 3A). When kinase assays were carried out at 4 °C to reduce the rate of Thr825 autophosphorylation, a significant decrease in the activity of SAP-treated A-CAT-5xA could be detected (Fig. 3B). These results are consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of Thr825 is required for A-CAT activity. The ability of Thr825 phosphorylation to activate A-CAT-5xA was further examined by mutating Gln822 and Gln823 to arginine to convert Thr825 into a PKA phosphorylation site (i.e. QQGT to RRGT). A mutant with serine in place of Thr825 (RRGS) was also created. A-CAT-RRGS exhibited a lower initial activity than A-CAT-RRGT, which is consistent with serine being a poorer autophosphorylation site than threonine. Incubation with PKA and MgATP increased the activity of A-CAT-RRGT by 60% and A-CAT-RRGS by more than 3-fold (Fig. 3C). The increase in activity was accompanied by the incorporation of 0.25 mol of Pi/mol into A-CAT-RRGS by PKA. Control experiments showed that the activity of A-CAT-5xA was not altered by incubation with PKA and that the MH-3 peptide was not a substrate for PKA (Fig. 3C). This result provides additional evidence that A-CAT activity depends on the phosphorylation of the Thr825 (or Ser825) site in the C-tail. To examine whether autophosphorylation of Thr825 is required for the activation of full-length MHCK A, wild-type MHCK A and T825A and T825E mutants were expressed in D. discoideum as FLAG-tagged proteins (Fig. 4A). The kinase activities of the MHCK A T825A and T825E mutants were less than 10% that of wild-type MHCK A (Fig. 4B). This shows that autophosphorylation of Thr825 is a necessary step in the activation of MHCK A. The effect of moving Thr825 closer to the α-kinase domain was examined by deleting three (A-CAT-Δ3) or six (A-CAT-Δ6) residues from the intervening linker sequence (Fig. 4C). A-CAT-Δ3 and A-CAT-Δ6 were considerably less active than A-CAT, indicating that the function of Thr825 depends to some extent on its position within the C-tail (Fig. 4C). The conserved nature of the Gly-Thr-hydrophobic sequence suggested that the C-tails of AK1 and MHCK B-D may have functions comparable with that of MHCK A (Fig. 2A). To test this possibility the C-tail of MHCK B (residues 326–354) was fused to the C terminus of A-CAT truncated at Leu805 (Fig. 4C). The C-tail of MHCK B fully rescued both the kinase and ATPase activity of the truncated A-CAT (Fig. 4C). This result supports the view that the MHCK C-tail regions perform analogous regulatory functions. A-CAT truncated at residue 809 (A-CAT-Δ809) was purified in yields comparable with that of A-CAT, showing that the loss of the C-tail does not compromise the stability of the core α-kinase domain. Indeed, A-CAT-Δ809 formed diffraction quality crystals much more readily than A-CAT, indicating that the C-tail impairs crystal formation. The x-ray crystal structure of A-CAT-Δ809 was solved to a resolution of 1.8 Å (Fig. 5A and s"

These proteins were assembled with the natural chromophore biliverdin (BV), with phycoerythrobilin (PEB), which lacks a double bond in the ring C-D-connecting methine bridge, and with synthetic bilin derivatives in which the ring C-D-connecting methine bridge is locked. All PEB and locked chromophore adducts are photoinactive. According to fluorescence quantum yields, the adducts may be divided into four different groups: wild type BV adducts exhibiting a weak fluorescence, mutant BV adducts with about 10-fold enhanced fluorescence, adducts with locked chromophores in which the fluorescence quantum yields are around 0.02, and PEB adducts with a high quantum yield of around 0.5. Thus, the strong fluorescence of the PEB adducts is not reached by the locked chromophore adducts, although the photoconversion energy dissipation pathway is blocked. We therefore suggest that ring D of the bilin chromophore, which contributes to the extended π-electron system of the locked chromophores, provides an energy dissipation pathway that is independent on photoconversion.

Phytochromes are photoreceptors of plants, bacteria, and fungi, which are most sensitive to red and far-red/near-infrared light. A typical phytochrome consists of an N-terminal chromophore module that bears the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim (1Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R674-R677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), GAF (cGMP phosphodiesterase, adenylyl cyclase and transcriptional factor FhaA (2Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar)), and PHY (phytochrome-specific) domains and a C-terminal output module with a histidine kinase or a histidine kinase-like domain (Fig. 1). Each phytochrome protein subunit carries one bilin chromophore that is covalently bound to a conserved cysteine residue. The PAS/GAF/PHY chromophore module is sufficient for chromophore incorporation and full spectral activity (3Noack S. Michael N. Rosen R. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4164-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Light absorption triggers the photoconversion between the so-called Pr 3The abbreviations used are: Pr, red-absorbing form of phytochrome; Pfr, far-red-absorbing form of phytochrome; BV, biliverdin; PΦB, phytochromobilin; PCB, phycocyanobilin; PEB, phycoerythrobilin; Agp, Agrobacterium tumefaciens phytochrome; Cph, cyanobacterial phytochrome. and Pfr forms, which have respective absorption maxima in the red and far-red spectral regions. The first step in the photoconversion is a Z to E isomerization around the double bond between pyrrole rings C and D of the bilin chromophore. In darkness, both forms are kinetically stable or have rather long interconversion times (4Rockwell N.C. Lagarias J.C. Chem. Phys. Chem. 2010; 11: 1172-1180Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The type of bilin chromophore differs between species. In cyanobacteria, two chromophore binding modes are realized: the natural chromophore of the Cph1/CphA-type phytochromes is PCB, whereas CphB-type phytochromes incorporate BV. This bilin also constitutes the chromophore of most bacterial and probably all fungal phytochromes. A third bilin, PΦB, serves as a chromophore in plant phytochromes. In BV-binding phytochromes the chromophore binding cysteine residue lies in the N-terminal part of the PAS domain, whereas PCB- and PΦB-binding phytochromes have their chromophore-binding cysteine in the GAF domain (5Lamparter T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 573: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Apart from this major difference, the chromophore pockets of BV- and PCB-binding phytochromes are very similar as judged from the x-ray structures of recently crystallized representatives (6Wagner J.R. Brunzelle J.S. Forest K.T. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2005; 438: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 7Wagner J.R. Zhang J. Brunzelle J.S. Vierstra R.D. Forest K.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2010; 11: 1090-1105Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments also show that amino acid residues of the chromophore pocket are highly conserved. BV, which is synthesized from heme by a one-enzyme reaction, is regarded as the most ancient chromophore. PΦB and PCB are synthesized via additional enzymes that reduce one and two double bonds of BV, respectively. These reductions result in a less conjugated system and hence in a blue shift of the respective adducts. The absorption maxima of typical BV-, PΦB-, and PCB-binding phytochromes are at 700, 665, and 655 nm, respectively. This kind of spectral tuning has probably evolved as an adaptation to a chlorophyll a-rich environment. Many variations of the prototypical phytochrome have been described. Several cyanobacterial phytochrome-like proteins utilize, for example, the GAF domains for chromophore binding, which they have probably inherited from a typical phytochrome (12Montgomery B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Domain rearrangements have also been described for fungal and bacterial BV-binding phytochromes (13Blumenstein A. Vienken K.

Photosynth. Res. 2008; 97: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Most phytochromes have a Pr ground state, but bacterial phytochromes with a Pfr ground state, so called bathy phytochromes, have been found in Bradyrhizobium sp., Rhodopseudomonas palustris (15Giraud E.

Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17Tasler R. Moises T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as well as other rhizobial species (18Rottwinkel G. Oberpichler I. Lamparter T. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 5124-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Early studies on plant phytochromes have shown that the fluorescence quantum yield of Pr is low at ambient temperature but is increased significantly under cryoconditions where photoconversion is blocked (19Sineshchekov V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 125-164Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Adducts that fluoresce strongly at ambient temperature have been obtained by chromophore replacement. Phycoerythrobilin (PEB), a bilin chromophore of the phycoerythrin antenna pigment of cyanobacteria and red algae, lacks the C15=C16 double bond between pyrrole rings C and D (Fig. 2). This bilin is incorporated into apophytochromes, but the adducts are photoinactive and highly fluorescent (20Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 870-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A quantum yield of 0.82 has been reported for the PEB adduct of cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1 (20Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 870-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Feeding PEB to plant mutants with an impaired chromophore biosynthesis enabled the detection of phytochrome by fluorescence microscopy within the cell (20Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 870-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Böse G. Schwille P. Lamparter T. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2013-2021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and studies on dimer subunit interactions of Cph1 by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (22Otto H. Lamparter T. Borucki B. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5885-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An adduct of P. aeruginosa phytochrome PaBphP with 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin, which also lacks the ring C-D-connecting double bond, is also fluorescent (17Tasler R. Moises T. Frankenberg-Dinkel N. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 1927-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The inhibition of photoconversion by low temperature or chromophore replacement correlates with an increase of Pr fluorescence, indicating that photoisomerization provides a major route of energy dissipation. Fluorescence is also increased in phytochrome mutants with impaired photoconversion; the Y166H mutant of cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1, in which photoconversion is inhibited, has a fluorescence quantum yield of >0.1 (23Fischer A.J. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17334-17339Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The homologous mutation resulted in the same fluorescence increase in plant phytochromes but not in BV-binding bacterial phytochromes (24Rockwell N.C. Shang L. Martin S.S. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6123-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Increased fluorescence has been reported for mutants of Deinococcus radiodurans and P. aeruginosa phytochromes DrBphP and PaBphP, respectively, in which a highly conserved Asp residue (Asp-207 in DrBphP) was replaced by Ala (9Yang X. Kuk J. Moffat K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14715-14720Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 25Wagner J.R. Zhang J. von Stetten D. Günther M. Murgida D.H.

The D197A mutant of the DrBphP PAS/GAF fragment has been used for directed evolution employing DNA shuffling. A 13-residue mutant resulting from that approach had an increased fluorescence quantum yield of 0.07. This variant has been successfully employed as a marker protein with advantageous properties in mammalian organs (26Shu X. Royant A. Lin M.Z. Aguilera T.A. Lev-Ram V. Steinbach P.A. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2009; 324: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Adducts have been prepared with locked chromophores in which rings C and D are held in a fixed geometry by an additional carbon bridge. They cannot undergo photoconversion and are thus comparable with the above mentioned PEB and 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin adducts. However, such adducts with locked chromophores have longer wavelength absorption maxima because of their extended π-system, a property that is in line with the demand for novel fluorescent dyes. In this article, we have characterized the fluorescence properties of several different adducts with bacterial phytochromes and locked chromophores. These studies show that the lock increases fluorescence significantly but not to the same extent as the loss of a C15=C16 double bond. This difference suggests that the D ring provides a radiationless energy dissipation pathway. All proteins (Cph1, Agp1, Agp1-V249C, Agp1-M15-D197A, Agp1-H280A, Agp2, and Agp2_Phy1) were expressed in Escherichia coli Xl1blue or BL21(DE3) cells. The expression vectors encode for proteins with a C-terminal poly-His tag. Expression vectors pF10.his, pAg1, and pAg2, which encode for Cph1, Agp1, and Agp2, respectively, are described elsewhere (27Lamparter T. Esch H. Cove D. Hartmann E.

An expression vector for the Agp1-H280A mutant was made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The expression vector pAg2-Phy1 encodes for a domain-swap mutant termed Agp2_Phy1. In this protein, the PHY domain of Agp2 (amino acids 315–501) is replaced by the PHY domain of Agp1 (amino acid 315 to 495). The vector pAgp2-Phy1 was cloned as follows. The sequence coding for the PHY domain of Agp1 was amplified by PCR by using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Espo, Finland) and the following phosphorylated primers: BZ22.1 5′-ACCATCAACCACGCCCATGC-3′ and BZ22.2 5′-CTCGCTGTGGTGGAACGCCAC-3′. Then, another PCR reaction was performed with the pET21b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI)-based Agp2 expression plasmid, pAgp2 (3Noack S. Michael N. Rosen R. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4164-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), using the primers BZ21.1 5′-TTGATGGCAGGCGAAAGAGAGC-3′ and BZ21.2 5′-GTCGAGGCGGCGCTTCTGCTTC-3′. In this reaction, the entire plasmid DNA except for the sequence coding the PHY domain of Agp2 was amplified. Both blunt end PCR products were ligated with the T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) overnight at 15 °C (32Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and transformed directly into the E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3). The correctness of the new expression vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, E. coli cells containing the desired plasmid were grown in LB medium with ampicillin at 37 °C until the A600 nm reached about 0.6. Then specific protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (20 μg/ml). The cultures were further grown at 16 °C until the A600 nm reached about 3. Thereafter, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with basic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8), and extracted with basic buffer. Proteins of the soluble fraction were precipitated with ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. The His-tagged phytochrome proteins were then purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. Following elution from the column with a buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, the phytochrome-containing fractions were again subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the protein was finally suspended in basic buffer.

The exact stock concentrations were estimated by measuring the absorption of the samples diluted in methanol/HCl. The following extinction coefficients (at λmax) were used: ϵBV = 30,800 m−1cm−1 (41McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Academic Press, New York1979Google Scholar), ϵPEB = 25,200 m−1cm−1 (42Chapman D.J. Cole W.J. Siegelman H.W. J. Am. Chem.

The values for locked chromophores were obtained from exactly weighed, pure, solid material after dissolution in methanol/HCl. Chromophore assembly was initiated by adding 2–3 μl of chromophore from the stock solution to 1 ml of protein, which was adjusted to about 10 μm to achieve an equimolar concentration of protein and chromophore. The assembly process was followed by measuring absorption spectra at different time points until no further absorption changes were evident. Thereafter, free chromophore was separated from the protein by using desalting columns (NAP-10 columns, GE Healthcare). Most if not all chromophore remained bound to the protein after the separation. The columns were equilibrated with basic buffer, and 1 ml of holoprotein was loaded on the column. The flow-through was discarded. Thereafter, 1.5 ml of basic buffer was applied on the column, and the flow-through, containing the protein, was collected. Free chromophore was not eluted because of its low molecular weight and its tight interaction with the matrix. Spectra were recorded before and after the separation. All UV-visible measurements were performed at 20 °C using a JASCO V-550 photometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded by using a Yobin-Yvon FluoroMax2 spectrofluorimeter at 20 °C. To avoid cross-talk and scattering artifacts, the emission monochromator was shielded with an appropriate cut-off filter (RG570, RG665, or RG695, thickness of 3 mm; Schott, Mainz, Germany). Slit widths of excitation and emission were set between 2 and 7 nm according to the fluorescence intensities. Corrected excitation and emission spectra were obtained considering the spectral characteristics of the lamp, the filter, and the detector. The fluorescence quantum yield Φ of each sample was calculated by integrating its emission spectrum and referring it to fluorescein as a standard (Φ = 0.95 (43Lakowicz, J. R., (1999) Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, 2nd Ed., New York.Google Scholar)). Agp2-BV was irradiated with far-red light (780 nm from a light-emitting diode, irradiance ∼200 μmol photon m−2 s−1) and fully converted to Pr before measuring the fluorescence. Because of the free mobility of the pyrrole rings, the fluorescence of free bilin molecules is very weak (44Alekabi H. Tegmolarsson I.M. Braslavsky S.E. Holzwarth A.R. Schaffner K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1986; 44: 433-440Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 45Falk H. The Chemistry of Linear Oligopyrroles and Bile Pigments. Springer Verlag, Berlin1989Crossref Google Scholar). Incorporation into the chromophore pocket of a biliprotein such as phycocyanin or phytochrome restricts this mobility and results in an increase of the fluorescence quantum yield. We initially measured the fluorescence properties of free chromophores under the buffer conditions that were later been used for measurements of phytochrome adducts (Table 1). The fluorescence of BV and the locked chromophore 15Za was not measurable under these conditions, we assume that the fluorescence quantum yields are below 10−6. The other chromophores had quantum yields in the range of 10−5 to 10−4, and the quantum yield of free PEB was around 10−3. Because in the chromophore pocket of phytochromes the bilins are in the protonated form, the fluorescence of free chromophores was also measured after acidification by HCl. This treatment changed the absorption and fluorescence properties of all tested chromophores. As stated by Falk (45Falk H. The Chemistry of Linear Oligopyrroles and Bile Pigments. Springer Verlag, Berlin1989Crossref Google Scholar), acidification of bilins is generally accompanied by a red shift of the absorption maximum. All chromophores in the present study, with the exception of BV, follow this rule, although the red shifts of 5Za15Ea and 5Zs15Za are only 3 and 13 nm, respectively. The blue shift of BV upon acidification is in contrast to other work (46Petrier C. Dupuy C. Jardon P. Gautron R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981; 22: 855-858Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) but might be related to the aqueous solvent used in the present control measurements.TABLE 1Absorption and fluorescence characteristics of free chromophores in aqueous buffer at pH 7.8 and after the addition of 0.5 m HCl from a 10 m stock solution at pH 1ChromophoreAbsorption λmaxExcitation λmaxEmission λmaxStokes shiftФnmnmnmnmFluorescein490488574860.95PEB, pH 7.8531535579440.0011PEB, pH 1587580613330.0016BV, pH 7.8673NDNDBV, pH 1629NDND15Za, pH 7.8618NDND15Za, pH 1678NDND15Ea, pH 7.8631632708760.00000315Ea, pH 1679640683430.0000135Za15Ea, pH 7.865365466170.0000265Za15Ea, pH 1656655672170.0000065Ea15Ea, pH 7.8609647669220.000645Ea15Ea, pH 1644640668280.000895Zs15Za, pH 7.8693660674140.0000645Zs15Za, pH 1706NDND Open table in a new tab The fluorescence quantum yields of the locked chromophores are generally higher than that of BV but lower than that of PEB. The fluorescence increase over BV is most likely due to the lock and the enhanced rigidity. Note that the introduction of a lock does not reduce mobility completely; it is assumed that seven-member rings still provide some flexibility (47Kufer W. Scheer H. Holzwarth A.R. Isr. J. Chem. 1983; 23: 233-240Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the same is probably true for eight-member rings. Acidification led to a (slight) fluorescence increase of three chromophores, whereas two showed a decrease. Hence, there was no general pattern for the effect of protonation on fluorescence yields. As a reference for our new phytochrome chromophore adducts, we measured absorption and fluorescence spectra of the PEB adducts of Cph1 and Agp1 (Fig. 3). In our hands the quantum yield of PEB-Cph1 was 0.54 (Table 2) and thus slightly lower than the 0.82 value reported by others (20Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 870-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 48Borucki B. Otto H. Rottwinkel G. Hughes J. Heyn M.P. Lamparter T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13684-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The bacterial phytochrome Agp1 contains BV as a natural chromophore, bound via the vinyl side chain of ring A to the protein; the protein can also incorporate PEB into its chromophore pocket. However, PEB, PCB, and PΦB, which carry an ethylidene side chain on ring A, are incorporated in a noncovalent manner, and the PEB adduct has an atypical, broad absorption spectrum (28Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mutant V249C of Agp1 incorporates PCB (30Lamparter T. Michael N.

Opitz, personal communication. in a covalent manner. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the PEB-Agp1-V249C adduct (Fig. 3)4 are almost indistinguishable from those of PEB-Cph1. The excitation and emission maxima for the Cph1 and Agp1-V249C adducts lie at 579/580 and 590/588 nm (Table 2), respectively. Hence, the broad spectrum of the PEB adduct with wild type Agp1 (28Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) results from the noncovalent binding mode. The fluorescence quantum yield of PEB-Agp1-V249C is 0.67 (Table 2), which is even higher than that of our PEB-Cph1 control.TABLE 2Absorption and fluorescence characteristics of the phytochrome adducts used in the present studyChromophore AdductAbsorption λmaxExcitation λmaxEmission λmaxStokes shiftФnmnmnmnmFluorescein490488574860.95PEB-Cph1580579590110.5369PEB-Agp1-V249C58058058880.6706BV-Agp170370070110.0002BV-Agp2703703713100.0013BV-Agp1-M15-D197A700684714300.0022BV-Agp1-H280A70170571380.0012BV-Agp2_Phy1693686711250.001615Za-Agp171571471840.013115Za-Agp271371271860.014015Za-Agp1-M15-D197A71371571610.015815Za-Agp1-H280A71470571380.012315Za-Agp2_Phy174271571500.002415Ea-Agp173671272190.00275Za15Ea-Agp1685682696140.01965Za15Ea-Agp270470270750.00065Ea15Ea-Agp1689670697270.00155Ea15Ea-Agp2701683697140.00225Zs15Za-Agp171170971230.00995Zs15Za-Agp270770571270.011815Ea-Agp2749NDND Open table in a new tab As expected, the fluorescence of wild type phytochromes Agp1 and Agp2 assembled with the natural chromophore BV is very weak (Fig. 4). The fluorescence of both adducts was measured in the Pr form, because thus far no Pfr fluorescence has been detected (19Sineshchekov V.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1228: 125-164Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The bathy phytochrome Agp2 converts into Pfr in darkness; hence this sample was photoconverted to Pr by 780 nm light prior to the fluorescence measurements. We obtained quantum yields for BV-Agp1 and BV-Agp2 of 0.0002 and 0.0013, respectively (Table 2). The BV adduct of Agp1 showed not only the weakest fluorescence of all, but excitation and emission maxima were also indistinguishable from each other. Several phytochrome mutants have been described that exhibit inefficient photoconversion combined with an elevated fluorescence quantum yield (23Fischer A.J. Lagarias J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the Agp1-M15-D197A mutant, the highly conserved Asp residue at position 197, which is located close to rings B and C of the tetrapyrrole chromophore, is mutated to Ala.

Much of this drive comes from a new generation of industry CEOs who are committed to sustainability ( 1 ). Sustainability naturally includes a view on what to do with products at the end of their lives, and the best modern products are designed to make recycling easier. However, there is much that is not deemed to be worth recycling and goes into landfill ( 2 ). Population increase and changes in consumption patterns combined with the inefficient use of materials push us toward a crisis point.

Endogenous IP3Rs provide very appealing tools for studying the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in intact mammalian cells because, upon activation, they are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded. Using mass spectrometry, we previously examined the ubiquitination of IP3R1 in αT3-1 pituitary gonadotrophs and found that IP3R1 ubiquitination is highly complex, with receptors being modified at multiple sites by monoubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains formed through both Lys-48 and Lys-63 linkages (Sliter, D. A., Kubota, K., Kirkpatrick, D. S., Alzayady, K. J., Gygi, S. P., and Wojcikiewicz, R. J. H. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 35319–35328). Here, we have extended these studies to determine whether IP3R2 and IP3R3 are similarly modified and if ubiquitination is cell type-dependent. Using mass spectrometry and linkage-specific ubiquitin antibodies, we found that all IP3R types are subject to ubiquitination at approximately the same locations and that, independent of cell type, IP3Rs are modified by monoubiquitin and Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, although in differing proportions. Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP3R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP3R degradation. Together, these data provide unique insight into the complexities of ubiquitination of an endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway substrate in unperturbed mammalian cells. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP3Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) 2The abbreviations used are: UPP, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R, IP3 receptor; AQUA, absolute quantification; GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; Ub, ubiquitin. is critical to cell homeostasis because it mediates the degradation of key proteins involved in fundamental cellular processes and allows for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation, a facet of the UPP that disposes of aberrant or unrequired proteins from the ER lumen and membrane (1Jung T. Catalgol B. Grune T. Mol. Aspects Med. 2009; 30: 191-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 2Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Proteins targeted for degradation by the UPP are first ubiquitinated and then shuttled to the 26 S proteasome, a cytosolic protein complex that recognizes, unfolds, and degrades ubiquitinated substrates (3Finley D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue in a target protein, is typically mediated by the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase (4Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). Repetition of this process can result in multiple monoubiquitination through attachment of additional ubiquitin moieties to different lysines within the target protein, or in the formation of ubiquitin chains through attachment of ubiquitin to any of seven lysines within ubiquitin itself (Lys-6, Lys-11, Lys-27, Lys-29, Lys-33, Lys-48, and Lys-63) or to the N-terminal methionine (5Komander D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 937-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The fate of a ubiquitinated protein is thought to be determined by the type of ubiquitin linkage associated with it. For example, it is generally accepted that proteins tagged with Lys-48-linked chains are targeted to the proteasome for degradation, whereas Lys-63-linked chains mediate a variety of events (e.g. the DNA damage response and protein trafficking) (6Ikeda F. Dikic I. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 7Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem.

However, this dogma is being challenged, for example, with new data indicating that ubiquitin chains utilizing lysines other than Lys-48 can contribute to proteasomal degradation (9Kirkpatrick D.S.

Ubiquitin can be removed from proteins through the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which can serve to reverse the effects of ubiquitination (13Love K.R. Catic A. Schlieker C. Ploegh H.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 14Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In recent years, we have examined inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R) processing by the UPP in intact cells (15Wojcikiewicz R.J. Pearce M.M. Sliter D.A. Wang Y. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). IP3Rs are large (∼260 kDa), ubiquitously expressed, ER membrane proteins that form tetrameric IP3- and Ca2+-regulated channels that govern Ca2+ release from the ER and are pivotal in mammalian cell signaling (16Foskett J.K.

Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1426-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). There are three IP3R types (termed IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3) that form both homo- and heterotetramers and that have slightly different properties and markedly different tissue distributions. Remarkably, activation of certain cell-surface receptors that persistently elevate IP3 concentration causes a decrease in cellular IP3R levels (15Wojcikiewicz R.J. Pearce M.M. Sliter D.A. Wang Y.

The value of examining ubiquitination in the context of intact cells, which contain a full complement of ubiquitinating enzymes and DUBs, rather than in vitro has been illustrated by some recent studies. For example, it was reported that in vitro ubiquitination of cyclin B1 by the E3 anaphase-promoting complex and the E2 UbcH10 resulted in the formation of ubiquitin chains linked though Lys-48, Lys-63, and Lys-11 (9Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, utilization of UbcH10 plus UBE2S, which is the more physiological E2 module for the anaphase-promoting complex, in vitro and in vivo facilitated the specific catalysis of Lys-11-linked ubiquitin chains (11Williamson A.

Likewise, in vitro construction of ubiquitin chains using various E2-E3 pairs revealed the formation of non-degradable forked ubiquitin chains (28Kim H.T. Kim K.P. Lledias F. Kisselev A.F.

Kim K.P. Uchiki T. Gygi S.P. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Finally, in vitro, epidermal growth factor receptors were modified by just monoubiquitin (30Mosesson Y. Shtiegman K. Katz M. Zwang Y. Vereb G. Szollosi J. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

In each case, achieving more physiological conditions resulted in apparently more physiological results. IP3Rs provide very appealing tools for studying the UPP under physiological conditions because endogenous receptors can be rapidly ubiquitinated through stimulation of endogenous signaling pathways in intact cells. Thus, we have employed a mass spectrometric technique called AQUA (for absolute quantification) (32Kirkpatrick D.S. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), endothelin-1, cholecystokinin, carbachol, and N-ethylmaleimide were purchased from Sigma, and MG132 was purchased from BIOMOL. Reagents for immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and immunoblotting were obtained as described previously (22Wojcikiewicz R.J. Xu Q. Webster J.M. Alzayady K. Gao C. J. Biol.

The plasmids used encoded FLAG-UbWT (ubiquitin tagged at the N terminus with a FLAG epitope; a kind gift from I. Dikic) and FLAG-tagged ubiquitin mutants FLAG-UbK48R and FLAG-UbK63R, in which Lys residues were mutated to Arg residues by site-directed mutagenesis. αT3-1, Rat1, AR42J, and SHSY5Y cells were grown to confluence in 15-cm diameter dishes, and 24 h prior to harvesting, Rat1 cells were cultured in serum-free medium. After stimulation, cells were harvested by the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (3–6 ml/dish; 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, and 0.2 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor, pH 8.0). Lysates were then incubated with 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 min to inhibit DUBs, quenched by the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with occasional mixing, and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, clarified lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation for 1–3 min at 3000 × g, washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, resuspended in gel loading buffer, incubated at 100 °C for 3 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and either Coomassie Blue-stained (rocked in 10% acetic acid, 40% ethanol, and 2.5 g/liter Coomassie Brilliant Blue R for 1 h) and destained (rinsed with 10% acetic acid and 40% ethanol for 30 min) or transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted and analyzed as described previously (22Wojcikiewicz R.J.

Trypsin digestion of ubiquitinated proteins generates peptides that have a covalently attached diglycine motif (resulting from digestion of ubiquitin between Arg-74 and Gly-75) at the modified lysine and a missed lysine cleavage at that lysine (32Kirkpatrick D.S.

For IP3R ubiquitination site identification, tandem mass spectra were searched using SeaQuest with a variable mass addition of 114.0429 Da in lysines to match the diglycine signature, and matches corresponding to IP3R ubiquitination sites were validated based on the mass accuracy of the precursor ion and manual inspection of the tandem MS spectra. For AQUA analysis, the ion-extracted chromatogram was drawn with 10-ppm mass accuracy, and cell-derived ubiquitin peptides were quantified from the ratio of the area under the curve for these peptides versus that for ubiquitin-derived AQUA peptides (9Kirkpatrick D.S.

Ubiquitin chains (purchased from BIOMOL) and cell lysates were mixed with gel loading buffer and incubated at 100 °C for 3 min prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Antibody dilutions were adjusted to produce equal signals from the chain standards to allow for subsequent semiquantitative immunoblotting (∼1:40, ∼1:750, and ∼1:750 for anti-Lys-48, anti-Lys-63, and anti-ubiquitin (FK2) antibodies, respectively). IP3Rs immunopurified from stimulated αT3-1, AR42J, and Rat1 cells were incubated with gel loading buffer at 37 °C for 30 min prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunodepletion, IP3R1 was immunopurified from stimulated αT3-1 cell lysates with anti-IP3R1 antibody. IP3R1 was eluted from anti-IP3R1 antibody by incubation at 37 °C for 90 min in 1% Zwittergent plus the peptide (1 ng/μl) against which the antibody was raised (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and the eluted IP3R subunits were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Lys-63 or anti-Lys-48 antibody plus 2 mg of protein A beads. After centrifugation, portions of the supernatants were incubated with gel loading buffer at 37 °C for 30 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. αT3-1, Rat1, and AR42J cells were grown to confluence in BD Falcon 6-well dishes. After stimulation, cells were harvested in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer, and cell lysates were mixed with gel loading buffer, boiled at 100 °C for 3 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (22Wojcikiewicz R.J.

IP3R immunoreactivity was quantitated using a GeneGnome imager (Syngene). αT3-1 cells were transfected using the NEON transfection system (Invitrogen). Briefly, αT3-1 cells were trypsinized, washed with culture medium and then phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in Buffer R (Invitrogen) at 1.5 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were then mixed with cDNA (15 μg/1.5 × 106 cells), and 100-μl aliquots were electroporated (one pulse, 20 ms, 1.5 kV) and seeded into a well of a BD Falcon 12-well dish. 24 h later, cells were treated with 10 nm GnRH, and cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. In our previous mass spectrometric analysis of IP3R ubiquitination, we examined IP3R1 isolated from GnRH-stimulated αT3-1 cells and found that at least 11 of the 167 lysines in IP3R1 are ubiquitinated (33Sliter D.A.

The bulk of IP3Rs reside in the cytosol and can be divided into three domains: the N-terminal ligand-binding domain, the central regulatory domain, and the C-terminal channel domain that contains six transmembrane helices and the channel pore (amino acids 1–576, 577–2276, and 2277–2749, respectively, for mouse IP3R1) (16Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). All of the ubiquitination sites previously identified (33Sliter D.A. Kubota K.

To determine whether or not IP3R2 and IP3R3 are ubiquitinated similarly to IP3R1, we examined IP3R2 isolated from cholecystokinin-stimulated AR42J cells, which express 86% IP3R2, 12% IP3R1, and 2% IP3R3 (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and endothelin-1-stimulated Rat1 cells, which express ∼50% IP3R1 and ∼50% IP3R3 (23Alzayady K.J. Panning M.M. Kelley G.G. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34530-34537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to define whether IP3R1 ubiquitination is context-dependent, we examined IP3R1 isolated from SHSY5Y cells, which, like αT3-1 cells, contain >99% IP3R1 (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the absence of stimulus, little or no ubiquitin immunoreactivity was associated with IP3Rs from αT3-1, Rat1, AR42J, and SHSY5Y cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). However, upon treatment with the appropriate stimulus, IP3Rs became ubiquitinated, as indicated by the presence of a smear of ubiquitin immunoreactivity beginning at ∼270 kDa and extending upward (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). To identify sites of ubiquitination and for AQUA analysis, regions corresponding to ubiquitinated IP3Rs, excised from analogous Coomassie Blue-stained gels, were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and tandem MS (32Kirkpatrick D.S. Gerber S.A. Gygi S.P. Methods. 2005; 35: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Re-examination of ubiquitinated IP3R1 from αT3-1 cells identified seven ubiquitination sites: Lys-916, Lys-1571, Lys-1771, Lys-1884, Lys-1899, Lys-1901, and Lys-1924 (Fig. 1B). Six of these were identified previously (33Sliter D.A. Kubota K. Kirkpatrick D.S. Alzayady K.J. Gygi S.P. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35319-35328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas one, Lys-1899, is new. Six ubiquitination sites were identified in IP3R2 from AR42J cells: Lys-909, Lys-1589, Lys-1722, Lys-1836, Lys-1864, and Lys-2071 (Fig. 1B). Only one IP3R3 site, Lys-2100, was identified in Rat1 cells. As expected, ubiquitination sites for IP3R1 were also identified in SHSY5Y cells (Lys-1847 and Lys-1870), Rat1 cells (Lys-916, Lys-962, and Lys-1771), and AR42J cells (Lys-916, Lys-1884, and Lys-1901) (Fig. 1B). Although ubiquitination sites were identified for IP3R1 in all cell types, most were found in αT3-1 cells, most likely because IP3R ubiquitination is particularly strong in αT3-1 cells (Fig. 1A), and this allowed for the identification of more ubiquitinated IP3R1 peptides than in the other cell types. Indeed, it seems that the frequency of ubiquitination sites identified in IP3R1, IP3R2, and IP3R3 in the different cell types reflects a combination of the relative abundance of each receptor type and the strength of stimulus-induced IP3R ubiquitination (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, every ubiquitination site identified, regardless of receptor type, is located within the IP3R regulatory domain. More specifically, alignment suggests that, despite sequence differences between the receptor types, ubiquitination sites appear to be clustered in the vicinity of putative surface-exposed loops, i.e. near regulatory or protease-sensitive sites (Fig. 1C). For example, Lys-909 of IP3R2 from AR42J cells aligns near Lys-916 of IP3R1 from αT3-1, AR42J, and Rat1 cells, and these lysines are located near a protease cleavage site (Arg-922 in IP3R1 and between Ser-916 and Ser-934 in IP3R3) (37Yoshikawa F.

J. 2005; 392: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and near PKA phosphorylation sites (Ser-916 and Ser-934 in IP3R3 and Ser-937 in IP3R2) (38Soulsby M.D. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Betzenhauser M.J. Fike J.L. Wagner 2nd, L.E. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25116-25125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Likewise, Lys-1771 of IP3R1 from αT3-1 and Rat1 cells aligns with Lys-1722 of IP3R2 from AR42J cells and is found in a glycine-rich region that, in IP3R1, contains an ATP-binding site (positions 1773–1775) and is thought to form a flexible connector between the cytosolic and membrane portions of IP3Rs (16Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O.D. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Finally, a cluster of ubiquitination sites is found close to the first transmembrane domain (Fig. 1C): Lys-1884, Lys-1899, Lys-1901, and Lys-1924 of IP3R1 and Lys-1836 and Lys-1864 of IP3R2 flank an IP3R1 caspase-3 cleavage site (Asp-1891), an IP3R3 PKA phosphorylation site (Ser-1834), and an IP3R1 protease cleavage site (Arg-1931) (37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The one ubiquitination site identified in IP3R3, Lys-2100, is also located in this region. In summary, all ubiquitination sites identified localize to probable surface-exposed loops in the IP3R regulatory domain, and for at least IP3R1, selection of sites seems to be context-independent because homologous aligning lysines were frequently selected in different cell types (e.g. Lys-1847 in SHSY"

Here we report that priming of cells with agonistic LTβ receptor antibody synergistically enhanced TNF-induced GM-CSF expression. The LTβ priming process was not due to an increase in TNF-mediated nuclear translocation of p65, p65 DNA binding, or NF-κB transactivational activity. The synergistic effect of LTβ priming was not observed with other TNF-responsive genes such as Ccl2 or RelB, which suggested that this effect was not a general increase in TNF signaling. Furthermore, RelB and p65 were both independently recruited to the GM-CSF promoter when cells were primed with LTβ followed by TNF treatment. As a consequence, an increase in both chromatin accessibility and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II were observed to the GM-CSF promoter. Taken together, these findings suggested that LTβ signaling amplified TNF-mediated GM-CSF expression by facilitating chromatin access and the co-recruitment of RNA polymerase II to increase gene transcription. Moreover, the novel priming process described here underscores the complexity of the interactions between the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways.

Taken together, these findings suggested that LTβ signaling amplified TNF-mediated GM-CSF expression by facilitating chromatin access and the co-recruitment of RNA polymerase II to increase gene transcription. Moreover, the novel priming process described here underscores the complexity of the interactions between the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathways. The activation of the NF-κB proteins can be through at least two distinct pathways (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar, 2Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The classical NF-κB pathway involves the activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) 2The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; CHX, cycloheximide; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; LTβ, lymphotoxin β; CHART, chromatin accessibility by real-time PCR; RT-qPCR, real-time qPCR. complex following receptor-ligand interaction. This complex contains three different kinases; IKKα, -β, and -γ, and a major substrate of this kinase complex is IκBα (3Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4073) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκBα results in its ubiquitinylation and degradation. The p65(RelA)/p50 heterodimer is thereby released to translocate into the nucleus to induce gene transcription. In contrast, the activation of the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway does not involve the IκB kinase complex. A major step in the initiation of the alternative pathway is the activation of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (4Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). The NIK kinase phosphorylates the IKKα kinase, which induces the phosphorylation of p100. The phosphorylation of p100 initiates processing where the ankyrin repeats of p100 are removed to generate p52 and exposes the nuclear localization sequences of RelB. The RelB/p52 complex translocates into the nucleus to bind various promoters and facilitates gene transcription. Several factors distinguish the two pathways. The classical pathway requires IKKγ, the degradation of IκBα, and primarily results in the nuclear translocation of p65/p50. In contrast, the alternative pathway involves the activation of NIK, the processing of p100, and the nuclear translocation of RelB/p52. Although several NF-κB responsive genes are activated by both pathways, numerous genes are uniquely activated by only one pathway (2Dejardin E. Droin N.M. Delhase M. Haas E. Cao Y. Makris C. Li Z.W. Karin M. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Immunity. 2002; 17: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 5Lovas A. Radke D. Albrecht D. Yilmaz Z.B. Möller U. Habenicht A.J. Weih F. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 606Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both pathways involve the degradation or processing of inhibitor proteins and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcription factors. Several studies have shown crosstalk between the two pathways. In some cases, the interaction between the two pathways resulted in a negative response (6Jacque E. Tchenio T. Piton G. Romeo P.H. Baud V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14635-14640Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In particular the formation of interchangable dimeric partners has been described with the activation of both pathways. Marienfeld et al. (7Marienfeld R. May M.J. Berberich I. Serfling E. Ghosh S. Neumann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19852-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have shown that the formation of a RelA(p65)/RelB heterodimer resulted in a negative response where the RelB protein was sequestering and inhibiting p65 from binding to DNA. Conversely, other studies have shown the formation of the RelA/RelB heterodimer leading to increased gene transcription (8Saito T. Sasaki C.Y. Rezanka L.J. Ghosh P. Longo D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 391: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the priming of cells with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which activates the classical NF-κB pathway, resulted in the expression of p100 (9Basak S. Kim H. Kearns J.D. Tergaonkar V. O'Dea E. Werner S.L. Benedict C.A. Ware C.F. Ghosh G. Verma I.M. Hoffmann A. Cell. 2007; 128: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The p100 then acts as a fourth IκB protein; it binds and sequesters the TNF-induced p65/p50 heterodimer by forming a trimolecular complex of p100/RelA/p50 (9Basak S. Kim H. Kearns J.D. Tergaonkar V. O'Dea E. Werner S.L. Benedict C.A. Ware C.F. Ghosh G. Verma I.M. Hoffmann A. Cell. 2007; 128: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). If the alternative pathway is activated through the lymphotoxin β (LTβ) receptor in the TNF-primed cells, the processing of p100 results in the release of the p65/p50 to induce gene transcription. The gene expression profile of the TNF-primed/LTβ-activated cells resembles the gene expression profile of TNF-treated cells. Thus, the two NF-κB pathways may interact with each other to influence either positively or negatively the transcription of NF-κB-responsive genes. We have previously shown that the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 resulted in an increase in GM-CSF gene (Csf2) expression (10Sasaki C.Y. Slemenda C.F. Ghosh P. Barberi T.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11218-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation was responsible for the co-recruitment of p300 and RNA polymerase II to the proximal site of the Csf2 gene promoter. Jiang et al. (11Jiang X. Takahashi N. Matsui N. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 919-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have shown that the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 by IKKα was induced by LTβR in mouse fibroblast cells. Based on these findings, we wondered whether signaling through the LTβR could induce the transcription of Csf2 gene as seen with TNF. Here we have shown that the treatment of 3T3 fibroblast cells with agonistic LTβR mAb resulted in the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536; however, this was not sufficient to induce the expression of the Csf2 gene. Priming the cells with LTβR mAb resulted in a synergistic increase of TNF-mediated Csf2 expression. The synergistic enhancement required the activation of NIK and signaling through the alternative NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, nuclear translocation and recruitment of both p65 and RelB to the Csf2 promoter were observed during the LTβR priming of TNF-mediated Csf2 gene expression. These findings suggested that RelB binding to the Csf2 promoter synergistically enhances subsequent phospho-p65-driven gene expression. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and antibiotics as described elsewhere. For the priming experiments, cells were treated with the priming agent for the indicated time interval. The cells were then washed with PBS to remove the priming agent and then treated with either TNF (25 ng/ml, Peprotech) or agonistic mouse LTβR mAb (0.5 μg/ml, Axxora) for the indicated time interval. In some cases, the cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 2 h before priming or treatment. The suppression of Map3k14 and Relb gene expression involved the transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the Map3k14 and RelB shRNAmir plasmids (OpenBiosystems) with the transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (LaRoche). Stable transfectants were obtained through puromycin selection and confirmed by semi-quantitative real-time qPCR. The MAP3K14 expression plasmid was purchased from OpenBiosystems. The NF-κB responsive region of the Csf2 promoter (12Osborne C.S. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized by ligating various oligonucleotides as described by Rouillard et al. (13Rouillard J.M. Lee W. Truan G. Gao X. Zhou X. Gulari E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W176-W180Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). The synthesized gene was then directionally subcloned into the pSEAP2-basic reporter plasmid (Clontech). Cells were transfected with either the pSEAP2-NFκB or pSEAP2-Csf2 reporter constructs with FuGENE6 transfection reagent (LaRoche). After an overnight incubation, the cells were treated with the indicated cytokines. On the following day, the culture supernatant was assessed for SEAP activity (source), and the cells were lysed and β-galactosidase activity was measured (source). The transfection efficiency was assessed with the addition of pCMV-βgal plasmid during the transfection process. The p65 DNA binding assay was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Active Motif). Two micrograms of nuclear extracts from cells treated with the indicated cytokines were analyzed with the kit. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses were performed as previously described (14Sasaki C.Y. Barberi T.J. Ghosh P. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34538-34547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). 10 or 5 μg of whole cell lysate or subcellular (cytoplasmic/nuclear) extracts were separated by PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked and blotted with various antibodies either individually or in combination (see supplemental Table S1 for antibody information). The immune complexes were detected with enhanced chemifluorescence and visualized with the Typhoon scanner (GE Health Science). For immunoprecipitation experiments with NIK antibody, 1 mg of total protein for each sample was precleared with 40 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared samples were incubated with 1 μg of NIK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads and eluted with 1× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen). Immunoblot analyses with the indicated antibody were conducted to detect the presence of specific proteins in the immunoprecipitated samples. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative real-time PCR was performed as previously described (14Sasaki C.Y. Barberi T.J. Ghosh P. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34538-34547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The primer sequences are listed in the supplemental Table S1 (15Cui W. Taub D.D. Gardner K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D805-D809Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation reaction was performed according to the following protocol (16Nelson J.D. Denisenko O. Bomsztyk K. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Chromatin samples were sonicated four times for 10 s at 40 V on ice. Sheared chromatin samples were precleared with 40 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 200 μg of sonicated chromatin was incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies (see supplemental Table S1) overnight at 4 °C. The analysis of fold enrichment was measured by real-time PCR using a previously described method (17Geisberg J.V. Struhl K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e151Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The immunodepletion ChIP assay was conducted according to the following protocol (14Sasaki C.Y. Barberi T.J. Ghosh P. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34538-34547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The CHART assay was performed as previously described (18Brettingham-Moore K.H. Rao S. Juelich T. Shannon M.F. Holloway A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Five million nuclei from treated 3T3 cells were isolated and digested with 100 units of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (New England Biolab) for 5 min at room temperature. Genomic DNA was isolated with the DNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 36 ng of DNA was used for SYBR green real-time PCR (Bio-Rad). The primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S2. The endogenous endonuclease activity was assessed with a control that was not treated with micrococcal nuclease for each treatment. The percent MNase cutting was determined as a percentage of digested versus undigested genomic DNA of each sample by converting the threshold cycle values of the amplification plot to a standard curve generated from with the cloned genomic DNA. The percent accessibility was expressed as follows: percent accessibility = 100 − percent MNase cutting. Previously we have shown that the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 was required for the induction of TNF-mediated GM-CSF expression (10Sasaki C.Y. Slemenda C.F. Ghosh P. Barberi T.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11218-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Jiang et al. (11Jiang X. Takahashi N. Matsui N. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 919-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of p65 at serine 536 by LTβ receptor (LTβR) signaling involved the NIK-IKKα cascade. To investigate the induction of GM-CSF by LTβR signaling, mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells were treated with either TNF or agonistic LTβR mAb for different time intervals. The rapid phosphorylation of p65 was observed within an hour of TNF treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–5). Likewise, the degradation and resynthesis of IκBα occurred during the same time interval. TNF treatment for 3 h also resulted in an increase in p100 and RelB levels. This was in agreement with previous studies that described the degradation and resynthesis of IκBα and the induction of p100 and RelB by the classical NF-κB signaling pathway following TNF treatment (19Bren G.D. Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Pennington K.N. Pobst L.J. Paya C.V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7722-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In contrast, a reduction of p100 was observed 3 h after the treatment with agonistic LTβR mAb (compare lanes 1 and 6–9) with a corresponding increase in nuclear p52 (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9). The treatment with LTβR mAb did not affect the amount of IκBα or RelB. These findings were consistent with the activation of the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway where p100 is processed to generate p52, which translocates into the nucleus (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In contrast to TNF stimulation, a slower gradual increase in phosphorylated p65 was detected following LTβR activation. The results demonstrated that the activation of either the classical (TNF) or the alternative (LTβR) pathway induced the phosphorylation of p65. In contrast to the phosphorylation of p65, TNF, but not LTβR mAb, treatment increased the amount of Csf2 transcripts (Fig. 1C). The kinetics of TNF-mediated Csf2 expression matched that of the phosphorylation of p65. Even with a longer incubation time, the amount of Csf2 induction by LTβR activation did not increase to the level seen with TNF treatment. Although the treatment with the agonistic LTβR mAb resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of p65, a lack of Csf2 induction was observed. These findings suggested that the phosphorylation of p65 was not sufficient for the induction of Csf2 transcription by LTβR signaling. Several studies have shown that the priming of cells with TNF facilitated the induction of classical NF-κB responsive genes by LTβR signaling (21Basak S. Shih V.F. Hoffmann A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3139-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, during the TNF priming process, p100 expression was induced and functioned as a fourth IκB protein that complexed with p65/p50 heterodimers. The subsequent activation of the LTβR signal resulted in the processing of p100 and the release and nuclear translocation of p65/p50 dimers, which induced the transcription of classical NF-κB responsive genes. In agreement, Csf2 expression was induced by LTβR mAb treatment when the cells were primed with TNF (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, when the sequence of exposure to TNF and LTβR signaling was reversed, a synergistic effect was observed on the induction of Csf2 gene expression. The cells were incubated with the agonistic LTβR mAb for 4 h (priming), washed, and then treated with TNF for an hour. This priming process resulted in a 40-fold increase in the amount of Csf2 transcripts as compared with TNF treatment alone. The synergistic effect was substantially greater than the observed effect when the cells were primed with TNF and then followed with LTβR mAb treatment (compare Fig. 2A with supplemental Fig. S1). This effect seemed to be specific for the Csf2 gene since a synergistic effect was not seen with Ccl2 and RelB expression (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). Furthermore, a minimum of 4 h of LTβR mAb priming resulted in a synergistic increase in Csf2 transcripts, which corresponds to the kinetics of p100 processing (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when the cells were allowed to rest for various time intervals after LTβR mAb priming before TNF treatment, the synergistic effect was rapidly reduced indicating the transient nature of the priming effect (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings indicated that the synergistic effect seen with TNF and agonistic LTβR mAb treatment was crucially influenced by the timing and order of exposure. The requirement for de novo protein synthesis is a major difference between the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathway (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). The protein synthesis inhibitor CHX enhances the TNF-induced classical NF-κB signal (22Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the LTβR signal-mediated alternative NF-κB response is blocked (23Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To investigate if the LTβR mAb priming effect was the result of activating the alternative NF-κB pathway, cells were treated with CHX during the LTβR mAb priming process. As seen in Fig. 3, the addition of CHX resulted in an increase in TNF-mediated Csf2 expression (∼3-fold), whereas the LTβR mAb priming effect was completely abrogated by the addition of CHX. These findings indicated that the synergistic response observed with LTβR mAb priming required de novo protein synthesis. Qing et al. (24Qing G. Qu Z. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40578-40582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have shown that an increase in NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) stability following LTβR activation is a key positive regulator in the alternative NF-κB pathway. Furthermore the inhibition of the alternative NF-κB pathway by CHX treatment was due to an increase in NIK turnover (25Liao G. Zhang M. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26243-26250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of NIK in the LTβR mAb priming process, NIK expression was decreased in cells with the Map3k14 shRNAmir. As seen in Fig. 4A, the level of NIK transcripts was significantly reduced in the cell line stably transfected with Map3K14 shRNA. Furthermore, the induction of NIK protein by LTβR-mAb treatment was abrogated in the cells transfected with the Map3k14 shRNA (upper panel of Fig. 4B). Moreover, LTβR-induced p100 processing was inhibited in the NIK knockdown cells (middle panel of Fig. 4B and quantitated in supplemental Fig. S3A). As seen in Fig. 4C, the amount of TNF-mediated Csf2 expression between the control and NIK knockdown cells were equivalent. These findings suggested that the suppression of NIK expression affected the alternative (LTβR mAb) but not the classical (TNF) NF-κB signaling pathway. Accordingly, the synergistic effect on Csf2 expression seen with LTβR mAb priming followed by TNF stimulation was blocked in the NIK knockdown cells (Fig. 4C). These results indicated that NIK was required for the synergistic effect of LTβR mAb on TNF-mediated Csf2 expression. In addition, the exogenous expression of the human NIK protein (MAP3K14) restored the LTβR mAb priming effect in the NIK knockdown cells (see supplemental Fig. S3, B and C). Thus, the inhibition of the synergistic effects of LTβR priming by CHX and by NIK knockdown indicated that the alternative NF-κB pathway plays a pivotal role in the synergistic effect of LTβR priming on TNF-induced Csf2 expression. The nuclear translocation of the various NF-κB proteins plays a pivotal role in the activation of both the classical and alternative pathway. It was conceivable that the priming effect by LTβR mAb was mediated by an increase in the amount of nuclear translocation of p65/p50 dimers to induce Csf2 expression. To investigate this possibility, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from treated cells were analyzed for the nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins. The treatment with either LTβR mAb or TNF resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of p65 in the whole cell lysates and cytoplasmic fractions (lanes 1–8 of the top panel of Fig. 5A). However, an increase in nuclear phospho-p65 was detected only after TNF but not after LTβR mAb treatment (lanes 9 and 10). The absence of either phospho- or total p65 in the nucleus following LTβR mAb treatment could explain the failure of LTβR signaling alone to augment Csf2 expression as seen in Fig. 1. In contrast, the activation of LTβR signaling resulted in an increase in nuclear RelB (middle panel). These findings were consistent with the activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway through LTβR signaling. With TNF treatment, an increase in nuclear p65, but not p52 (see supplemental Fig. S4) or RelB, was observed. These findings were consistent with the activation of the classical NF-κB pathway by TNF signaling. The amount of nuclear NF-κB proteins was not significantly different between the LTβR-primed nuclear samples and those stimulated with TNF alone. In particular, although a slight increase was observed in phospho-p65 in the whole cell lysate (lane 4 of the top panel), the amount of nuclear phospho-p65 was similar between the LTβR-primed and unprimed TNF-treated samples (compare lanes 10 and 12 of the top panel). Likewise, no difference in the amount of nuclear RelB (compare lanes 11 and 12) was observed between the primed and LTβR mAb alone treated samples. Therefore, subsequent TNF stimulation did not augment nuclear translocation of the p52 and RelB that had been induced by LTβR signaling. It is important to note that the priming with LTβR mAb did not affect the total amount of p65 and RelB (see lanes 1 through 4). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation experiments of nuclear lysates from primed cells demonstrated that RelB and p65 were not associated with each other (supplemental Fig. S6A). The major difference between the primed cells and those treated with TNF alone was the nuclear accumulation of both phospho-p65 and RelB in the primed cell nucleus. These findings suggested that qualitative, but not quantitative, differences in the nuclear translocation of both p65 and RelB might be involved in synergistic effect observed after LTβR priming followed by TNF treatment. It was also conceivable that either the DNA binding activity or the transactivation potential of the NF-κB transcription factors was increased during the LTβR mAb priming process. To investigate these possibilities, the DNA binding capacity of p65 was measured in nuclear extracts from cells that were primed with LTβR mAb. As seen in Fig. 5B, an increase in p65 DNA binding activity was observed in nuclear extracts from cells that were treated with TNF but not LTβR mAb. Priming with LTβR mAb followed by TNF treatment resulted in an increase in p65 DNA binding activity to a level similar to TNF treatment alone. The p65 DNA binding activity was blocked with an oligonucleotide containing the wild type, but not a mutated, NF-κB consensus sequence (supplemental Fig. S5). Furthermore, a reporter plasmid containing the cis acting NF-κB response element from the Csf2 promoter (12Osborne C.S. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar) was transfected into cells and the amount of reporter expression was assessed after treating the cells with TNF or LTβR mAb alone or primed with LTβR mAb before TNF treatment. As seen in Fig. 5C, an increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity was seen with TNF, but not LTβR, treatment. The amount of transcriptional activity did not significantly increase over TNF treatment alone when the cells were primed with LTβR mAb and then treated with TNF. Taken together, these findings indicated that the LTβR-priming effect was not due to an increase in either the p65 DNA binding activity or NF-κB transactivational activity. Although the amount of nuclear translocation and the transactivational potential of the NF-κB transcriptional factors were not further increased, it was possible that an increase in chromatin accessibility could explain the synergistic effect observed during LTβR mAb priming of TNF-mediated Csf2 transcription. Several studies (18Brettingham-Moore K.H. Rao S. Juelich T. Shannon M.F. Holloway A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26Brettingham-Moore K.H. Sprod O.R. Chen X. Oakford P. Shannon M.F. Holloway A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2639-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Holloway A.F. Rao S. Chen X. Shannon M.F. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that the activation of T cells resulted in an increase in chromatin accessibility at the Csf2 promoter during transcription. To study this possibility, chromatin remodeling of the Csf2 promoter was monitored with the chromatin accessibility assay from cells that were primed with LTβR mAb and then treated with TNF. For the chromatin accessibility assay, nuclei from treated cells were incubated with MNase, quantitatively assessed by real-time PCR, and expressed as a percentage of the amount of undigested genomic DNA samples (26Brettingham-Moore K.H. Sprod O.R. Chen X. Oakford P. Shannon M.F. Holloway A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2639-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Sutcliffe E.L. Parish I.A. He Y.Q. Juelich T. Tierney M.L. Rangasamy D. Milburn P.J. Parish C.R. Tremethick D.J. Rao S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 29: 1972-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As seen in the Fig. 6, TNF or LTβR mAb treatment resulted in an increase in chromatin accessibility to the proximal, but not the distal, region of the promoter. The proximal region has been shown to contain a cis acting NF-κB responsive element, whereas the distal region does not. Moveover, accessibility to the proximal region was dramatically increased when the cells were primed with LTβR mAb and then treated with TNF. In contrast, accessibility of the distal region was not affected which indicated that the LTβR priming process was specific to the proximal region of the Csf2 promoter. These findings suggested that a significant increase in accessibility to the Csf2 promoter during the LTβR mAb priming process could account for the synergistic induction seen with TNF-mediated Csf2 expression. Several studies have shown that the recruitment of p65 to the Csf2 promoter results in an increase in gene transcription (27Holloway A.F. Rao S. Chen X. Shannon M.F. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To investigate if p65 and RelB were recruited to the Csf2 promoter, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed on cells that were LTβR mAb primed followed by TNF treatment or treated with TNF or LTβR mAb alone. As seen in Fig. 7A, p65 but not RelB was recruited to the Csf2 promoter following TNF treatment. In contrast, LTβR mAb treatment induced the recruitment of RelB, but not p65, to the Csf2 promoter. When the cells were primed with LTβR mAb and then treated with TNF, the recruitment of both RelB and p65 to the Csf2 promoter was observed. The amount of p65 and RelB recruited to the Csf2 promoter did not change with LTβR priming. In addition, it was possible that the RelB and p65 were recruited the Csf2 promoter on different alleles. To address this possibility, chromatin from LTβR mAb primed and TNF-treated samples were immunodepleted with antibodies against RelB and the remaining chromatin was precipitated with antibodies against p65. As seen in the supplemental Fig. S7, the amount of DNA precipitated with anti-p65 was reduced when the samples were immunodepleted with anti-RelB as compared with the control sample (immunodepletion with normal immunoglobulin). A similar finding was observed when the samples were immunodepleted with anti-p65 and precipitated with anti-RelB. These findings indicated that RelB and p65 were recruited to the Csf2 promoter on the same allele. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that there were qualitative (the recruitment of both RelB and p65) and not quantitative differences between the priming followed by TNF treatment and the individual treatments. Furthermore, we have previously described the co-recruitment of p300 and RNA polymerase II to the Csf2 promoter following TNF treatment, which resulted in an increase in Csf2 transcription (10Sasaki C.Y. Slemenda C.F. Ghosh P. Barberi T.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11218-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). As expected, the treatment with TNF alone resulted in the recruitment of p300 and RNA polymerase II to the Csf2 promoter (Fig. 7B). In contrast, p300 or RNA polymerase II was not recruited to the Csf2 promoter after LTβR mAb treatment. The levels of RNA polymerase II recruited to the Csf2 promoter were higher in the LTβR mAb-primed sample treated with TNF than in cells stimulated with TNF alone. These differences in the levels of RNA polymerase II could be responsible for the synergistic effect observed with LTβR mAb priming of TNF-mediated Csf2 expression. Based on our findings, the recruitment of RelB to the Csf2 promoter during the priming process could account for the increased robustness in TNF-mediated Csf2 expression. To investigate the role of RelB in the enhancement of TNF-mediated Csf2 transcription, the expression of endogenous RelB was suppressed with the transfection of Relb shRNAmir into 3T3 fibroblast cells. As seen in Fig. 8, the amount of Relb protein was reduced in the two clones transfected with the Relb shRNAmir as compared with the cells transfected with the control plasmid (pGIPZ) (Fig. 8A). Chromatin accessibility to the proximal region of the Csf2 promoter was reduced in the cells lacking Relb protein when primed with LTβR and treated with TNF, although the TNF-mediated chromatin accessibility was not affected (Fig. 8B). Similarly, the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the Csf2 promoter was suppressed in the cells lacking RelB when primed with LTβR and treated with TNF (Fig. 8C, data not shown for second clone). Lastly the synergistic enhancement of Csf2 expression by LTβ signaling of TNF-mediated Csf2 expression was abrogated with the suppression of RelB protein expression (Fig. 8D). These findings demonstrated that RelB was required for the increase in chromatin accessibility and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the Csf2 promoter during the LTβ-priming/TNF treatment. Hence the RelB may be playing a role in increasing chromatin accessibility to the Csf2 promoter, which then increases the recruitment of RNA polymerase II for the transcription of the Csf2 gene. Many characteristics distinguish the two NF-κB signaling pathways. However, as seen in many biological signaling systems, there exist numerous intersections that allow the pathways to influence each other. Here we described a synergistic relationship between the classical and alternative NF-κB signaling pathway that regulates the expression of GM-CSF. The transcription of the Csf2 gene has been shown to respond to stimuli that activate the classical NF-κB signaling pathway such as signaling through the TNF receptor. We have previously shown that this process involves the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 (10Sasaki C.Y. Slemenda C.F. Ghosh P. Barberi T.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11218-11225Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The activation of the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway through the LTβR resulted in the phosphorylation of serine 536 on p65 but did not induce Csf2 gene transcription. However if the cells were primed with agonistic LTβR antibody and then treated with TNF, a synergistic induction of Csf2, but not Ccl2, another TNF responsive gene, expression was observed. The synergistic effect was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and involved the nuclear translocation and recruitment of RelB and p65 proteins to the Csf2 promoter. In addition, suppression of NIK expression resulted in the loss of the synergistic effect induced by agonistic LTβR mAb, which indicated that the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway was required. Taken together these findings suggested that RelB facilitated the induction of p65-mediated Csf2 expression. A feature that distinguishes the alternative from the classical NF-κB pathway is the lack of NEMO (IKKγ) activity (29Rudolph D. Yeh W.C. Wakeham A. Rudolph B. Nallainathan D. Potter J. Elia A.J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the activity of IKKα has been reported to be involved in both pathways (30Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 31Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The activation of IKKα is responsible for the phosphorylation of p65 on serine 536 by both TNF (32Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) and agonistic LTβR mAb (11Jiang X. Takahashi N. Matsui N. Tetsuka T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 919-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) treatment. The degradation of IκBα induced by TNF and the processing of p100 induced by LTβR signaling are both mediated by IKKα activity; IκBα degradation is a NEMO-dependent process and p100 processing is a NEMO-independent process. The kinetics of maximum TNF- and LTβR mAb-induced phosphorylation of p65 coincided with the kinetics of degradation of IκBα and processing of p100, which was consistent with the activation of the two IKKα complexes. However, because the alternative NF-κB pathway is not dependent on NEMO activity, the LTβR mAb-induced phospho-p65 was sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκBα. This explains the lack of Csf2 induction following the LTβR mAb treatment despite the phosphorylation of p65. This also confirms the specificity of the agonistic LTβR mAb antibody in stimulating only the alternative NF-κB signaling pathway. Based on the data shown here, the synergistic effect of LTβR priming on TNF-mediated Csf2 induction involved the recruitment of p65 and RelB independently to the Csf2 promoter, which resulted in an increase in chromatin remodeling and the co-recruitment of RNA polymerase II. In accordance, Brettingham-Moore et al. (18Brettingham-Moore K.H. Rao S. Juelich T. Shannon M.F. Holloway A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that the presence of the NF-κB transcription factor c-Rel in the nucleus resulted in the remodeling of the chromatin surrounding the Csf2 promoter and Csf2 transcription in activated T cells. Although we used a different cell-type and stimuli, the co-recruitment of p65, p300, and RNA polymerase II to the Csf2 promoter following TNF treatment was sufficient to induce gene transcription. With LTβR priming, RelB was also recruited to the Csf2 promoter, which resulted in a dramatic increase in Csf2 transcription. Furthermore, the co-recruitment of RelB to the Csf2 promoter increased the amount of RNA polymerase II recruitment, which is consistent with an increase in Csf2 transcription. RelB alone, as seen with LTβR treatment, was not responsible for the co-recruitment of RNA polymerase II and p300 to the Csf2 promoter. Furthermore, the suppression of RelB expression resulted in the abrogation of the synergistic effect on TNF-mediated Csf2 expression by LTβR mAb priming. Hence it is possible that recruitment of RelB (during LTβR priming) to the Csf2 promoter makes the chromatin accessible and facilitates the p65-mediated recruitment of RNA polymerase II (during TNF activation), which results in an increase in gene transcription. The findings from the sequential immunoprecipitation experiment in supplemental Fig. S5 demonstrated that p65 and RelB exist as independent dimers in lysates from LTβR mAb-primed and TNF-treated cells. In agreement, the amount of p65 recruitment to the Csf2 promoter was not affected in RelB knock-down cells that were primed with LTβR-mAb and then treated with TNF (see supplemental Fig. S6B). Furthermore, the results from the immunodepletion ChIP assay suggested that p65 and RelB were recruited to the Csf2 promoter on the same allele, as seen in supplemental Fig. S6, when cells were primed with LTβR mAb and treated with TNF. In addition, a single cis acting NF-κB response element has been described to the region of the Csf2 promoter that was precipitated in the ChIP assays. It is conceivable that the LTβR mAb priming process induces RelB to act as an enhancer that binds to a distal site which alters the chromatin architecture to promote p65-mediated Csf2 transcription following TNF treatment. Osborne et al. (12Osborne C.S. Vadas M.A. Cockerill P.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 226-235PubMed Google Scholar) have described a 400 bp element, which shares 67% homology to the human CSF2 enhancer and is 2 kb upstream from the mouse Csf2 gene. However, we could not detect the recruitment of either RelB or p65 to this distal 400 bp element following LTβR priming/treatment or TNF treatment (data not shown). It is possible that there could be other sites within the Csf2 promoter that facilitate p65-mediated Csf2 expression after TNF treatment. Remodeling of chromatin involves the post-translational modification of histones, which influences gene transcription. The treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A has been shown to increase the acetylation of histones and promote the transcription of GM-CSF in activated T cells (26Brettingham-Moore K.H. Sprod O.R. Chen X. Oakford P. Shannon M.F. Holloway A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 2639-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, the treatment with trichostatin A followed by TNF stimulation did not result in a synergistic effect as seen with LTβR mAb priming (data not shown). In addition, the histone acetyltransferase p300 was not recruited to the promoter with LTβR mAb treatment, which suggested that the chromatin remodeling seen with LTβR mAb priming process does not involve histone acetylation. It is not known if LTβR mAb priming process induces other histone modifications, such as phosphorylation or methylation, to boost TNF-mediated Csf2 transcription. Defining the role of RelB in promoting chromatin accessibility to the Csf2 promoter will be pivotal in understanding the priming process. In studies involving multiple cytokines, an autocrine or paracrine relationship could be responsible for the observed synergistic effect. It was conceivable that LTβR mAb priming induced the expression of TNF or TNF receptor, which could explain the synergistic response to TNF-mediated Csf2 expression. Although the amount of TNF or TNFR was not investigated, the response to the LTβR mAb priming process was specific to Csf2 expression. The other TNF-responsive genes such as Ccl2 and RelB were not affected by the LTβR mAb priming process. This would argue against the possibility of LTβR mAb increasing the amount of TNF or TNFR during the priming process. Nevertheless, the findings indicated that neither an autocrine nor paracrine relationship between TNF and LTβR signaling was responsible for the synergistic effect on Csf2 expression. Moreover, these findings underscore the complexity between the classical (TNF) and alternative (LTβR) signaling pathways and their interactions in regulating Csf2 expression. Here we showed that the alternative NF-κB pathway influences the classical NF-κB pathway in a synergistic manner with respect to Csf2 expression. The activation of lymphocytes results in the expression of TNF and LTβ, and their receptors are found on macrophages and stromal fibroblast cells (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar, 33Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). In addition, TNF is soluble and secreted as a trimer whereas LTβ is cell membrane-bound (34Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 625-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lack of development of the secondary lymph node organs is the phenotype seen in LTβR knock-out mice (35Fütterer A. Mink K. Luz A. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Pfeffer K. Immunity. 1998; 9: 59-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the interactions between these cell types are influenced by soluble TNF and cell membrane-associated LTβ in a temporal and spatial manner to maintain the function of the lymph node. Furthermore, because GM-CSF may act as an immune adjuvant, it is possible that the synergistic relationship between the alternative and classical NF-κB signaling pathways could facilitate the generation of a robust immune response when amounts of TNF and LTβ are limiting.

https://openalex.org/W2049686737,"Fractal geometry was created by Benoit B. Mandelbrot nearly 40 years ago, and with the 1982 publication of his seminal book, “The Fractal Geometry of Nature,” its application took off, opening our eyes to patterns in nature on all scales and across diverse disciplines. On 14 October, he died of cancer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He fundamentally and irrevocably changed our view of the world and left us a tool that will continue to unveil nature's most peculiar commonalities that might otherwise be left aside as insignificant.

Mandelbrot was born in 1924 in Warsaw, Poland. With the rise of Nazism, his family left for France in 1936, where he pursued an education in mathematics and earned a doctorate at the University of Paris in 1952. His career path took him to prominent establishments: the California Institute of Technology, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, IBM Research in New York, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and to Yale University (where he retired in 2005).

Whereas the Renaissance saw geometry in the forefront, much of the 19th and 20th century sought an algebraic representation of nearly all mathematical fields. As a result, the patterns and forms that real nature presents were increasingly neglected. Geometry in the ordinary sense was left to school children, and even school mathematics departed from geometry in favor of an algebraic and abstract underpinning of curricula. Mandelbrot always felt this view was narrow and inappropriate for understanding nature. After decades of a mathematical trend to abandon visual representation of phenomena, which was spurred by French mathematicians (the so-called Bourbaki group) in the mid-1930s, Mandelbrot gave the eye a central role again.

His whole career became one long and ardent pursuit of the concept of “roughness”—the roughness of clusters in the physics of disorder, of turbulent flows, of exotic noises, of chaotic dynamical systems, of distributions of galaxies, of coastlines, of stock-price charts, and of mathematical constructions. Some describe Mandelbrot as one who chose the role of a maverick in the mainstream sciences. Quite to the contrary, his uncompromising devotion to analyze and understand the “rough” reality of nature isolated him from the mainstream. In his view, the common “smooth” representations of natural processes were entirely inappropriate and far from the essence of nature: “Clouds are not spheres and mountains are not cones.” Alone, he shaped a program of geometry based on fractals, a term he coined to refer to mathematical shapes with irregular contours, just as seen in nature. The notion of self-similarity is key in fractal geometry: geometric shapes that break into parts, each a small-scale model of the whole.

His mathematical sources were deeply rooted in the entire history of mathematics, notably the work of Felix Hausdorff and Paul Levy, and the “Mandelbrot set” that bears his name would likely not have been discovered without his peculiar contact with some forgotten jewels of mathematics produced at the turn of the 19th century by Gaston Julia and Pierre Fatou. He told me that his uncle, Szolem Mandelbrojt, had almost forced him to study their papers as the best introduction to good mathematics. In fact, his uncle, a traditional mathematician, student of Jacques Hadamard, and member of the College de France, sought to eradicate Benoit's preference for a geometric approach to mathematics. Fortunately, Mandelbrot's advocacy for geometry was without compromise.

The mathematical genre of Julia and Fatou has experienced a great revival through Mandelbrot, and their topic—iteration—became a guiding principle for his own discovery and work. Whereas classical geometry and many of its modern algebraic and other extensions encode objects from closed elementary formulas to differential equations, Mandelbrot made us aware of a mathematical universe yet to be harvested—the world of iterative processes. Within this framework, he developed the tools that appear ideally suited for the rough nature of the world. And “world” is meant literally, because his footprints are left in the theory of finance, linguistics, biology, medicine, chemistry, physics, earth science, cosmology, computer science, astronomy, many of the engineering disciplines, and of course, mathematics.

The Mandelbrot set provides perhaps the most striking example of a mathematical object whose properties would remain undiscovered without the guiding power of the human eye used by an able mathematician. For example, the key for understanding the myriads of patterns that sprout at the boundary of the Mandelbrot set is governed by a peculiar mathematical coding scheme within the field lines of its potential. Mandelbrot earned not only the credit for its discovery but also for expressing provocative mathematical conjectures about its properties. For instance, he proposed that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set, which exhibits all the marvelous and seemingly complex images that turned it into a cult object, has a fractal dimension of only two.

Now that Mandelbrot's work can be considered to belong to mainstream mathematics and the sciences, it is important to remember that there was once strong resistance and skepticism. I have often asked myself where Mandelbrot found the source of his strength, determination, and endurance in those decades when he was practically isolated in his own mathematical world. He used to claim that his geometrical view and associated gifts guided him and that he did not feel isolated at all. I would add that his pristine character as someone who sought the truth in life and nature led him as well. Moreover, I remember Benoit as a universal scientist and very conscious citizen of the world, knowledgeable and sharp in all branches of the sciences and beyond: the arts, politics, and history. It will take further generations to grasp the full significance and impact of his insight far beyond the borders of mathematics.

His personal history left him as someone who was fortunate to escape the darkest periods of mankind. He chose to remain forever suspicious toward any form of establishment and mainstream.
