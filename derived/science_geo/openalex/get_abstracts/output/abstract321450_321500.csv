https://openalex.org/W1987798092,"Males of the queen butterfly Danaus gilippus berenice, deprived of the two extrusible brushlike ""hairpencils"" at the rear of their abdomen, are capable of courting females but incapable of seducing them. In normal courtship, an aphrodisiac secretion associated with the hairpencils is transferred by way of tiny cuticular ""dust"" particles to the antennae of the females. Of the two substances identified from the secretion, one (the ketone) acts as the chemical messenger that induces the females to mate. The only known function of the other compound (the diol) is to serve as a glue that sticks the dust to the female. Males were reared under conditions in which they produced subnormal amounts of ketone and showed reduced seductive capacity. Under certain experimental circumstances, the competence of these males was restored by addition of synthetic ketone."
https://openalex.org/W2049582900,The surface morphology and optical properties of Mercury resemble those of the moon in remarkable detail and record a very similar sequence of events. Chemical and mineralogical similarity of the outer layers of Mercury and the moon is implied; Mercury is probably a differentiated planet with a large iron-rich core. Differentiation is inferred to have occurred very early. No evidence of atmospheric modification of landforms has been found. Large-scale scarps and ridges unlike lunar or martian features may reflect a unique period of planetary compression near the end of heavy bombardment by small planetesimals.
https://openalex.org/W2027064309,"Fluxes of protons with energies of approximately 550 kev and electrons with energies of approximately 300 kev which exceed approximately 10(4) and 10(5) cm(-2) sec(-1), respectively, have been discovered in the magnetosphere of Mercury. Electron fluxes > 10(3) cm(-2) sec(-1) also are observed in the outbound pass of the Mariner 10 spacecraft throuigh the magnetosheath. The intensity versus time profiles of the particle fluxes in the magnetosphere appear with sudden onsets of approximately 10(4) cm(-2) sec(-1) beginning at interplanetary background levels and persisting for times equivalent to their being distriblited spatially over regions having a scale size comparable to the planetary radius. For a spectral form dJ/dE alpha E-gamma, where J is the differential particle intensity and E is the kinetic energy, the typical values of gamma are gamma(p) = 5.5 for protons above 500 kev and gamma(e) >/= 9 for electrons above 170 kev. Large coherent electron intensity oscillations (variations of factors of 10 to 100) have been discovered with characteristic periods of approximately 6 seconds and with higher frequency components. In some cases proton bursts are found in phase with these oscillations. On the basis of the experimental evidence and a knowledge of the general magnetic field intensities and directions along the trajectory of Mariner 10 provided by the magnetic field observations, it is shown that the radiation events observed in the magnetosphere and magnetosheath are transient and are not interpretable in terms of stable trapped particle populations. Furthermtiore, experimental evidence strongly supports the view that the particles are impulsively accelerated and that the acceleration source is not more distant from the point of observation along lines of force than approximately 8 x 10(3) to 16 x 10(3) kilometers (3 to 6.5 units of Mercury's radius). Candidates for the regions most likely to be sources of particle acceleration are discussed, namely, the magnetotail and the magnetosheath. It is pointed out that the phenomena discovered at Mercury will place more stringent conditions on allowed mnodels for electron and proton acceleration than have heretofore been possible in studies within the earth's magnetosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1992469076,"Analysis of data obtained by the ultraviolet experiment on Mariner 10 indicates that Mercury is surrounded by a thin atmosphere consisting in part of helium. The partial pressure of helium at the terminator is about 5 x 10(-12) millibar. The total surface pressure of the atmosphere is less than about 2 x 10(-9) millibar. Upper limits are set for the abundance of various gases, including hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, argon, neon, and xenon. The wavelength dependence of Mercury's surface albedo is similar to that of the moon over a broad range of wavelengths from 500 to 1600 angstroms. Strong signals were recorded by the airglow instrument as Mariner 10 passed through the cavity behind Mercury. They are as yet unexplained but may provide information on the properties of the local plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1964202816,"Two major components in the ""hairpencil"" secretion of the male of the queen butterfly (Danaus gilippus berenice) have been identified. One, a crystalline ketone (2,3-dihydro-7-methyl-1H-pyrrolizin-1-one), is known from another danaid butterfly. The other, a viscous terpenoid alcohol (trans, trans-3,7-dimethyldeca-2,6-dien-1,10-diol), is new; its structure is confirmed by an unambiguous synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1991205230,"Olfactory receptor responses (electroantennograms) were recorded from antennae of danaid butterflies. Antennae of male and female queen butterflies (Danaus gilippus berenice) respond equally strongly to the hairpencil of queen males, to its crude extract, and to one of its two identified secretory components (the ketone). Responses to the second component (the diol) are weak. Hairpencils of a related species, Lycorea ceres, which also contain the ketone, are equally effective in eliciting electroantennograms from both sexes of the queen. Antennae of another related species, the monarch (Danaus plexippus), respond to the same stimuli as does the queen. Monarch hairpencils, which lack the ketone, do not elicit electroantennograms in monarch or queen antennae."
https://openalex.org/W1974991265,"Analysis of the radio-tracking data from Mariner 10 yields 6,023,600 ± 600 for the ratio of the mass of the sun to that of Mercury, in very good agreement with values determined earlier from radar data alone. Occultation measurements yielded values for the radius of Mercury of 2440 ± 2 and 2438 ± 2 kilometers at latitudes of 2°N and 68°N, respectively, again in close agreement with the average equatorial radius of 2439 ± 1 kilometers determined from radar data. The mean density of 5.44 grams per cubic centimeter deduced for Mercury from Mariner 10 data thus virtually coincides with the prior determination. No evidence of either an ionosphere or an atmosphere was found, with the data yielding upper bounds on the electron density of about 1500 and 4000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the dayside and nightside, respectively, and an inferred upper bound on the surface pressure of 10-8 millibar."

These one-to-one adducts were isolated as crystalline solids and characterized by means of elemental analysis, magnetic properties, and molecular weight determinations."
https://openalex.org/W2043172157,"Foraminferal dominance values above 50 percent and associated diversity minimums in surface sediments of the North Atlantic coincide with past extremes of temperature, productivity, or salinity in overlying surface waters. These parameters delimit a cold PolarSubpolar water mass and an impoverished, saline Southern Sargasso Central water mass for the late Recent. Anticipated pole-to-equator diversity and dominance gradients in the open ocean are virtually eliminated by the stronger trends of the vigorous subtropical North Atlantic gyre."

They contracted into the typical barrel-shaped puparium, before the onset of tanning. This proved that ecdysone controls the puparial contraction as well as tanning."

https://openalex.org/W1965854900,"Several crystallographic computer programs have been organized into one large automatic program for solving crystal structures. The emphasis of this organization has been to produce a noninteractive system, that is, to have all decisions made by the computer. Input data are the raw intensity data, cell constants, space group, chemical formula, and other miscellaneous items. The output is a stereo picture of the contents in a unit cell. The program, operating in a noninteractive mode, has successfully solved compounds of unknown structure; in addition, for a test compound of completely unknown composition, this program deduced the correct structure with an average error in bond distance of 0.05 angstrom and an average error in bond angle of 7 degrees ."
