Many methods have been tried for antenatal sex determination; but even modern ones, based upon scientific hypotheses, have failed to receive sufficient confirmation for general acceptance."

https://openalex.org/W1977714892,"THE antiglobulin test of Coombs, Mourant and Race is already widely employed in routine practice, and many laboratories are producing for themselves antiglobulin sera. Rabbits were commonly immunized by unchanged human serum or its globulin fraction. The latter method, especially in the smaller laboratories, meets difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W1995292296,"WE have recently isolated an organism from the stool of an adult human subject that is capable of synthesizing significant quantities of fatty material, which become visible on the surface, from a fat-free medium. The fat is neutral in character, liberating fatty acids on hydrolysis, and can be removed from the surface by dissolving it in ether. It is colourless and melts below body temperature. Some of its properties are shown in Table 1. Relatively little fat is present in the medium and organisms, and has not so far been investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2034736993,"A COMPARISON was made between the levels of thyroid and thyrotrophic hormones in the blood of female albino rats during the four stages of the œstrous cycle. The procedure used was that adopted by D'Angello and Gordon1, namely, ‘the stasis tadpole method’. Serum was obtained from the blood of the rats, which were divided into four groups of five or six each according to the vaginal smear reading. These groups were of pro-œstrous, œstrous, metœstrous and diœstrous rats. The tadpoles were divided into five groups, one of which was the untreated control. The others were injected with seven injections of 0.01 ml. of serum obtained from the four groups of rats on alternate days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection the tadpoles were killed with chloroform, fixed in susa and stored in 80 per cent alcohol. Their hindlimbs were then measured with a micrometer; this was used as a criterion of thyroid hormone activity. The height of the epithelial cells of the thyroids of tadpoles was used as an indication of the level of thyrotrophic hormone in the blood of the different groups of rats. The results are shown in Table 1."
https://openalex.org/W2035520685,"SIR JOHN COCKCROFT1 has given a reassuring answer to the question of the genetic hazards of radiation from the products of nuclear and thermonuclear explosions disseminated to large distances. I think that he, or his biological advisers, have greatly over-estimated the simplicity of the problem. It can be attacked by several different methods. First we can fix a rough upper bound to the effect."
https://openalex.org/W2036345505,"Reddy and Srinivasan1 have described a method for the estimation of vitamin K and vitamin K3 which is slightly different from that of Novelli2. During the course of our investigation on the biosynthesis of vitamin K in moulds, we found that the method of Reddy and Srinivasan was not suitable for determining microquantities of vitamin K. It was observed that, on standing, the intensity of the colour at the junction of the two layers increases, with the result that the intensity of colour is not uniform throughout the layer. In the present communication, we wish to describe a modified method which can be used to estimate vitamin K in the range 2–30 µgm."
