https://openalex.org/W1519110908,"The complete primary structure of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor from rat brain was elucidated using a series of overlapping cDNA clones. Two different sets of clones that either contain or lack a 45-nucleotide sequence in the amino-terminal third of the protein were isolated, suggesting a differential splicing event that results in the biosynthesis of either a 2734- or 2749-amino acid receptor protein. Hydrophobicity analysis demonstrates the presence of a cluster of hydrophobic sequences in the carboxyl-terminal third of the protein that probably comprise eight transmembrane regions and that may form the calcium channel intrinsic to the receptor. The receptor was universally expressed at low levels in all tissues and cultured cells tested. Transfection of a full-length expression construct of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor into COS cells resulted in the biosynthesis of a 260-kDa protein that bound inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and formed high molecular weight complexes similar to the native receptor as analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugations. On the other hand, the protein product synthesized by a mutant receptor construct in which the amino-terminal 418 amino acids were deleted failed to bind inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The mutant receptor still formed high molecular weight complexes, suggesting that it folded normally and that the amino-terminal sequences of the receptor are part of the ligand binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W2051747697,"Na+,K(+)-ATPase has distinctly different distributions in mesenchymal cells, where it has an unrestricted distribution over the entire cell surface, compared with polarized epithelial cells, where it is restricted to the basal-lateral membrane domain. The generation of this restricted distribution is important in mesenchyme to epithelia conversion in development and the function of transporting epithelia, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here we show that expression of the epithelial CAM uvomorulin in transfected fibroblasts is sufficient to induce a redistribution of Na+,K(+)-ATPase to sites of uvomorulin-mediated cell-cell contacts, similar to that in polarized epithelial cells. This restricted distribution of Na+,K(+)-ATPase occurs in the absence of tight junctions but coincides with the reorganization of the membrane cytoskeleton. The results indicate a direct role for CAMs as inducers of cell surface polarity of selective cytoplasmic and membrane proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2078316320,"LHRH (chicken II luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone) partially reduces calcium currents and slows the activation kinetics of part of the remaining current in frog sympathetic neurons. The effects of LHRH are mimicked by intracellular dialysis with GTP-γ-S. A strong depolarization can temporarily reverse the effects of LHRH or GTP-γ-S: activation kinetics return to normal, and the amplitude of the current is increased (facilitation). Facilitation develops rapidly (π = 4–6 ms at >+30 mV) and decays more slowly ( at −80 mV). Tail currents in LHRH are smaller and faster than in the control, and these effects are partially reversed by facilitation. These results can be explained by a model in which a fraction of the channels is shifted into a “reluctant” gating mode, where opening requires stronger depolarization. If this mechanism is at the root of presynaptic inhibition, our results predict that inhibition of transmitter release would be overcome during bursts of high frequency activity."
https://openalex.org/W2044297195,"Ribosomal frameshifting regulates expression of the TYB gene of yeast Ty retrotransposons. We previously demonstrated that a 14 nucleotide sequence conserved between two families of Ty elements was necessary and sufficient to support ribosomal frameshifting. This work demonstrates that only 7 of these 14 nucleotides are needed for normal levels of frameshifting. Any change to the sequence CUU-AGG-C drastically reduces frameshifting; this suggests that two specific tRNAs, tRNA(UAGLeu) and tRNA(CCUArg), are involved in the event. Our tRNA overproduction data suggest that a leucyl-tRNA, probably tRNA(UAGLeu), an unusual leucine isoacceptor that recognizes all six leucine codons, slips from CUU-Leu onto UUA-Leu (in the +1 reading frame) during a translational pause at the AGG-Arg codon induced by the low availability of tRNA(CCUArg), encoded by a single-copy essential gene. Frameshifting is also directional and reading frame specific. Interestingly, frameshifting is inhibited when the slip CUU codon is located three codons downstream, but not four or more codons downstream, of the translational initiation codon."
https://openalex.org/W1967838053,"Krev-1 is known to suppress transformation by ras. However, the mechanism of the suppression is unclear. The protein product of Krev-1, Rap1A-p21, is identical to Ras-p21 proteins in the region where interaction with guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) is believed to occur. Therefore, the ability of GAP to interact with Rap1A-p21 was tested. Rap1A-p21 was not activated by GAP but bound tightly to GAP and was an effective competitive inhibitor of GAP-mediated Ras-GTPase activity. Binding of GAP to Rap1A-p21 was strictly guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent. The ability of Rap1A-p21 to bind tightly to GAP may account for Krev-1 suppression of transformation by ras. This may occur by preventing interaction of GAP with Ras-p21 or with other cellular proteins necessary for GAP-mediated Ras GTPase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1986201324,"Drosophila P transposable elements encode two proteins, an 87 kd transposase protein and a 66 kd protein that has been hypothesized to repress transposition. We have made germline transformants carrying modified P element derivatives that encode only the 66 kd protein and shown that these elements repress transposase activity in both the germline and the soma. The position of these elements in the genome quantitatively affected their ability to negatively regulate transposase and to express the 66 kd protein. Single 66 kd element-containing strains did not exhibit the maternal inheritance of P cytotype characteristic of P strains. However, we demonstrated that a true P strain produced higher levels of the 66 kd protein during oogenesis than single 66 kd P elements. Thus, the expression of the 66 kd repressor during oogenesis may be a major determinant of the maternal effect of P cytotype."
https://openalex.org/W1514636046,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. KGF exhibits potent mitogenic activity for a variety of epithelial cell types but is distinct from other known FGFs in that it is not mitogenic for fibroblasts or endothelial cells. We report saturable specific binding of 125I-KGF to surface receptors on intact Balb/MK mouse epidermal keratinocytes. 125I-KGF binding was completed efficiently by acidic FGF (aFGF) but with 20-fold lower efficiency by basic FGF (bFGF). The pattern of 125I-acidic FGF binding and competition on Balb/MK keratinocytes and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts suggests that these cell types possess related but distinct FGF receptors. Scatchard analysis of 125I-KGF binding suggested major and minor high affinity receptor components (KD = 400 and 25 pM, respectively) as well as a third high capacity/low affinity heparin-like component. Covalent affinity cross-linking of 125I-KGF to its receptor on Balb/MK cells revealed two species of 115 and 140 kDa. KGF also stimulated the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90-kDa protein in Balb/MK cells but not in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Together these results indicate that Balb/MK keratinocytes possess high affinity KGF receptors to which the FGFs may also bind. However, these receptors are distinct from the receptor(s) for aFGF and bFGF on NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which fail to interact with KGF."
https://openalex.org/W1542547297,"Bleaching of eumelanin has been studied in model systems consisting of synthetic dopa-melanin and various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, molecular oxygen, and copper(II) ions at neutral and alkaline pH. The data show that at neutral pH, in the dark, metal-ion-free melanin is very resistant to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. However, the rate of bleaching of melanin, induced by H2O2 is significantly accelerated by illumination from UVA-visible light. Bound-to-melanin copper(II) also accelerates the bleaching of melanin with the efficiency dependent on concentration of H2O2 and oxygen. It suggests possible involvement of melanin-copper complexes in Fenton-like processes. The formation of hydroxyl radicals during melanin bleaching has been concluded on the basis of the electrochemical detection of hydroxylation products of salicylate used as OH scavenger. Redox conversion of bound-to-melanin copper ions was monitored by EPR spectroscopy and direct measurement of melanin-Cu(II) complexes. It has been shown that melanin-copper(I) complexes were readily oxidized by either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. The data indicate that bleaching of melanin is a complex process with two distinct stages, reversible oxidation of the hydroquinone moieties of melanin followed by irreversible reactions of the monomers that lead to degradation of the melanin polymer."

https://openalex.org/W2051110150,"The Gin DNA invertase of bacteriophage Mu carries out processive recombination in which multiple rounds of exchange follow synaptic complex formation. The stereostructure of the knotted products determined by electron microscopy establishes critical features of site synapsis and DNA exchange. Surprisingly, the invertase knots substrates with directly repeated sites as well as those with inverted sites. The results suggest that the Gin synaptic complex contains three mutually perpendicular dyads; one is the axis of site rotation during exchange, and they cause inverted and direct site substrates to form a similar synaptic complex. The extensive knotting by Gin has implications for the energetics of recombination and shows that the enhancer for recombination is required only at an early stage, and thus may normally operate in a hit-and-run fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1642778195,"Studies on N-linked oligosaccharide processing were undertaken in HepG2 cells and calf thyroid slices to explore the possibility that the recently described Golgi endo-alpha-D-mannosidase (Lubas, W.A., and Spiro, R.G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3775-3781) is responsible for the frequently noted failure of glucosidase inhibitors to achieve complete cessation of complex carbohydrate unit synthesis. We have found that in the presence of the glucosidase inhibitors, castanospermine (CST) or 1-deoxynojirimycin, there is a substantial production of the glucosylated mannose saccharides (Glc3Man, Glc2Man, and Glc1Man) which are the characteristic products of endomannosidase action. Furthermore, in HepG2 cells, a secretion of these components into the medium could be demonstrated. Characterization of the N-linked polymannose oligosaccharides produced by HepG2 cells in the presence of CST (as well as 1-deoxymannojirimycin to prevent processing by alpha-mannosidase I) indicated the occurrence, in addition to the expected glucosylated species, of substantial amounts of Man8GlcNAc and Man7GlcNAc. Since Man9GlcNAc was almost completely absent and the Man8GlcNAc isomer was shown to be identical with that formed by the in vitro action of endomannosidase on glucosylated polymannose oligosaccharides, we concluded that this enzyme was actively functioning in the intact cells and could provide a pathway for circumventing the glucosidase blockade. Indeed, quantitative studies in HepG2 cells supported this contention as the continued formation of complex carbohydrate units (50% of control) during CST inhibition could be accounted for by the deglucosylation effected by endomannosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1523721174,"Exposure of 3T3-L1 adipocytes to 100 ng/ml of cholera toxin or 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP caused a marked stimulation of deoxyglucose transport. A maximal increase of 10- to 15-fold was observed after 12-24 h of exposure, while 100 nM insulin elicited an increase of similar magnitude within 30 min. A short term exposure (4 h) of cells to cholera toxin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in deoxyglucose transport which was associated with significant redistribution of both the HepG2/erythrocyte (GLUT1) and muscle/adipocyte (GLUT4) glucose transporters from low density microsomes to the plasma membrane fraction. Total cellular amounts of both transporter proteins remained constant. In contrast, cells exposed to cholera toxin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP for 12 h exhibited elevations in total cellular contents of GLUT1 (but not GLUT4) protein to about 1.5- and 2.5-fold above controls, respectively. Although such treatments of cells with cholera toxin (12 h) versus insulin (30 min) caused similar 10-fold enhancements of deoxyglucose transport, a striking discrepancy was observed with respect to the content of glucose transporter proteins in the plasma membrane fraction. While insulin elicited a 2.6-fold increase in the levels of GLUT4 protein in the plasma membrane fraction, cholera toxin increased the amount of this transporter by only 30%. Insulin or cholera toxin increased the levels of GLUT1 protein in the plasma membrane fraction equally (1.6-fold). Thus, a greater number of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane fraction is associated with transport stimulation by insulin compared to cholera toxin. We conclude that: 1) at early times (4 h) after the addition of cholera toxin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP to 3T3-L1 adipocytes, redistribution of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane appears to contribute to elevated deoxyglucose uptake rates, and 2) the stimulation of hexose uptake after prolonged treatment (12-18 h) of cells with cholera toxin may involve an additional increase in the intrinsic activity of one or both glucose transporter isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W2088499993,"P400, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3-R), is a key protein to understanding the mechanisms of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. We obtained the cerebellar-type P400/InsP3-R cDNA and generated an L cell transfectant (L15) that produces cDNA-derived P400/InsP3-R. In membranes, this protein displays high affinity, specificity, and capacity for InsP3, as does the cerebellar P400/InsP3-R. InsP3 can also induce greater 45Ca2+ release from the membrane vesicles of L15 cells than from those of control L cells. These results provide direct evidence that the cDNA-derived P400/InsP3-R protein is actually involved in physiological Ca2+ mobilization, through binding to InsP3 molecules in the same manner as the cerebellar P400/InsP3-R."
https://openalex.org/W1499398296,"The present studies were performed to determine the role of cyclic GMP in regulating agonist mediated calcium entry in the pancreatic acinar cell. In guinea pig-dispersed pancreatic acini the findings demonstrated that carbachol stimulated a transient 20-40-fold rise in cellular cyclic GMP followed by a sustained 3-4-fold rise in cellular cyclic GMP. The guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione (LY83583), caused a dose-dependent inhibition of carbachol-stimulated increases in cellular cyclic GMP both during the initial transient large increase in cyclic GMP and the sustained increase in cyclic GMP. LY83583 also inhibited cellular Ca2+ influx during carbachol stimulation and reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool of Ca2+ at the termination of carbachol stimulation with atropine. The effect of the inhibition on reloading of the agonist-sensitive pool was secondary to its effects on the plasma membrane C2+ entry. The addition of dibutyryl cyclic GMP to LY83583-treated acini restored Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Nitroprusside increased both cellular cyclic GMP and the rate of Ca2+ influx. During periods when plasma membrane Ca2+ entry was activated, cellular cyclic GMP levels were increased. These results suggest that agonist-induced increases in cellular cyclic GMP are necessary and sufficient to mediate the effects of the agonist on the plasma membrane Ca2+ entry mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2040328923,"Our studies using proteases to probe protein structure establish that binding to the upstream activating sequences (UASs) of two different yeast a-specific genes induces a conformational change in the pheromone/receptor transcription factor (PRTF), which is not observed upon binding to the UASs of either of two α-specific genes. We propose that this selective structural alteration exposes an activation region of PRTF when it binds a-specific genes, switching these genes on. The transcriptional activator MATα1 may activate α-specific genes by binding to the PRTF-α-specific UAS complex and unmasking the otherwise hidden activation surface of PRTF. We also show that the N-terminal third of PRTF is sufficient for specific DNA binding, while the middle third of the protein interacts with MATα1."
https://openalex.org/W1521720594,"Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell membrane protein which plays a central regulatory role in the protein C anticoagulant pathway. The human thrombomodulin intronless gene was isolated from a genomic DNA library and used to isolate the coding region. A mammalian expression vector, phd-TMD1, encoding all the extracellular domains of human thrombomodulin but lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was constructed. Stable phd-TMD 1 transformants, in both hamster AV12-644 and human 293 cells, expressed functionally active recombinant thrombomodulin as a secreted, soluble product. Soluble thrombomodulin was secreted as two major proteins of 105 kDa and 75 kDa, both of which were purified to homogeneity. The kinetic properties for protein C activation of the two proteins were very different: the Kd for thrombin, Km for protein C, and Ca2+ optima were 3.0 nM, 1.5 microM, and 1-3 mM for the 105-kDa protein and 16 nM, 2.3 microM, and 0.2-0.5 mM for the 75-kDa protein. In clotting and platelet activation assays, the 105-kDa protein was a much more potent anticoagulant than the 75-kDa protein. Both forms of the protein had the amino-terminal sequence Ala19-Pro-Ala-Glu-Pro-Gln. Amino acid composition analysis indicated that both forms of the protein had the same amino acid content which was consistent with the predicted protein comprising residues Ala19 to Ser515. The difference in size appeared to be due to glycosylation as both forms were of similar size following chemical deglycosylation. These studies suggest that (1) secretable thrombomodulin derivatives can be used to study structure-function relationships of the extracellular domains of this important regulatory protein, (2) the extent of glycosylation has profound effects on the kinetic and anticoagulant properties of human thrombomodulin, and (3) soluble recombinant human thrombomodulins may be developed as clinically significant therapeutic anticoagulants."
https://openalex.org/W1571025663,"The cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex is a component of the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol-8 to ubiquinone-8 within the cytoplasmic membrane and the concomitant reduction of O2 to H2O. The hydropathy profiles of the deduced amino acid sequences suggest that all five of the gene products of the cyo operon contain multiple membrane-spanning helical segments. The goal of this work was to obtain experimental evidence for the topology of the five gene products in the cytoplasmic membrane by using the technique of gene fusions. A number of random gene fusions were generated in vitro encoding hybrid proteins in which the amino-terminal portion was provided by the subunit of interest and the carboxyl-terminal portion by one of two sensor proteins, alkaline phosphatase lacking its signal sequence or beta-galactosidase. Results obtained are self-consistent, and topological models are proposed for all of the five gene products encoded by the cyo operon. Based on the sequence similarities with subunits of the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidases, the experimental evidence obtained here can be used to infer topological models for the mitochondrial encoded subunits of the eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidases."
https://openalex.org/W2044100362,"The tricarboxylate transporter has been purified in reconstitutively active form from rat liver mitochondria. The transporter was extracted from mitoplasts with Triton X-114 in the presence of cardiolipin and citrate and was then purified by sequential chromatography on hydroxylapatite, Matrex Gel Orange A, Matrex Gel Blue B, and Affi-Gel 501. Analysis of the purified material via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of one main protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 32.5 kDa. Upon incorporation into phospholipid vesicles, the purified transporter catalyzed a 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate-sensitive citrate/citrate exchange with a specific transport activity of 3240 nmol/4 min/mg of protein. This value was enhanced 831-fold with respect to the starting material. Substrate competition studies indicated that the reconstituted transport could be substantially inhibited by isocitrate, malate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, but not by alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, malonate, pyruvate, or inorganic phosphate. Moreover, in addition to 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, the reconstituted exchange was sensitive to the anion transport inhibitor n-butylmalonate but was insensitive to phenylsuccinate, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, and carboxyatractyloside. Finally, studies with covalent modifying agents indicated the purified transporter was inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and by diethyl pyrocarbonate, 2,3-butanedione, phenylglyoxal, and pyridoxal 5-phosphate. In conclusion, these studies describe the first procedure to yield a highly purified tricarboxylate transport protein that both displays a high specific transport activity and can be obtained in quantities that readily enable further structural as well as functional studies. Based on its substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity, the purified 32.5-kDa protein appears to represent the complete tricarboxylate transport system found in rat liver mitochondria. Finally, new information is presented concerning the effect of covalent modifying reagents on the function of this transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1633445354,"The purified Na+ channel from rat brain consists of alpha (260 kDa), beta 1 (36 kDa), and beta 2 (33 kDa) subunits. Pure beta 1 subunits were prepared from purified rat brain Na+ channels which had been adsorbed to hydroxylapatite resin and used to prepare specific anti-beta 1 subunit antiserum. Antibodies purified from this antiserum by antigen affinity chromatography immunoprecipitate 125I-labeled, purified beta 1 subunits and purified Na+ channels (measured as high affinity [3H] saxitoxin binding sites) and recognize beta 1 subunits on immunoblots of solubilized rat brain membranes. The affinity-purified anti-beta 1 antibodies recognize beta 1 subunits in rat spinal cord, heart, skeletal muscle, and sciatic nerve, but do not detect immunoreactive beta 1 subunits in eel electroplax or eel brain. The developmental time course of expression of immunoreactive beta 1 subunits in rat forebrain was measured by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with affinity-purified anti-beta 1 antibodies. The amount of immunoreactive beta 1 subunits increased steadily to adult levels during the first 21 days of postnatal development."
https://openalex.org/W1579178476,"The minimal DNA duplex requirements for topoisomerase I-mediated cleavage at a specific binding sequence were determined by analyzing the interaction of the enzyme with sets of DNA substrates varying successively by single nucleotides at the 5'- or 3' end of either strand. Topoisomerase I cleavage experiments showed a minimal region of nine nucleotides on the scissile strand and five nucleotides on the noncleaved strand. On the scissile strand, seven of the nine nucleotides were situated upstream to the cleavage site, while all five nucleotides required on the non-cleaved strand were located to this side. The results suggested that topoisomerase I bound tightly to this region, stabilizing the DNA duplex extensively. On minimal substrates which were partially single-stranded downstream to the cleavage site, cleavage was suicidal, that is, the enzyme was able to cleave the substrates, but unable to perform the final religation."
https://openalex.org/W1887714095,"The bacteriophage lambda P protein promoters replication of the phage chromosome by recruiting a key component of the cellular replication machinery to the viral origin. Specifically, P protein delivers one or more molecules of Escherichia coli DnaB helicase to a nucleoprotein structure formed by the lambda O initiator at the lambda replication origin. Using purified proteins, we have examined the features of the pivotal host virus interaction between P and DnaB. These two proteins interact in vitro to form a P.DnaB protein complex that can be resolved by sedimentation or by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose from the individual free proteins. The sedimentation coefficient of the P.DnaB complex, 13 S, suggests a size larger than that of free DnaB hexamer (Mr = 313,600). The P.DnaB complex isolated by glycerol gradient sedimentation contains approximately three protomers of P/DnaB hexamer, consistent with a molecular weight of 393,000. The isolated P.DnaB complex functions in vitro in the initiation of lambda DNA replication. Interaction of P with DnaB strongly suppressed both the intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase activity of DnaB, as well as the capacity of DnaB to assist E. coli primase in the general priming reaction. Formation of a P.DnaB protein complex also blocked DnaB from functioning in the initiation of E. coli DNA replication in vitro. The physical and functional properties of lambda P protein suggest that it is a viral analogue of the E. coli DnaC replication protein. Like P, DnaC also binds to DnaB (Wickner, S., and Hurwitz, J. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 72, 921-925), but unlike P, DnaC stimulates DnaB-mediated general priming. When viral P and bacterial DnaC replication proteins were placed in direct competition with one another for binding to DnaB, the viral protein was clearly predominant. For example, a 5-fold molar excess of DnaC protein only partially reversed the inhibitory effect of P on general priming. Furthermore, when a preformed DnaC.DnaB protein complex was incubated briefly with P protein, it was readily converted into a P.DnaB protein complex and the bulk of the bound DnaC was released as free protein. It is likely that the capacity of the lambda P protein to outcompete the analogous host protein for binding to the bacterial DnaB helicase is the critical molecular event enabling infecting phage to recruit cellular replication proteins required for initiation of DNA synthesis at the viral origin."
https://openalex.org/W2124536238,"A protein that stimulates DNA polymerase alpha/primase many-fold on unprimed poly(dT) was purified to homogeneity from extracts of cultured mouse cells. The protein contains polypeptides of approximately 132 and 44 kDa, and the total molecular mass of 150 kDa calculated from Stokes radius (54 A) and sedimentation coefficient (6.7 S) indicates that it contains one each of the two subunits. The purified accessory factor (AAF) also stimulates DNA polymerase alpha/primase in the self-primed reaction with unprimed single-stranded DNA. In addition to these effects on the coordinate activities of DNA polymerase alpha and DNA primase, stimulatory effects were also demonstrated separately on both the polymerase and primase activities of the enzyme complex. However, there was no stimulation with DNase-treated (activated) DNA under normal conditions for assay of DNA polymerase alpha. The stimulatory activity of mouse AAF is highly specific for DNA polymerase alpha/primase; no effect was observed with mouse DNA polymerases beta, gamma, or delta, nor with retroviral, bacteriophage, or bacterial DNA polymerases. Mouse AAF stimulated human DNA polymerase alpha/primase with several different templates, similar to results with the mouse enzyme. However, it had very little effect on the DNA polymerase/primase from either Drosophila embryo or from yeast."
https://openalex.org/W1629406534,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) activates a broad range of myeloid cells through binding to high affinity surface membrane receptors. The effects of this hematopoietin are dependent upon the differentiation status of the myeloid cell and range from proliferation of early myeloid progenitor cells to activation of neutrophil and monocyte function. In addition, many of the biological effects of GM-CSF are shared with interleukin-3 (IL-3), a distantly related lymphokine. In this study, we have characterized the GM-CSF receptor of myeloid cells at various stages of differentiation by comparing the binding characteristics and surface regulation of this receptor in early versus late myeloid cells. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high affinity receptors on normal neutrophils, monocytes, and myeloblasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Neutrophils expressed significantly higher numbers of receptors, with an approximately 2-fold lower affinity, when compared with other myeloid cells. Two different patterns of GM-CSF receptor regulation and binding were observed. In the first pattern, the GM-CSF receptor of neutrophils was rapidly down-regulated by GM-CSF itself, by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), and by the calcium ionophore A23187, and it was not competed for by IL-3 (class I receptor). In contrast to the neutrophil receptor, the GM-CSF receptor of the myeloblast demonstrated resistance to the down-regulatory effects of GM-CSF itself, PMA, and A23187, and it was completely competed for by IL-3 (class II receptor). In some cases of acute myeloid leukemia and monocytes, a mixed pattern of partial PMA responsiveness and partial competition by unlabeled IL-3 was observed, suggesting the coexpression of both class I and II receptors in these cells. In these cells, after down-regulation of the class I receptor by PMA, the remaining receptors were shown to be completely cross-competed for by IL-3, further supporting the hypothesis that these cells have a mixture of class I and II receptors. Chemical cross-linking of radiolabeled GM-CSF to myeloid cells revealed the labeling of three proteins (156, 126, and 82 kDa) which were identical in cells expressing either class I or II binding sites. These data show that there are differentiation-associated differences in the regulation of the GM-CSF receptor which may have important physiological consequences."
https://openalex.org/W1573824422,"Alternative splicing of the c-erbA alpha gene transcript generates mRNAs encoding a thyroid hormone (T3) receptor (alpha 1) and a non-T3-binding variant (alpha 2). Also encoded at this genomic locus is Rev-ErbA alpha (Rev), a non-T3-binding member of the T3/steroid hormone receptor family. The DNA strand coding for Rev is opposite of that encoding the c-erbA alpha proteins, such that bidirectional transcription is required to generate the Rev and alpha 2 mRNAs. We have used cycloheximide as a tool for studying the regulation of gene expression from this complex genomic locus. In 235-1 cells cycloheximide treatment increased Rev mRNA levels by 50-100-fold. The effect was detectable after a 1-2-h incubation with 20 micrograms/ml cycloheximide and maximal at 24 h. The cycloheximide-induced increase in Rev gene expression was due to inhibition of protein synthesis since anisomycin caused a similar induction of Rev mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays revealed an approximately 10-fold increase in the transcriptional rate of the Rev gene during cycloheximide treatment. In addition, cycloheximide stabilized the Rev mRNA, as evidenced by half-life determinations in the presence of actinomycin D (5 ng/ml). Thus, labile proteins repress basal Rev gene expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Cycloheximide treatment also increased alpha 1 and decreased alpha 2 mRNA levels, with the alpha 1/alpha 2 ratio increasing approximately 10-fold. Interestingly, however, these effects appeared not to be due to changes in rates of transcription or degradation of either mRNA. A likely alternative, given the structure of the c-erbA alpha gene, is that inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in a change in the c-erbA alpha splicing pattern. We hypothesize that this may be causally related to the accumulation of Rev mRNA (or the nascent Rev gene transcript), which could inhibit splicing to alpha 2 by hybridizing to complementary sequences, favoring alpha 1 mRNA production. Since alpha 1 is a T3 receptor whereas alpha 2 is an inhibitor of T3 action, such changes could influence target cell responsiveness to T3."
https://openalex.org/W1535881345,"Rat pancreatic acini loaded with the pH sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein were used to characterize intracellular pH (pHi) regulatory mechanisms in these cells. The acini were attached to cover slips and continuously perfused. In 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered solutions recovery from acid load (H+ efflux) required extracellular Na+ (Na+out) and was blocked by amiloride. Likewise, H+ influx initiated by removal of Na+out was blocked by amiloride. Hence, in HEPES-buffered medium the major operative pHi regulatory mechanism is a Na+/H+ exchange. In HCO3(-)-buffered medium, amiloride only partially blocked recovery from acid load and acidification due to Na+out removal. The remaining fraction required Na+out, was inhibited by H2-4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfunic acid (H2DIDS) and was independent of C1-. Hence, a transporter with characteristics of a Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport exists in pancreatic acini. Measurement of pHi changes due to Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport, suggests that the transporter contributes to HCO3- efflux under physiological conditions. Changing the Cl- gradient across the plasma membrane of acini maintained in HCO3(-)-buffered solutions reveals the presence of an H2DIDS-sensitive, Na(+)-independent, Cl(-)-dependent, HCO3- transporter with characteristics of a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger. In pancreatic acini the exchanger transports HCO3- but not OH- and under physiological conditions functions to remove HCO3- from the cytosol. In summary, only the Na+/H+ exchanger is functional in HEPES-buffered medium to maintain pHi at 7.28 +/- 0.03. In the presence of 25 mM HCO3- at pHo of 7.4, all the transporters operate simultaneously to maintain a steady-state pHi of 7.13 +/- 0.04."
https://openalex.org/W2094890765,"Glutamate neurotoxicity is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. While prolonged activation of either NMDA or non-NMDA receptors causes neuronal damage, NMDA receptors appear to mediate most of the glutamate toxicity. The reasons why NMDA toxicity predominates are uncertain but may relate to more effective neuroprotective mechanisms acting at non-NMDA receptors. To determine whether desensitization is one such mechanism, we studied the effects of the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) on quisqualate currents and toxicity in cultured postnatal rat hippocampal neurons. After WGA treatment, quisqualate currents exhibit little desensitization and a 4- to 8-fold increase in steady-state amplitude. WGA also markedly augments the degree of acute, quisqualate-induced neuronal degeneration. These results suggest that non-NMDA desensitization serves a neuroprotective function in hippocampal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2048232849,"Murine minor lymphocyte-stimulating (Mls) determinants are cell surface antigens that stimulate strong primary T cell responses; the responding T cells display restricted T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ gene usage. Interaction of T cells with mitogens or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens activated the polyphosphoinositide (PI) signaling pathway, but this pathway was not triggered by Mls recognition. However, interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion and proliferation to all three stimuli were comparable. Thus, although recognition of both allo-H-2 and Mls determinants is thought to be mediated by the TCR, these antigens appear to elicit biochemically distinct signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2147051030,"The ryanodine receptor/junctional channel complex (JCC) has been isolated and identified morphologically as the foot structure spanning the gap between sarcoplasmic reticulum and the transverse tubule. Functionally, the JCC contains the calcium release channel which mediates calcium release in excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle. The three-dimensional structure of the JCC, obtained by image analyses of electron micrographs, reveals two distinct faces and an efflux pathway indicated by a central pore with a diameter of approximately 20 A and four radial canals leading to the myoplasm. The JCC consists of four identical protomers, with Mr = 565,233 each. In the present study, proteolytic digestion of native JCC was carried out to obtain insight into its surface topography. Peptides generated by cleavages with endoproteinases Lys-C and Glu-C were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and sequenced. Twenty-four cleavage sites have been identified and are equated to surface exposed peptides. Surface probability analysis, combined with protease sensitivity, has been used to provide independent information identifying sequences with high likelihood of appearing on the surface. This analysis also predicts sequences with low surface probability which may be buried within the hydrophobic core of the structure. Furthermore, regions of high surface probability, not cleaved by proteases, are potential candidates for surface-surface association and/or the hydrophilic internal calcium efflux pathway."

The amino acid sequence of the protein was determined to 20 amino acids and proved to be identical to that of the major androgen-dependent proteins from rat epididymis as deduced from the cDNA sequence. These proteins are thought to play a role in sperm maturation, perhaps, it can be suggested now, by delivering retinoic acid to the sperm. The retinoic acid-binding protein has sequence homology to the serum retinol-binding protein and is predicted to have the same overall fold of the polypeptide chain. The epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein has been crystallized from 39 to 43% saturated ammonium sulfate, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0.

The solubilized VIP receptor has been purified approximately 50,000-fold to apparent homogeneity by a one-step affinity chromatography using a newly designed VIP-polyacrylamide resin. The purified receptor bound 125I-VIP with a Kd of 22.3 +/- 0.7 nM and retained its peptide specificity toward VIP-related peptides. The specific activity of the purified receptor (16,400 pmol/mg of protein) was very close to the theoretical value (18,900 pmol/mg of protein) calculated assuming one binding site/protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified receptor revealed a single band with an Mr of 53,000 after either silver staining or radioiodination. Affinity labeling of the purified receptor with 125I-VIP using dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) gave a single radioactive band, the labeling of which was completely inhibited by an excess of unlabeled VIP. In conclusion, an Mr 53,000 protein containing the VIP-binding site was purified to homogeneity by a one-step affinity chromatography using immobilized VIP."
https://openalex.org/W1522309317,"There is continuing controversy as to whether iron can be exchanged from the purple phosphatase, uteroferrin (Uf), to fetal transferrin (Tf) and whether this process might be of physiological relevance during pregnancy in the pig. Here, iron transfer from Uf to apoTf at pH 7.1 was followed by measuring the loss of acid phosphatase activity from native Uf as a function of incubation conditions and time. In the presence of apoTf and 1 mM ascorbate (but not in the presence of either agent alone), 50% of enzyme activity was lost in about 12 h. Loss of activity was accompanied by bleaching of Uf purple color and the appearance of the characteristic visual absorption spectrum of Fe-Tf. Citrate could replace ascorbate in the reaction. Loss of Uf iron did not occur at pH 5.3, at which pH Tf cannot bind Fe. [59Fe]Uf was prepared and shown to be identical in its enzymatic and physical properties with unmodified Uf. Transfer of 59Fe from Uf to apo-Tf was promoted by conditions identical to those which led to loss of purple color and acid phosphatase activity. However, the results suggested that only one of the two iron atoms at the bi-iron center on Uf was readily lost, and that exchange of the second iron occurred more slowly. Loss of iron made Uf more susceptible to denaturation. A third technique, quantitation of the g' = 4.3 signal of iron specifically bound to Tf by EPR, was also tested as a means assaying accumulation of Fe-Tf, but the method was too insensitive to measure the kinetics of iron transfer at physiological protein concentrations. We conclude that iron can be transferred directly from Uf to apoTf in the presence of low molecular weight chelators, and that the process is likely to be of physiological significance."

https://openalex.org/W1603459178,"Pancreatic acini loaded with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein were used to examine the effect of Ca2(+)-mobilizing agonists on the activity of acid-base transporters in these cells. In the accompanying article (Muallen, S., and Loessberg, P. A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12813-12819) we showed that in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-buffered medium the main pHi regulatory mechanism is the Na+/H+ exchanger, a while in HCO3(-)-buffered medium pHi is determined by the combined activities of a Na+/H+ exchanger, a Na(+)-HCO3- cotransporter and a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger. In this study we found that stimulation of acini with Ca2(+)-mobilizing agonists in HEPES or HCO3(-)-buffered media is followed by an initial acidification which is independent of any identified plasma membrane-located acid-base transporting mechanism, and thus may represent intracellularly produced acid. In HEPES-buffered medium there was a subsequent large alkalinization to pHi above that in resting cells, which could be attributed to the Na+/H+ exchanger. Measurements of the rate of recovery from acid load indicated that the Na+/H+ exchanger was stimulated by the agonists. In HCO3(-)-buffered medium the alkalinization observed after the initial acidification was greatly attenuated. Examination of the activity of each acid-base transporting mechanism in stimulated acini showed that in HCO3(-)-buffered medium: (a) recovery from acid load in the presence of H2-4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (H2DIDS) (Na+/H+ exchange) was stimulated similar to that found in HEPES-buffered medium; (b) recovery from acid load in the presence of amiloride and acidification due to removal of external Na+ in the presence of amiloride (HCO3- influx and efflux, respectively, by Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport) were inhibited; and (c) HCO3- influx and efflux due to Cl-/HCO3- exchange, which was measured by changing the Cl- or HCO3- gradients across the plasma membrane, were stimulated. Furthermore, the rate of Cl-/HCO3- exchange in stimulated acini was higher than the sum of H+ efflux due to Na+/H+ exchange and HCO3- influx due to Na(+)-HCO3- cotransport. Use of H2DIDS showed that the latter accounted for the attenuated changes in pHi in HCO3(-)-buffered medium, as much as treating the acini with H2DIDS resulted in similar agonist-mediated pHi changes in HEPES- and HCO3(-)-buffered media. The effect of agonists on the various acid-base transporting mechanisms is discussed in terms of their possible role in transcellular NaCl transport, cell volume regulation, and cell proliferation in pancreatic acini."

The proposed consensus DNA site for E. coli FNR is 5'-AAATTTGATATATATCAAATTT-3'. In this report, we show that substitution of 2 base pairs (1 base pair per DNA half-site) within the E. coli lac DNA site for CAP suffices to remove the lac promoter from the CAP regulon and to place the lac promoter in the FNR regulon. FNR stimulates transcription of the derivative of the lac promoter having G:C----T:A substitutions at base pair 5 each DNA half-site (13-fold stimulation). FNR does not stimulate transcription of the wild-type lac promoter, or of derivatives of the lac promoter having G:C----A:T or G:C----C:G substitutions at base pair 5 of each DNA half-site. Stimulation of transcription is strictly dependent on anaerobiosis. FNR-stimulated transcription initiates at the same base pair as does CAP-dependent transcription of the wild-type lac promoter."

(1980) Virology 105, 205-222) are also capable of inhibiting membrane fusion in a pure lipid vesicle system. Large unilamellar vesicles of N-methyl dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine containing encapsulated 1-aminonaphthalene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid and/or p-xylene bis (pyridinium bromide) were formed by extrusion. Vesicle fusion (contents mixing) and leakage were then monitored with the 1-aminonaphthalene-3,6,8-trisulfonic acid/p-xylene bis(pyridinium bromide) fluorescence assay. Sendai virus fusion with lipid vesicles was measured by following the relief of fluorescence quenching of virus labeled with octadecylrhodamine B chloride, a lipid mixing assay for fusion. The efficiency with which the peptides carbobenzoxy-D-Phe-L-PheGly, carbobenzoxy-L-Phe-L-Tyr, and carbobenz-oxy-Gly-L-Phe inhibit fusion of N-methyl dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine large unilamellar vesicles directly paralleled their previously known effectiveness in blocking virus infectivity of cultured cells. In addition, above a certain concentration threshold, the inhibitory peptides decreased the initial rate of leakage from lipid vesicles. The inhibition by these peptides of virus-vesicle fusion followed the same order of potency as for vesicle-vesicle fusion. The observation of the same relative potency of these peptides toward inhibition of virus-cell infection, and virus-vesicle and vesicle-vesicle membrane fusion suggested that these peptides inhibited virus-cell infection by inhibiting the ability of the virus to fuse with the cell. Furthermore, these results suggest that the mechanism of inhibition of all three fusion events may have steps in common."
https://openalex.org/W1523046507,"The catalytic subunits of asymmetric and hydrophobic forms of acetylcholinesterase arise from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing. Each protein is encoded in three exons, with exons 1 and 2 encoding sequence common to both forms and exons 3A and 3H specifying unique carboxyl-terminal domains. We examined the expression of cDNAs for the two forms by transient transfection in COS-1 cells. The catalytic subunit of the asymmetric form expressed by transfected cells exhibits low activity and is retained within the cell. The cDNA encoding hydrophobic acetylcholinesterase directs the synthesis of enzyme with much greater activity, which is expressed on the outer surface of the cell membrane and can be released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. A mutant truncated acetylcholinesterase which lacks either carboxyl-terminal sequence encoded by the alternative exons is secreted into the medium. An exon 1-3H fusion mutant, created by deletion of coding exon 2 from the hydrophobic form cDNA, is glycophospholipid-linked. The 30-amino acid carboxyl-terminal domain specified by exon 3H appears necessary and sufficient to direct glycophospholipid attachment. Thus, heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant acetylcholinesterase proteins indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domains specified by alternative coding exons determine the cellular dispositions of acetylcholinesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1601564120,"Cholesterol sulfate is a component of several biological membranes. In erythrocytes, cholesterol sulfate inhibits hypotonic hemolysis, while in sperm, it can decrease fertilization efficiency. We have found cholesterol sulfate to be a potent inhibitor of Sendai virus fusion to both human erythrocyte and liposomal membranes. Cholesterol sulfate also raises the bilayer to hexagonal phase transition temperature of dielaidoyl phosphatidylethanolamine as demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Although hexagonal phase structures are not readily found in biological membranes, there is a correlation between the effects of membrane additives on bilayer/non-bilayer equilibria and membrane stabilization. It is proposed that the ability of cholesterol sulfate to alter the physical properties of membranes contributes to its stabilization of biological membranes and the inhibition of membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1587827058,"A binding site for thrombomodulin on human thrombin (alpha-thrombin) was elucidated by identifying an epitope for a monoclonal antibody for thrombin (MT-6) which inhibited the activation of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex by directly inhibiting the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin. An 8.5-kDa fragment isolated by digestion of thrombin with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease followed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a peptide isolated by reversed-phase HPLC after reduction of the 8.5-kDa fragment, which was composed of three peptides linked by disulfide-bonds, bound directly to MT-6 and thrombomodulin. The amino acid sequence of the peptide coincided with the sequence of residues Thr-147 to Asp-175 of the B-chain of thrombin. A synthetic peptide corresponding to Thr-147 to Ser-158 of the B-chain inhibited the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin. Elastase-digested thrombin, which was cleaved between Ala-150 and Asn-151, lost its binding affinity for both MT-6 and thrombomodulin. These findings indicate that the binding site for thrombomodulin is located within the sequence between Thr-147 and Ser-158 of the B-chain."

Since the metabolic removal of DAG is determined, in large part, by the rate of its phosphorylation by diglyceride kinase, we quantified differences in the activity of diglyceride kinase utilizing individual subclasses of diradyl glycerols as substrate. Rabbit brain microsomal diglyceride kinase activity was over 30-fold greater utilizing DAG as substrate (25.8 nmol.mg-1.min-1) in comparison to AAG (0.8 nmol.mg-1.min-1). No alterations in the affinity of microsomal diglyceride kinase for ATP were present (Km approximately 0.5 mM) utilizing each diradyl glycerol subclass. Similar subclass specificities for diglyceride kinase (i.e. DAG greater than Alkyl AG much greater than AAG) were present in brain and liver cytosol as well as in liver microsomes utilizing multiple assay conditions. In sharp contrast, Escherichia coli diglyceride kinase phosphorylated DAG, Alkyl AG, or AAG diradyl glycerol molecular subclasses at identical rates. Furthermore, although DAG was rapidly hydrolyzed by diglyceride lipase, catabolism of AAG or Alkyl AG by plasmalogenase, alkyl ether hydrolase, or diglyceride/monoglyceride lipase was undetectable. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of the differential catabolism of each diradyl glycerol molecular subclass as a primary determinant of their biologic half-lives. Since individual subclasses of diglycerides have distinct physical properties and physiologic functions, these results underscore the importance of lipid subclass specific metabolism in tailoring individual cellular responses during activation."
https://openalex.org/W1562825561,"In order to delineate structural-functional relationships of the mast cell receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) by molecular-genetic analysis, a transfectable cell must be identified which resembles mast cells except for being deficient in receptors. We have found that the well known murine mastocytoma P815 is suitable. These cells express no Fc epsilon RI, lack mRNA for the alpha and beta subunits of the receptor, but contain some mRNA for gamma chains. After transfection with the cDNA for each of the subunits, stable clones could be isolated which expressed several hundred thousand normal Fc epsilon RI and synthesized large amounts of mRNA for alpha, beta, and gamma, the last at 3-fold higher levels than in the untransfected cells. Aggregation of the transfected receptors led to opening of presumptive calcium channels and to activation of phospholipase C, phospholipase A2, and protein kinase C. The kinetics and other characteristics of the signals were similar to those observed after stimulation of the rat tumor mast cells from which the receptor genetic material had been derived but were smaller in magnitude. These weaker signals most likely result from an overall reduced reactivity exhibited by the P815 cells since stimulation by other ligands led to weaker or even no responses. The cells failed to degranulate after either receptor aggregation or reaction with ionophores with or without phorbol ester. Both the transfected and untransfected P815 cells express Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma RII) which, interestingly, independently triggered similar responses despite their apparently simpler subunit structure."
https://openalex.org/W1601682751,"We analyzed the kinetics and thermodynamics of 125I-nerve growth factor (125I-NGF) binding to NGF-receptor on PC12 cells. We used conditions of pseudo-first order kinetics and techniques to quantitate internalized complexes, or high affinity binding complexes, and cell surface fast or low affinity complexes. Two possible models were examined: binding to two independent receptors at the cell surface (i.e. high and low affinity forms of NGF-receptor) and a model for consecutive formation of fast, low affinity binding followed by slow, high affinity binding or internalization. Our data are consistent with the consecutive model only. The rates of association and dissociation of NGF with slow, high affinity sites and internalized, acid wash-resistant sites are indistinguishable from each other. We also analyzed, in detail, the two assays primarily used to distinguish slow binding complexes from internalized complexes. Scatchard analysis of total binding and dissociation of pre-equilibrated 125I-NGF in the presence of unlabeled NGF at high concentration (cold wash). Neither of these assays shows any evidence that the slow, high affinity binding step is different from internalization of the 125I-NGF-receptor complex. Based on this analysis, there are only two detectable forms of NGF-receptor on PC12 cells: complexes on the surface of the cells with a binding affinity of 0.5 nM at 37 degrees C and complexes internalized by the cells. Furthermore, the data are consistent with a model in which NGF-receptor is internalized constitutively and independently of occupancy by NGF. We also examined the fate of internalized 125I-NGF. In the first 60 min after contact with PC12 cells, no degradation of 125I-NGF was observed. Moreover, a significant amount of 125I-NGF recirculates to the cell surface and is released as intact, Mr = 13,000 NGF. The cells were also stimulated by NGF in a primary neurite outgrowth assay with an ED50 of 2-16 pM under conditions of low initial cell numbers in a large extracellular volume of NGF-containing medium. Thus, low level occupancy of the cell surface receptors, Kd = 0.5 nM, for several days is sufficient to stimulate neurite outgrowth. This indicates the presence of spare NGF-receptors on the surface PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1573996893,"The cloned long terminal repeats (LTRs) of mouse intracisternal A-particle (IAP) proviral elements differ in their promoter activity. In this study, the LTR from a recently transposed IAP element (rc-mos) is shown to be a more effective promoter both in vivo and in vitro than the LTR from a randomly cloned genomic element (MIA14). These LTRs differ in nucleotide sequence in certain previously defined protein-binding domains. In particular, the MIA14 LTR contains two domains, designated Enh1 and Enh2, with sequence homology to the SV40 enhancer core motif, while in rc-mos the position is occupied by a variant sequence which lacks core homology. EBP-80 is a general enhancer core-binding protein originally isolated by virtue of its affinity for the MIA14 sequence (Falzon, M., and Kuff, E.L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 21915-21922). We now find by quantitative binding studies, binding competition, and UV cross-linking that EBP-80 from both human and mouse cells binds to the Enh2 motif of rc-mos more strongly than to the of MIA14. In vitro transcription from both LTRs is strongly enhanced by addition of EBP-80 showing that binding is related to function. The rc-mos LTR remains the more effective promoter in the presence of added EBP-80. Reciprocal substitution of the domains in the two LTRs by site-directed mutagenesis shows that the rc-mos variant confers a 3-fold increment in in vivo promotor activity. The rc-mos motif or a closely related sequence is found in the cloned LTRs of many expressed and/or recently transposed IAP elements. EBP-80 is identified as a cellular transcription factor whose heightened levels in certain mouse cells might result in preferential expression of IAP elements containing this sequence motif."

https://openalex.org/W1518456569,"Gyrase-mediated DNA cleavage on plasmid DNAs was measured in Escherichia coli treated with oxolinic acid. On pBR322 DNA, gyrase cleavage sites were concentrated in the region between the 3'-ends of the tetA and bla genes. The preferential cleavage in this region was dependent on RNA transcription and the divergent orientation of these two transcription units. The enhanced gyrase cleavage also required translation; chloramphenicol treatment or the insertion of a translation terminator within the 5'-proximal region of the tetA gene abolished the enhanced cleavage. We suggest that the enhanced gyrase cleavage may reflect the changes in local DNA supercoiling during RNA transcription as gyrase cleavage in vitro was shown to be sensitive to the supercoiling state of DNA. The effects of transcription and translation on gyrase cleavage can best be explained by the twin-supercoiled-domain model of transcription (Liu, L. F., and Wang, J. C. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The NCI-H69 cell alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase was obtained from a 0.2% Triton X-100-solubilized enzyme fraction after affinity purification on a GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column and gel filtration through a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 column. Increasing concentrations of the photoaffinity reagent were found to result in loss of up to 35% of the original enzyme activity at under 100 microM final concentrations. The inactivation was photolysis dependent and could be prevented by the addition of GDP-fucose prior to photolysis. The photoprobe behaved as a competitive inhibitor with respect to GDP-fucose with a Ki of 23 microM, identical to that of GDP. Photoincorporation of 125I-labeled GDP-hexanolaminyl-4-azidosalicylic acid into the enzyme fraction labeled a slow migrating protein band in a native polyacrylamide gel which corresponded to enzyme activity. Inclusion of GDP-fucose prevented photolabeling of this band. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the photolabeled, GDP-fucose-protected band yielded a 125I-labeled protein band that migrated at Mr 45,000, most probably corresponding to an alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase protein subunit. These studies suggest photoaffinity labeling using nucleotide affinity ligands linked to photoactivatable, heterobifunctional cross-linking reagents may be generally applicable to photoaffinity labeling glycosyltransferase enzyme proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1551836852,"We have evaluated potential molecular mechanisms by which a group of synthetic lymphokine-like molecules, the 7,8-disubstituted guanine ribonucleosides, acts on second messenger pathways to augment the responses of murine B lymphocytes. Despite its extensive structural homology with GTP, 7-methyl-8-oxoguanosine (7-Me-8-oGuo), a prototypical disubstituted nucleoside, does not inhibit the binding of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate either to purified G-proteins, or to G-proteins in situ in the plasma membrane. In contrast to anti-IgM antibodies, 7-Me-8-oGuo fails to induce elevation of intracellular free calcium in B lymphocytes. It does not elicit enhanced production of inositol phosphates in either unfractionated or large, cycling B cells (the cells on which it acts preferentially). It is unable to modify the cellular distribution or activity of protein kinase C, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, anti-IgD antibodies, and lipopolysaccharide do activate protein kinase C. Inhibitors of protein kinase C activity diminish stimulation of mRNA transcription by anti-IgD antibodies and lipopolysaccharide but not by 7-Me-8-oGuo. These data demonstrate that 7-Me-8-oGuo either uses a pathway distinct from that mediated by G-proteins, intracellular free calcium, inositol phosphates, and protein kinase C, or else bypasses the early events of this pathway, activating the cell at a point beyond their involvement. In either event, these nucleosides represent the only class of activator to date that is capable of driving B cell proliferation and differentiation without involvement of protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1510289463,"The pregnenolone-binding protein (PBP) in guinea pig adrenocortical cytosol is inactivated (converted to a nonsteroid-binding form) by incubation with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase at pH 9. Previously bound pregnenolone does not prevent this inactivation, and dephosphorylation causes dissociation of bound ligand from the protein. Cytosolic PBP, partially purified PBP, and highly purified PBP are equally susceptible to alkaline phosphatase-mediated inactivation. No change in apparent molecular weight or immunoreactivity is evident by Western blot analysis. Loss of pregnenolone-binding capacity of cytosolic PBP (but not partially purified PBP) could be reversed by inhibiting the phosphatase, lowering the pH to approximately 7, and adding ATP to the incubation. Reactivation is absolutely and specifically dependent upon ATP, which restores binding capacity in a concentration-dependent manner. Other nucleoside triphosphates, including the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate, as well as cAMP and cGMP are ineffectual as cofactors for reactivation. These data strongly implicate a cytosolic kinase which is apparently inactivated or separated from PBP during purification. Preliminary investigations indicate that the reactivating kinase is not cAMP-dependent, but may have a requirement for calcium and/or calmodulin. The identification of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as the regulatory mechanism for steroid binding should prove pivital in elucidating the functional role of PBP."
