https://openalex.org/W1570227839,"In crude extracts of adipose tissue the protein kinase dissociates slowly at 30 degrees into regulatory and catalytic subunits in the presence of 700 mug per ml of histone or 0.5 M NaCl. If the kinase is first dissociated by adding 10 muM adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP), reassociation occurs instantaneously after removal of the cAMP by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. In contrast, in crude xtracts of heart, the protein kinase dissociates rapidly in the presence of 700 mug per ml of histone or 0.5 M NaCl and reassociates slowly after removal of cAMP. These differences are accounted for by the existence of two types of protein kinases in these tissues, referred to as types I and II. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of extracts of adipose tissue produces only one peak of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (type II) which elutes between 0.15 and 0.25 M NaCl. Similar chromatography of heart extracts resolves enzyme activity into two peaks; a type I enzyme which elutes between 0.05 and 0.1 M and predominates (greater than 75% of total activity), and a type II enzyme which elutes between 0.15 and 0.25 M NaCl. The dissociation properties of the types I and II enzymes from heart and adipose tissue are retained after partial purification by DEAE-cellulose and Sepharose 6B chromatography. Rechromatography of the separated peaks of the cardiac enzymes does not change the elution pattern. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration studies indicate that the molecular weights of these enzymes are very similar. The type II enzyme isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography of heart extracts resembles the adipose tissue enzyme, i.e. it undergoes slow dissociation at 30 degrees in the presence of histone or 0.5 M NaCl. The adipose tissue kinase and the heart type II kinase are not identical, however, since they do not elute at exactly the same point on DEAE-cellulose columns. A survey of several tissues indicates the presence of type I and II protein kinases similar to the enzymes in adipose tissue and heart as determined by DEAE-cellulose chromatography of crude extracts and by dissociation of the enzymes with histone. The presence of MgATP prevents dissociation of type I enzyme from heart by 0.5 M NaCl or histone. The profile of the enzyme on DEAE-cellulose, however, is not changed..."

https://openalex.org/W1972398797,The 5' terminal structure of the mRNA synthesized in vitro by the virion-associated RNA polymerase of vesicular stomatitis virus in the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methione consists of 7-methyl guanosine linked to 2'-O-methyl adenosine through a 5'-5' pyrophosphate bond as m7G(5')ppp(5')A-m-p ... The alpha and beta phosphated of GTP and alpha phosphate of ATP are incorporated into the blocked 5' terminal structure.
https://openalex.org/W1586344435,"Both cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate and dithiothreitol stimulate binding of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) to aggregation-competent amoebae. Both compounds appear to function solely by preventing the hydrolysis of cAMP by the cell-bound phosphodiesterase. The dissociation constant for binding of cAMP is 36 nM. Both cAMP binding and membrane-bound phosphodiesterase activities increase dramatically as cells develop aggregation competence, reach a maximum at about 11 hours, and remain at high levels for up to 48 hours if cells are maintained in shaken suspension. When amoebae are allowed to aggregate and develop naturally, binding of cAMP increases during aggregation, decreases during tip formation, and disappears during culmination. Phosphodiesterase activity parallels binding activity except that the decreased level after tip formation is retained throughout culmination. Two N-6-modified cAMP derivatives compete with cAMP for binding sites. One derivative is fluorescent (1,N-6-etheno-cAMP); the other is photolyzable [N-6(ethyl-2-diazomalonyl)cAMP]. This result opens the possibilities of using fluorescence quenching for assay of in vitro binding and of affinity labeling of binding sites. Competition by the derivatives is only partial, indicating possible heterogeneity of binding sites. Both compounds inhibit hydrolysis of cAMP by the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase."

https://openalex.org/W1550981166,"In previous studies, the insulin resistance of the obese hyperglycemic mouse (ob/ob) was found to be associated with decreased insulin binding to liver, fat, and lymphocytes. The present study demonstrates that the insulin receptors in the liver membranes of the ob/ob mouse are decreased in number, but are indistinguishable from normal by other criteria including affinity, kinetics of association and dissociation, temperature dependence of binding, and biological specificity of the binding reaction. The receptor in liver membranes of the ob/ob mouse is also indistinguishable with respect to insulin receptor site-site interactions. Degradation of both insulin and of receptor sites was studied and did not account for differences observed in binding. We conclude that the insulin receptor from the ob/ob mouse is a functionally normal receptor and that its presence in diminished number accounts for the observed decrease in insulin binding to liver plasma membranes."

The effect, which is specific for the anomeric linkage and the glycone, is observed in the presence and absence of puromycin. Beta-Xylosides may substitute for xylosylated core protein as initiators of synthesis of chondroitin sulfate chains. No stimulation of synthesis of heparan sulfate was observed. With the use of a fluorogenic xyloside, 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside, it was demonstrated that the free chondroitin sulfate chains secreted into the medium bear the xyloside at the reducing end, and have an average molecular weight of 16,500."
https://openalex.org/W1567050319,"Abstract C-I was prepared from very low density lipoproteins of patients with familial type V hyperliporproteinemia. Peptides from tryptic digests of unmodified and succinylated C-I, chymotryptic peptides, and the products of cayanogen bromide cleavage were isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptides was performed by the dansyl (5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl) technique and hydrolytic regeneration of the amino acid residues from the phenylthiocarbamyl derivatives. Alignment of the tryptic fragments within the cyanogen bromide and succinyl-tryptic peptides was confirmed by the overlap chymotryptic peptides. The complete amino acid sequence of C-I, 57 residues in length, does not reveal any obvious basis for its lipophilic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1978515769,"Methyl groups derived from 3H-methyl methionine were incorporated into vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNAs isolated from infected cells. Sequential degradation of the 12–18S viral mRNA species with ribonuclease T2, penicillium nuclease, and alkaline phosphatase yielded a single 3H-labeled dinucleotide. A similar resistant 32P-labeled fragment was obtained by digesting VSV mRNA uniformly labeled with 32P. This methylated and blocked oligomer was further cleaved with nucleotide pyrophosphatase, yielding two methylated 5′ nucleotides. We postulate that the 5′ terminal structure of the in vivo 12–18S VSV mRNA contains 7-methylguanosine linked by a 5′-5′ pyrophosphate bond to a methylated derivative of adenosine. In contrast to the mRNAs (+ strand), the VSV genome RNA (− strand) is not blocked."

Substantial but not complete protection was observed in animals immunized and challenged with herpes simplex virus type 1, but no protection was noted in animals immunized and challenged with herpes simplex virus type 2. Latent ganglionic infection can develop in immunized animals despite the presence of high titers of neutralizing antibody."

https://openalex.org/W1609055747,"The kinetics of ATP synthesis by submitochondrial particles were studied with a continuous flow mixing technique allowing measurements of ATP synthesis between 15 and 120 ms after mixing for estimation of the initial rate. During the initial 100 ms, ATP synthesis proceeded at a faster rate when driven by an artificially imposed electrochemical proton gradient than when driven by the respiratory substrate NADH. The rate of ATP synthesis driven by the artificial electrochemical proton gradient was dependent upon the magnitude of the gradient, and was affected similarly by variations of either the pH gradient or membrane potential. Initiation of ATP synthesis driven by NADH oxidation with ADP plus Pi resulted in an initial rate of phosphorylation equivalent to that during steady state respiration. However, a lag in phosphorylation was observed when ATP synthesis was initiated by oxygen or NADH. Valinomycin caused transient uncoupling of ATP synthesis driven by respiration since it strongly inhibited ATP synthesis during the initial 100 ms but it had no effect during steady state phosphorylation. The kinetic results strongly suggest that an electrochemical proton gradient is an obligate intermediate between electron transport and ATP synthesis on the main pathway of energy transduction."

Receptors were eluted in the free form at pH 3.2 and did not aggregate in the absence of detergent. The purified receptors displayed about 50% of the maximum theoretical binding activity, and retained the high binding affinity and hormonal specificity of the original gonadotropin receptors of the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1499237251,"Abstract Complete conversion of skeletal muscle glycogen synthetase from the I form to the D form requires incorporation of 2 mol of phosphate per enzyme subunit (90,000 g). Incubation of sythetase I with low concentrations of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate(cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (10 units/ml) and ATP (0.1 to 0.3 mM) plus magnesium acetate (10 mM) results in incorporation within 1/2 hour of 1 mol of phosphate persubunit concomitant with a decrease in the synthetase activity ratio (minus glucose-6-P/plus glucose-6-P) from 0.85 to 0.25. Further incubation for 6 hours does not greatly increase the phosphate content of the synthetase or promote conversion to the D form. This level of phosphorylation is not increased by raising the concentration of protein kinase to 150 units/ml and is not influenced by the presence of glucose-6-P, UDP-glucose, or glycogen. However, at protein kinase concentrations of 10,000 to 30,000 units/ml a second mol of phosphate is incorporated per subunit, and the sythetase activity ratio decreases to 0.05 or less. In addition to the 2 mol of phosphate persubunit which are required for formation of sythetase D, further phosphorylation can be observed which is not associated with changes in synthetase activity. This phosphorylation occurs at a slow rate, is increased by raising the ATP concentration to 2 to 4mM, and is not blocked by the heat-stable protein inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These data indicate that skeletal muscle glycogen synthetase contains multiple phosphorylation sites only two of which are involved in the synthetase I to D conversion."
https://openalex.org/W1499316111,"The glycogenolytic effect of glucagon has been studied in fetal hepatocytes cultured for 3 to 4 days in the presence of cortisol (10 muM). The hepatocytes, when transplanted from young fetuses (15-day-old), contain only minute amounts of glycogen, whereas when cultured 3 to 4 days in the presence of cortisol, they contain high levels of stored glycogen. Glucagon induced a rapid but partial mobilization of glycogen, which was maximal after 2 hours. The half-maximal response was observed with about 0.1 nM glucagon. The glycogenolytic effect of glucagon in fetal hepatocytes is probably mediated by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) as in adult liver. This effect was mimicked by cyclic AMP and N-6, O-2-dibutyryl cyclic AMP, (dibutyryl cyclic AMP), and potentiated by theophylline. Glucagon addition was followed by accumulation of cyclic AMP in the cells within 2 min. Glucagon produces a marked stimulation of the rate of glycogen breakdown and an inhibition of the rate of incorporation of [14-C] glucose into glycogen. The glycogeneolytic effect of a single addition of glucagon was reversed within 4 hours. A second addition of glucagon at this time was unable to induce a new glycogenolytic response. A resistance to glucagon stimulation appeared in the cells after a first exposure to the hormone. This refractoriness was also shown by the loss of glucagon-dependent cyclic AMP accumulation and was not linked to the release by the cells of a hormone antagonist into the medium. The hepatocytes resistant to the action of glucagon retained their response to cyclic AMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and norepinephrine. Finally, glycogenolytic concentrations of cyclic AMP and of its dibutyryl derivative failed to induce a refractoriness to glucagon."

https://openalex.org/W1490995508,"The kinetics of binding of glucocorticoids to the soluble, specific binding protein of mouse fibroblasts has been examined. The rate at which both potent and weak glucocorticoids achieve binding equilibrium is very slow. Second order rate constants of association range from 3 times 10-5 M- minus 1 min- minus 1 for cortisol to 6.7 times 10-5 M- minus 1 min- minus 1 for triamcinolone acetonide. Studies of the rates of binding at high steroid concentrations suggest that the slow rate of binding may be explained by a two-step mechanism. Active glucocorticoids, regardless of their potency, bind initially in a rapid manner to form a weak complex with the binding protein. The dissociation constant for the weak binding reaction is 0.87 times 10- minus 7 M for triamcinolone acetonide and 2.4 times 10- minus 7 M for cortisol. The weak binding complex becomes converted slowly to a tight complex. The first order rate constants for this conversion and the rate constants of dissociation from the tight complex have been determined for cortisol, dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide. The binding affinity of steroids of different biological potency is correlated with their rate of dissociation from this second tight binding state."
https://openalex.org/W1553014303,"Modifications of existing methods have allowed for the isolation and purification of various species of plasma glycosaminoglycans on the basis of their sulfate content and molecular size. All of the preparations precipitated human plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL); maximal precipitation occurred with amounts of glycans corresponding to 50 mug of hexuronate and 12 mg of LDL. The interaction of glycans with pyrene-labeled lipoproteins was also studied, measuring variations of the fluorescence emitted by the monomer (M) and excimer (E) species of the bound pyrene. The ratio IE/IM is proportional to c/eta, where c is the microscopic concentration of the pyrene confined to the hydrocarbon region of the lipoprotein and eta is the microviscosity of that region. To 0.12 mg of pyrene-labeled LDL, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or high density lipoproteins (HDL) were added increasing amounts of the various glycan preparations. The sulfate-rich species decreased the IE/IM ratio of LDL and HDL but not that of VLDL. This finding suggests that the glycan caused a change in lipoprotein conformation associated with either an increased volume or increased microscopic viscosity of the hydrocarbon region. The modification of LDL conformation could be prevented by proteolytic treatment of the sulfate-rich species or by addition to the system of suitable amounts of sulfate-poor species or of chrondroitin-4-sulfate, but could not be prevented by increased ionic concentration. These results suggest that the two main species of plasma glycans are important in maintaining adequate rheological properties of plasma lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W31567841,"Insulin release from isolated perifused pancreatic islets was stimulated by the divalent ionophore A23187 in the absence of exogenous glucose. In addition, A23187 produced a 2-fold elevation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) levels in isolated perifused islets. The elevation of cAMP levels coincided with peak insulin release. Ionophore-induced insulin release was unaffected by pretreatment of the islets with theophylline (5 mM). Stimulation of insulin release produced by the ionophore occurred either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca-2+; however, cAMP accumulation required the presence of extracellular Ca-2+. The ionophore (10 muM) had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity of homogenates of isolated islets. The results of this study are interpreted as indicating that intracellular Ca-2+ has an essential role in the insulin releasing mechanism, whereas the cAMP system has a modulatory effect on this process."
https://openalex.org/W98907575,"Characteristics of adenylate cyclase stimulation by the GTP analog 5'-guanyl imidodiphosphate Gpp(NH)p have been examined in intact frog erythrocytes, frog erythrocyte membranes, and solubilized canine myocardial preparations. Gpp(NH)p caused marked enzyme activation in the erythrocyte membranes and in solubilized myocardial preparations, but had much lesser effects in intact cells. Enzyme activation by Gpp(NH)p exhibited a definite lag period, requiring 10 to 15 min for complete activation at 37 degrees. Activation was essentially irreversible after a 5-hour dialysis sufficient to reduce the Gpp(NH)p levels below threshold for stimulation. Gpp(NH)p-activated enzyme differed from native enzyme in several respects, such as its greater temperature stability, and its insensitivity to further stimulation by other activators, such as catecholamine or fluoride. These differences suggest that the enzyme, once fully activated by Gpp(NH)p, may have undergone some modification that is not subject ot facile reversal."
https://openalex.org/W1564079240,"In term gestational human umbilical artery segments incubated in room air at 37 degrees, histamine, acetylcholine, bradykinin, K+, and serotonin (agonists that cause contraction) cause accumulation of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) without altering the content of adenosine 3':5'-monosphophate (cAMP); prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), which relaxes the artery, causes cAMP accumulation without affecting the cGMP content (Clyman, R. I., Sandler, J.A., Manganiello, V.C., and Vaughan, M. (1975) J. Clin. Invest., in press). It has been postulated that Ca-2+ is important in the regulation of cyclic nucleotides in other tissues. In the umbilical artery the control of cAMP content by PGE1 was independent of Ca-2+. After incubation in Ca-2+-free medium, the c GMP contentof the artery segments was decreased by 50% and was unaffected by histamine, acetylcholine, bradykinin, and K+. Readdition of Ca-2+ (2.7 mM) or Sr-2+ (3.6 mM) to the medium partially restored the basal cGMP content and the agonist effects on the cGMP content. However, Sr-2+ was not as effective as Ca-2+ in this regard. Ionophores A23187 and X537A (agents that facilitate Ca-2+ movement through membranes) mimicked the effects of these Ca-2+-dependent agonists on cGMP content. Incubation with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine (0.1 mM) increased both the basal content of cGMP and the histamine-induced accumulation 3-fold. This effect was dependent on the presence of Ca-2+ also. Accumulation of cGMP induced by serotonin, on the other hand, was not diminished in Ca-2+-depleted arteries and, in fact, seemed to be inhibited by 2.7 mM Ca-2+. These observations are consistent with the existence in the umbilical artery of two separate mechanisms for control of cGMP synthesis that are influenced differently by Ca-2+."
https://openalex.org/W1530055903,"We have synthesized the deoxyribooligonucleotide fragments, constituting the sequence of the lac operator of Escherichia coli. Two of these fragments, d(pApApTpTpGpTpTpApT) (nonamer) and d(pApApTpTpGpTpGpApG) (nonamer), corresponding to the 5' termini of lac operator have been synthesized by the phosphodiester method. The remaining four fragments, d(ApCpApApTpT) (hexamer), d(ApTpApApCpApApTpT) (nonamer), d(ApApTpTpGpTpGpApGpCpGpG) (dodecamer), and d(ApApTpTpGpTpTpApTpCpCpGpCpTpC) (pentadecamer), have been synthesized by an improved phosphotriester method. All of the compounds were first characterized by venom and spleen phosphodiesterase digestion to obtain their base composition. The sequence of these oligonucleotides was fully confirmed by the characteristic mobility shifts of their partial venom phosphodiesterase digestion products on two-dimensional homochromatography. A comparative study of the two methods for the synthesis of oligonucleotides has revealed that the phosphotriester method is more convenient than the phosphodiester method because of higher yields and ease of handling large scale preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1491387027,"Two fractions of gastric mucosal membranes obtained by Ficoll-sucrose density gradient centrifugation were studied by a variety of techniques to localize the polypeptides. Gel electrophoresis showed the presence of five major polypeptides and several minor ones. Only one of these, 82,000 daltons, was available for iodination in the intact tissue. The two membrane fractions differed in their accessibility to peroxidase. The denser fraction showed two major defined iodination peaks at 82,000 and 102,000 daltons. Freeze-thawing and iodinating with 131-I produced additional labeling of peaks as well as relabeling the 82,000-dalton component, showing it was accessible from both sides of the membrane. The two major components were also sensitive to cross-linking, the 102,000 polypeptide being especially sensitive to --SH oxidation. Proteolysis with trypsin removed both components in the denser membrane fraction, in addition to inhibiting the K+-ATPase and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase of that fraction. Phosphorylation with [gamma-32-P]ATP labeled the 102,000-dalton component and K+, HCO3- minus and p-nitrophenylphosphate reduced the level of labeling. Hence the 102,000 region contains a subunit of the ATPase, is readily iodinated in inside-out vesicles, and is the most available for interpeptide S--S cross-linking."
https://openalex.org/W1573395697,"Prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductase was purified from chicken heart by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and DEAE-Sephadex, hydroxylapatite and phosphocellulose chromatography. Two peaks of activity were resolved during the phosphocellulose chromatographic step. Both peaks were stimulated by a substance that was not bound to the phosphocellulose column. This stimulatory substance was destroyed by treatment with phosphodiesterase and 0.1 M NaOH. It was heat-stable (100 degrees, 2 min), nondialyzable, and resistant to treatment with pronase, ribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease; but it was dialyzable after heating or digestion with pronase. Sodium pyrophosphate also enhanced the activities of the prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductases as did angiotensin I; but not angiotensin II. In the presence of 3':5'-cyclic AMP, AMP, or several other ribonucleotides, the enhancing effects of the natural stimulatory substance, sodium pyrophosphate or angiotensin I were blocked, but these ribonucleotides themselves had little effect on the enzymes activity. The substrate specificities of the two prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductases were also studied. Both the 9-keto group and the 15-keto group of 15-ketoprostaglandin F2 alpha could be converted to the corresponding hydroxyl group; the 15-keto group was reduced faster than the 9-keto group. Prostaglandin D2, a prostaglandin with a 9-hydroxyl and an 11-keto group, could not be converted to prostaglandin F2 alpha nor could cyclohexanone be converted to cyclohexanol by the prostaglandin E 9-ketoreductase."
https://openalex.org/W1566119739,"Carbamylphosphate synthetase was purified to homogeneity from a derepressed strain of Salmonella typhimurium by a procedure based on affinity chromatography employing immobilized glutamine. The enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of carbamylphosphate from either ammonia or glutamine together with ATP and bicarbonate. The ATP saturation curve of either nitrogen donor is sigmoidal (n equals 1.5) but the affinity for ATP is higher with ammonia. In addition to the feedback inhibition by UMP and activation by ornithine which we previously reported (1), the activity was found to be stimulated by IMP and phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Evidence from pool measurements in enteric bacteria by others suggests that of the latter two compounds only phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate is physiologically significant. All effectors regulate enzyme activity by altering its affinity for ATP. Glutamine also modulates the affinity for ATP; it is increased as glutamine concentratiions decrease, an effect that could serve to insulate the cell against major changes in carbamylphosphate synthesis in response to fluctuations in concentration of glutamine. The molecular weight of the holoenzyme was estimated to be 150,000 by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in triethanolamine and Tris-acetate buffers in which the enzyme is a monomer. In the presence of ornithine in potassium phosphate buffer, the enzyme is an oligomer with a molecular weight of 580,000. This transition has been exploited as an alternate route of purifying the enzyme to homogeneity using successive sucrose density centrifugation. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate shows that the enzyme consists of two unequal subunits with molecular weights of 110,000 and 45,000. The two subunits were separated by gel filtration in the presence of 1 M potassium thiocyanate, ATP, MgCl2, glutamine, NH4Cl, ornithine, and UMP. The heavy subunit catalyzes the synthesis of carbamylphosphate from ammonia but not glutamine. The ATP saturation curve for the separated heavy subunit is still sigmoidal (n equals 1.4 and So.5 equals 0.3 mM). The ammonia dependent activity of the heavy subunit is stimulated by the activators ornithine, IMP, and phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate but is only marginally inhibited by high concentrations of UMP. The addition of the light subunit restored full ability to utilize glutamine as well as normal sensitivity to UMP. Purified subunits were used for in vitro complementation studies with strains carrying mutations in pyrA, the structural gene encoding carbamylphosphate synthetase. The results indicate that the pyrA region encodes both subunits and that the structural genes for the two polypeptides are linked. A deletion mutant lacking both subunits of carbamylphosphate synthetase also lacked any ability to synthetize carbamylphosphate from ammonia. Hence, unlike certain other bacteria, S. typhimurium does not possess a carbamate kinase."

The missense suppressor mutation, glyTsuA36(HA), results in a C yields U base substitution at the 3' end of the anticodon of tRNAGGA/G -Gly 2 (nucleotide position 38). A secondary effect of this base substitution is the modification of the A residue directly adjacent to the 3' end of the anticodon of tRNAsuA36(HA), -Gly 2 suggesting that the enzymes responsible for this modification recognize the anticodon sequences of prospective tRNA substrates. The creation of a missense-suppressing tRNA, tRNAsuA36(HA), -Gly 2 by an alteration of the anticodon sequence of tRNAGGA/G -Gly 2 is analogous to mechanisms whereby other suppressor tRNAs have arisen. The high degree of nucleotide sequence homology between the amino acid acceptor stems and anticodon regions of four glycine isoaccepting tRNAs specified by E. coli and bacteriophage T4 suggests that these regions may be recognized by the glycyl-tRNA synthetase; the involvement of the anticodon region in the synthetase recognition process is supported by the greatly decreased rate of aminoacylation of tRNAsuA36(HA) -Gly 2."
https://openalex.org/W1480930112,"Steroid-induced difference spectra have been used to examine the combination of cholesterol with adrenal mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 which participates in cholesterol side chain cleavage (P-450scc) and the depletion of cholesterol from the cytochrome which results from turnover of the enzyme system. Type I difference spectra-induced by cholest-5-ene-3beta, 25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol) and cholest-5-ene-3beta, 20 alpha, 22R-triol (20alpha, 22R dihydroxycholesterol) have been used to quantitate binding of cholesterol to two sites (I and II) on cytochrome P-450scc. The action of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in vivo and the action of calcium or phosphate ions on isolated mitochondria stimulate the combination of cholesterol with site I but not site II. Cholesterol derived from lecithin-cholesterol micelles, however, binds to both sites. Malate-induced cholesterol depletion occurred at a comparable rate to the transfer of cholesterol from lecithin-cholesterol micelles. However, a residual proportion of cholesterol-cytochrome P-450scc complexes remained, even after 10 min of exposure to malate, and was of similar magnitude in mitochondria from both cycloheximide-treated and stressed rats. It is suggested that this reflects a less reactive form of cholesterol-cytochrome complex. Steroid-induced difference spectra indicate that sites I and II on cytochrome P-450scc are similarly depleted after metabolism of mitochondrial cholesterol in vitro and after inhibition of the action of ACTH in vivo. Anaerobiosis of adrenal cells after excision of the accumulation of cholesterol at cytochrome P-450cc. When anaerobiosis was prevented, cytochrome P-450scc in the freshly isolated mitochondria was apparently essentially free of complexed cholesterol, irrespective of the extent of ACTH action. For 30 min after suspension of the mitochondria in 0.25 M sucrose at 4 degrees, cholesterol combines with cytochrome P-450scc. The extent of this process was not affected by the presence of cycloheximide during ether stress treatment of the rats. It is concluded that there are at least two pools of mitochondrial cholesterol with access to cytochrome P-450scc but that ACTH stimulates only the pool which most readily interacts with the cytochrome."

The sequence of the precursor is pG-U-U-C-C-A-G-G-A-U-G-C-G-G-G-C-A-U-C-G-U-A-U-A-A-U-G-G-C-U-A-U-U-A-C-C-U-C-A-G-C-C-U-N-C-U-A-A-G-C-U-G-A-U-G-A-U-G-C-G-G-G-T-psi-C-G-A-U-U-C-C-C-G-C-U-G-C-C-C-G-C-U-C-C-A-A-G-A-U-G-U-G-C-U-G-A-U-A-U-A-G-C-U-C-A-G-D-D-G-G-D-A-G-A-G-C-G-C-A-C-C-C-U-U-G-G-U-mt6A-A-G-G-G-U-G-A-G-m7G-U-C-G-G-C-A-G-T-psi-C-G-A-A-U-C-U-G-C-C-U-A-U-C-A-G-C-A-C-C-A-C-U-UOH(tRNA sequences are italicized). It contains the entire primary nucleotide sequences of tRNA Gly2 suA36 and tRNA Thr ACU/C, including the common 3'-terminal sequence, CCA. Nineteen additional nucleotides are present, with 10 at the 5' end, 3 at the 3' end, and the remaining 6 in the inter-tRNA spacer region. RNase P cleaves the precursor specifically at the 5' ends of the mature tRNA sequences."
https://openalex.org/W63250965,"Polynucleotide templates were copied by avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) and the frequency and distribution of errors were determined. The error rate with [r(pA)2500-d(pT)12-18] template-initiator under a variety of conditions was approximately 1/600, i.e. one incorrect dCMP incorporated for 600 correct dTMP polymerized. Addition of the metal chelator o-phenanthroline to the reaction inhibited the incorporation of correct and incorrect nucleotides proportionately. The enzyme inhibited a pH optimum of 8.5 and the error rate remained constant over a range of pH (6.0 to 10.0). The rate of polymerization was greater at higher temperatures and approximately doubled for every 10 degrees increase. The error rate was constant at all temperatures. These results indicate that the purified avian myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase synthesizes polydeoxynucleotides with an unusually large number of errors in base-pairing. Velocity sedimentation of the products of the reaction obtained at various times during the course of synthesis indicate that: (a) the entire length of the 14 S template was copied, and (b) the incorporation of the incorrect nucleotide did not terminate chain propagation. Isopyknic banding in neutral and alkaline cesium sulfate gradients showed that the noncomplementary nucleotides are incorporated into the polydeoxynucleotide product. Stepwise degradation and nearest neighbor analysis of the reaction product indicated that (a) the correct and incorrect nucleotides are present in phosphodiester linkages, (b) the errors are not concentrated at either termini; and (c) the errors are uniformly distributed throughout the newly synthesized polydeoxynucleotide."

https://openalex.org/W1514361218,"Isolated individual liver cells were made permeable to charged molecules and macromolecules by treatment with toluene, and the properties of such cells were examined in detail. The optimal conditions of toluene treatment, as determined by assay of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities, was 7 to 9% toluene for 2 min at 0 degrees. Conditions are also described for maintaining the treated cells for periods up to 1 hour. Toluene treatment was found to be as efficient as various disruptive methods for making internal enzymes accessible to exogenous substrates, and this was true for enzymes in the cytosol, membrane, or organelle fractions. Electron microscopic and biochemical examination of toluen-treated cells indicated that they were relatively intact and lost only small amounts of cellular constituents to the suspension medium. The data in this paper suggest that toluene treatment of individual cells might prove useful for studies of macromolecular synthesis in liver;"
https://openalex.org/W1556225860,"Adrenal mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 which functions in cholesterol side chain cleavage (P-450scc) exhibited type I (lambdamax 385, lambdamin 420 nm) and inverse type I (lambdamin 385, lambdamax 420 nm) difference spectra with several steroids. The magnitude and type of response were dependent on the particular steroid and on the extent to which cholesterol was bound to the cytochrome in the intact mitochondrion. the inverse type I difference spectrum induced by 3beta-hydroxy-pregn-5-ene-20-one (pregnenolone) was dependent on the proportion of high spin cholesterol-cytochrome P-450scc complexes. With rat adrenal mitochondria cholest-5-ene-3beta, 20alpha-diol (20alpha-hydroxycholesterol) invariably induced a smaller inverse type I response and, under conditions where cytochrome P-450scc was nearly free of cholesterol, even produced a small type I response. Two distinct steroid binding sites on cytochrome P-450scc were detected by, respectively, the slow type I response to cholest-5-ene-3beta, 25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol) and the rapid type I response to a subsequent addition of cholest-5-ene-3beta, 20alpha, 22 R-triol (20alpha, 22R-dihydroxycholesterol). The relative proportions of the spectral responses to these steroids were dependent on the previous extent of adrenal activation by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), because this stimulatory process altered the combination of mitochondrial cholesterol with cytochrome P-450scc. It is proposed that the two steroid binding sites on cytochrome P-450scc interact with steroids in the following way: site I binds cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 20alpha, 22R-dihydroxycholesterol with formation of a partially high spin cytochrome; site II binds both pregnenolone and 20alpha-OH cholesterol resulting in a low spin cytochrome. Interactions between sites I and II are not competitive, and occupancy of site II ensures a low spin state irrespective of the occupancy of site I. A second mode of interaction by 20alpha, 22R-dihydroxycholesterol stabilizes a high spin cytochrome and is competitive with site II binding by 20alpha-hydroxycholesterol or pregnenolone. Formation of a maximally high spin cytochrome follows occupancy by 20alpha, 22R-dihydroxycholesterol at both sites."

No function has yet been found for this molecule. Its primary structure and behavior suggests an unusually stable and possibly unique secondary structure. Even from single species of E. coli, there is some sequence heterogeneity within the molecule. The sequence of a major species from MRE 600 is: (see article). Methods for getting sequence overlaps on this highly structured RNA are described, and a possible functional role for 4.5 S RNA is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W175120530,"An RNA species from Escherichia coli infected with phage lambda was purified by hybridization to lambda 1-strand DNA and shown to have variable length. This variability was due to a variable number of adenylate residues attached to the 3' end of the molecule. Pancreatic RNase treatment of the RNA-DNA hybrid removed the 3'-terminal adenylate residues, generating a homogeneous RNA molecule terminating with -Up. The results indicate the presence of adenylate residues not coded by the DNA template at the terminus of this transcript from intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1590696452,"Human interferon binds to a omega-carboxpentyl-agarose column at low ionic strength (0.15 M NaCl) and is still retained when the ionic strength is raised (to 1.0 M NaCl). The binding can be reversed, however, by ethylene glycol, indicating a hydrophobic interaction. The binding of human interferon to omega-aminohexyl-agarose is weak, even at a low ionic strength, and is probably exclusively electrostatic. This disparate binding behavior may be caused by the presence of a positive charge, adjacent to the hydrophobic binding site, on human interferon. The interaction of human interferon with omega-carboxypentyl-agarose is quite selective, inasmuch as the majority of proteins present in interferon preparations pass through the column unretained. Hydrophobic chromatography of human interferon may thus be useful in its purification."
https://openalex.org/W1487808095,"DPNH peroxidase is a flavin adenine dinucleotide-containing flavoprotein. Anaerobic titration of enzyme with dithionite has shown that the active site of the enzyme contains 2 mol of flavin and in addition 1 mol of a non-flavin electron acceptor that is tentatively identified as a disulfide group. Thus complete reduction of the enzyme requires 3 mol of dithionite per mole of active site. The first mole of dithionite reduces the non-flavin acceptor; complex formation between the reduced acceptor and one of the bound flavin molecules causes the formation of a long wavelength absorption band between 500 and 670 nm. The second mole of dithionite reduces the flavin that interacts with the reduced non-flavin group, and the long wavelength band disappears. The third mole of dithionite reduces the second mole of flavin. All groups are reoxidized in the presence of air. DPNH reacts with only two of the enzyme-bound electron acceptors. The first mole of DPNH reduces the non-flavin group to form an intermediate (I) that is almost identical with that formed by dithionite. The second mole of DPNH complexes with the second flavin of Intermediate I to form Intermediate II. This reaction causes a further absorbance increase in the long wavelength region; the tail of the absorption band now extends to 960 nm. The titration data (potassium phosphate, 0.05 M, pH 7.0) can be fitted with dissociation constants of 1 times 10-7 M for the formation of I, and 3 times 10-6 M for the conversion of I to II. In air, species II is oxidized to I; I is stable in air, but is oxidized stoichiometrically to oxidized enzyme by H2O2. Present evidence suggests that bound DPN-plus is responsible for the air stability of species I. Intermediate I, but not oxidized enzyme, reacts slowly with phenylmercuric acetate. This reaction causes loss of the air-stable intermediate and parallel loss in enzyme activity. The inactive enzyme cannot be reduced by DPNH to Species I; DPNH can, however, still react with the second flavin to form the autoxidizable complex. With other methods of enzyme inactivation there is also a direct correlation between residual enzyme activity and the ability of enzyme to form the air-stable intermediate. It is concluded that the air-stable intermediate is an important catalytic species."

https://openalex.org/W144018785,"Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase from Salmonella typhimurium contains four cysteine residues per subunit. Three of these react readily with 5, 5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), forming an active derivative with kinetic and physical properties similar to the native enzyme, but one reacts only under denaturing conditions. Stoichiometric amounts of KMnO4 inactivate the DTNB-treated enzyme. The loss of activity is correlated with the oxidation of the remaining cysteinyl group to cysteic acid by KMnO4. Amino acid analysis indicates that no other residues are altered. The rate of inactivation of the enzyme is decreased 30-fold by saturatin g concentrations of the substrate ATP. Inorganic phosphate also protects substantially against KMnO4. Titration of the native enzyme with limiting amounts of KMnO4 shows that the sulfhydryl group essential for activity competes effectively with the other sulfhydryl groups for KMnO4. These results suggest that the essential sulfhydryl group is near the active site, and that KMnO4, a phosphate analogue, can act as an active site-directed reagent at the ATP binding site of the enzyme. The KMnO4-oxidized enzyme is more highly aggregated than untreated enzyme and fails to bind ATP appreciably."

https://openalex.org/W2048556888,A quantitative hemadsorption assay distinguishes the effects of membrane fixation on concanavalin A-mediated agglutinability of fixed cells with unfixed cells. We observed undiminished adherence of unfixed erythrocytes to glutaraldehyde-fixed normal and virus-transformed hamster fibroblasts coated with concanavalin A. Fixation of the erythrocytes abolished agglutination with fixed fibroblasts. The agglutinability of fixed cells is more likely related to increased cell rigidity than to decreased membrane fluidity.
https://openalex.org/W1977835381,"Short DNA chains, isolated from in vitro pulse-labeled replicating polyoma DNA, exhibit some degree of self-complementarity (28% resistance to S1 nuclease after self-annealing to plateau levels). This level of self-annealing is not increased if short DNA chains present as free single-stranded DNA after extraction are included in the hybridization, excluding a selective loss of chains from one side of the growing fork and supporting a semi-discontinuous mode of chain growth. This mode also applies to restricted synthesis conditions under which a relative excess of short chains is made, since no increase in the self-annealing of such short chains is observed. The self-annealing that can be measured is higher for the faster sedimenting portion (46%) of the short DNA chains than for the slower sedimenting portion (18.5%), indicating that it is most likely due to contaminating continuously growing strands from the other side of the fork. High self-annealing values (up to 60%) are obtained if virus stocks generating defective DNA are used for infection. Restriction endonuclease (Hpall) characterization of such DNA shows evidence for the presence of multiple origins of replication. One of several possible mechanisms is discussed by which replicating defective DNA can generate self-complementary short chains despite a semi-discontinuous mode of replication."
https://openalex.org/W1486538157,"The sequence of 18 nucleotides in the region preceding the initiation of transcription of the gene N of bacteriophage lambda has been determined to be as follows (see article). The basic approach used for the sequence determination involved Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I-catalyzed elongation of the octadecanucleotide primer, dT-C-A-G-T-G-C-G-T-C-C-T-G-C-T-G-A-rU, possessing the appropriate polarity and nucleotide sequence corresponding to the 5' end of the gene N transcript. Following hybridization of the primer to the r-stand of bacteriophage lambda CI85657, sequences of the newly grown ollgonucleotide chains were determined by a) partial exonuclease digestion followed by two-dimensional fingerprinting; b) determination of pyrimidine tracts; and c) nearest neighbor analyses. Primer elongation was carried out in a controlled manner, the size of the newly grown chains being kept short by the following techniques: a) insertion of a ribonucleotide unit as the 3' terminus of the primer; b) use of a limited number of deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates in the elongation reaction; and c) enlongation of the primer using all the four nucleoside triphosphates with one of the triphosphates being supplied in a limiting concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1487329968,"Sequences of the cohesive ends and the 3'-terminal regions of phi80 DNA have been determined. Sequences of the cohesive ends were obtained through the use of two standard methods. The first method involved the incorporation of all four labeled deoxyribonucleotides into the phi80 cohesive ends using DNA polymerase I. The DNA was then partially digested with micrococcal nuclease or pancreatic DNase. The products were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and characterized by composition, 3'-terminal, and nearest neighbor analyses. The second method involved partial incorporation using one, two, or three labeled deoxyribonucleotides followed by similar analyses. Sequences of the double-stranded regions adjacent to the cohesive ends were determined by three new methods. These methods were: (a) the DNA was specifically labeled at the 3' terminus and then partially degraded. Labeled oligonucleotide products were sequenced by their mobilities on various separation systems. (b) The cohesive ends were enlarged by limited degradation with exonuclease III. After this treatment, the DNA was partially repaired with labeled nucleotides, digested, and the products were analyzed. (c) A synthetic ologonucleotide primer was bound to phi80 DNA which had been repaired with DNA polymerase I, and then partially digested with lambda-exonuclease. The primer was extended into the region of interest by partial repair with labeled nucleotides. The extended primer was isolated and analyzed."
