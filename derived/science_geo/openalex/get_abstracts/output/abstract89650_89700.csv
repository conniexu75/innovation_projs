https://openalex.org/W2037102374,"Germ-line granules in C. elegans embryos (P granules) can be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody. In mutant zygotes with abnormal spindle orientations and in wild-type zygotes treated with the microtubule inhibitors nocodazole, colcemid, vinblastine, and griseofulvin, both P-granule segregation to the posterior pole and the concomitant pseudocleavage occur apparently normally, but the normally concurrent migration of the pronuclei is inhibited. Conversely, treatment of wild-type embryos with the microfilament inhibitors cytochalasins D and B inhibits P-granule segregation and pseudocleavage, as well as other manifestations of polarity, without preventing pronuclear migration. The results suggest that P-granule segregation does not require either the spindle or cytoplasmic microtubules, but that this process as well as generation of other asymmetries does require cytoskeletal functions that depend on microfilaments."

https://openalex.org/W2117415893,"The differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells is accompanied by changes in cell morphology, decreased synthesis and assembly of cytoskeletal proteins, and increased biosynthesis of lipogenic enzymes. The differentiation-dependent alterations in actin assembly can be prevented by culture of cells on fibronectin matrices. Under these conditions, morphological change is prevented and the induction of lipogenic enzymes such as glycerophosphate dehydrogenase and fatty acid synthetase is sharply reduced. In contrast, the differentiation-linked decreases in actin and tubulin biosynthesis occur normally. Hybridization of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA to cloned cDNA probes indicates that the inhibition of lipogenic protein biosynthesis occurs because of reduced levels of specific mRNA production. The inhibitory effects of fibronectin can be reversed by keeping cells in a rounded configuration or by exposing cells to either cytochalasin D, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, or insulin, a key lipogenic hormone. These results demonstrate that fibronectin can regulate gene expression for lipogenic proteins and they suggest that it interferes with cytoskeletal and morphological changes necessary for new gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W1563610085,"Thrombin-activated vitamin K-dependent protein C purified from human plasma has a potent anticoagulant effect on human plasma, whereas its bovine counterpart has a very weak anticoagulant effect on human plasma. This species difference was found to be partly due to a more rapid degradation of human factor Va by human than by bovine activated protein C. In the presence of phospholipid, activated human protein C cleaves several peptide bonds in fragment D (heavy chain of factor Va), whereas in fragment F1F2 (light chain of factor Va) there appears to be only one peptide bond that is slowly cleaved. The degradation of fragment D is accompanied by a parallel loss of factor V activity. With the blood coagulation factor Xa bound to factor Va, fragment D is protected from degradation by activated protein C, and factor Va remains active. Fragment D isolated from factor Va was exposed to activated protein C in the presence of phospholipid and was found not to be degraded. This observation suggests that fragment D of factor V is bound to phospholipid via fragment F1F2."

https://openalex.org/W2106495814,"The oncogene of the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line has been passed serially through NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Oncogene-specific probes prepared from the resulting tertiary transfectants by molecular cloning have been used to show that loss of the transfected oncogene from NIH/3T3 cells correlates with reversion to nontransformed morphology. Analysis of cells transfected by the oncogenes of other tumors and tumor cell lines indicates that the transforming gene of the HL-60 leukemia cell line is closely related to oncogenes of a Burkitt's lymphoma, an acute myelogenous leukemia, an adenocarcinoma of the colon, a neuroblastoma, and two sarcomas. This oncogene is distantly related to the viral oncogenes of Kirsten and Harvey sarcoma viruses. It has been termed N-ras. The active N-ras oncogene coexists with altered versions of the myc oncogene in the HL-60 and AW Ramos human tumors. This suggests a multistep mechanism involving both ras and myc genes in the creation of these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2052368267,"Egg laying in Aplysia is characterized by a stereotyped behavioral array which is mediated by several neuroactive peptides. We have sequenced two genes encoding the A and B peptides thought to initiate the egg-laying process, as well as a gene encoding egg-laying hormone (ELH) which directly mediates the behavioral array. The three genes share 90% sequence homology and are representatives of a small multigene family. Each gene encodes a protein precursor in which the active peptides are flanked by internal cleavage sites providing the potential to generate multiple small peptides. Each of the three genes consists of sequences homologous to A or B peptide as well as ELH. Although these genes share significant nucleotide homology, they have diverged such that different member genes express functionally related but nonoverlapping sets of neuroactive peptides in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2092759342,"When injected into mice, the synthetic double-stranded polynucleotide poly(inosinic) X poly(cytidylic) acid induces high natural killer (NK) cell activity within 4 to 12 hours. Induction of NK activity in mice immunized 2 or 3 days previously, or the addition of NK cells to cultures immunized in vitro 2 or 3 days previously, promotes early termination of the ongoing primary immunoglobulin M antibody response. A target for NK cells is a population of accessory cells that has interacted with antigen and is necessary for sustaining the antibody response. The inference is strong that NK cells induced normally by immunization also terminate the usual antibody response in vivo by elimination of antigen-exposed accessory cells."
https://openalex.org/W1519541902,"Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase from Clostridium thermoaceticum has been purified to homogeneity using a strict anaerobic procedure. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 440,000 and it consists of three each of two different subunits giving the composition alpha 3 beta 3. The molecular weight of the alpha-subunit is 78,000 and that of the beta-subunit is 71,000. Pore limit gel electrophoresis gave a molecular weight of 161,000 indicating that the enzyme dissociates to form a dimer with an alpha beta structure. The dimer apparently contains per mol 2 nickel, 1 zinc, 11 iron, and 14 acid-labile sulfur. The anaerobic enzyme has an iron-sulfur type spectrum, which is changed in the presence of the substrate, CO. In the presence of oxygen, which destroys the activity or CO2, the spectrum is that of a typical iron-sulfur protein. Under acidic conditions a low molecular weight nickel factor separates from the enzyme. Viologens, methylene blue, ferredoxin, flavodoxin, and rubredoxin serve as electron acceptors. Of these rubredoxin is by far the most efficient. The enzyme has a pH optimum around 8.4. At this pH and 50 degrees C under 100% CO atmosphere, the apparent Km for methyl viologen is 3.03 mM and Vmax is 750 mumols of CO oxidized min-1 mg-1. Cyanide and methyl iodide inhibit the enzyme. CO reverses the cyanide inhibition but promotes the reaction with methyl iodide. The pure enzyme has no hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1612324382,"Using a synthetic peptide (Glu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly) as a substrate, various normal tissues from the rat were probed for tyrosine protein kinase activity. Spleen was shown to contain much higher tyrosine protein kinase activity than other rat tissues (lung, brain, testes, liver, kidney, heart, and thymus, in decreasing order of specific activity). Most of the tyrosine protein kinase activity of the various rat tissues (greater than 80%) was present in the particulate fraction, and Nonidet P-40, a nonionic detergent, could activate the particulate form of the enzyme 2-20-fold in many of the tissues. Epidermal growth factor (1 microgram/ml), cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP, or Ca2+ did not increase spleen tyrosine protein kinase activity. Half-maximal enzyme activity was observed at 60-80 microM MgATP and at 2.2 mM peptide, and both Mg2+ (10 mM) and Mn2+ (0.5-1.0 mM) were effective divalent metal ions for the expression of activity. When the particulate fraction of spleen was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of Na dodecyl SO4, a number of alkali-stable bands were identified by autoradiography. Two major bands at Mr = 53,000 and 56,000 were shown to contain phosphotyrosine. Two similar alkali-stable bands containing phosphotyrosine but with lower amounts of 32P labeling were also observed in the particulate fractions of various other tissues (lung, brain, kidney, and testes). The particulate form of tyrosine protein kinase of rat spleen could be solubilized by using high concentrations of Nonidet P-40 (5%) at an alkaline pH (pH 9.0). Partial purification and subsequent filtration on Sephacryl S-200 yielded a peak of tyrosine protein kinase activity with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000. The two major phosphorylated bands of Mr = 53,000 and 56,000 co-migrated with the peak of enzyme activity. The solubilized and partially purified enzyme preparation phosphorylated only tyrosine residues when either endogenous proteins or casein were used as substrates. These results suggest that relatively high activities of tyrosine protein kinase exist in a normal tissue (rat spleen). Major endogenous substrates of the enzyme(s) appear to be represented by two proteins of Mr = 53,000 and 56,000; one or both of these substrates may be the tyrosine protein kinase itself."
https://openalex.org/W2042153218,Frontal cortex and cerebellar tissue from fetal rats was implanted into the damaged frontal cortex of adults. Cognitive deficits in spatial alternation learning that follow bilateral destruction of medial frontal cortex were reduced in rats with frontal cortex implants but not in those with implants of cerebellum. Histological evaluation showed that connections were made between the frontal cortex implants and host brain tissue.

The techniques are applicable to polypeptides ranging in size from small peptides (less than 10 residues) to large proteins (more than 1000 residues).
https://openalex.org/W2014548112,"The interrelationship between commitment (irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle) and muscle-specific gene expression was analyzed with the myogenic cell line ts 3b-2, which is temperature sensitive for commitment and cell fusion. The rates of synthesis and levels of accumulation of muscle-specific mRNAs and proteins in the ts 3b-2 cells at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures are comparable, indicating that neither commitment nor cell fusion is required for induction of muscle-specific gene expression. In the absence of commitment, the cells are reversibly withdrawn from the cell cycle during gene induction, and expression of the muscle-specific genes is deinduced upon the switch to growth-stimulating conditions. The deinduction reflects coordinate and preferential cessation of muscle-specific mRNA synthesis, coupled with destabilization of the muscle-specific mRNAs in the cytoplasm, without effect on constitutively expressed housekeeping protein genes. The phenotype of the ts 3b-2 cells demonstrates that commitment and muscle-specific gene expression are both required, but alone are insufficient, to produce the terminally differentiated muscle phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2080068969,"Actin filament bundles isolated from Limulus sperm were used for quantitative electron microscope studies of F-actin assembly. The assembly rate constants were calculated. In addition, the critical concentrations (Cos) for both filament ends were directly determined. In 75 mM KCl and 1-5 mM Mg++, the Cos were 0.1 microM and 0.5 microM for the barbed and pointed ends, respectively. Substitution of Ca++ (20-200 microM) for Mg++ resulted in Cos of 0.4 microM for both filament ends. Consistent with these findings, filament growth occurred only from the barbed ends of Limulus bundles ""seeded"" into F-actin solutions in KCl and Mg++. Finally, filaments originally grown from the pointed filament ends of Limulus bundles were gradually lost as the actin solution reached steady state. These results demonstrate that actin filaments can ""treadmill"" under physiological conditions, albeit at very slow rates."

https://openalex.org/W2002269484,"The DNA regions required for accurate initiation by RNA polymerase 1 on the ribosomal RNA genes of Xenopus laevis consist of at least two domains within a 150 bp segment adjoining the initiation site. A region of only 13 nucleotides (from -7 to +6) appears sufficient to specify accurate and efficient initiation when various 5' and 3' deletion mutants are injected into oocyte nuclei. In contrast, a 10-fold larger region (from -142 to +6) is required for maximal synthesis when deletion mutants are assayed in oocyte nuclear homogenates; only a low level of synthesis is specified by the 13 bp promoter domain in this in vitro system. Site-specific mutants demonstrate that a sequence adjoining nucleotide -75 is also essential for efficient in vitro initiation. Under other conditions, transcription can be strongly affected by sequences that extend several kb upstream in the rDNA spacer and contain duplications of sequences found within the 150 bp promoter. We propose a model in which transcription of the X. laevis rRNA genes is regulated by interaction of at least three sequence domains that extend over a several kb region."
https://openalex.org/W1577602873,"The incorporation of cholesteryl oleate and triolein into phospholipid vesicles was studied in cosonicated mixtures of 94 weight % egg phosphatidylcholine and 6 weight % neutral lipid (0-6% triolein and 6-0% cholesteryl oleate). 13C NMR spectroscopy was used to quantitate both neutral lipids in vesicles containing 90% isotopically substituted [carbonyl-13C]cholesteryl oleate and [carbonyl-13C]triolein. Vesicles were also prepared with radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate and triolein and the composition of ultracentrifugal subfractions determined by chemical and radioisotopic methods. For a given starting composition, the incorporation of neutral lipids into vesicles was similar for vesicles prepared and analyzed by the two methodologies. The maximum solubility in vesicles prepared at 55 degrees C with a single neutral lipid was 3.1 weight % triolein (2.8 mol %) and 2.3 weight % cholesteryl oleate (2.8 mol %). In sonication mixtures with both triolein and cholesteryl oleate, the incorporation of each lipid into vesicles was proportional to the starting concentration; the total incorporation of neutral lipid was less than or equal to 4.0% (weight or mole per cent). The solubility limits were intermediate between the theoretical cases of complete additivity and complete competition. The [13C]carbonyl chemical shifts showed that the carbonyl groups of the vesicle-solubilized neutral lipids were close to the vesicle surface and that excess triolein and cholesteryl oleate partitioned into an oil phase containing both triolein and cholesteryl oleate."
https://openalex.org/W1579478499,"A sensitive radioreceptor assay has been used to measure in vitro 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) synthesis in vitamin D-replete rats. Incubation of kidney cortical slices with 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 produced a product which co-migrated on high performance liquid chromatography with authentic 1,25(OH)2D3 in two different solvent systems and displaced 1,25(OH)2D3 from its intestinal receptor. In addition, mass spectral analysis of the product produced a mass fragmentation consistent with that of authentic 1,25(OH)2D3. Endogenous renal cortical 1,25(OH)2D3 content in phosphate-deprived rats averaged 1.1 +/- 0.3 pmol/g (n = 11), which was significantly greater than the renal cortical 1,25(OH)2D3 content of age-matched rats eating a normal diet which averaged 0.44 +/- 0.21 pmol/g (n = 8, p less than 0.001). After incubation, net 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis in renal slices from phosphate-deprived rats averaged 51 pmol/g/h, about 13-fold greater than the mean of 3.8 pmol/g/h observed in renal slices from rats eating the normal diet. These results indicate that the elevated plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels observed in rats during dietary phosphate deprivation are due to increased renal synthesis of the hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1545812718,"In a microsome system rendered competent in protein translation by the addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, co-translational insertion and glycosylation of N-linked glycoproteins is observed when the appropriate mRNA is supplied. We have utilized this system to examine the ability of acceptor tripeptides of the type Asn-X-Thr/Ser to inhibit co-translational glycosylation. Using endogenous oligosaccharide-lipid as the carbohydrate donor, dog pancreas microsomes efficiently glycosylated N alpha-[3H]Ac-Asn-Leu-Thr-NHCH3 (apparent Km = 100 microM). Glycopeptide formation was essentially complete within 20 min. In the presence of mRNA from vesicular stomatitis virus or chicken ovalbumin, a similar tripeptide, N alpha-Ac-Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2, inhibited co-translational glycosylation. Translocation of the nascent chains was not affected. Thus, in the absence of peptide, all translated G protein was glycosylated and found within the microsomes, whereas in the presence of the peptide a mixture of glycosylated and nonglycosylated G protein was sequestered. Inhibition of nascent chain glycosylation was competitive and not merely the result of oligosaccharide lipid depletion, because preincubation of the microsomes with the peptide followed by its removal did not affect subsequent glycosylation of ovalbumin or G protein. Six derivatives of Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2, three of which were acceptors and three of which were not, were tested for their ability to inhibit co-translational glycosylation. The three acceptor peptides, N alpha-Ac-Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2, N alpha-Oc-Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2, and N alpha-Bz-Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2, effectively inhibited nascent chain glycosylation. In contrast, the three nonacceptors, N alpha-Ac-Gln-Leu-Thr-NH2, N alpha-Ac-Asn(N beta-Me)-Leu-Thr-NH2, and Asn-Leu-Thr-NH2, had no effect. Taken together, these data indicate that the inhibition of co-translational glycosylation by a peptide is dependent on its ability to compete for the active site of the oligosaccharyl transferase."
https://openalex.org/W1531578544,"The interaction between the peptide melittin from bee venom with multilamellar liposomes of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or egg yolk phosphatidylcholine has been studied by the method of temperature scanning densitometry, yielding information on the specific volume of the association products and on the changes during the thermotropic transition of the lipids. The effects of the interaction were found to be biphasic with respect to melittin concentration; below 10(-3) mol per mol of phospholipid, an increase in transition temperature, abolition of the pretransition, a reduction in the transition volume of the lipids by about 25%, and a nonadditive increase in apparent specific volume of the complexes were observed. Only minor changes in these parameters could be detected between molar ratios of 10(-3) and 10(-2). Above 1 mol % melittin, the transition temperature decreased and the transition volume approached zero around 10 mol %. Since the effects in the low concentration range cannot be accounted for only by local perturbations around the actual sites of interaction, it is concluded that the interaction involves long range effects of melittin affecting several hundreds of phospholipid molecules. The results are discussed in terms of a phospholipid cluster model, whereby the interaction with melittin leads to a cooperative transition of entire clusters to a state of expanded volume. It is suggested that this transition may be important to the activating effect of melittin on membrane enzymes and to enhanced membrane permeability and lysis."
https://openalex.org/W1554412531,"A double-stranded cDNA library constructed from the total poly(A+) RNA of goose uropygial gland was screened for recombinants containing sequences complementary to malic enzyme mRNA. Replicate arrays of 1400 colonies were hybridized independently with 32P-labeled cDNAs copied from two populations of hepatic RNA derived from tissues which differed by about 35-fold with respect to the relative synthesis of malic enzyme. Forty-eight of the colonies which gave differential signals were further screened by hybrid-selected translation. DNA from one of these contained an insert of 970 base pairs and selected an mRNA which directed the synthesis of malic enzyme in a cell-free system. The malic enzyme sequences were subcloned into the single-stranded bacteriophage M13mp8. The subclones were used to prepare 32P-labeled single-stranded hybridization probe. Northern analysis indicated that malic enzyme mRNA from both goose and chicken is about 2100 bases in length. Hepatic malic enzyme mRNA concentration is stimulated 30- to 50-fold or more when neonatal chicks or goslings, respectively, are fed for 24 h. When added to chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, triiodothyronine stimulated malic enzyme mRNA accumulation by more than 100-fold. Glucagon inhibited the thyroid hormone-stimulated accumulation of malic enzyme mRNA by 99%. In all instances, malic enzyme mRNA concentration was closely correlated with the relative rate of malic enzyme synthesis. These results suggest that nutritional and hormonal regulation of malic enzyme synthesis occurs at the pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W1557145999,"cyc- S49 cell membranes contain an adenylyl cyclase activity which is stimulated by forskolin and inhibited by guanine nucleotides and NaF. These inhibitory effects are mediated by an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Ni) affecting the adenylyl cyclase catalytic unit (Hildebrandt, J. D., Sekura, R. D., Codina, J., Iyengar, R., Manclark, C. R., and Birnbaumer, L. (1983) Nature (Lond.) 302, 706-709). Since cyc- S49 cells do not contain a stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Ns), these membranes were used to study the requirements and kinetics of activation of Ni in the absence of Ns. Activation of Ni by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate was time-dependent (i.e. hysteretic) and pseudo-irreversible. Although GTP and guanosine 5'-(beta-thio)diphosphate could prevent the inhibition caused by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate if added simultaneously with it, they could not reverse the inhibited state induced by previous exposure to guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Activation of Ni had an absolute requirement for Mg2+. Unlike the activation of Ns, however, which requires millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ in the absence of hormonal stimulation, activation of Ni requires only micromolar concentrations of the divalent cation. These results support the contention that hormones which activate Ni or Ns do so by altering different parameters of a similar activation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2023448745,"We have found that live and ethanol-fixed fibroblasts, when covered with conditioned medium containing tissue plasminogen activator, associate with the enzyme and remove it from the medium. Binding of tissue plasminogen activator to fixed cells showed equilibrium kinetics with maximal uptake corresponding to 2.4 units of enzyme per 106 fixed cells. Enzyme bound to fixed cells could activate plasminogen and produce plaques of caseinolysis in casein-plasminogen-agar overlays. Electrophoretic analysis showed it covalently attached to a fibroblast component with a molecular weight of 40,000–50,000. Sequestration of tissue plasminogen activator by live fibroblasts showed nonsaturable first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.465/hr. We conclude that active enzyme is bound to a surface receptor, then internalized and degraded. Fibroblasts did not release the binding molecule into the medium; binding of tissue plasminogen activator from the medium was unaffected by heparin or thrombin. This phenomenon differs from that described by Baker et al. and ascribed to “proteasenexin.”"
https://openalex.org/W1597906482,"Forskolin activated adenylate cyclase of purified rat adipocyte membranes in the absence of exogenous guanine nucleotides. Guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) inhibited the forskolin-activated cyclase immediately upon addition of the nucleotide at concentrations too low to activate adenylate cyclase (10(-9) to 10(-7) M). Inhibition seen with a very high concentration of Gpp(NH)p (10(-4) M) lasted for 3-4 min and was followed by an increase in the synthetic rate which remained constant for at least 15 min. The length of the transient inhibition did not vary with forskolin concentrations above 0.05 microM but low Gpp(NH)p (10(-8) M) exhibited a lengthened (6-7 min) inhibitory phase. The transient inhibitory effects of Gpp(NH)p were eliminated by 10(-7) M isoproterenol, high (40 mM) Mg2+, or preincubation with Gpp(NH)p in the absence of forskolin. While forskolin stimulated fat cell cyclase in the presence of Mn2+, this ion blocked the inhibitory effects of Gpp(NH)p. The well documented inhibitory effects of GTP on the fat cell adenylate cyclase system were also observed in the presence of forskolin. However, the inhibition by GTP is not transitory. These findings indicate that Gpp(NH)p regulation of forskolin-stimulated cyclase has at least two components: 1) an inhibitory component which acts through an undetermined mechanism and which acts immediately to decrease cyclase activity; and 2) an activating component which modulates the inhibited cyclase activity through the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein."

https://openalex.org/W1534976838,"T47D are unusual human breast cancer cells that do not require estrogen to synthesize high levels of progesterone receptors. These cells can, therefore, be used to study the mechanisms by which progesterone, freed of estrogen interference, controls the synthesis of its receptors. In a recent paper we described progesterone receptor translocation and a subsequent very rapid nuclear processing step that results in an apparent loss of 60 to 80% of cellular progesterone receptors, 30 to 60 min after progesterone treatment. This paper deals with the replenishment of cellular receptors following processing. If progesterone is removed from cells after 60 min of treatment, cytoplasmic progesterone receptors replenish in 16 to 20 h. However, replenishment occurs even during chronic progesterone treatment; this is an artifact created by the extremely rapid (t1/2 approximately 2 h) metabolism of progesterone in media exposed to cells. If progesterone metabolism is blocked, then replenishment is not seen, probably because the hormone continuously retranslocates the newly replenished sites. There is an early protein synthesis-dependent step; cycloheximide in the first 4 h inhibits replenishment 24 h later, but if cycloheximide is slightly delayed (beyond 4 h), replenishment proceeds normally. In contrast to progesterone, the synthetic progestin R5020 completely suppresses progesterone receptor replenishment even 96 h after its removal from the medium. This compound can bind covalently to receptors and may be very difficult to remove from cells. Clearly, progestin treatment, and by analogy, circulating progesterone, will have profound effects on cytoplasmic and nuclear progesterone receptor levels when these are measured in biopsied human tumors as an adjunct to endocrine therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1625767764,"The kinetics of 64Cu(II) uptake, efflux and net accumulation were examined with hepatocytes isolated from hemizygous and heterozygous brindled mice to determine the basis for the low hepatic copper levels in these mice. Initial rate data (0.5 min) for 64Cu(II) uptake showed no significant differences between the normal and mutant hepatocytes for the Km and Vmax parameters for copper uptake. The rate and total efflux of 64Cu from preloaded cells were also normal for both the hemizygous and heterozygous brindled hepatocytes. Normal and mutant hepatocytes exhibited an overshoot in net 64Cu(II) uptake when cells were incubated continuously with 64Cu(II) for 6 h. Maximal intracellular levels were attained at 1.5 to 2.5 h before a lower steady state was achieved by approximately 3 h. The mutant hepatocytes were also normal with respect to the time-delayed efflux process responsible for the overshoot in terms of 64Cu lost/min/mg of protein. However, both the hemizygous and heterozygous hepatocytes showed approximately 25% less than normal maximal copper accumulation. This accounted for the approximately 25% lower copper levels at steady state and also equaled the Cu deficiency in the resting whole livers. The impaired Cu accumulation characteristic is not a general property of Cu-deficient hepatocytes because nutritionally Cu-deficient hepatocytes exhibited higher than normal net 64Cu accumulation. The effect was Cu-specific since 65Zn(II) accumulation was normal with the mutant hepatocytes. The results are consistent with expression of the primary defect at the cellular level in the liver in the mouse mutants, and by inference, Menkes disease."
https://openalex.org/W1569590249,"The chloroperoxidase-peracetic acid-chloride-2-chlorodimedone system is used as a model for the investigation of enzymatic halogenation reactions. Systematic variation of the concentrations of the three substrates under steady state conditions yields sets of kinetic parameters containing both kinetic and mechanistic information. Three distinct enzyme species are involved in the halogenation cycle: native enzyme, compound I, and a short-lived halogenating intermediate. Analysis of the kinetic data is complicated by the fact that chloride serves as a substrate in the second step and as an inhibitor of the first step of the overall halogenation reaction. The inhibitor binding site on the native enzyme must be protonated prior to the binding of chloride. Chloride appears to be a competitive inhibitor for both compound I formation and cyanide binding to chloroperoxidase. Only the latter reaction can be studied directly in stopped-flow experiments since compound I disappears rapidly by reacting with chloride present in solution. Rate constants are calculated for the individual steps of the reaction at four different pH values. The rate constant for compound I formation is independent of pH, but the actual rate is reduced at lower pH values due to pH dependence of the chloride inhibition. The rate constant for the oxidation of chloride by compound I decreases with increasing pH. The rate of the halogenation step appears to be independent of pH."

https://openalex.org/W1589366508,"Protein synthesis occurring before the onset of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) stimulation of calcium uptake was examined in embryonic chick duodena by double label autoradiography. Duodena from 19-day-old embryos were cultured for 24 h. Duodena exposed to a saturating concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D3 during the last 2, 4, or 6 h were either cultured with [3H]leucine for the final 2 h or used for calcium uptake assays. Duodena not exposed to the hormone were either cultured with [14C]leucine for the final 2 h or used for calcium uptake assays. Calcium uptake by nonradiolabeled duodena was increased (p less than 0.05) only in tissues exposed to the hormone for 6 h. Tissue uptakes of [3H]leucine and [14C]leucine were identical and linear with time. Soluble proteins were extracted from 3H- and 14C-labeled tissues, mixed, and simultaneously resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of fluorographs and autoradiographs prepared from the double-labeled gels revealed a protein induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 within 2 h of exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and at lest 2 h before the calcium uptake response. The induced protein co-migrated with purified chick calcium-binding protein during two-dimensional electrophoresis. These results demonstrate that 1) this protein is the calcium-binding protein and 2) calcium-binding protein is clearly synthesized in the embryonic duodenum before the calcium uptake response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1550374019,"Dictyostelium discoideum cells appear to be able to recognize particular carbohydrate prosthetic groups at different stages in their life cycle. We therefore used our previously developed model system (consisting of polyacrylamide gels containing putative ligands covalently linked to the polymer) to determine the receptors on these cells capable of recognizing carbohydrates. D. discoideum cells, at different developmental stages from growth phase to late aggregation, were incubated with the derivatized gels, and the number of adherent cells was determined by measuring alanine transaminase after cell lysis. From 70 to 100% of the cells firmly adhered to gels derivatized with glucose, maltose, or cellobiose. The cells were also capable of binding to N-acetylglucosamine and mannose, but both the rate and the extent of binding to these sugars were less than those observed with the glucose derivatives. Furthermore, binding to N-acetylglucosamine decreased to negligible levels during the aggregation stage of development. The cells did not bind to the glucose-derivatized gels in the presence of glucose and a variety of carbohydrates containing glucose at the nonreducing termini, whereas binding was not inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, and derivatives of these sugars. Adhesion to all sugars was blocked by 2,4-dinitrophenol. This inhibitor also reversed the binding to gels containing N-acetylglucosamine and mannose, but not to glucose. Differential binding to the three monosaccharides was also observed under conditions affecting the normal amoeboid shape of the cells. In addition, adhesion to N-acetylglucosamine and mannose was trypsin-sensitive, whereas adhesion to glucose was only slightly affected by treating the cells with trypsin (and cycloheximide). These and other results suggest that D. discoideum cell adhesion to derivatized gels is mediated by three different receptors, one highly specific for glucose and two (probably less specific) for N-acetylglucosamine and mannose."

This response compression is not accompanied by the usual reduction in retinal sensitivity that occurs with background illumination. Furthermore, this effect is obtained only briefly after the offset of ambient lighting in the diurnal light-dark cycle of nonhibernating animals."
https://openalex.org/W1500161555,"The kinetic mechanism of the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed N-demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline supported by ethyl hydroperoxide was determined from initial rate and inhibition studies. When the concentration of N,N-dimethylaniline was varied in the presence of several different fixed concentrations of ethyl hydroperoxide, a double reciprocal plot of the data gave a series of parallel lines. Parallel lines were also observed when the data were plotted as a function of the concentration of ethyl hydroperoxide. A linear double reciprocal plot was obtained when the concentrations of both substrates were varied in a constant ratio. Competitive substrate inhibition was observed for N,N-dimethylaniline with a KI of 4.78 mM. Competitive substrate inhibition was also observed for ethyl hydroperoxide but the secondary replot of the slopes of the double reciprocal lines versus the concentrations of ethyl hydroperoxide intercepted the origin, indicating that no abortive binary complex between ethyl hydroperoxide and the enzyme was formed. These results suggested that the inhibition of the demethylation reaction by ethyl hydroperoxide was due to the reaction of ethyl hydroperoxide with chloroperoxidase compound I to evolve oxygen. N,N-Dimethylaniline inhibited the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed evolution of oxygen from ethyl hydroperoxide with a KI (0.111 mM) essentially identical with its KM for demethylation (0.122 mM). The inhibition of the demethylation reaction by 2,5-dimethylfuran was competitive with respect to N,N-dimethylaniline and uncompetitive with respect to ethyl hydroperoxide, consistent with dead-end inhibition in a ping-pong system. The results of the initial rate and inhibition studies are consistent with a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism as the minimal kinetic model for chloroperoxidase-catalyzed N-demethylation reactions. In this model, ethyl hydroperoxide reacts with chloroperoxidase to form the oxidized enzyme intermediate compound I with the concomitant release of ethanol. N,N-Dimethylaniline then binds to compound I and is oxidized, resulting in the formation of N-methylaniline and formaldehyde and the regeneration of the native peroxidase."

Third-stage larvae from the tick vector grew, developed, and molted twice in a medium containing NCTC 135 and Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum under a gas phase of 95 percent nitrogen and 5 percent carbon dioxide. The availability of such a culture system for filariids should facilitate studies of their immunology, biochemistry, and sensitivity to drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2039315854,A genomic clone consisting of the Moloney leukemia proviral genome with moderately repetitive mouse sequences was microinjected into the pronucleus of a mouse zygote. An animal was derived that carried multiple copies of proviral DNA in a tandem array. No evidence for homologous recombination was obtained. The viral genome was expressed in this animal and was transmitted as a single unit to its offspring. Subsequent breeding studies revealed that the proviral DNA had integrated on an X chromosome.
https://openalex.org/W1998867767,"A diffusible factor produced and secreted by malignant murine cells was capable of inducing plasminogen activator production by normal diploid human fibroblasts. The factor's ability to induce plasminogen activator was insensitive to treatment with nucleases, but its activity was destroyed by digestion with proteases. It is proposed that such a factor would play a role in malignancy if it would recruit normal cells that were adjacent to transformed cells to produce plasminogen activator which could result in tumor-promoted proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1590292171,"JEG-3 is a human choriocarcinoma cell line characterized by low levels of adenosine deaminase expression. For the purpose of studying adenosine deaminase gene regulation in the JEG-3 cells, we attempted to select variant cells having increased adenosine deaminase expression. This was accomplished by selecting cells for resistance to the cytotoxic adenosine analogs 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl adenine (ara-A) or 9-beta-D-xylofuranosyl adenine (xyl-A), both of which could presumably be detoxified by the action of adenosine deaminase. Single step high dose selection was ineffective in obtaining cells with increased adenosine deaminase. However, multistep selection using either ara-A or xyl-A resulted in cell populations with increased adenosine deaminase activity. Removal of selective pressure resulted in decreased adenosine deaminase levels. Subclones of xyl-A-resistant cells belonged to one of three phenotypic classes characterized by either elevated adenosine deaminase levels, decreased adenosine kinase levels, or both of these features. One subclone (A3-1A7) with unaltered adenosine kinase expression showed a 20-fold increase in adenosine deaminase expression. Further selection of this subclone for increasing xyl-A resistance resulted in an additional 2-fold increase in adenosine deaminase expression, followed by loss of adenosine kinase expression. These adenosine kinase-deficient cells showed no subsequent increase in adenosine deaminase expression in response to further xyl-A selection pressure. These results confirmed that xyl-A toxicity was mediated through its phosphorylated form and indicated that resistance may result from increased adenosine deaminase levels and/or adenosine kinase deficiency. The increased adenosine deaminase expression of the A3-1A7 subclone was exclusively in the ADA 2 allelic form. However, cell fusion experiments between A3-1A7 cells and mouse C1-1D cells established the existence of functional copies of both ADA 1 and ADA 2 allelic genes in the A3-1A7 cells. The increased expression of only one of the two functional ADA alleles, the requirement for a stepwise selection protocol to obtain cells with increased adenosine deaminase, and the instability of the adenosine deaminase phenotype in the absence of selective pressure suggest that the alteration of adenosine deaminase phenotype in the drug-resistant cells was the result of adenosine deaminase gene amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1542807160,"The alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, thymine 7-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.6), has been purified from cultures of Rhodotorula glutinis grown with thymine as a nitrogen source. The purification scheme developed yielded essentially homogeneous preparations of the 7-hydroxylase and also purified another alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside 2'-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.3). The purity of the 7-hydroxylase was determined with analytical disc gel electrophoresis in which runs were varied with respect to pH, extent of cross-linking, and the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol. The 7-hydroxylase apparently exists as a monomer since its molecular weight was 42,700 when determined by molecular gel filtration chromatography and was 40,300 when determined by analytical disc gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturing conditions was used to show that the 2'-hydroxylase has a molecular weight of 64,600. The essentially homogeneous preparations of the 7-hydroxylase were shown to catalyze the thymine-, 5-hydroxymethyluracil-, and 5-formyluracil-dependent oxygenations that are coupled to the decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate, as well as a putative uncoupled decarboxylation which is dependent on uracil. Furthermore, these enzyme preparations were used to show that ATP stimulated the 7-hydroxylase reaction in the absence of ascorbate. Even though it is attractive to consider the four pyrimidine-dependent reactions as being catalyzed by the same active site, they were shown to differ markedly in their dependencies on ascorbate or ATP. The effects of ascorbate and ATP on these reactions, and on the 2'-hydroxylase reaction, are discussed in terms of the possible roles of ascorbate and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1560830776,"The mode of action of carnitine on the growth of the yeast Torulopsis bovina ATCC 26014 was investigated. When 0.5-5 microM L-carnitine was added to the medium, the growth rate doubled for both aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Cells grown in the absence of carnitine contain 0.4 nmol of L-carnitine/g, wet weight, but with 5 microM L-carnitine in the media, cells contain 1400 nmol of carnitine/g, wet weight, by the end of exponential growth. When [1-14C]acetyl-L-carnitine was added to growth media, almost all of the radioactivity became cell-associated. Most of the 14C was incorporated into cell protein although considerable 14C was recovered in the fatty acid fraction of saponified cells. Analyses of the amino acids derived from radiolabeled protein showed that the acetyl[14C] of acetylcarnitine was in glutamate, arginine, proline, leucine, and lysine. In contrast, [1-14C]acetate labeled leucine and lysine. Isopycnic density gradient analysis demonstrated that carnitine acetyltransferase was primarily associated with mitochondria, while acetyl-CoA synthetase and acetyl-CoA hydrolase were cytosolic. Isolated mitochondria incorporated [14C]acetylcarnitine radioactivity into citrate and 2-oxoglutarate. The data are consistent with carnitine facilitating the transfer of acetyl groups from the cytosol into mitochondria for synthesis of citrate and its metabolites. These results demonstrate a role for carnitine in biosyntheses in the yeast T. bovina."
https://openalex.org/W1486797051,"Upon solubilization and partial purification, renal mitochondrial P-450 catalyzes both the 1 alpha- and 24-hydroxylations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the absence of NADPH. Neither 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 nor 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is further metabolized by the enzyme. Under similar conditions, P-450 obtained from hepatic microsomes or adrenal mitochondria is inactive as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 hydroxylase. Both hydroxylations are heat-sensitive and are inhibited by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin, 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3, EDTA, menadione, dithiothreitol, and cadmium but not by carbon monoxide. Cumene hydroperoxide does not facilitate either hydroxylation and no lipid peroxides can be detected in the system either prior to or after incubation with the substrate. Based on these data, it is proposed that during these hydroxylations P-450 is acting as a dioxygenase. The first step in the sequence of reactions is postulated to be a P-450-catalyzed formation of a hydroperoxide at carbon 1 of a substrate molecule. This is followed by the 25-hydroxyvitamin D hydroperoxide-supported, P-450-catalyzed hydroxylation of another molecule of substrate at either the 1 alpha or the 24 position. During the cycle 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is also generated from the hydroperoxide. From this mechanism, it can be concluded that one form of P-450 is capable of catalyzing the production of both 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3."
https://openalex.org/W1509621923,"Antithrombin III mRNA was enriched from a baboon liver by specific polysome immunoprecipitation. The partially purified antithrombin III mRNA preparation was used for cDNA synthesis and cloning. Candidate antithrombin III cDNA clones were identified by differential hybridization using as probes [32P]cDNAs synthesized from the polysome-enriched and -depleted RNA fractions, respectively. The candidate clones were further analyzed by hybrid-selected translation. The authenticity of a cDNA clone positive to both tests was unambiguously confirmed by matching its nucleotide sequence with the known amino acid sequence of human antithrombin III. The baboon antithrombin III cDNA clone hybridized well with human antithrombin III mRNA and can be used as a probe to isolate the corresponding human gene."
https://openalex.org/W1546471939,"The complete primary structures of the two main forms, PRP-IV and PRP-V, of a proline-rich polypeptide bound in vivo to rat prostatic binding protein has been determined. Their sequences were established using manual Edman degradation of the native polypeptide and of purified fragments derived from trypsin and thermolysin digestions. Both polypeptides contain 38 amino acid residues (Mr = 4397 and 4339); cysteine, methionine, and serine are missing. In spite of the high proline content (21%), no polyproline stretches were detected. PRP-IV and PRP-V show an extensive structural homology and differ only by three substitutions. These amino acid replacements are located in the NH2-terminal part of the molecule at positions 6 (His leads to Pro), 10 (Pro leads to His), and 11 (Asp leads to Gly). Moreover, each component displays a microheterogeneity at several positions in the sequence which indicates that multiple structural variants exist for PRP-IV and PRP-V. These data not only suggest the existence in rat ventral prostate of a multigene family coding for the proline-rich polypeptides but also the occurrence of a pronounced genetic polymorphism for these components. In addition, a remarkable sequence homology is observed between the PRP components and the region of the B chain in the precursor of mouse renin."
