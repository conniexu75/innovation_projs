https://openalex.org/W2593308454,"Theta-gamma phase coupling and spike timing within theta oscillations are prominent features of the hippocampus and are often related to navigation and memory. However, the mechanisms that give rise to these relationships are not well understood. Using high spatial resolution electrophysiology, we investigated the influence of CA3 and entorhinal inputs on the timing of CA1 neurons. The theta-phase preference and excitatory strength of the afferent CA3 and entorhinal inputs effectively timed the principal neuron activity, as well as regulated distinct CA1 interneuron populations in multiple tasks and behavioral states. Feedback potentiation of distal dendritic inhibition by CA1 place cells attenuated the excitatory entorhinal input at place field entry, coupled with feedback depression of proximal dendritic and perisomatic inhibition, allowing the CA3 input to gain control toward the exit. Thus, upstream inputs interact with local mechanisms to determine theta-phase timing of hippocampal neurons to support memory and spatial navigation."

A mitochondrial defect in the synVI strain mapped to synonymous coding changes within PRE4 (YFR050C), encoding an essential proteasome subunit; Sc2.0 coding changes reduced Pre4 protein accumulation by half. Completing Sc2.0 specifies consolidation of 16 synthetic chromosomes into a single strain. We investigated phenotypic, transcriptional, and proteomewide consequences of Sc2.0 chromosome consolidation in poly-synthetic strains. Another ""bug"" was discovered through proteomic analysis, associated with alteration of the HIS2 transcription start due to transfer RNA deletion and loxPsym site insertion. Despite extensive genetic alterations across 6% of the genome, no major global changes were detected in the poly-synthetic strain ""omics"" analyses.

https://openalex.org/W2607040243,"INTRODUCTION The Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2.0 project (Sc2.0) aims to modify the yeast genome with a series of densely spaced designer changes. Both a synthetic yeast chromosome arm (synIXR) and the entirely synthetic chromosome (synIII) function with high fitness in yeast. For designer genome synthesis projects, precise engineering of the physical sequence to match the specified design is important for the systematic evaluation of underlying design principles. Yeast can maintain nuclear chromosomes as rings, occurring by chance at repeated sequences, although the cyclized format is unfavorable in meiosis given the possibility of dicentric chromosome formation from meiotic recombination. Here, we describe the de novo synthesis of synthetic yeast chromosome V (synV) in the “Build-A-Genome China” course, perfectly matching the designer sequence and bearing loxPsym sites, distinguishable watermarks, and all the other features of the synthetic genome. We generated a ring synV derivative with user-specified cyclization coordinates and characterized its performance in mitosis and meiosis. RATIONALE Systematic evaluation of underlying Sc2.0 design principles requires that the final assembled synthetic genome perfectly match the designed sequence. Given the size of yeast chromosomes, synthetic chromosome construction is performed iteratively, and new mutations and unpredictable events may occur during synthesis; even a very small number of unintentional nucleotide changes across the genome could have substantial effects on phenotype. Therefore, precisely matching the physical sequence to the designed sequence is crucial for verification of the design principles in genome synthesis. Ring chromosomes can extend those design principles to provide a model for genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders. RESULTS We chemically synthesized, assembled, and incorporated designer chromosome synV (536,024 base pairs) of S. cerevisiae according to Sc2.0 principles, based on the complete nucleotide sequence of native yeast chromosome V (576,874 base pairs). This work was performed as part of the “Build-A-Genome China” course in Tianjin University. We corrected all mutations found—including duplications, substitutions, and indels—in the initial synV strain by using integrative cotransformation of the precise desired changes and by means of a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–based method. Altogether, 3331 corrected base pairs were required to match to the designed sequence. We generated a strain that exactly matches all designer sequence changes that displays high fitness under a variety of culture conditions. All corrections were verified with whole-genome sequencing; RNA sequencing revealed only minor changes in gene expression—most notably, decreases in expression of genes relocated near synthetic telomeres as a result of design. We constructed a functional circular synV (ring_synV) derivative in yeast by precisely joining both chromosome ends (telomeres) at specified coordinates. The ring chromosome showed restoration of subtelomeric gene expression levels. The ring_synV strain exhibited fitness comparable with that of the linear synV strain, revealed no change in sporulation frequency, but notably reduced spore viability. In meiosis, heterozygous or homozygous diploid ring_wtV and ring_synV chromosomes behaved similarly, exhibiting substantially higher frequency of the formation of zero-spore tetrads, a type that was not seen in the rod chromosome diploids. Rod synV chromosomes went through meiosis with high spore viability, despite no effort having been made to preserve meiotic competency in the design of synV. CONCLUSION The perfect designer-matched synthetic chromosome V provides strategies to edit sequence variants and correct unpredictable events, such as off-target integration of extra copies of synthetic DNA elsewhere in the genome. We also constructed a ring synthetic chromosome derivative and evaluated its fitness and stability in yeast. Both synV and synVI can be circularized and can power yeast cell growth without affecting fitness when gene content is maintained. These fitness and stability phenotypes of the ring synthetic chromosome in yeast provide a model system with which to probe the mechanism of human ring chromosome disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2596907809,"Debugging a genome sequence is imperative for successfully building a synthetic genome. As part of the effort to build a designer eukaryotic genome, yeast synthetic chromosome X (synX), designed as 707,459 base pairs, was synthesized chemically. SynX exhibited good fitness under a wide variety of conditions. A highly efficient mapping strategy called pooled PCRTag mapping (PoPM), which can be generalized to any watermarked synthetic chromosome, was developed to identify genetic alterations that affect cell fitness (""bugs""). A series of bugs were corrected that included a large region bearing complex amplifications, a growth defect mapping to a recoded sequence in FIP1, and a loxPsym site affecting promoter function of ATP2 PoPM is a powerful tool for synthetic yeast genome debugging and an efficient strategy for phenotype-genotype mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2595742156,"We designed and synthesized a 976,067-base pair linear chromosome, synXII, based on native chromosome XII in Saccharomyces cerevisiae SynXII was assembled using a two-step method, specified by successive megachunk integration and meiotic recombination-mediated assembly, producing a functional chromosome in S. cerevisiae. Minor growth defect ""bugs"" detected in synXII, caused by deletion of tRNA genes, were rescued by introducing an ectopic copy of a single tRNA gene. The ribosomal gene cluster (rDNA) on synXII was left intact during the assembly process and subsequently replaced by a modified rDNA unit used to regenerate rDNA at three distinct chromosomal locations. The signature sequences within rDNA, which can be used to determine species identity, were swapped to generate a Saccharomyces synXII strain that would be identified as Saccharomyces bayanus by standard DNA barcoding procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2596950554,"INTRODUCTION Although much effort has been devoted to studying yeast in the past few decades, our understanding of this model organism is still limited. Rapidly developing DNA synthesis techniques have made a “build-to-understand” approach feasible to reengineer on the genome scale. Here, we report on the completion of a 770-kilobase synthetic yeast chromosome II (synII). SynII was characterized using extensive Trans-Omics tests. Despite considerable sequence alterations, synII is virtually indistinguishable from wild type. However, an up-regulation of translational machinery was observed and can be reversed by restoring the transfer RNA (tRNA) gene copy number. RATIONALE Following the “design-build-test-debug” working loop, synII was successfully designed and constructed in vivo. Extensive Trans-Omics tests were conducted, including phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, chromosome segregation, and replication analyses. By both complementation assays and SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP -mediated evolution), we targeted and debugged the origin of a growth defect at 37°C in glycerol medium. RESULTS To efficiently construct megabase-long chromosomes, we developed an I- Sce I–mediated strategy, which enables parallel integration of synthetic chromosome arms and reduced the overall integration time by 50% for synII. An I- Sce I site is introduced for generating a double-strand break to promote targeted homologous recombination during mitotic growth. Despite hundreds of modifications introduced, there are still regions sharing substantial sequence similarity that might lead to undesirable meiotic recombinations when intercrossing the two semisynthetic chromosome arm strains. Induction of the I- Sce I–mediated double-strand break is otherwise lethal and thus introduced a strong selective pressure for targeted homologous recombination. Since our strategy is designed to generate a markerless synII and leave the URA3 marker on the wild-type chromosome, we observed a tenfold increase in URA3 -deficient colonies upon I- Sce I induction, meaning that our strategy can greatly bias the crossover events toward the designated regions. By incorporating comprehensive phenotyping approaches at multiple levels, we demonstrated that synII was capable of powering the growth of yeast indistinguishably from wild-type cells (see the figure), showing highly consistent biological processes comparable to the native strain. Meanwhile, we also noticed modest but potentially significant up-regulation of the translational machinery. The main alteration underlying this change in expression is the deletion of 13 tRNA genes. A growth defect was observed in one very specific condition—high temperature (37°C) in medium with glycerol as a carbon source—where colony size was reduced significantly. We targeted and debugged this defect by two distinct approaches. The first approach involved phenotype screening of all intermediate strains followed by a complementation assay with wild-type sequences in the synthetic strain. By doing so, we identified a modification resulting from PCRTag recoding in TSC10 , which is involved in regulation of the yeast high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response pathway. After replacement with wild-type TSC10 , the defect was greatly mitigated. The other approach, debugging by SCRaMbLE, showed rearrangements in regions containing HOG regulation genes. Both approaches indicated that the defect is related to HOG response dysregulation. Thus, the phenotypic defect can be pinpointed and debugged through multiple alternative routes in the complex cellular interactome network. CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that synII segregates, replicates, and functions in a highly similar fashion compared with its wild-type counterpart. Furthermore, we believe that the iterative “design-build-test-debug” cycle methodology, established here, will facilitate progression of the Sc2.0 project in the face of the increasing synthetic genome complexity.

Similarity with memory athlete connectivity patterns predicted memory improvements up to 4 months after training. In conclusion, mnemonic training drives distributed rather than regional changes, reorganizing the brain’s functional network organization to enable superior memory performance. Memory is one of the core components of human cognition. Memory is critical for learning new information and allows one to plan for the future (Schacter et al., 2007Schacter D.L. Addis D.R. Buckner R.L. Remembering the past to imagine the future: the prospective brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). The sense of self is defined, in part, by one’s ability to remember past events. It is understandable, therefore, that few brain disorders are feared more than Alzheimer’s disease, the quintessential disorder of memory loss. The medial temporal lobes have been linked to memory since the seminal early reports on patient H.M. (Scoville and Milner, 1957Scoville W.B. Milner B. Loss of recent memory after bilateral hippocampal lesions.J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1957; 20: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4885) Google Scholar). Increasingly, however, the field has moved from a region-based understanding of memory function to a network-based approach. The network approach maintains the importance of medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures while highlighting the relevance of their interactions with cortical structures like the angular gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, among others (Greicius et al., 2003Greicius M.D. Krasnow B. Reiss A.L. Menon V. Functional connectivity in the resting brain: a network analysis of the default mode hypothesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The network approach has begun to inform our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and how it might spread progressively to other brain regions (Seeley et al., 2009Seeley W.W. Crawford R.K. Zhou J.

To better understand the network structure supporting memory, we focus here not on memory loss but on memory gain. The top participants of the annual World Memory Championships regularly demonstrate the ability to memorize hundreds of words, digits, or other abstract information units within minutes (Foer, 2011Foer J. Moonwalking with Einstein. Penguin Books, London2011Google Scholar). Surprisingly, such memory skills do not seem to be associated with extraordinary brain anatomy or general cognitive superiority, but they are acquired through deliberate training in mnemonic strategies (Maguire et al., 2003Maguire E.A. Valentine E.R. Wilding J.M. Kapur N. Routes to remembering: the brains behind superior memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Dresler and Konrad, 2013Dresler M. Konrad B.N. Mnemonic expertise during wakefulness and sleep.Behav. Brain Sci. 2013; 36 (discussion 634–659): 616-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The most prominent mnemonic technique is the method of loci, an ancient technique used extensively by Greek and Roman orators (Yates, 1966Yates F.A. The Art of Memory. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London1966Google Scholar). It utilizes well-established memories of visuospatial routes: during encoding, the to-be-remembered information is visualized at salient points along such a route, which in turn is mentally retraced during retrieval. While numerous behavioral studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mnemonic strategies, such as the method of loci (Worthen and Hunt, 2011Worthen J.B. Hunt R.R. Mnemonology. Psychology Press, New York2011Google Scholar), data on the brain changes underlying mnemonics are sparse. Previous fMRI studies have demonstrated transient activation of visuospatial brain regions during use of the method of loci in both expert and novice users (Maguire et al., 2003Maguire E.A. Valentine E.R. Wilding J.M. Kapur N. Routes to remembering: the brains behind superior memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Nyberg et al., 2003Nyberg L. Sandblom J. Jones S. Neely A.S. Petersson K.M. Ingvar M. Bäckman L. Neural correlates of training-related memory improvement in adulthood and aging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13728-13733Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). More long-lasting changes in baseline brain function or anatomy, however, have not been observed in mnemonic experts, possibly because distributed effects or distinctive brain network connectivity patterns are difficult to detect on the basis of very small sample sizes. To elucidate changes in baseline brain function due to extensive training in mnemonic strategies, here we investigate brain networks that are associated with memory and visuospatial processing. We compare fMRI functional connectivity patterns of a comparably large sample of the world’s leading memory athletes with mnemonics-naive subjects before and after an intense training in the method of loci. We investigated 23 memory athletes (aged 28 ± 8.6 years, nine women) of the top 50 of the memory sports world ranking list. We used MRI to assess both brain anatomy and function during task-free rest before engaging in memory tasks. All of these participants attribute their superior memory skills to deliberate training in mnemonic strategies. The memory athletes were compared with a control group closely matched for age, sex, intelligence, and handedness. Of the 23 athletes, 17 participated in a word learning task under fMRI conditions where they demonstrated their superior memory abilities compared to controls (70.8 ± 0.6 versus 39.9 ± 3.6 of 72 words correctly recalled 20 min after encoding; median, 72 versus 41; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.001, r = 0.62). As to whether naive controls can improve their memory with mnemonic training similar to that of memory athletes, 51 participants (aged 24 ± 3.0 years, all men) without any prior experience in mnemonic strategies completed two fMRI sessions over a 6-week interval (Figure 1). In each session, all participants performed a memory test in which they memorized 72 words. Memory was tested with free recall after 20 min and again after 24 hr. After the 24-hr retest of the first session, subjects were pseudo-randomly assigned to 6 weeks (40 × 30 min) of mnemonic training in the method of loci or an active (n-back working memory training) or passive (no training) control condition (Figure 1). At the conclusion of the 6-week training period, participants returned for a post-training assessment that again included a resting state fMRI scan and a further encoding session of 72 new words, followed by free recall after 20-min and 24-hr delays. Then 4 months after training completion, participants of all three groups were invited again for a memory test of the 72 words used in the first session to assess potential long-term benefits of mnemonic training. We observed significantly improved memory performance in the participants of the mnemonic training condition in the second experimental session, and this improvement was significantly greater than observed in participants of the active and passive control groups (F2,48 > 20, p < 0.001, η2 > 0.4 each). These effects persisted at the 4-month follow-up (F2,43 = 13.4, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.39; Figure 2; Table S2). We were interested in the functional organization of brain networks underlying mnemonic expertise in memory athletes in comparison to brain network reorganization as a result of an intense mnemonic training in naive subjects. All participants underwent a T1-weighted anatomical scan and an 8-min resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan with a 3.0T scanner. Scans were completed before engaging in any memory-related activity, ensuring the assessment of pure baseline brain network organization. After fMRI data preprocessing, functional connectivity (FC) was calculated among 71 regions of interest (ROIs) distributed across six brain networks related to memory and visuospatial processing (Figure 3). FC was compared between athletes and controls with a two-sample t test, producing a 71 × 71 connectivity matrix cataloguing differences in pairwise FC (athletes-controls connectivity matrix, Figure 4). This difference matrix was then used as a starting point to test whether this network organization was innate to the athletes or could be instilled by 6 weeks of mnemonic training in naive subjects.Figure 4Similarity of Training-Induced Connectivity Changes with Athlete-Control Connectivity DifferencesShow full caption(A) Brain network connectivity differences between memory athletes and controls.(B) Connectivity changes from pre- to post-training assessment for each training condition.(C) Scatterplots and correlations between the memory athlete versus control connectivity difference matrix and the pre- versus post-training connectivity difference matrices.

(B) Connectivity changes from pre- to post-training assessment for each training condition. (C) Scatterplots and correlations between the memory athlete versus control connectivity difference matrix and the pre- versus post-training connectivity difference matrices. The pattern of connectivity differences between memory athletes and controls correlates significantly with the pattern of connectivity changes in the mnemonic training condition (r = 0.222, p = 0.005), but does not correlate significantly with the connectivity pattern changes in the active (r = 0.011, p = 0.943) and passive (r = −0.061, p = 0.632) control groups. In the training groups, we therefore calculated pre- and post-training connectivity matrices in the same manner as above. Using paired t tests, we produced three 71 × 71 connectivity difference matrices documenting changes in connectivity for each training condition. We then compared these FC changes for each training group with the FC pattern that distinguished athletes from controls by correlating the two T-score matrices. We found that mnemonic training elicited changes in brain network organization that significantly resembled the network connectivity patterns that distinguish memory athletes from controls (Figure 4; r = 0.22, p < 0.005). Neither the active nor passive control group experienced similar changes in neural network organization (r < 0.02, p > 0.6 each). In contrast to this multivariate effect of global connectivity similarity, none of the univariate differences between any of the groups were significant after correction for multiple comparisons via false discovery rate. In other words, without comparison to the athlete/control connectivity difference pattern, no connectivity changes through mnemonic training would have been observed in our sample. We next examined whether brain network re-organization was related to improved memory performance. We calculated the correlation of each individual subject’s connectivity change matrix (post-training minus pre-training FC matrix) to the athletes-controls matrix, producing 51 different similarity values, one for each participant across the three training arms. These values were regressed against the participants’ change-in-free recall scores (post-training minus pre-training free recall performance). We found that the correlation of individual change matrices to the athletes-controls matrix was significantly related to the participants’ changes in free recall performance. This was true for 20-min delayed recall, 24-hr delayed recall, and in a follow-up memory test 4 months after the end of training (Figure 5; Z = 2.07, p = 0.019; Z = 2.12, p = 0.017; Z = 1.65, p = 0.049, respectively). Given that both memory athletes and participants of the mnemonic condition after training showed strong ceiling effects in the memory task, no meaningful correlations were possible within these groups. Further emphasizing the multivariate nature of our findings, for all other comparisons, simple within-group univariate correlations with behavior were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. We also did not find significant associations with training speed within the mnemonic training group. To understand the nature of the multivariate finding in more detail, we tested whether the effect is distributed across all connections between our selected ROIs or driven by more discriminative connections. We focused on those 25 connections in the athletes-controls matrix whose T-score absolute (i.e., both positive and negative) values were among the top 1% of largest differences. We tested across participants if similarity between the individual pre-/post-training connectivity difference matrices with the athlete-control difference matrix differed between this restricted set of 25 connections and the whole set of 2,485 connections. We found a significant increase in similarity in the mnemonic training condition (t = 2.61, p = 0.019), but not for the active (t = 0.59, p = 0.57) or passive (t = –1.65, p = 0.12) control groups. This suggests that the top 1% of connections carried a disproportional amount of information, thus allowing a more specific interpretation of the observed multivariate effect: connectivity between two major hubs (medial prefrontal cortex [MPFC] and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) and a number of regions important for memory processes, including the left parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and right angular gyrus, was pivotal for the observed similarity between training effects and memory athlete connectivity patterns (Figure 6). To gain additional insight into network dynamics, we investigated if the effect was more prominent within or between brain networks. We repeated the correlational similarity analyses for 885 connections lying entirely within the default mode network (ventral and dorsal combined), the visual network (visuospatial and higher visual combined), or the MTL (left and right combined) and separately for the 1,600 connections between the default mode, visual, and MTL networks (Figure 7). We found for no condition significant resemblance of the pre- versus post-connectivity differences with athlete versus control connectivity differences within the networks (mnemonic training: r = 0.10, p = 0.29; active control: r = –0.05, p = 0.64; passive control: r = –0.17, p = 0.13). In contrast, we did find a significant correlation for pre- versus post-connectivity differences with athlete versus control connectivity differences between the networks in the mnemonic training condition (r = 0.21, p = 0.01), whereas the respective correlations for the active and passive control conditions were not significant (active control: r = 0.02, p = 0.82; passive control: r = 0.00, p = 0.96). Importantly, for the mnemonic training condition, similarity with athlete-control connectivity patterns was significantly larger for between- versus within-network connectivity (t = 2.17, p = 0.049). Hence, the observed effect was mainly driven by between- rather than within-network connectivity patterns during task-free baseline rest. To replicate our findings and to test whether the observed multivariate similarity between brain network connectivity patterns of memory athletes and after mnemonic training was restricted to baseline rest or is also present during active memory encoding, we repeated the described analyses also for connectivity as seen in the fMRI encoding task data. We were able to replicate the main finding of a correlational similarity between athlete/control and pre-/post-training connectivity difference patterns for the mnemonic condition (r = 0.26, p = 0.02), but not for the active (r = 0.03, p = 0.74) and passive (r = –0.03, p = 0.70) control groups. Strikingly, in the within- versus between-network analyses for the task recordings, we found the opposite effect than for task-free resting state data: we observed a significant correlation for pre-post with athlete-control connectivity patterns within the networks, specifically in the mnemonic training condition (mnemonic training: r = 0.40, p = 0.01; active control: r = 0.00, p = 0.97; passive control: r = 0.04, p = 0.70), however, no significant similarity for between-network connectivity in any of the training groups (mnemonic training: r = 0.17, p = 0.17; active control: r = 0.05, p = 0.65; passive control: r = –0.07, p = 0.50). For the mnemonic training condition, similarity with athlete-control connectivity patterns was significantly larger for within- versus between-network connectivity (t = 3.0, p = 0.01). Hence, in contrast to the task-free resting state, the similarity effect was driven by within- rather than between-network connectivity patterns during task. Our results demonstrate that superior memory is supported by a multivariate resting state FC profile distributed throughout the default mode network, visual networks, and the MTL. This superior memory connectivity profile can be instilled in naive controls by a 6-week period of mnemonic training in the method of loci: the greater the degree to which an individual’s FC profile after training resembled the memory athletes’ connectivity pattern, the more that individual profited on measures of short- and long-delay memory. The improved memory observed after mnemonic training persists for as long as 4 months after training concludes. Of note, the training-induced similarity with the superior memory connectivity profile can be observed both during task-free baseline resting state and for background brain connectivity during active encoding. During rest, similarity between training-induced changes and the specific connectivity pattern of memory athletes is mainly driven by connectivity between brain networks, whereas during encoding it is driven by within-network connectivity. One hypothesis for the efficacy of mnemonic strategies invokes their use of naturally evolved skills, such as visuospatial memory and navigation (Maguire et al., 2003Maguire E.A. Valentine E.R. Wilding J.M. Kapur N. Routes to remembering: the brains behind superior memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In the method of loci, abstract and unrelated information units are transformed into concrete and related information patterns that can more easily be processed by memory-related brain structures, such as the hippocampus. The method of loci has been associated with hippocampal place and grid cells (Becchetti, 2010Becchetti A. Hippocampal formation and the classical art of memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: E104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which are also active during mental navigation (Bellmund et al., 2016Bellmund J.L. Deuker L. Navarro Schröder T. Doeller C.F.

Brain regions critical for visuospatial memory and navigation, such as retrosplenial and hippocampal areas, are engaged during mnemonic encoding in memory athletes (Maguire et al., 2003Maguire E.A. Valentine E.R. Wilding J.M. Kapur N. Routes to remembering: the brains behind superior memory.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Acquisition of the method of loci in novices is related to activation increases in the left hippocampal region; its use during encoding is related with increased activation in the left occipito-parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and DLPFC (Nyberg et al., 2003Nyberg L. Sandblom J. Jones S. Neely A.S. Petersson K.M. Ingvar M. Bäckman L. Neural correlates of training-related memory improvement in adulthood and aging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 13728-13733Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar); and its use during recall is related with increased activation in the left parahippocampal gyrus and retrosplenial cortex (Kondo et al., 2005Kondo Y. Suzuki M. Mugikura S. Abe N. Takahashi S. Iijima T. Fujii T. Changes in brain activation associated with use of a memory strategy: a functional MRI study.Neuroimage. 2005; 24: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These studies converge with our data in that the left parahippocampal gyrus and bilateral retrosplenial cortex both showed significant changes in network connectivity between memory athletes and controls. We identified the right DLPFC as a hub for a number of connections that contributed most strongly to the transfer effect. The DLPFC is more strongly activated when information is encoded in a more structured way, e.g., by chunking (Bor et al., 2003Bor D. Duncan J. Wiseman R.J. Owen A.M. Encoding strategies dissociate prefrontal activity from working memory demand.Neuron. 2003; 37: 361-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In particular, the right DLPFC has been linked to the use of memory strategies: patients with right DLPFC lesions are specifically impaired when using strategies during memory tasks (Chase et al., 2008Chase H.W. Clark L. Sahakian B.J. Bullmore E.T. Robbins T.W. Dissociable roles of prefrontal subregions in self-ordered working memory performance.Neuropsychologia. 2008; 46: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right DLPFC interferes with retrieval only in users of encoding strategies (Manenti et al., 2010Manenti R. Cotelli M. Calabria M. Maioli C. Miniussi C. The role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in retrieval from long-term memory depends on strategies: a repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation study.Neuroscience. 2010; 166: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The right DLPFC shows activation increases mainly for the encoding of visual material (Kelley et al., 1998Kelley W.M. Miezin F.M. McDermott K.B. Buckner R.L. Raichle M.E. Cohen N.J. Ollinger J.M.

Changes in brain activation associated with use of a memory strategy: a functional MRI study.Neuroimage. 2005; 24: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The prominent role of right DLPFC we found in the brain connectivity profile of experts in the method of loci is, therefore, convergent with previous work linking this brain region to visuospatial processing and encoding strategies. Our results suggest participation of the MPFC in the FC profile supporting superior memory. Separate research on mental schemas has highlighted the role of the MPFC in memory processes: mental schemas enhance learning by allowing efficient encoding of newly acquired information through incorporation in pre-existing knowledge structures (Tse et al., 2007Tse D. Langston R.F. Kakeyama M. Bethus I. Spooner P.A. Wood E.R. Witter M.P. Morris R.G. Schemas and memory consolidation.Science. 2007; 316: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Schema utilization improves learning and is associated with increased activity in, and connectivity between, the MPFC and information-related cortices (van Kesteren et al., 2010avan Kesteren M.T. Rijpkema M. Ruiter D.J. Fernández G. Retrieval of associative information congruent with prior knowledge is related to increased medial prefrontal activity and connectivity.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15888-15894Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the manipulation of prior schema knowledge was shown to influence MPFC-hippocampal connectivity during encoding and post-encoding rest (van Kesteren et al., 2010bvan Kesteren M.T. Fernández G. Norris D.G. Hermans E.J. Persistent schema-dependent hippocampal-neocortical connectivity during memory encoding and postencoding rest in humans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 7550-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Mnemonics, such as the method of loci, can be conceptualized as utilizing schemas, providing pre-learned knowledge structures into which new information can be rapidly encoded. Analyzing network dynamics, we observed that the similarity of mnemonic training-induced brain reorganization with superior memory connectivity patterns was mainly driven by between-network connectivity during task-free baseline resting state and by within-network connectivity during actual encoding. While task-related brain processes are known to be intrinsically related to task-independent measurements collected at rest (Hampson et al., 2006Hampson M. Driesen N.R. Skudlarski P. Gore J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2595847241,"INTRODUCTION The overall organization of budding yeast chromosomes is driven and regulated by four factors: (i) the tethering and clustering of centromeres at the spindle pole body; (ii) the loose tethering of telomeres at the nuclear envelope, where they form small, dynamic clusters; (iii) a single nucleolus in which the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster is sequestered from other chromosomes; and (iv) chromosomal arm lengths. Hi-C, a genomic derivative of the chromosome conformation capture approach, quantifies the proximity of all DNA segments present in the nuclei of a cell population, unveiling the average multiscale organization of chromosomes in the nuclear space. We exploited Hi-C to investigate the trajectories of synthetic chromosomes within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nucleus and compare them with their native counterparts. RATIONALE The Sc2.0 genome design specifies strong conservation of gene content and arrangement with respect to the native chromosomal sequence. However, synthetic chromosomes incorporate thousands of designer changes, notably the removal of transfer RNA genes and repeated sequences such as transposons and subtelomeric repeats to enhance stability. They also carry loxPsym sites, allowing for inducible genome SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by loxP -mediated evolution) aimed at accelerating genomic plasticity. Whether these changes affect chromosome organization, DNA metabolism, and fitness is a critical question for completion of the Sc2.0 project. To address these questions, we used Hi-C to characterize the organization of synthetic chromosomes. RESULTS Comparison of synthetic chromosomes with native counterparts revealed no substantial changes, showing that the redesigned sequences, and especially the removal of repeated sequences, had little or no effect on average chromosome trajectories. Sc2.0 synthetic chromosomes have Hi-C contact maps with much smoother contact patterns than those of native chromosomes, especially in subtelomeric regions. This improved “mappability” results directly from the removal of repeated elements all along the length of the synthetic chromosomes. These observations highlight a conceptual advance enabled by bottom-up chromosome synthesis, which allows refinement of experimental systems to make complex questions easier to address. Despite the overall similarity, differences were observed in two instances. First, deletion of the HML and HMR silent mating-type cassettes on chromosome III led to a loss of their specific interaction. Second, repositioning the large array of rDNA repeats nearer to the centromere cluster forced substantial genome-wide conformational changes—for instance, inserting the array in the middle of the small right arm of chromosome III split the arm into two noninteracting regions. The nucleolus structure was then trapped in the middle between small and large chromosome arms, imposing a physical barrier between them. In addition to describing the Sc2.0 chromosome organization, we also used Hi-C to identify chromosomal rearrangements resulting from SCRaMbLE experiments. Inducible recombination between the hundreds of loxPsym sites introduced into Sc2.0 chromosomes enables combinatorial rearrangements of the genome structure. Hi-C contact maps of two SCRaMbLE strains carrying synIII and synIXR chromosomes revealed a variety of cis events, including simple deletions, inversions, and duplications, as well as translocations, the latter event representing a class of trans SCRaMbLE rearrangements not previously observed. CONCLUSION This large data set is a resource that will be exploited in future studies exploring the power of the SCRaMbLE system. By investigating the trajectories of Sc2.0 chromosomes in the nuclear space, this work paves the way for future studies addressing the influence of genome-wide engineering approaches on essential features of living systems.

https://openalex.org/W2592656674,"Ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission by functioning as ligand-gated ion channels. Fast inhibitory transmission in the brain is mediated mostly by ionotropic GABAA receptors (GABAARs), but their essential components for synaptic localization remain unknown. Here, we identify putative auxiliary subunits of GABAARs, which we term GARLHs, consisting of LH4 and LH3 proteins. LH4 forms a stable tripartite complex with GABAARs and neuroligin-2 in the brain. Moreover, LH4 is required for the synaptic localization of GABAARs and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Our findings propose GARLHs as the first identified auxiliary subunits for anion channels. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of inhibitory transmission and the molecular constituents of native anion channels in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2591618978,"A hotly debated issue in reading research concerns the extent to which readers process parafoveal words, and how parafoveal information might influence foveal word recognition. We investigated syntactic word processing both in sentence reading and in reading isolated foveal words when these were flanked by parafoveal words. In Experiment 1 we found a syntactic parafoveal preview benefit in sentence reading, meaning that fixation durations on target words were decreased when there was a syntactically congruent preview word at the target location (n) during the fixation on the pre-target (n-1). In Experiment 2 we used a flanker paradigm in which participants had to classify foveal target words as either noun or verb, when those targets were flanked by syntactically congruent or incongruent words (stimulus on-time 170 ms). Lower response times and error rates in the congruent condition suggested that higher-order (syntactic) information can be integrated across foveal and parafoveal words. Although higher-order parafoveal-on-foveal effects have been elusive in sentence reading, results from our flanker paradigm show that the reading system can extract higher-order information from multiple words in a single glance. We propose a model of reading to account for the present findings."
https://openalex.org/W2592546275,"Functional circuits in the visual cortex require the coordinated activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Molecular genetic approaches in the mouse have led to the ""local non-specific pooling principle"" of inhibitory connectivity, in which inhibitory neurons are untuned for stimulus features due to the random pooling of local inputs. However, it remains unclear whether this principle generalizes to species with a columnar organization of feature selectivity such as carnivores, primates, and humans. Here we use virally mediated GABAergic-specific GCaMP6f expression to demonstrate that inhibitory neurons in ferret visual cortex respond robustly and selectively to oriented stimuli. We find that the tuning of inhibitory neurons is inconsistent with the local non-specific pooling of excitatory inputs and that inhibitory neurons exhibit orientation-specific noise correlations with local and distant excitatory neurons. These findings challenge the generality of the non-specific pooling principle for inhibitory neurons, suggesting different rules for functional excitatory-inhibitory interactions in non-murine species."
https://openalex.org/W2560429321,"Emerging evidence suggests that regular physical activity can impact cortical function and facilitate plasticity. In the present study, we examined how physical activity levels influence corticospinal excitability and intracortical circuitry in motor cortex following a single session of moderate intensity aerobic exercise. We aimed to determine whether exercise-induced short-term plasticity differed between high versus low physically active individuals. Participants included twenty-eight young, healthy adults divided into two equal groups based on physical activity level determined by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire: low-to-moderate (LOW) and high (HIGH) physical activity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess motor cortex excitability via motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves for the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle at rest (MEPREST) and during tonic contraction (MEPACTIVE), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and facilitation (SICF), and intracortical facilitation (ICF). All dependent measures were obtained in the resting FDI muscle, with the exception of AMT and MEPACTIVE recruitment curves that were obtained during tonic FDI contraction. Dependent measures were acquired before and following moderate intensity aerobic exercise (20 mins, ~60% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate) performed on a recumbent cycle ergometer. Results indicate that MEPREST recruitment curve amplitudes and area under the recruitment curve (AURC) were increased following exercise in the HIGH group only (p = 0.002 and p = 0.044, respectively). SICI and ICF were reduced following exercise irrespective of physical activity level (p = 0.007 and p = 0.04, respectively). MEPACTIVE recruitment curves and SICF were unaltered by exercise. These findings indicate that the propensity for exercise-induced plasticity is different in high versus low physically active individuals. Additionally, these data highlight that a single session of aerobic exercise can transiently reduce inhibition in the motor cortex regardless of physical activity level, potentially priming the system for plasticity induction."

Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have a poor capacity to spontaneously repair after injury, limiting restitution of motor and sensory function. Stimulation of axon growth is an important strategy to encourage repair of damaged connections. Robust axon regeneration after injury can be elicited by genetic manipulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors (Belin et al., 2015Belin S. Nawabi H. Wang C. Tang S. Latremoliere A. Warren P.

These studies have suggested that a global alteration of the cell-intrinsic growth state is required to achieve extensive axon regeneration. However, the current challenge is to identify druggable targets and treatments to repair CNS injury. Adaptor proteins facilitate many important molecular processes and are interesting targets to manipulate the intrinsic growth state. 14-3-3s are a seven-isoform (β, γ, ε, ζ, η, θ, σ) family of dimeric cytosolic adaptor proteins highly expressed in the CNS. 14-3-3s have pervasive roles in cell signaling and are important regulators of neurodevelopment and axon guidance (Cheah et al., 2012Cheah P.S.

Here we report that 14-3-3s enhance axon growth. Moreover, we find that a developmental increase in 14-3-3 phosphorylation antagonizes 14-3-3 function. 14-3-3s bind to serine- and threonine-phosphorylated client proteins via a highly conserved binding groove (Figure 1A). Intriguingly, a small molecule called fusicoccin-A (FC-A) can be used as a chemical tool to stabilize 14-3-3:client complexes. FC-A binds to a solvent-exposed hydrophobic pocket created by the interface of the 14-3-3 binding groove and certain client proteins (de Boer and de Vries-van Leeuwen, 2012de Boer A.H. de Vries-van Leeuwen I.J. Fusicoccanes: diterpenes with surprising biological functions.Trends Plant Sci. 2012; 17: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Pharmacological stabilization of 14-3-3 PPIs is a potentially powerful approach to alter the cell-intrinsic growth state through modulation of multiple signaling pathways. We discover that FC-A stimulates neurite outgrowth in vitro, reduces corticospinal axon dieback after spinal cord injury, and stimulates optic nerve regeneration. We demonstrate that FC-A acts through a 14-3-3-dependent mechanism and identify FC-A-binding proteins using bead-immobilized FC-A and mass spectrometry. We show that FC-A stabilizes a complex between 14-3-3 and the stress response regulator GCN1, leading to GCN1 turnover and enhanced neurite outgrowth. These results identify a novel strategy and class of small molecules to enhance axon growth after injury. To assess the role of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins in neurite outgrowth, we treated embryonic day 18 (E18) rat cortical neurons with BV02, a cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor of 14-3-3 PPIs (Corradi et al., 2010Corradi V.

BV02 significantly reduced neurite growth at low micromolar concentrations and at 10 μM many of the neurons failed to initiate neurites or only sprouted few very short processes, with an overall ∼60% reduction in average total neurite length per neuron (Figures 1B and 1C). This was not accompanied by any significant increase in TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (Figure 1D). Expression of dimeric R18 (difopein), a peptide inhibitor of 14-3-3s (Masters and Fu, 2001Masters S.C. Fu H. 14-3-3 proteins mediate an essential anti-apoptotic signal.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45193-45200Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), similarly impaired neurite outgrowth (Figure 1E). We next investigated the effect of knocking down individual 14-3-3 isoforms on axon regeneration in vitro. We employed a scratch assay where rat cortical neurons are grown to confluence for 10 days and mechanically injured with a pipet tip (Huebner et al., 2011Huebner E.A. Kim B.G. Duffy P.J. Brown R.H. Strittmatter S.M. A multi-domain fragment of Nogo-A protein is a potent inhibitor of cortical axon regeneration via Nogo receptor 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18026-18036Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The day after injury, nearly all the regenerating neurites are tau-positive axons (Figure S1A). 14-3-3s are present throughout the soma and neurites in mature sparse cultures (Figure S1B); however, there is an enrichment at the growth cone tips after scratch injury, suggesting a role in axon regrowth (arrowheads, Figure S1C). Knockdown of 14-3-3 isoforms β, γ, or ζ significantly reduced axon regeneration after scratch injury (Figures 1F–1H) and did not impact cell survival (Figure 1I). We confirmed the specificity of these effects in a neurite outgrowth assay by expressing RNAi-resistant myc-tagged 14-3-3s and found that this was sufficient to restore baseline levels of growth (Figure S2). Further supporting a positive role for 14-3-3s in axon growth, overexpression of myc-tagged 14-3-3 β, γ, or ζ significantly enhanced regeneration after scratch injury (Figures 2A–2C). Phosphorylation of a conserved serine (S58) in the 14-3-3 dimerization interface impairs dimerization and binding to client proteins (Powell et al., 2003Powell D.W. Rane M.J.

Intriguingly, we found that 14-3-3 phosphorylation in the cortex is upregulated between the second and third week of life and high levels persist into adulthood (Figures 2D and 2E). We tested the effect of 14-3-3 phosphorylation on neurite outgrowth and found that overexpression of both wild-type 14-3-3ζ and a non-phosphorylatable S58A mutant enhanced neurite outgrowth, while overexpression of a phosphomimetic S58E mutant was ineffective (Figures 2F and 2G). We also found that overexpressed 14-3-3 is largely unphosphorylated relative to endogenous 14-3-3 (arrowheads, Figure 2H), suggesting that the process mediating 14-3-3 phosphorylation is saturated. Together, this supports a model wherein an increase in phosphorylation-mediated antagonism of 14-3-3 function contributes to a decline in the intrinsic capacity of neurons to grow. Fusicoccin-A (FC-A) is a fusicoccane small molecule produced by the Phomopsis amygdali fungus that stabilizes the binding between 14-3-3s and client proteins (de Boer and de Vries-van Leeuwen, 2012de Boer A.H. de Vries-van Leeuwen I.J. Fusicoccanes: diterpenes with surprising biological functions.Trends Plant Sci. 2012; 17: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of FC-A bound to 14-3-3:client complexes show that FC-A binds to a pocket created by the interface of the 14-3-3 binding groove and the client peptide docked within the groove (Würtele et al., 2003Würtele M. Jelich-Ottmann C. Wittinghofer A. Oecking C. Structural view of a fungal toxin acting on a 14-3-3 regulatory complex.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). FC-A has a very low affinity for “un-cliented” 14-3-3 and binds to a limited set of 14-3-3:client complexes, dependent on client motif sequences (Würtele et al., 2003Würtele M. Jelich-Ottmann C. Wittinghofer A. Oecking C. Structural view of a fungal toxin acting on a 14-3-3 regulatory complex.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We reasoned that FC-A, by its ability to stabilize 14-3-3 PPIs, might be a means to pharmacologically harness the pro-growth activity of 14-3-3s in neurons. Treatment of cortical neurons with FC-A produced a striking dose-dependent enhancement of neurite outgrowth on day 1 of culture (Figures 3B and 3C). Stimulation of neurite outgrowth was apparent at low micromolar concentrations with an EC50 of 29 μM (Figure 3D). A maximal effect of more than doubling neurite outgrowth per cell was reached at ∼200 μM. The EC50 is comparable to biologically active concentrations of FC-A that have been reported in other mammalian cell types (Bury et al., 2013Bury M. Andolfi A. Rogister B. Cimmino A. Mégalizzi V. Mathieu V. Feron O. Evidente A. Kiss R.

USA. 2013; 110: 8894-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FC-A also markedly enhanced axon regeneration after scratch injury (Figures 3E and 3F). Although no outward toxicity was noted, axon regeneration peaked at 25 μM and began to decline at higher doses, suggesting that injured aged cortical neurons may be more sensitive to high doses of FC-A. Importantly, FC-A also promoted outgrowth from primary human fetal neurons, indicating a conservation of activity from rodent to human (Figures 3G and 3H). To confirm that FC-A targets 14-3-3 s to induce neurite outgrowth, we treated cortical neurons with a combination of FC-A and the cell-permeable 14-3-3 PPI inhibitor BV02. FC-A failed to elicit a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in the presence of BV02, which severely impaired baseline neurite outgrowth as expected (Figures 4A and 4B ). In parallel as a control, we cultured neurons in the presence of the rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, a known neurite outgrowth inducer, and found that BV02 had no effect on the ability of Y-27632 to stimulate outgrowth (Figures 4A and 4B). Interestingly, although Y-27632 is more potent in the neurite outgrowth assay, it does not significantly stimulate regeneration after scratch injury of aged cultures, consistent with another report showing no effect of Y-27632 in the same scratch injury paradigm (Figure S3; Huebner et al., 2011Huebner E.A. Kim B.G. Duffy P.J. Brown R.H. Strittmatter S.M. A multi-domain fragment of Nogo-A protein is a potent inhibitor of cortical axon regeneration via Nogo receptor 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18026-18036Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To further test the 14-3-3 dependence of FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth, we knocked down 14-3-3 β, γ, and ζ, which resulted in a substantial depletion of total 14-3-3 (Figure 4C). This significantly impaired FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth, further supporting that FC-A functions through a 14-3-3-dependent mechanism (Figure 4D). We have previously shown that 14-3-3s regulate axon guidance through modulation of protein kinase A (PKA) (Kent et al., 2010Kent C.B. Shimada T. Ferraro G.B. Ritter B. Yam P.T. McPherson P.S. Charron F. Kennedy T.E. Fournier A.E. 14-3-3 proteins regulate protein kinase a activity to modulate growth cone turning responses.J.

However, inhibition of PKA with KT5720 had no effect on FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth (Figure S4), suggesting that FC-A stimulates neurite outgrowth in PKA-independent manner. To identify FC-A targets, we chemically coupled FC-A to magnetic beads (Figure 4E) to use as an affinity reagent for pull-downs from cortical neuron lysate. We first confirmed that FC-A-beads selectively precipitate 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 4F). Interestingly, FC-A beads precipitated a small fraction of total 14-3-3, suggesting a small pool of “cliented” 14-3-3s. The 14-3-3 PPI inhibitor R18, which spans the binding groove, blocked the binding of 14-3-3 to the beads, indicating that 14-3-3 binds to FC-A at the client-binding groove and not at another surface of the protein (Figure 4F). The client-binding-deficient phospho-S58 species was not precipitated by FC-A beads, again indicating that FC-A selectively binds cliented 14-3-3s (Figure 4G). As a control for binding specificity, soluble FC-A impaired 14-3-3 binding to the FC-A-beads (Figure 4H). To gain insight into the mechanism underlying FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth, we used FC-A-beads for affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry to identify the complement of FC-A-binding proteins. Pull-downs from cortical neuron lysate using FC-A-beads or control beads were performed in three independent experiments. Using “significance analysis of interactome” (SAINT) (Choi et al., 2011Choi H. Larsen B. Lin Z.Y. Breitkreutz A. Mellacheruvu D. Fermin D. Qin Z.S. Tyers M. Gingras A.C. Nesvizhskii A.I. SAINT: probabilistic scoring of affinity purification-mass spectrometry data.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), we identified 14 high-probability interactors (cutoff of 0.9). Remarkably, 13 of these 14 proteins contain potential FC-A/14-3-3 binding motifs (Table S1), defined by the characteristics of known binding motifs that can either be C-terminal serines or threonines (S/T) or internal S/T preceded by an arginine and followed by residues with small hydrophobic side chains. Of these proteins, “general control non-derepressible 1” (GCN1), a regulator of translation in response to cell stress, possesses 11 potential binding sites, one of which has identical sequence to a known binding site (Stevers et al., 2016Stevers L.M. Lam C.V. Leysen S.F.R. Meijer F.A. van Scheppingen D.S. de Vries R.M.J.M. Carlile G.W. Milroy L.G. Thomas D.Y. Brunsveld L. et al.Characterization and small-molecule stabilization of the multisite tandem binding between 14-3-3 and the R domain of CFTR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E1152-E1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We therefore focused our efforts on querying a potential role for GCN1 in FC-A-dependent neurite outgrowth. We first confirmed that FC-A-beads selectively precipitate GCN1 and that soluble FC-A blocks the interaction by western blot (Figures 5A and 5B ). FC-A beads precipitated a relatively large proportion of GCN1 compared to 14-3-3, likely reflecting the selective precipitation of a large pool of GCN1 that is incorporated into a relatively small pool of cliented 14-3-3s. Supporting this idea, R18 blocked the binding of GCN1 to the FC-A-beads, demonstrating the 14-3-3 dependence of FC-A binding to GCN1. Moreover, we immunoprecipitated GCN1 and found that FC-A stimulates the co-precipitation of 14-3-3 (Figure 5C). As 14-3-3s are known to sequester and affect the stability of client proteins (Tzivion et al., 2001Tzivion G. Shen Y.H. Zhu J. 14-3-3 proteins; bringing new definitions to scaffolding.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6331-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we assessed the effect of FC-A treatment on GCN1 expression in cortical neurons. Interestingly, we found a dose-dependent decrease in GCN1 expression levels (Figures 5D and 5E). 14-3-3s can mediate proteasome-dependent turnover of client proteins (Qureshi et al., 2013Qureshi H.Y. Han D. MacDonald R. Paudel H.K.

Biol. 2010; 30: 1508-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), so we therefore assessed the effect of proteasome inhibition with MG132. This increased GCN1 levels and attenuated the FC-A-mediated decrease, suggesting that FC-A induces proteasomal degradation of GCN1 potentially via stabilization of a GCN1:14-3-3 complex (Figures 5F and 5G). To determine whether loss of GCN1 underlies FC-A-induced neurite outgrowth, we electroporated cortical neurons with a GCN1-targeting shRNA together with GFP and cultured the neurons in the presence of vehicle or FC-A. Knockdown of GCN1 significantly enhanced basal neurite outgrowth (Figures 6A–6C). The improved outgrowth of GCN1 knockdown neurons occluded any further enhancement by 25 μM FC-A, but the neurons did respond to a higher dose of 100 μM (Figure 5C). This indicates that FC-A acts in part through GCN1 loss of function, releasing an intrinsic “brake” on neurite outgrowth, but that other molecular pathways are also engaged by higher doses. Further supporting this model, 25 μM FC-A is also capable of stimulating neurite outgrowth from a population of neurons with more than ∼100 μm baseline outgrowth (Figure 6D). GCN1 is solely known for its role in reducing global translation by binding and activating the eIF2α kinase GCN2 in response to cell stress. GCN2-dependent phosphorylation of the eIF2α subunit on a conserved serine (S51) converts eIF2 to a dominant negative, reducing global translation (Sattlegger and Hinnebusch, 2000Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. Separate domains in GCN1 for binding protein kinase GCN2 and ribosomes are required for GCN2 activation in amino acid-starved cells.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that because FC-A reduces GCN1 expression, this might lead to an increase in global translation that could be responsible for stimulating neurite outgrowth. We treated neurons with a combination of 25 μM FC-A and cycloheximide (CHX) or anisomycin to block translation. Both CHX and anisomycin severely impaired neurite outgrowth but did not fully block the stimulation of neurite outgrowth by 25 μM FC-A (Figures 6E and 6F), suggesting a mechanism that may be independent from protein synthesis. Moreover, we found that FC-A does not have any reproducible effect on eIF2α phosphorylation (Figures 6G and 6H). Rapamycin also failed to block outgrowth induced by both FC-A and GCN1 knockdown (Figure S5), suggesting a mechanism independent of mTOR, a well-established pro-regeneration pathway. Combined, these results indicate that 14-3-3 PPI stabilization with FC-A stimulates axon growth in part by stabilizing a 14-3-3:GCN1 complex, resulting in GCN1 downregulation (Figure 6I). The damaged CNS is characterized by the presence of growth inhibitors including chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) produced by reactive glia. FC-A significantly improved neurite outgrowth on aggrecan substrates, suggesting that it may be efficacious in improving growth after injury in vivo (Figure S6). We therefore sought to determine whether FC-A could improve axon growth after a dorsal hemisection spinal cord injury, which transects the entire corticospinal tract (CST). Mice received an immediate local application of FC-A in a rapidly polymerizing fibrin gel onto the injury site. CST axons were then anterogradely traced by injecting biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the motor cortex and the mice were analyzed on day 21 (Figure 7A). Surgeries and analysis were performed blinded to the experimental condition in two independent cohorts. Mice that received a single treatment of FC-A had a significant reduction in axonal die-back away from the injury site compared to control mice treated with vehicle-containing fibrin gel. While the cut axons of control mice retracted an average distance of ∼72 μm, the end-bulbs of FC-A-treated mice were within the lesion or in close proximity to the lesion (Figures 7B and 7C). These results indicate that transient exposure to FC-A is sufficient to diminish the collapse and retraction of severed axons in vivo. Next, we determined whether FC-A could stimulate CNS axon regeneration past the lesion with longer therapeutic exposure using the optic nerve crush (ONC) model and intravitreal injections. To visualize FC-A distribution after intravitreal injection, we generated an Alexa 488 FC-A conjugate. 488-FC-A was enriched in the retinal ganglion cell layer 1 day after injection, suggesting that it is readily taken up by retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (Figure S7A). We also examined retinal GCN1 expression by western blot as a readout for activity. GCN1 was unchanged at 1 day post-injection, but significantly downregulated 3 days post-injection. Intriguingly, GCN1 levels remained suppressed 7 days post-injection, suggesting a sustained effect (Figures S7B and S7C). We next determined whether FC-A could induce axon regeneration after ONC. Mice received either 1 or 2 intravitreal injections of FC-A (Figure 8A). Cholera toxin β (CTβ) was used to trace RGC axons and GAP43 staining was used to visualize and quantify actively growing fibers. Surgeries and analysis were performed blinded to the experimental condition. Treatment with a single injection of FC-A was insufficient to stimulate axon regeneration; however, a second injection on day 7 resulted in significant regeneration at 100, 200, and 500 μm from the lesion compared to control animals (Figures 8B and 8C). Nearly all CTβ+ axons were also GAP43+, indicating that the axons were in a growth state (Figure 8D). We also assessed RGC density in the retina using Brn3a as a marker. As expected, ONC caused a massive loss of RGCs (∼70% loss of RGCs). Interestingly, FC-A-did not improve RGC survival, indicating that FC-A stimulates axon regeneration independent of cell survival (Figures 8E and 8F). These findings show that therapeutic administration of FC-A can stimulate axon regeneration after CNS injury and open the door to a new class of small molecules that could be further optimized to repair CNS damage. We have found that 14-3-3 adaptor proteins facilitate neurite outgrowth and that 14-3-3 function is dynamically modulated by phosphorylation. Antagonism of 14-3-3 function by phosphorylation increases during development of the cortex, suggesting that this may dampen the intrinsic growth capacity of neurons. The similar effects we observed on neurite outgrowth by manipulating the expression of 14-3-3 β, γ, or ζ suggest functional redundancy. Moreover, because manipulating the expression of single isoforms was sufficient to elicit effects on neurite outgrowth, we speculate that there is a limited pool of 14-3-3 proteins that are competent to bind to clients an"
https://openalex.org/W2594728599,"Exposure to environmental stressors, toxicants, and nutrient deficiencies can affect DNA in several ways. Some exposures cause damage and alter the structure of DNA, but there is increasing evidence that the same or other environmental exposures, including those that occur during fetal development in utero, can cause epigenetic effects that modulate DNA function and gene expression. Some epigenetic changes to DNA that affect gene transcription are at least partially reversible (i.e., they can be enzymatically reversed after cessation of exposure to environmental agents), but some epigenetic modifications seem to persist, even for decades. To explain the effects of early life experiences (such as famine and exposures to other stressors) on the long-term persistence of specific patterns of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, we propose an analogy with immune memory. We propose that an epigenetic memory can be established and maintained in self-renewing stem cell compartments. We suggest that the observations on early life effects on adult diseases and the persistence of methylation changes in smokers support our hypothesis, for which a mechanistic basis, however, needs to be further clarified. We outline a new model based on methylation changes. Although these changes seem to be mainly adaptive, they are also implicated in the pathogenesis and onset of diseases, depending on individual genotypic background and types of subsequent exposures. Elucidating the relationships between the adaptive and maladaptive consequences of the epigenetic modifications that result from complex environmental exposures is a major challenge for current and future research in epigenetics.—Vineis, P., Chatziioannou, A., Cunliffe, V.

https://openalex.org/W2594070031,"Morphine is one of the most widely used drugs for the treatment of pain. However, side effects, including persistent constipation and antinociceptive tolerance, limit its clinical efficacy. Prolonged morphine treatment results in a ""leaky"" gut, predisposing to colonic inflammation that is facilitated by microbial dysbiosis and associated bacterial translocation. In this study, we examined the role of enteric glia in mediating this secondary inflammatory response to prolonged treatment with morphine. We found that purinergic P2X receptor activity was significantly enhanced in enteric glia that were isolated from mice with long-term morphine treatment (in vivo) but not upon direct exposure of glia to morphine (in vitro). LPS, a major bacterial product, also increased ATP-induced currents, as well as expression of P2X4, P2X7, IL6, IL-1β mRNA in enteric glia. LPS increased connexin43 (Cx43) expression and enhanced ATP release from enteric glia cells. LPS-induced P2X currents and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression were blocked by the Cx43 blockers Gap26 and carbenoxolone. Likewise, colonic inflammation related to prolonged exposure to morphine was significantly attenuated by carbenoxolone (25 mg/kg). Carbenoxolone also prevented gut wall disruption and significantly reduced morphine-induced constipation. These findings imply that enteric glia activation is a significant modulator of morphine-related inflammation and constipation.-Bhave, S., Gade, A., Kang, M., Hauser, K. F., Dewey, W.

Kcne2 deletion in mice impaired glucose tolerance as early as 5 wk of age in pups fed a Western diet, ultimately causing diabetes. In adult mice fed normal chow, skeletal muscle expression of insulin receptor β and insulin receptor substrate 1 were down-regulated 2-fold by Kcne2 deletion, characteristic of T2DM. Kcne2 deletion also caused extensive pancreatic transcriptome changes consistent with facets of T2DM, including endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, and hyperproliferation. Kcne2 deletion impaired β-cell insulin secretion in vitro up to 8-fold and diminished β-cell peak outward K+ current at positive membrane potentials, but also left-shifted its voltage dependence and slowed inactivation. Interestingly, we also observed an aging-dependent reduction in β-cell outward currents in both Kcne2+/+ and Kcne2−/− mice.

We tested the hypothesis that NAC alters the vascular milieu to improve healing of amputation stumps in diabetes using a novel in vivo murine hindlimb ischemia-amputation model. Amputation stump tissue perfusion and healing were evaluated in C57BL/6J adult mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Compared with controls, mice treated with daily NAC demonstrated improved postamputation stump healing, perfusion, adductor muscle neovascularization, and decreased muscle fiber damage. Additionally, NAC stimulated HUVEC migration and proliferation in a phospholipase C β–dependent fashion and decreased Gαq palmitoylation. Similarly, NAC treatment also decreased Gαq palmitoylation in ischemic and nonischemic hindlimbs in vivo.

Weekly SC should therefore yield the best therapeutic index and is widely used but has not been compared to established administration schedules in the context of a clinical trial. Methods Comprehensive electronic medical record review was done for disease control and neuropathy symptoms of 344 consecutive patients who received their first BTZ-containing regimen for myeloma or AL amyloidosis before or after we changed to SC weekly in December 2010. Univariate and multivariable analyses were carried out that adjusted for age, underlying disease, concurrently used anticancer agents, underlying conditions predisposing to neuropathy, and number of prior regimens compared SC weekly to other schedules. Results Fifty-three patients received BTZ SC weekly, 17 SC twice weekly, 127 IV weekly and 147 IV twice weekly. Risk for neuropathy of any grade was higher with other schedules compared to SC weekly (44.3% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.001) while response rate was similar (72.1% vs. 76.6%, respectively, p = 0.15). Multivariable analyses upheld higher neuropathy risk (Odds ratio 2.45, 95% CI 1.26–4.76, p = 0.008) while the likelihood of not achieving a response (= partial response or better) was comparable (Odds ratio 1.25, 95% CI 0.58–2.71, p = 0.56) for other schedules compared to SC weekly, respectively. Lower neuropathy risk translated into longer treatment duration when BTZ was started SC weekly (p = 0.001).

Growth restriction of phase II bacteria is thought to result from potentiated recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which leads to production of inhibitory effector molecules. Past studies have used conditioned medium from L-929 murine fibroblasts as a source of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) to promote differentiation of bone marrow-derived myeloid precursors into macrophages. However, uncharacterized components of conditioned medium, such as variable amounts of type I interferons, can affect macrophage activation status and their permissiveness for infection. In the current study, we show that the C. burnetii Nine Mile phase II (NMII) strain grows robustly in primary macrophages from C57BL/6J mice when bone marrow cells are differentiated with recombinant murine M-CSF (rmM-CSF). Bacteria were readily internalized by BMDM, and replicated within degradative, LAMP1-positive vacuoles to achieve roughly 3 logs of growth over 6 days. Uninfected BMDM did not appreciably express CD38 or Egr2, markers of classically (M1) and alternatively (M2) activated macrophages, respectively, nor did infection change the lack of polarization. In accordance with an M0 phenotype, infected BMDM produced moderate amounts of TNF and nitric oxide. Similar NMII growth results were obtained using C57BL/6J myeloid progenitors immortalized with an estrogen-regulated Hoxb8 (ER-Hoxb8) oncogene. To demonstrate the utility of the ER-Hoxb8 system, myeloid progenitors from natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1) C57BL/6J knock-in mice were transduced with ER-Hoxb8, and macrophages were derived from immortalized progenitors using rmM-CSF and infected with NMII. No difference in growth was observed when compared to macrophages from wild type mice, indicating depletion of metal ions by the Nramp1 transporter does not negatively impact NMII growth. Results with NMII were recapitulated in primary macrophages where C57BL/6J Nramp1+ BMDM efficiently killed Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. M-CSF differentiated murine macrophages from bone marrow and conditional ER-Hoxb8 myeloid progenitors will be useful ex vivo models for studying Coxiella-macrophage interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2594332009,"TNF-like 1A (TL1A) is a cytokine belonging to the TNF superfamily that promotes inflammation in autoimmune diseases. Inhibiting the interaction of TL1A with the endogenous death-domain receptor 3 (DR3) offers a therapeutic approach for treating TL1A-induced autoimmune diseases. Here, we generated improved DR3 variants showing increased TL1A binding affinity and stability using a directed evolution approach. Given the high cysteine content and post-translational modification of DR3, we employed yeast surface display and expression in mammalian cell lines for screening, expression and characterization of improved DR3 variants. A cell-based assay performed with the human TF-1 cell line and CD4+ T cells showed that two improved DR3 mutants efficiently inhibited TL1A-induced cell death and secretion of IFN-γ, respectively. These DR3 mutants can be used as drug candidates for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases and for other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatic arthritis and asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2592192737,"Combination treatment with low-dose thiopurine and allopurinol (AP) has successfully been used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease with a so called skewed thiopurine metabolite profile. In red blood cells in vivo, it reduces the concentration of methylated metabolites and increases the concentration of the phosphorylated ones, which is associated with improved therapeutic efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the largely unknown mechanism of AP on thiopurine metabolism in cells with an active thiopurine metabolic pathway using HepG2 and HEK293 cells. Cells were treated with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and AP or its metabolite oxypurinol. The expression of genes known to be associated with thiopurine metabolism, and the concentration of thiopurine metabolites were analyzed. Gene expression levels were only affected by AP in the presence of 6MP. The addition of AP to 6MP affected the expression of in total 19 genes in the two cell lines. In both cell lines the expression of the transporter SLC29A2 was reduced by the combined treatment. Six regulated genes in HepG2 cells and 8 regulated genes in HEK293 cells were connected to networks with 18 and 35 genes, respectively, present at known susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease, when analyzed using a protein-protein interaction database. The genes identified as regulated as well as the disease associated interacting genes represent new candidates for further investigation in the context of combination therapy with thiopurines and AP. However, no differences in absolute metabolite concentrations were observed between 6MP+AP or 6MP+oxypurinol vs. 6MP alone in either of the two cell lines. In conclusion; the effect of AP on gene expression levels requires the presence of 6MP, at least in vitro. Previously described AP-effects on metabolite concentrations observed in red blood cells in vivo could not be reproduced in our cell lines in vitro. AP's effects in relation to thiopurine metabolism are complex. The network-identified susceptibility genes represented biological processes mainly associated with purine nucleotide biosynthetic processes, lymphocyte proliferation, NF-KB activation, JAK-STAT signaling, and apoptotic signaling at oxidative stress."

Cancer-specific cell surface proteins can be targeted for the delivery of therapeutic agents. However, specific proteins may not always be expressed by a tumor. Wang et al. overcome this challenge by designing sugars to selectively label cancer cells. Small-molecule sugars (azides) can be metabolized by enzymes that are highly expressed in some tumors, including colon and breast cancer cells. Metabolized azides labeled endogenous cell surface proteins in cultured cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice. The azide moiety on the labeled proteins was subsequently recognized by another molecule carrying a drug, which was taken up by the cancer cells. Tumor growth was reduced, and animal survival improved by 86%.

Certain individuals, known as superspreaders, disproportionately infect more people with disease-causing organisms than the average infectious case. Lau et al. identified key drivers of Ebola virus (EBOV) superspreading during the 2014 West Africa outbreak. Unexpectedly, secondary cases largely did not transmit tertiary cases; thus, epidemic growth was fueled and sustained by a few superspreaders, and transmission occurred locally, within 2.5 km of the source. Community-based EBOV cases progressed more rapidly than those identified in clinical care settings. The most infectious age groups tended to be the young or people over 45 years old, which may reflect social structure, such as the intimacy of care needs, or immunological factors. This work helps to identify the most vulnerable groups and provide parameters for control efforts in future outbreaks of EBOV.

Historically, experimental psychologists have relied heavily on undergraduates for their subject pool; over the past decade, they have recruited subjects online, employing people colloquially termed MTurkers through the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. Over the years, MTurkers have become so familiar with online surveys that there are concerns about the representativeness and reliability of these participants. Peer et al. compared MTurk with two other crowdsourcing sites, CrowdFlower and Prolific Academic. The latter two sites produced participants who were less familiar with the kinds of tasks assigned (good) but also less attentive to instructions (bad), and they had more European participants. In terms of reliability and reproducibility, Prolific Academic scored higher than CrowdFlower and about the same as MTurk.

For the first few cleavages, cells of the mammalian embryo are considered identical. Subsequently, symmetry is broken to generate the inner cell mass, which specifies the embryo proper, or the extraembryonic trophectoderm. Korotkevich et al. used live imaging to visualize miniblastocysts generated from single 8-cell–stage blastomeres. The mitotic spindles of mini-blastocysts aligned along the apico-basal axis. The polar cell containing the apical domain, which expresses Cdx2, enveloped the apolar sister to adopt a trophectoderm fate. Transplantation of the apical domain showed that it is required and sufficient for the first lineage segregation. It is not yet known whether surface adhesion molecules or mechanical differences affect the assembly of the apical domain for subsequent lineage segregation.

Wavelength, intensity, and polarization are several parameters that define a light field. Light from most natural and many artificial light sources is unpolarized. However, an instantaneous snapshot of a propagating light field shows that it may be completely polarized. Shevchenko et al. propose and demonstrate experimentally that there is a finite window of time for that snapshot in which the unpolarized light is polarized. Using a Michelson interferometer with polarization- sensitive components combined with two-photon absorption detectors, they show for two different unpolarized light sources that the polarization time window varies from 10 to 100 fs. The effect of a finite polarization time could be exploited in a number of applications such as communication and sensing.

Gender inequalities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are well documented, but the underlying causes leading to these inequalities are less studied. To test the association between masculinity or femininity and choosing a STEM major, Simon et al. surveyed students at a major public university, using questions regarding academic climate and occupational values coupled with the Bem sex-role inventory, a widely used measure of gendered personality types. Resulting data suggest that the conventional model that men like science because it is “masculine,” whereas women do not like science because it is “antifeminine,” is flawed. Instead, results show that women pay a femininity penalty in STEM majors, whereas more abundant feminine personality traits in men render them more likely to major in a STEM field.

In addition to chemical cues, the differentiation of stem cells can be influenced by mechanical forces, such as the stiffness of the underlying substrate, but these effects diminish with age. Barreto et al. compared the differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells from donors aged 11 to 12 years and from young adults aged 20 to 30 years, when the skeleton has fully matured. The juvenile cells showed greater mechanosensitivity and enhanced angiogenesis and osteogenesis. From an examination of a number of growth factors, the authors found a key role for the protein JNK3, which might serve as a target for restoring the potential for regeneration in adults suffering from bone degeneration to that found in youth.
