https://openalex.org/W4292117455,"People living in rural regions in the United States face more health challenges than their non-rural counterparts which could put them at additional risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Few studies have examined if rurality is associated with additional mortality risk among those hospitalized for COVID-19. We studied a retrospective cohort of 3,991 people hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infections discharged between March 1 and September 30, 2020 in one of 17 hospitals in North Carolina that collaborate as a clinical data research network. Patient demographics, comorbidities, symptoms and laboratory data were examined. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations of rurality with a composite outcome of death/hospice discharge. Comorbidities were more common in the rural patient population as were the number of comorbidities per patient. Overall, 505 patients died prior to discharge and 63 patients were discharged to hospice. Among rural patients, 16.5% died or were discharged to hospice vs. 13.3% in the urban cohort resulting in greater odds of death/hospice discharge (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6). This estimate decreased minimally when adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, payer, disease comorbidities, presenting oxygen levels and cytokine levels (adjusted model OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.5). This analysis demonstrated a higher COVID-19 mortality risk among rural residents of NC. Implementing policy changes may mitigate such disparities going forward."
https://openalex.org/W4293065906,"The COVID-19 pandemic’s disruptions to daily routines and services have proven especially challenging for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families. The current retrospective study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic’s social environmental changes on parental ratings of personal and child concerns about family conflict, opportunities for social interaction, and loss of institutional support (school and therapy services). Analyses of responses from families with ASD in the US determined differences in concerns across three time points which were measured simultaneously: prior to COVID-19, at the start of COVID-19, and at the time of survey completion. From our sample of 246 school-aged children, parents retrospectively reported significantly increasing levels of concern for both themselves and their children over time, with parents’ personal concern levels rated consistently higher than their ratings of their child’s level of concern. Concerns about loss of institutional support were higher for parents of children reported as having co-occurring intellectual disability. Further, parents of younger children also reported more concerns about loss of services, as well as more social concerns. For parent ratings of child concerns, children who were reportedly aware of COVID-19 were determined to have higher levels of social concerns and concerns about loss of institutional support. Meanwhile, the child’s age and gender did not impact their parent ratings of child concerns. The increased level of parental and child-perceived concerns over the course of the pandemic suggests a need for improved service delivery and support for these families. The high levels of concerns observed in the current study provide support for the need to assess families’ priorities and tailor services to best meet families’ needs. This will potentially increase the quality of life of family members, and improve ASD services across the lifespan, and improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4292117378,"Long bone breakage for bone marrow recovery is a commonly observed practice in Middle Palaeolithic contexts, regardless of the climatic conditions. While lithic technology is largely used to define cultural patterns in human groups, despite dedicating research by zooarchaeologists, for now butchering techniques rarely allowed the identification of clear traditions, notably for ancient Palaeolithic periods. In this paper, we test the hypothesis of butchery traditions among Neandertal groupsusing the bone assemblages from three sites in southwestern Europe. These sites are located in southeastern France and northern Italy and are dated to the Late Middle Palaeolithic: Abri du Maras (Marine Isotopic Stages (MIS) 4–3, Ardèche), Saint-Marcel (MIS 3, Ardèche), and Riparo Tagliente (MIS 4–3, Verona). The detection of culturally-induced patterns of bone breakage involves differentiating them from intuitively generated patterns. To tackle this issue, we used a zooarchaeological approach focusing on the percussion marks produced during the bone breakage process. Statistical analyses as the chi-square test of independence were employed to verify if percussion mark locations were randomly distributed, and if these distributions were different from the intuitive ones. For femurs and humeri, our results demonstrate that Neandertal groups occupying the Abri du Maras (levels 4.1 and 4.2) and the Saint-Marcel Cave (levels g and h) sites in France applied butchery traditions to recover yellow marrow. However, the traditions developed at each site were different. On the contrary, in Riparo Tagliente, in Italy, several groups or individuals of a same group did not share the same butchery traditions over time. Regarding the Abri du Maras and Saint Marcel Cave assemblages, our research demonstrates that Neandertal groups applied intense standardized bone breakage, far from the intuitive practice observed experimentally and related to bone density and/or skeletal morphology. These standardized patterns, which are systematic and counter-intuitive, can be interpreted as culturally induced for the Abri du Maras and Saint Marcel Cave. The diversity of Neandertal traditions should be considered by taking into account the butchery, in particular the practice of bone marrow extraction, and not only technological behaviours and types of tool kits."
https://openalex.org/W4292117611,"High sugar intake in humans is associated with the development of overweight and other diet-related diseases. The World Health Organization and other health organizations recommend limiting the sugar intake to 10% of the total energy intake. There have been different approaches of front-of-pack labelling to reduce the amount of sugar in food products. Companies use nutrition claims to advertise the sugar content (e.g., without added sugar, 30% less sugar). Such nutrition claims can lead to false assumptions about the healthiness of foods and can lead to health-halo effects. Nutrition claims make products appear healthier than they really are, the aspect advertised in the nutrition claim is transferred to the entire food product. As a result, food products can be perceived as healthy even though they are not. Recently, the Nutri-Score was introduced in an increasing number of countries throughout Europe to provide consumers with an overview of the overall nutritional quality of a product. This study analyzes if the Nutri-Score can help to prevent health-halo effects caused by nutrition claims on sugar. Therefore, an online survey consisting of a split-sample design with more than 1,000 respondents was assessed. The results show that, depending on the initial perceived healthiness of a product, the Nutri-Score is able to prevent health-halo effects caused by claims on sugar. Making the Nutri-Score mandatory when using nutrition claims would be one possible way to reduce misperceptions about unhealthy food and reduce health-halo effects caused by claims on sugar."
https://openalex.org/W4292117581,"Preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation) is a risk factor for poor educational outcomes. A dose-response effect of earlier gestational age at birth on poor primary school attainment has been observed, but evidence for secondary school attainment is limited and focused predominantly on the very preterm (&lt;32 weeks) population. We examined the association between gestational age at birth and academic attainment at the end of primary and secondary schooling in England. Data for children born in England from 2000–2001 were drawn from the population-based UK Millennium Cohort Study. Information about the child’s birth, sociodemographic factors and health was collected from parents. Attainment on national tests at the end of primary (age 11) and secondary school (age 16) was derived from linked education records. Data on attainment in primary school was available for 6,950 pupils and that of secondary school was available for 7,131 pupils. Adjusted relative risks (aRRs) for these outcomes were estimated at each stage separately using modified Poisson regression. At the end of primary school, 17.7% of children had not achieved the expected level in both English and Mathematics and this proportion increased with increasing prematurity. Compared to full term (39–41 weeks) children, the strongest associations were among children born moderately (32–33 weeks; aRR = 2.13 (95% CI 1.44–3.13)) and very preterm (aRR = 2.06 (95% CI 1.46–2.92)). Children born late preterm (34–36 weeks) and early term (37–38 weeks) were also at higher risk with aRR = 1.18 (95% CI 0.94–1.49) and aRR = 1.21 (95% CI 1.05–1.38), respectively. At the end of secondary school, 45.2% had not passed at least five General Certificate of Secondary Education examinations including English and Mathematics. Following adjustment, only children born very preterm were at significantly higher risk (aRR = 1.26 (95% CI 1.03–1.54)). All children born before full term are at risk of poorer attainment during primary school compared with term-born children, but only children born very preterm remain at risk at the end of secondary schooling. Children born very preterm may require additional educational support throughout compulsory schooling."
https://openalex.org/W4292117606,"Climate change is already impacting coastal communities, and ongoing and future shifts in fisheries species productivity from climate change have implications for the livelihoods and cultures of coastal communities. Harvested marine species in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem support U.S. West Coast communities economically, socially, and culturally. Ecological vulnerability assessments exist for individual species in the California Current but ecological and human vulnerability are linked and vulnerability is expected to vary by community. Here, we present automatable, reproducible methods for assessing the vulnerability of U.S. West Coast fishing dependent communities to climate change within a social-ecological vulnerability framework. We first assessed the ecological risk of marine resources, on which fishing communities rely, to 50 years of climate change projections. We then combined this with the adaptive capacity of fishing communities, based on social indicators, to assess the potential ability of communities to cope with future changes. Specific communities (particularly in Washington state) were determined to be at risk to climate change mainly due to economic reliance on at risk marine fisheries species, like salmon, hake, or sea urchins. But, due to higher social adaptive capacity, these communities were often not found to be the most vulnerable overall. Conversely, certain communities that were not the most at risk, ecologically and economically, ranked in the category of highly vulnerable communities due to low adaptive capacity based on social indicators (particularly in Southern California). Certain communities were both ecologically at risk due to catch composition and socially vulnerable (low adaptive capacity) leading to the highest tier of vulnerability. The integration of climatic, ecological, economic, and societal data reveals that factors underlying vulnerability are variable across fishing communities on the U.S West Coast, and suggests the need to develop a variety of well-aligned strategies to adapt to the ecological impacts of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4293065799,"Objectives To report a prospective epidemiological, virological and serological investigation of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a primary school. Methods As part of a longitudinal, prospective, school-based surveillance study, this investigation involved repeated testing of 73 pupils, 9 teachers, 13 non-teaching staff and 26 household members of participants who tested positive, with rapid antigen tests and/or RT-PCR (Day 0–2 and Day 5–7), serologies on dried capillary blood samples (Day 0–2 and Day 30), contact tracing interviews and SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing. Results We identified 20 children (aged 4 to 6 years from 4 school classes), 2 teachers and a total of 4 household members who were infected by the Alpha variant during this outbreak. Infection attack rates were between 11.8 and 62.0% among pupils from the 4 school classes, 22.2% among teachers and 0% among non-teaching staff. Secondary attack rate among household members was 15.4%. Symptoms were reported by 63% of infected children, 100% of teachers and 50% of household members. All analysed sequences but one showed 100% identity. Serological tests detected 8 seroconversions unidentified by SARS-CoV-2 virological tests. Conclusions This study confirmed child-to-child and child-to-adult SARS-CoV-2 transmission and introduction into households. Effective measures to limit transmission in schools have the potential to reduce the overall community circulation."
https://openalex.org/W4293065937,"There is an alarming shortage of qualified STEM teachers in American PK-12 schools. The COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate this crisis and consequently affect who participates in future STEM innovation. At three points during the pandemic, we surveyed early career teachers who were supported by the National Science Foundation as they began teaching in high-needs school districts. Teachers who felt connected to their professional and academic communities reported intentions to remain in the profession, while those who felt isolated reported intentions of leaving. It is critical for STEM academics to maintain professional relationships with graduates who pursue STEM teaching professions after graduation."
https://openalex.org/W4292117469,"A fundamental challenge in human missions to Mars is producing consumable foods efficiently with the in situ resources such as soil, water, nutrients and solar radiation available on Mars. The low nutrient content of martian soil and high salinity of water render them unfit for direct use for propagating food crops on Mars. It is therefore essential to develop strategies to enhance nutrient content in Mars soil and to desalinate briny water for long-term missions on Mars. We report simple and efficient strategies for treating basaltic regolith simulant soil and briny water simulant for suitable resources for growing plants. We show that alfalfa plants grow well in a nutrient-limited basaltic regolith simulant soil and that the alfalfa biomass can be used as a biofertilizer to sustain growth and production of turnip, radish and lettuce in the basaltic regolith simulant soil. Moreover, we show that marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 effectively desalinates the briny water simulant, and that desalination can be further enhanced by filtration through basalt-type volcanic rocks. Our findings indicate that it is possible to grow food crops with alfalfa treated basaltic regolith martian soil as a substratum watered with biodesalinated water."
https://openalex.org/W4292117528,"The settlement of the Americas has been the focus of incessant debate for more than 100 years, and open questions regarding the timing and spatial patterns of colonization still remain today. Phylogenetic studies with complete human Y chromosome sequences are used as a highly informative tool to investigate the history of human populations in a given time frame. To study the phylogenetic relationships of Native American lineages and infer the settlement history of the Americas, we analyzed Y chromosome Q Haplogroup, which is a Pan-American haplogroup and represents practically all Native American lineages in Mesoamerica and South America. We built a phylogenetic tree for Q Haplogroup based on 102 whole Y chromosome sequences, of which 13 new Argentine sequences were provided by our group. Moreover, 1,072 new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to its resolution and diversity were identified. Q-M848 is known to be the most frequent autochthonous sub-haplogroup of the Americas. The present is the first genomic study of Q Haplogroup in which current knowledge on Q-M848 sub-lineages is contrasted with the historical, archaeological and linguistic data available. The divergence times, spatial structure and the SNPs found here as novel for Q-Z780, a less frequent sub-haplogroup autochthonous of the Americas, provide genetic support for a South American settlement before 18,000 years ago. We analyzed how environmental events that occurred during the Younger Dryas period may have affected Native American lineages, and found that this event may have caused a substantial loss of lineages. This could explain the current low frequency of Q-Z780 (also perhaps of Q-F4674, a third possible sub-haplogroup autochthonous of the Americas). These environmental events could have acted as a driving force for expansion and diversification of the Q-M848 sub-lineages, which show a spatial structure that developed during the Younger Dryas period."
https://openalex.org/W4292117538,"Domestic horses are currently often subject to management practices that can entail social stressors, which in turn can negatively influence immunocompetence and disease susceptibility. The present study therefore aimed to characterize the number of various blood leukocyte subsets in horses, focusing on two potentially stressful housing environments: changes in group composition and relocation to individual stabling. Immune measurements were conducted before as well as one and eight days after changes were made. They were complemented by an assessment of plasma cortisol concentrations as well as behavioral observations. One and eight days after relocation to single housing, the mean numbers of eosinophils, T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells decreased by up to 31%, 20% and 22% respectively, whereas the mean numbers of neutrophils increased by 25%. In contrast, one and eight days after changes in group composition not only the mean number of neutrophils, but also of monocytes, T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells increased by up to 24%, 17%, 9%, and 15% respectively. In consequence, an increase in the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicating stress-induced immune modulation was found after relocation to single housing, but not after changes in group composition. The changes in leukocyte numbers after relocation to single housing were accompanied by a transient increase in cortisol concentrations after one day and the occurrence of disturbed behavior patterns one week after change in housing condition. In contrast, changes in group composition did not result in an increase of cortisol concentrations or in an increase of aggressive interactions. The results strongly indicate that individual stabling is an intense stressor leading to acute and lasting alterations in blood counts of various leukocyte types. The study highlights a probable negative impact of single housing on welfare and health of horses and an advantage of group housing systems in view of immunocompetence."
https://openalex.org/W4292263238,"Improving crop adaptation and stability across diverse and changing environmental conditions is essential to increasing grain yield per unit area. In turn, this contributes to meeting the increasing global food demand. Nevertheless, a number of factors challenge the efficiency of crop improvement programs, of which genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is one of the major factors. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and phenotypic stability of 385 Ethiopian durum wheat landraces and 35 cultivars; assess the pattern of genotype by environment interaction (GEI) effect, and identify stable and high-yielding landraces or cultivars using the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype main effect plus genotype by environment interaction biplot (GGE-biplot). The experiment was laid out in an alpha lattice design with two replications at five test sites (Akaki, Chefe Donsa, Holeta, Kulumsa, and Sinana). The combined analysis of variance revealed highly significant effects (P ≤ 0.01) of environments (E), genotype (G), and GEI on a phenotypic variation of traits evaluated, including grain yield. For all traits, the amount of phenotypic variance and GEI explained by the GGE biplot was higher than in AMMI2, but both exhibited significant effects of E and GEI on the genotypes. The AMMI model identified G169, G420, G413, G139, G415, G416, G417, and G418 as stable genotypes across testing sites. Whereas, the GGE biplot identified G169, G420, G415, G139, G106, G412, G413, and G417 as both high-yielding and stable across test sites. Hence, genotypes identified as stable and high yielding in the present study could be used in a durum wheat breeding program aimed at identifying genes and molecular markers associated with the crop's productivity traits as well as developing stable and high-yielding cultivars for use in East Africa and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4293065824,"For clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) risk-dependent diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms are routinely implemented in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence-based image analysis has the potential to improve outcome prediction and thereby risk stratification. Thus, we investigated whether a convolutional neural network (CNN) can extract relevant image features from a representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained slide to predict 5-year overall survival (5y-OS) in ccRCC. The CNN was trained to predict 5y-OS in a binary manner using slides from TCGA and validated using an independent in-house cohort. Multivariable logistic regression was used to combine of the CNNs prediction and clinicopathological parameters. A mean balanced accuracy of 72.0% (standard deviation [SD] = 7.9%), sensitivity of 72.4% (SD = 10.6%), specificity of 71.7% (SD = 11.9%) and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.75 (SD = 0.07) was achieved on the TCGA training set (n = 254 patients / WSIs) using 10-fold cross-validation. On the external validation cohort (n = 99 patients / WSIs), mean accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUROC were 65.5% (95%-confidence interval [CI]: 62.9–68.1%), 86.2% (95%-CI: 81.8–90.5%), 44.9% (95%-CI: 40.2–49.6%), and 0.70 (95%-CI: 0.69–0.71). A multivariable model including age, tumor stage and metastasis yielded an AUROC of 0.75 on the TCGA cohort. The inclusion of the CNN-based classification (Odds ratio = 4.86, 95%-CI: 2.70–8.75, p &lt; 0.01) raised the AUROC to 0.81. On the validation cohort, both models showed an AUROC of 0.88. In univariable Cox regression, the CNN showed a hazard ratio of 3.69 (95%-CI: 2.60–5.23, p &lt; 0.01) on TCGA and 2.13 (95%-CI: 0.92–4.94, p = 0.08) on external validation. The results demonstrate that the CNN’s image-based prediction of survival is promising and thus this widely applicable technique should be further investigated with the aim of improving existing risk stratification in ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W4292117571,"Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the standard of care for lung cancer screening in the United States (US). LDCT has a sensitivity of 93.8% but its specificity of 73.4% leads to potentially harmful follow-up procedures in patients without lung cancer. Thus, there is a need for additional assays with high accuracy that can be used as an adjunct to LDCT to diagnose lung cancer. Sputum is a biological fluid that can be obtained non-invasively and can be dissociated to release its cellular contents, providing a snapshot of the lung environment. We obtained sputum from current and former smokers with a 30+ pack-year smoking history and who were either confirmed to have lung cancer or at high risk of developing the disease. Dissociated sputum cells were counted, viability determined, and labeled with a panel of markers to separate leukocytes from non-leukocytes. After excluding debris and dead cells, including squamous epithelial cells, we identified reproducible population signatures and confirmed the samples’ lung origin. In addition to leukocyte and epithelial-specific fluorescent antibodies, we used the highly fluorescent meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP), known to preferentially stain cancer (associated) cells. We looked for differences in cell characteristics, population size and fluorescence intensity that could be useful in distinguishing cancer samples from high-risk samples. We present our data demonstrating the feasibility of a flow cytometry platform to analyze sputum in a high-throughput and standardized matter for the diagnosis of lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4292117688,"Personal data collected by wearable devices contains rich privacy. It is important to realize the personal privacy protection for user data without affecting the data collection of wearable device services. In order to protect users’ personal privacy, a collection scheme based on local differential privacy is proposed for the collected single attribute numerical stream data. At first, the stream data points collected by the wearable device are censored to identify the salient points, and the adaptive Laplacian mechanism is used to add noise to these salient points according to the assigned privacy budget; then the collector reconstructs and fits the stream data curve to the noise-added salient points, so as to protect the personal privacy of the data. This scheme is experimented on the heart rate dataset, and the results show that when the privacy budget is 0.5 (i.e., at higher privacy protection strength), the mean relative error is 0.12, which is 57.78% lower than the scheme of Kim et al. With the satisfaction of user privacy protection, the usability of mean value estimation of wearable device stream data is improved."
https://openalex.org/W4292117729,"Mission statements (henceforth: missions) are strategic planning communication tools used by all types of organizations worldwide. Missions communicate an organization’s purpose, values, standards, and strategy. Research on missions has been prolific over the past 30 years, nevertheless several empirical gaps remain, such as single sector or country studies and restricted mission samples. In this article, we identify similarities and differences in the content of missions from government, private, higher education, and health research-knowledge intensive institutions in a sample of 1,900+ institutions from 89 countries through the deployment of sentiment analysis, readability, and lexical diversity; semantic networks; and a similarity computation between document corpus. We found that missions of research-knowledge intensive institutions are challenging to read texts with lower lexical diversity that favors positive rather than negative words. In stark contrast to this, the non-profit sector is consonant in multiple dimensions in its use of Corporate Social Responsibility jargon. The lexical appearance of ‘research’ in the missions varies according to mission sectorial context, and each sector has a cluster-specific focus. Utilizing the mission as a strategic planning tool in higher-income regions might serve to explain corpora similarities shared by sectors and continents. Furthermore, our open-access dataset on missions worldwide can be used as a source for further replication, triangulation, or crowdsourcing-data studies. Also, practitioners could use our open-access dataset and insights to facilitate strategic planning activities in organizations from multiple sectors."
https://openalex.org/W4293065815,"Increasing human-wildlife conflicts worldwide are driving the need for multiple solutions to reducing ""problem"" wildlife and their impacts. Fertility control is advocated as a non-lethal tool to manage free-living wildlife and in particular to control iconic species. Injectable immunocontraceptives, such as GonaCon, stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn affects the release of reproductive hormones in mammals. Feral cattle (Bos indicus or Bos taurus) in Hong Kong are an iconic species whose numbers and impacts on human activities have increased over the last decade. Previous studies have proven that a primer vaccination and booster dose of GonaCon in female cattle are safe and effective in reducing pregnancy levels one year post-treatment. The aims of this project were 1. to evaluate the longevity of the effect of GonaCon in feral cattle up to four years post-vaccination; and 2. to assess if a second booster dose of GonaCon, administered at either two or four years post-vaccination, extends the contraceptive effect in this species. Vaccination with GonaCon, administered as a primer and booster dose, was effective in causing significant infertility in free-living cattle for at least three years post-vaccination, with the percentage of pregnant animals in the vaccinated group decreasing from 76% at vaccination to 35%, 19% and 7% in years 2, 3 and 4 post-vaccination, compared with 67% at vaccination to 50%, 57% and 14% respectively in the control group. A second booster dose of GonaCon administered either 2 or 4 years after vaccination rendered 100% of the Treated cattle infertile for at least another year. These results suggested that vaccination with GonaCon can reduce feral cattle population growth and that a second booster dose can extend the longevity of the contraceptive effect."
https://openalex.org/W4292117422,"Economic inequality shapes the degree to which people and different social groups are perceived in stereotypical ways. Our research sought to investigate the impact of the perception of economic inequality in an organizational setting on expectations of social diversity in the organization’s workforce, across the dimensions of gender and ethnicity. Combining data from previous experiments, we first explored in one set of studies (Studies 1a and 1b; N = 378) whether the degree of economic inequality in a fictitious organization affected participants’ expectations of the representation of minority vs. majority group employees. We found that when we presented an organization with unequal (vs. equal) distribution of economic wealth amongst its employees to study participants, they expected the presence of men and White majority individuals to be larger than the presence of women and ethnic minorities. Second, we tested our hypotheses and replicated these initial effects in a pre-registered study (Study 2: N = 449). Moreover, we explored the potential mediating role of perceived diversity climate, that is, the perception that the organization promotes and deals well with demographic diversity. Findings revealed that an organizational setting that distributed resources unequally (vs. equally) was associated with a more adverse diversity climate, which, in turn, correlated with expectations of a lower presence of minority group employees in the organization. We concluded that economic inequality creates a context that modulates perceptions of a climate of social exclusion which likely affects the possibilities for members of disadvantaged groups to participate and develop in organizations."

Descriptive data were summarised and free text responses were thematically analysed.441 pregnant women, mean age 32 years (range 17-44), completed the survey. Twenty-six percent were from ethnic minority groups, and 31% had a co-morbid health condition. Most respondents (66.2%) had been vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least one dose (White British 71.9%, Asian 67.9%, White-other 63.6%, Black 33%). The most common reasons for not being vaccinated were concerns about effects on the unborn baby and future pregnancies, anxiety about possible adverse impact on the mother, not enough known about the vaccine, and lack of trust in vaccines. Comments included: ""I'd rather not risk injecting the unknown into my body"", and ""I don't trust it."" Although 23% used social media for information on COVID-19 vaccination, the most trusted sources were the patient's GP and midwife (43%) and official health-related websites such as NHS (39%).A third of these pregnant women had not been vaccinated against COVID-19. Trusted health professionals like midwives and GPs could have a crucial role in increasing vaccination uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4292117627,"The use of radio and television as means to spread reproductive health awareness in Sub-Saharan Africa has been extensive, and its impacts significant. More recently, other means of communication, such as mobile phones, have received the attention of researchers and policy makers as health communication tools. However, evidence on which of the two types of communication (i.e. passive communication from TV/radio, or active communication through phones) is more effective in fostering better reproductive health choices is sparse. This study aims to identify the potential influence of TV or radio ownership as opposed to cell phone ownership on contraceptive use and access to maternal healthcare. Cross-sectional, individual analysis from eleven high-maternal mortality Sub-Saharan African countries is conducted. A total of 78,000 women in union are included in the analysis. Results indicate that ownership of TV or radio is more weakly correlated to better outcomes than mobile phone ownership is. Results are stronger for lower educated women and robust across all levels of wealth. Interestingly, the study also finds that decision-making power is a relevant mediator of cell phone ownership on contraceptive use, but not on maternal healthcare access. A key takeaway from the study is that, while the role of television and radio appears to have diminished in recent years, mobile phones have become a key tool for empowerment and behavioural change among Sub-Saharan African women. Health communication policies should be designed to take into account the now prominent role of mobile phones in affecting health behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W4292117661,"Estrogen action is mediated by various genes, including estrogen-responsive genes (ERGs). ERGs have been used as reporter-genes and markers for gene expression. Gene expression profiling using a set of ERGs has been used to examine statistically reliable transcriptomic assays such as DNA microarray assays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). However, the quality of ERGs has not been extensively examined. Here, we obtained a set of 300 ERGs that were newly identified by six sets of RNA-seq data from estrogen-treated and control human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The ERGs exhibited statistical stability, which was based on the coefficient of variation (CV) analysis, correlation analysis, and examination of the functional association with estrogen action using database searches. A set of the top 30 genes based on CV ranking were further evaluated quantitatively by RT-PCR and qualitatively by a functional analysis using the GO and KEGG databases and by a mechanistic analysis to classify ERα/β-dependent or ER-independent types of transcriptional regulation. The 30 ERGs were characterized according to (1) the enzymes, such as metabolic enzymes, proteases, and protein kinases, (2) the genes with specific cell functions, such as cell-signaling mediators, tumor-suppressors, and the roles in breast cancer, (3) the association with transcriptional regulation, and (4) estrogen-responsiveness. Therefore, the ERGs identified here represent various cell functions and cell signaling pathways, including estrogen signaling, and thus, may be useful to evaluate estrogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W4293065684,"Effective immune responses depend on efficient antigen uptake in the periphery, transport of those antigens to, and presentation in draining lymph nodes (LNs). These processes have been studied intensively using stable fluorescent proteins (FPs) as model antigens. To date, ZsGreen is the only FP that can be tracked efficiently towards LNs, hence, it is difficult to compare studies using alternated tracking proteins. Here, we systematically compared six different FPs. We included ZsGreen, ZsYellow, DsRed, AsRed, mCherry, and mRFP based on sequence homology and/or origin species, and generated FP-expressing tumor cell lines. Stability of fluorescent signal was assessed in vitro over time, across different pH environments, and in vivo through FP antigen uptake and transfer to immune cells isolated from tumors and tumor-draining LNs. ZsGreen could be detected in high percentages of all analyzed tumor-infiltrating immune cells, with highest amounts in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s). ZsYellow, AsRed, and DsRed followed a similar pattern, but percentages of FP-containing immune cells in the tumor were lower than for ZsGreen. Strikingly, mRFP and mCherry demonstrated a 'non-canonical' antigen uptake pattern where percentages of FP-positive tumor-infiltrating immune cells were highest for cDC1s not TAMs and cDC2s despite comparable stabilities and localization of all FPs. Analysis of antigen-containing cells in the LN was hindered by intracellular degradation of FPs. Only ZsGreen could be efficiently tracked to the LN, though some signal was measurable for ZsYellow and DsRed. In summary, we find that detection of antigen uptake and distribution is subject to variabilities related to fluorophore nature. Future experiments need to consider that these processes might be impacted by protein expression, stability, or other unknown factors. Thus, our data sheds light on potential under-appreciated mechanisms regulating antigen transfer and highlights potential uses and necessary caveats to interpretation based on FP use."

This study seeks to determine whether improvements can be achieved by forecasting a stock index using a hybrid model and incorporating financial variables. We extend the literature on stock market forecasting by applying a hybrid model that combines wavelet transform (WT), long short-term memory (LSTM), and an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) based on individual ranking to predict stock indices for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index of the New York Stock Exchange, Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 (S&amp;P 500) index, Nikkei 225 index of Tokyo, Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong market, CSI300 index of Chinese mainland stock market, and NIFTY50 index of India. The results indicate an overall improvement in forecasting of the stock index using the AGA-LSTM model compared to the benchmark models. The evaluation indicators prove that this model has a higher prediction accuracy when forecasting six stock indices."
https://openalex.org/W4293065832,"Policies that restrict access to and use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) by legal status may disproportionately disadvantage particular racial and ethnic groups. While immigrant legal status, race, and ethnicity are recognized as independent social determinants of health, studies examining the extent to which legal status structures racial and ethnic health disparities are limited. Research is needed to identify factors that mitigate disparate health outcomes, such as SNAP and WIC.Cross-sectional data from the 2009/2010 National Agricultural Workers Survey (N = 3,961) were analyzed. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined associations among self-reported health, race, ethnicity, legal status, and SNAP/WIC participation.Farmworkers reporting excellent or good health were more likely to be non-Hispanic White, U.S. citizen, aged 18-25, single, male, educated beyond primary school, living above the poverty level, without chronic health conditions, and located in the Midwest. Hispanic farmworkers had lower odds of reporting excellent or good health (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.12-0.62). Among SNAP/WIC participants, Hispanic farmworkers had higher odds of reporting excellent or good health (OR 6.74, 95% CI 1.54-29.57) compared to non-Hispanic White farmworkers. There was no significant association between self-reported health and legal status.This study complements the extant literature showing racial and ethnic health disparities among the U.S. farmworker population. Results provide valuable insight on the health-protective potential of programs like SNAP and WIC, particularly among Hispanic farmworkers, who may be both less likely to be eligible and more hesitant to participate. These findings underscore the need to expand U.S. farmworkers' eligibility and participation in SNAP and WIC."
https://openalex.org/W4293065942,"Denmark has experienced a remarkable reduction in CVD mortality over recent decades. The scale of the health contribution from the Danish regulation on industrially produced trans fatty acid (ITFA) has therefore long been of interest. Thus the objective was to determine health and equity benefits of the Danish regulation on ITFA content in Danish food, by quantifying the relative contributions of changes in ITFA intake, other risk factors and treatments on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality decline from 1991 to 2007 in Denmark, stratified by socioeconomic group. To evaluate the effects of the ITFA ban (Danish Order no. 160 of March 2003) the Danish IMPACT SEC model was extended to quantify reductions in CHD deaths attributable to changes in ITFA (%E) intake between 1991–2007. Population counts were obtained from the Danish Central Office of Civil Registration, financial income from Statistics Denmark and ITFA intake from Dan-MONICA III (1991) and DANSDA (2005–2008) . Participants were adults aged 25–84 years living in Denmark in 1991 and 2007, stratified by socioeconomic quintiles. The main outcome measure was CHD deaths prevented or postponed (DPP). Mean energy intake from ITFA was decimated between 1991 and 2007, falling from 1.1%E to 0.1%E in men and from 1·0%E to 0·1%E in women. Approximately 1,191 (95% CI 989–1,409) fewer CHD deaths were attributable to the ITFA reduction, representing some 11% of the overall 11,100 mortality fall observed in the period. The greatest attributable mortality falls were seen in the most deprived quintiles. Adding ITFA data to the original IMPACTsec model improved the overall model fit from 64% to 73%. In conclusion: Denmark’s mandatory elimination of ITFA accounted for approximately 11% of the substantial reduction in CHD deaths observed between 1991 and 2007. The most deprived groups benefited the most, thus reducing inequalities. Adopting the Danish ITFA regulatory approach elsewhere could substantially reduce CHD mortality while improving health equity."
https://openalex.org/W4293066000,"Background Various studies from different countries indicated that veterinarians have a significantly increased risk of depression, suicidal ideation and of death by suicide. For German veterinarians a recent study has demonstrated a three times higher rate for depression, two times higher rate for suicidal ideation and a five times higher suicide risk compared to the German general population. For veterinary students, recent studies in the US and UK indicated higher mental distress. To date, empirical studies on depression, suicidal ideation and suicide risk among veterinary students in Germany were lacking so far. This study investigates depression, suicidal ideation and suicide risk of veterinary students in Germany. Methods 913 German veterinary students (14.3% response rate, 90.7% women, mean age 23.6 years) between 18 and 46 years were included and compared with representative German general population samples from 2007 (N = 1097, 55.4% women, mean age 33.9) and 2015 (N = 1033, 56.1% women, mean age 32.8) of the same age range using the depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Suicide Behaviors questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). The general population samples were collected with the assistance of a demographic consulting company. Results The prevalence of depression among German veterinary students was 45.9% (compared to 3.2% in the general population), suicidal ideation was 19.9% (compared to 4.5% in the general population) and suicide risk was 24.0% (compared to 6.6% in the general population). Conclusion In this study, German veterinary students have a 22.1 times higher risk to be screened positive for depression, a 4 times higher risk for reporting current suicidal ideation and they are 4.2 times more likely to have an increased suicide risk compared with the general population in Germany of the same age range."
https://openalex.org/W4293066031,"Recently, olfactory information on odorants has been associated with their corresponding molecular features. Such information has been obtained by predicting the sensory test evaluation scores from the molecular structure parameters or the sensing data. On the other hand, we develop a method of the prediction of molecular features corresponding to the odor impression. We utilize a machine-learning-based odor predictive model introduced in our previous research, and we propose a mathematical model for exploring the sensing data space. By using mass spectrum as sensing data in the predictive model, we can represent predicted mass spectrum as those of an odor mixture, and the mixing ratio can be obtained. We show that the mass spectrum of apple flavor with enhanced ‘fruit’ and ‘sweet’ impressions can be obtained using 59 and 60 molecules respectively by using our analysis method."
https://openalex.org/W4292117322,"There has been an increasing awareness of sarcopenia, which is characterized by a concomitant decrease in skeletal muscle mass and quality due to aging. Resistance exercise is considered more effective than aerobic exercise in terms of therapeutic exercise. To confirm the effect of long-term aerobic exercise in preventing sarcopenia, we evaluated the skeletal muscle mass, quality, and angiogenic capacity of super-aged mice that had undergone lifelong spontaneous exercise (LSE) through various experiments. Our findings show that LSE could maintain skeletal muscle mass, quality, and fitness levels in super-aged mice. In addition, ex vivo experiments showed that the angiogenic capacity was maintained at a high level. However, these results were not consistent with the related changes in the expression of genes and/or proteins involved in protein synthesis or angiogenesis. Based on the results of previous studies, it seems certain that the expression at the molecular level does not represent the phenotypes of skeletal muscle and angiogenesis. This is because aging and long-term exercise are variables that can affect both protein synthesis and the expression patterns of angiogenesis-related genes and proteins. Therefore, in aging and exercise-related research, various physical fitness and angiogenesis variables and phenotypes should be analyzed. In conclusion, LSE appears to maintain the potential of angiogenesis and slow the aging process to maintain skeletal muscle mass and quality. Aerobic exercise may thus be effective for the prevention of sarcopenia."
https://openalex.org/W4292117348,"For the first time, dolphins wearing video cameras were observed capturing and eating live native fish. While freely swimming in San Diego Bay, one dolphin caught 69 resident fish, 64 demersal, 5 near surface, while the other caught 40, 36 demersal and 4 near the surface. Two other dolphins were observed capturing 135 live native fish in a sea water pool. Two additional dolphins were observed feeding opportunistically during open water sessions in the Pacific Ocean. Notably, one of these dolphins was observed to consume 8 yellow-bellied sea snakes ( Hydrophis platurus ). Searching dolphins clicked at intervals of 20 to 50 ms. On approaching prey, click intervals shorten into a terminal buzz and then a squeal. Squeals were bursts of clicks that varied in duration, peak frequency, and amplitude. Squeals continued as the dolphin seized, manipulated and swallowed the prey. If fish escaped, the dolphin continued the chase and sonar clicks were heard less often than the continuous terminal buzz and squeal. During captures, the dolphins’ lips flared to reveal nearly all of the teeth. The throat expanded outward. Fish continued escape swimming even as they entered the dolphins’ mouth, yet the dolphin appeared to suck the fish right down."

Studies of MCMV often involve the use of BALB/c strain mice, but most in vitro assays are carried out in the NIH 3T3 cell line, which is derived from Swiss Albino mice. This report describes a BALB/c-derived mouse salivary gland cell line immortalized using the SV40 large T antigen. Cells stained positive for PDGFR1 and negative for E-cadherin and PECAM-1, indicating mesenchymal origin. This cell line, which has been named murine salivary gland mesenchymal (mSGM), shows promise as a tool for ex vivo immunological assays due to its MHC haplotype match with the BALB/c mouse strain. In addition, plaque assays using mSGM rather than NIH 3T3 cells are significantly more sensitive for detecting low concentrations of MCMV particles. Finally, it is demonstrated that mSGM cells express all 3 BALB/c MHC class I isotypes and are susceptible to T cell-mediated ex vivo cytotoxicity assays, leading to many possible uses in immunological studies of MCMV."
https://openalex.org/W4292117634,"Reputation is a key component in social interactions of group-living animals and appears to play a role in the establishment of cooperation. Animals can form reputations of individuals by directly interacting with them or by observing them interact with a third party, i.e., eavesdropping. Previous research has focused on whether dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) can eavesdrop on humans because of their ability to cooperate with humans, however the results are mixed and if they can eavesdrop, it is unknown whether this ability evolved during the domestication process or whether it was inherited from their ancestor, wolves (Canis lupus). Our study investigated whether equally hand-raised, pack-living dogs and wolves can form reputations of humans in a food-giving situation through indirect and/or direct experience. The experimental procedure comprised three parts: baseline (to test whether the subject preferred a person prior to the experiment), observation and testing. In the observation phase, the subject observed two humans interact with a dog demonstrator-one acted generously and fed the dog, and the other acted selfishly and refused to feed the dog. The subject could then choose which person to approach in the test phase. In the following experience phase, the animals interacted directly with the same two humans who behaved either in a generous or selfish manner. Then, they were again given a choice whom to approach. We found that dogs and wolves, at the group level, did not differentiate between a generous or selfish partner after indirect or direct experience, but wolves were more attentive towards the generous person during the observation phase and some dogs and wolves did prefer the generous partner, at least after indirect and direct experience was combined. Our study suggests that reputation formation may be more difficult than expected for animals and we emphasise the importance of context when studying reputation formation in animals."

In vitamin K depletion, plasma levels of the inactive form of MGP, dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) are increased and associated with VC and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients have increased circulating dp-ucMGP levels and accelerated VC. VItamin K In PEritoneal DIAlysis (VIKIPEDIA) is a prospective, randomized, open label, placebo-controlled trial, evaluating the effect of vitamin K2 supplementation on arterial stiffness and CV events in ESRD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Forty-four PD patients will be included in the study. At baseline, dp-ucMGP and pulse-wave velocity (PWV) will be assessed and then patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to vitamin K (1000 μg MK-7/day) or placebo for 1.5 years. The primary endpoint of this trial is the change in PWV in the placebo group as compared to the treatment group. Secondary endpoints are the occurrence of CV events, mortality, changes in PD adequacy, change in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure indexes and aortic systolic blood pressure and changes in calcium/phosphorus/parathormone metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W4292117695,"Pregnant and lactating women have been discouraged from using cannabis by Health Canada. However, the increasing rate of cannabis use among pregnant women has presented an urgent need to investigate its physiological effects during the perinatal period. During pregnancy, the mammary gland (MG) undergoes remodeling, which involves alveolar differentiation of mammary epithelial cells (MECs), which is essential for breast milk production and secretion. Limited evidence has been reported on the impact of cannabis or its components, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), on MG development or MEC differentiation. In this study, we investigated the effects of THC and CBD on the differentiation of MECs by assessing changes in cellular viability, lipid accumulation, and gene and protein expression of major milk protein and lipid synthesizing markers. using the HC11 cells as a model. We hypothesized that THC and CBD will negatively impact the synthesis of milk proteins and lipids, as well as lipid markers in HC11 cells. Our results demonstrated that THC and CBD reduced cellular viability at concentrations above 30μM and 20μM, respectively. Relative to control, 10μM THC and 10μM CBD reduced mRNA levels of milk proteins (CSN2 and WAP) , lipid synthesizing and glucose transport markers (GLUT 1 , HK2 , FASN , FABP4 , PLIN2 and LPL) , as well as whey acidic protein and lipid levels. In addition, co-treatment of a CB2 antagonist with THC, and a CB2 agonist with CBD, reversed the impact of THC and CBD on the mRNA levels of key markers, respectively. In conclusion, 10μM THC and CBD altered the differentiation of HC11 cells, in part via the CB2 receptor."

This study aimed to evaluate the importance of traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially in the elderly, after a ski accident, and to describe its short-term repercussions. Methodology Patients were analyzed who were admitted to our neurotrauma center from 2012–2018 after a head trauma while skiing. Three different age groups were differentiated and analyzed for the severity of TBI depending on the initial Glasgow Coma Scale as the primary outcome and as secondary outcomes need and type of surgery, Glasgow Outcome Score, preexisting use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs, time to presentation, and pattern of brain injury. TBI severity was adjusted to the time to initial medical consultation. Results No significant difference in TBI severity was found when comparing the middle (&gt;29–54) and older (≥54) age groups to the reference group &lt;30 years (OR:0.45, p = 0.127; OR:0.46, p = 0.17). Acute subdural hemorrhage was present in 21.2% of the ≥55 group and 14.5% of the 30–54 age group, compared to 12.8% of the youngest group (p = &lt;0.001). Overall, 39.4% of the patients in the ≥55 group and 8.1% of the 30–54 age group presented with chronic subdural hemorrhage, whereas none of the youngest patients did (p = &lt;0.001). Conclusion No differences were observed in terms of TBI severity between age groups after acute trauma. Nonetheless, a different pattern of head injury after TBI in older patients was demonstrated. Accordingly, the management differs for these TBIs compared to those of younger patients."
https://openalex.org/W4292117701,"Performance assessments play an essential role in performance diagnostics at schools. In practice, both announced and unannounced assessments are regularly used. However, it is unclear whether assessments are better administered announced or unannounced. From a theoretical perspective, it can be argued that announced assessments, mediated by the greater degree of students’ subjective control that accompanies them, should have a more beneficial effect on emotions, as well as the subsequently resulting performance, than unannounced assessments. To investigate these assumptions, emotion (enjoyment, anxiety) and achievement data (grades) were collected from 414 students in 19 lower- and upper-level tracks at a German secondary school on both announced and unannounced performance assessments. Less anxiety and more enjoyment occurred on the announced assessments. Moreover, enjoyment and anxiety were predictors of performance (i.e., school grades), which was better overall on announced assessments than on unannounced ones. The results of our field study suggest that announced assessments have more beneficial effects on emotions than unannounced assessments."
https://openalex.org/W4292117704,"Pancreatic polypeptide (PP), secreted from γ cells of the islets of Langerhans, is a 36 amino-acid peptide encoded by the Ppy gene. Although previous studies have reported that PP causes a decrease in appetite, the molecular mechanism that regulates PP secretion has not been fully elucidated. Lack of understanding of the regulatory mechanism of PP secretion may be partially owing to the lack of assay systems that can specifically detect PP. We recently developed the mouse monoclonal antibody 23-2D3 that specifically recognizes PP. In the present study, we developed a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the measurement of mouse PP, and directly monitored intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations in Ppy -expressing cells from a newly developed reporter mouse. Using these systems, we identified agonists, such as carbachol and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which stimulate PP secretion. We further demonstrated that, unlike the case of GIP-induced insulin secretion from β cells, there is a unique mechanism by which PP secretion is triggered by an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations via voltage-dependent calcium channels even in low-glucose conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4292117715,"Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is an arbovirus that, while it has been known to exist since the 1930’s, recently had a spike in cases. This increased prevalence is particularly concerning due to the severity of the disease with 1 in 3 symptomatic patients dying. The cause of this peak is currently unknown but could be due to changes in climate, the virus itself, or host behavior. In this paper we propose a novel multi-season deterministic model of EEE spread and its stochastic counterpart. Models were parameterized using a dataset from the Florida Department of Health with sixteen years of sentinel chicken seroconversion rates. The different roles of the enzootic and bridge mosquito vectors were explored. As expected, enzootic mosquitoes like Culiseta melanura were more important for EEE persistence, while bridge vectors were implicated in the disease burden in humans. These models were used to explore hypothetical viral mutations and host behavior changes, including increased infectivity, vertical transmission, and host feeding preferences. Results showed that changes in the enzootic vector transmission increased cases among birds more drastically than equivalent changes in the bridge vector. Additionally, a 5% difference in the bridge vector’s bird feeding preference can increase cumulative dead-end host infections more than 20-fold. Taken together, this suggests changes in many parts of the transmission cycle can augment cases in birds, but the bridge vectors feeding preference acts as a valve limiting the enzootic circulation from its impact on dead-end hosts, such as humans. Our what-if scenario analysis reveals and measures possible threats regarding EEE and relevant environmental changes and hypothetically suggests how to prevent potential damage to public health and the equine economy."
https://openalex.org/W4292361838,"Motivated by several possible differences in Covid-19 virus strains, age demographics, and face mask wearing between continents and countries, we focussed on changes in Covid death rates in 2020. We have extended our Covid-19 multicompartment model (Khan et al., 2020) to fit cumulative case and death data for 49 European countries and 52 US states and territories during the recent pandemic, and found that the case mortality rate had decreased by at least 80% in most of the US and at least 90% in most of Europe. We found that death rate decreases do not have strong correlations to other model parameters (such as contact rate) or other standard state/national metrics such as population density, GDP, and median age. Almost all the decreases occurred between mid-April and mid-June 2020, which corresponds to the time when many state and national lockdowns were relaxed resulting in surges of new cases. We examine here several plausible causes for this drop-improvements in treatment, face mask wearing, new virus strains, testing, potentially changing demographics of infected patients, and changes in data collection and reporting-but none of their effects are as significant as the death rate changes suggest. In conclusion, this work shows that a two death rate model is effective in quantifying the reported drop in death rates."
https://openalex.org/W4292361885,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the Kingdom of Bhutan, and early detection of hypertension is critical for preventing cardiovascular disease. However, health-seeking behavior, including blood pressure measurement, is infrequently investigated in Bhutan. Therefore, this study investigated factors related to blood pressure measurement in Bhutan. We performed a secondary data analysis of a target population of 1,962 individuals using data from the “2014 Bhutan STEPS survey data”as a cross-sectional study. Approximately 26% of those with hypertension who were detected during the STEPS survey had never had their blood pressure measured. Previous blood pressure measurement was significantly associated with age and working status in men (self-employed [odds ratio (OR): 0.219, 95% CI: 0.133–0.361], non-working [OR: 0.114, 95% CI: 0.050–0.263], employee [OR: 1.000]). Previous blood pressure measurement was significantly associated with higher income in women (Quartile-2 [OR: 1.984, 95% CI: 1.209–3.255], Quartile-1 [OR: 2.161, 95% CI: 1.415–3.299], Quartile-4 [OR: 1.000]). A family history of hypertension (OR: 2.019, 95% CI: 1.549–2.243) increased the likelihood of having experienced a blood pressure measurement in both men and women. Multivariate logistic regression showed that people with unhealthy lifestyles (high salt intake [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 0.247, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.068–0.893], tobacco use [AOR: 0.538, 95% CI: 0.380–0.761]) had a decreased likelihood of previous blood pressure measurement. To promote the early detection of hypertension in Bhutan, we suggest that more attention be paid to low-income women, non-working, self-employed, and low-income men, and a reduction of barriers to blood pressure measurement. Before the STEPS survey, a substantial number of hypertensive people had never had their blood pressure measured or were unconcerned about their health. As a result, we propose that early blood pressure monitoring and treatment for people with hypertension or at higher risk of hypertension be given increased emphasis."
https://openalex.org/W4293065931,"In this paper, we investigate how open access is reflected and implemented in all Norwegian universities and how they responded to national policy developments for open access in the period 2009–2021. We analyse how the universities adapted arguments for the three core missions of the universities–research, education, and societal impact–when they reacted to increasing pressures to facilitate open access. Our analysis is based on 182 institutional strategy documents, open access policies and annual reports. When considering the profile of the institutional policies and the explicit referrals to national policies, we find there is a great deal of homogeneity between Norwegian universities, and they are mostly aligned with national policy. Open access is connected to the third mission in all university strategies, but often in a very general manner and without documenting benefits for non-academic users. We find limited emphasis on open access as advantageous for education. All universities show commitment to open access, and several can be described as proactive as they tie it to different types of local incentives. Development over time suggests more mature and institutionalised polices that do not challenge what we may call the academic heartland and its core value of academic freedom, including where and how to publish. We propose a framework for analysing similar institutionalisation processes with three main dimensions: mimesis, adaptation/integration with existing practices, and maturation/commitment."
https://openalex.org/W4293066057,"The blockages of pipelines caused by agglomeration of gas hydrates is a major flow assurance issue in the oil and gas industry. Some crude oils form gas hydrates that remain as transportable particles in a slurry. It is commonly believed that naturally occurring components in those crude oils alter the surface properties of gas hydrate particles when formed. The exact structure of the crude oil components responsible for this surface modification remains unknown. In this study, a successive accumulation and spiking of hydrate-active crude oil fractions was performed to increase the concentration of hydrate related compounds. Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was then utilised to analyse extracted oil samples for each spiking generation. Machine learning-based variable selection was used on the FT-ICR MS spectra to identify the components related to hydrate formation. Among six different methods, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was selected as the best performing model and the 23 most important variables were determined. The FT-ICR MS mass spectra for each spiking level was compared to samples extracted before the successive accumulation, to identify changes in the composition. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) exhibited differences between the oils and spiking levels, indicating an accumulation of hydrate active components. Molecular formulas, double bond equivalents (DBE) and hydrogen-carbon (H/C) ratios were determined for each of the selected variables and evaluated. Some variables were identified as possibly asphaltenes and naphthenic acids which could be related to the positive wetting index (WI) for the oils."
https://openalex.org/W4293066137,"A computational approach involving mathematical modeling and in silico experiments was used to characterize the determinants of extent and duration of platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition by aspirin and design precision dosing in patients with accelerated platelet turnover or reduced drug bioavailability. To this purpose, a recently developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) model of low-dose aspirin in regenerating platelets and megakaryocytes, was used to predict the main features and determinants of platelet COX-1 inhibition. The response to different aspirin regimens in healthy subjects and in pathological conditions associated with alterations in aspirin PK (i.e., severely obese subjects) or PD (i.e., essential thrombocytemya patients), were simulated. A model sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the main processes influencing COX-1 dynamics. In silico experiments and sensitivity analyses indicated a major role for megakaryocytes and platelet turnover in determining the extent and duration of COX-1 inhibition by once-daily, low-dose aspirin. They also showed the superiority of reducing the dosing interval vs increasing the once-daily dose in conditions of increased platelet turnover, while suggested specific dose adjustments in conditions of possible reduction in drug bioavailability. In conclusion, the consistency of our model-based findings with experimental data from studies in healthy subjects and patients with essential thrombocythemia supports the potential of our approach for describing the determinants of platelet inhibition by aspirin and informing precision dosing which may guide personalized antithrombotic therapy in different patient populations, especially in those under-represented in clinical trials or in those associated with poor feasibility."
https://openalex.org/W4292117459,"Many societies report an increasingly divergent development of managers’ salaries compared to that of their workforce. Moreover, there is often a lack in diversity amongst managerial boards. We investigate the role of managers’ gender and incentive scheme on wages chosen for workers by conducting two experimental studies. The data reveal male managers respond in more self-oriented ways to their incentive scheme. Further, we find that experience with the workers’ task can increase appreciation of workers. Effects are strongest when the managers’ compensation scheme rules out self-orientation. Overall, female managers display more consistency in choosing adequate wages for workers, i.e. their choices are less affected by incentives. An increase in diversity may thus help reducing salary disparities and foster work atmosphere."

We compare raw material samples from three chert-bearing areas in Germany with archaeological samples from Vogelherd. Our results show that infrared spectroscopy can distinguish between different raw materials. Our archaeological samples from Vogelherd correspond to the sampled geological cherts in terms of their spectral signature. Our comparison of reference samples and archaeological samples highlights problems in commonly used macroscopic identifications of chert raw materials."
https://openalex.org/W4292997499,"Background The INTERVAL trial showed shorter inter-donation intervals could safely increase the frequency of whole-blood donation. We extended the INTERVAL trial to consider the relative cost-effectiveness of reduced inter-donation intervals. Methods Our within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) used data from 44,863 whole-blood donors randomly assigned to 12, 10 or 8 week (males), and 16, 14 or 12 week inter-donation intervals (females). The CEA analysed the number of whole-blood donations, deferrals including low- haemoglobin deferrals, and donors’ health-related quality of life (QoL) to report costs and cost-effectiveness over two years. Findings The mean number of blood donation visits over two years was higher for the reduced interval strategies, for males (7.76, 6.60 and 5.68 average donations in the 8-, 10- and 12- week arms) and for females (5.10, 4.60 and 4.01 donations in the 12-, 14- and 16- week arms). For males, the average rate of deferral for low haemoglobin per session attended, was 5.71% (8- week arm), 3.73% (10- week), and 2.55% (12- week), and for females the rates were: 7.92% (12-week), 6.63% (14- week), and 5.05% (16- week). Donors’ QoL was similar across strategies, although self-reported symptoms were increased with shorter donation intervals. The shorter interval strategies increased average cost, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of £9.51 (95% CI 9.33 to 9.69) per additional whole-blood donation for the 8- versus 12- week interval for males, and £10.17 (95% CI 9.80 to 10.54) for the 12- versus 16- week interval arm for females. Conclusions Over two years, reducing the minimum donation interval could provide additional units of whole-blood at a small additional cost, including for those donor subgroups whose blood type is in relatively high demand. However, the significance of self-reported symptoms needs to be investigated further before these policies are expanded."
https://openalex.org/W4293065694,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Ramipril is a widely used ACE compound because of its effectiveness in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, as well as its low risk of adverse effects. However, the clinical features of ramipril, and the risk of DILI, have not been adequately studied. A retrospective cohort study was performed based on data from 3909 inpatients to compare the risk of DILI conferred by ramipril and other ACEIs. A logistic regression model was then constructed and validated against data from 1686 patients using ramipril, of which 117 patients were diagnosed with DILI. The use of ramipril increased the risk of DILI by 2.68 times (odds ratio = 2.68; 95% confident interval (CI):1.96-3.71) compared with the group using other ACEIs. The clinical features of DILI in the ramipril group were similar to those from the ACEI group (P>0.05), except that the ALT level was higher (P<0.05). A logistic regression model including Body mass index (BMI), comorbidity, liver disease, daily dose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was built and successfully validated for DILI risk prediction, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.752-0.888). We recommend that clinicians should be aware of the levels of ALT and ALP as well as BMI, comorbidities, and liver disease before prescribing ramipril to avoid the risk of DILI in patients."
https://openalex.org/W4293065947,"Mentoring has been a subject of study for 50 years. Most studies of mentoring programs evaluate the effect of the program on the participants but do not evaluate if different mentors have different effects on mentees. Open-source software (OSS) is software with a license that allows it to be freely used by other people. Such software has become foundational to the world economy. However, many OSS projects get abandoned by their creators. Various nonprofit organizations have arisen to help OSS projects become sustainable. One of the key services offered by many of these nonprofit organizations is a mentorship program where experienced OSS developers advise nascent projects on how to achieve sustainability. We use data from the Apache Software Foundation Incubator program where 303 mentors have mentored 286 projects, with most mentoring more than one project, to address this question: Is who a project has as a mentor associated with variation in project success? Who a project has as a mentor accounts for 45% of the variation in project outcomes, with some mentors being associated with positive and some with negative outcomes. These mentors could offer insights into how to improve the mentoring program. This result also demonstrates, more broadly, that the nature of specific mentoring relationships may be important to understanding how mentors impact outcomes in other mentoring programs."

The survival of the marriage and the impact of various competing factors on the survival is of high importance. This study aimed at utilizing competing risks survival analysis to investigate the marriage survival of new couples in Tabriz. Methods In this longitudinal study, a number of 386 individuals who were married and divorced from 1991 to 2017, were selected by random sampling. The registered information was attained from the general registry office of Tabriz. Data analysis was carried out using the Lunn-McNeil procedure and the results were presented using an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR). Results The average age of marriage was about 23.9 (SD 6.6) years. The results of multivariate Lunn-McNeil models indicated that for the competing cause of having a relationship with another person (AHRs range: 1.12 to 2.03), the traditional mode of being familiar (AHRs range: 1.55 to 3.39), family weak role in choosing a wife/spouse (AHRs range: 0.25 to 3.25) and the role of moral-religious commitment (AHRs range: 0.37 to 0.47), along with other causes severed the risk of marriage survival reduction. Conclusion According to the results of this study in assessing competing risks, we conclude that the decline in marriage survival is a multifactorial phenomenon. Examining the survival of marriage in order to better understand all the dimensions and factors affecting this phenomenon and providing information to counselors and officials can play an important role in increasing marriage survival."

However, there is currently no consensus regarding the health effects of electromagnetic field exposure, despite the large amount of research conducted on this topic. This study aimed to understand the knowledge structure and trend of electromagnetic field and health research through text network analysis and topic modeling.PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were searched, and 3,880 articles published before June 2021 were identified. We explored the main keywords and research topics regarding electromagnetic fields and human health by constructing a network of keywords. A social network analysis program was used to analyze the data, visualize the network, and perform topic modeling.Four keywords, ""exposure,"" ""effect,"" ""cell,"" and ""cancer,"" were highly correlated to other keywords and formed each colony in the knowledge structure of research on electromagnetic fields and health. Five topics were derived from topic modeling: cell research, research on the adaption of MRI, health effects of mobile phones, pain therapy, and exposure measurement. Cell research has been continuously performed, and many studies have been conducted on the health effects of mobile phones since 2000.These findings will assist in gaining insights into and understanding changes in research on the health effects of electromagnetic fields, and suggest important areas and directions for future research."
https://openalex.org/W4293066162,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health problem and is the most common form of violence against women. Women with HIV in serodifferent relationships may be at an increased risk of IPV compared to women without HIV, hindering their ability to adhere to antiretroviral therapy, clinic appointments, and condom use during sex. This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of IPV in the past year among women with HIV in serodifferent relationships in Nairobi, Kenya.This cross-sectional study included women with HIV in serodifferent relationships who were at least 18 years old and provided written informed consent. Their experience of physical, sexual, or emotional violence in the past year by the current partner was assessed using 13 questions adapted from the World Health Organization survey on violence against women. Standardized instruments were used to assess sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Associations between intimate partner violence and other variables were evaluated using log binomial regression models.Of the 159 women enrolled, 47 (29.6%, 95% CI 22.9-37.2%) reported IPV in the past year. Of these, 32 (68.1%) reported emotional, 27 (57.4%) physical, and 27 (57.4%) sexual violence. In the multivariate model, pregnancy (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2.14, 95% CI 1.09-4.20), alcohol use (minimal drinking aPR 1.91, 95% CI 1.10-3.33; moderate/severe drinking aPR 1.17, 95% CI 0.53-2.59), male partner controlling behavior (aPR 2.09, 95% CI 1.24-3.51), and past physical violence (aPR 1.93, 95% CI 1.22-3.05) remained significantly associated with a higher prevalence of IPV in the past year.This study identified a high prevalence of IPV in the past year among women with HIV in serodifferent relationships. Pregnant women and women who had experienced prior violence had a higher prevalence of IPV. These data highlight the need to screen for IPV during clinic visits, and to offer evidence based interventions to support women in serodifferent relationships who have experienced IPV."
