However, the performance of electronic circuits is now becoming rather limited when digital information needs to be sent from one point to another. Photonics offers an effective solution to this problem by implementing optical communication systems based on optical fibers and photonic circuits. Unfortunately, the micrometer-scale bulky components of photonics have limited the integration of these components into electronic chips, which are now measured in nanometers. Surface plasmon–based circuits, which merge electronics and photonics at the nanoscale, may offer a solution to this size-compatibility problem. Here we review the current status and future prospects of plasmonics in various applications including plasmonic chips, light generation, and nanolithography."

We show that the endothelial growth factor VEGF is sufficient for organ homing of circulating mononuclear myeloid cells and is required for their perivascular positioning and retention. Recruited bone marrow-derived circulating cells (RBCCs) summoned by VEGF serve a function distinct from endothelial progenitor cells. Retention of RBCCs in close proximity to angiogenic vessels is mediated by SDF1, a chemokine induced by VEGF in activated perivascular myofibroblasts. RBCCs enhance in situ proliferation of endothelial cells via secreting proangiogenic activities distinct from locally induced activities. Precluding RBCCs strongly attenuated the proangiogenic response to VEGF and addition of purified RBCCs enhanced angiogenesis in excision wounds.

Formation of new blood vessels in adult organs is fundamentally different from developmental neovascularization. Whereas developmental vasculogenesis relies on a reservoir of local angioblasts, adult neovascularization may utilize circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) and eventually incorporated within the forming vasculature at a distant organ (Asahara et al., 1999Asahara T.

Recently, increased attention has been directed to other populations of BM-derived cells recruited to sites of ongoing angiogenesis but that do not function as EPCs. These cells might nevertheless contribute to neovessel formation (De Palma et al., 2003De Palma M. Venneri M.A. Roca C. Naldini L.

The present study focuses on the angiogenic roles of these cells, collectively defined here as recruited bone marrow-derived circulating cells (RBCCs) and on their homing mechanisms. Elucidating the angiogenic roles of RBCCs is of a particular significance in light of the need to reconcile the apparent limited contribution of EPCs with the apparent beneficial effect of autologous BM cells administered to ischemic tissues (Kalka et al., 2000Kalka C.

Med. 2001; 7: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2302) Google Scholar), findings that have already prompted clinical trials (Schachinger et al., 2004Schachinger V. Assmus B. Britten M.B. Honold J.

Martin H. et al.Transplantation of progenitor cells and regeneration enhancement in acute myocardial infarction: final one-year results of the TOPCARE-AMI Trial.J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 1690-1699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In addition, understanding the unknown mechanisms underlying RBCC homing may provide potential new targets for augmenting or, conversely, attenuating angiogenesis. Another unique aspect of adult neovascularization is that, unlike the hardwired program of developmental angiogenesis, it is usually triggered by either environmental stress (e.g., hypoxia) or by stochastic genetic changes in tumors. These incidental stimuli usually culminate in upregulated expression of VEGF. It is, therefore, mechanistically unclear how VEGF single-handedly orchestrates a complete angiogenic program, a task known to be executed by multiple and often nonredundant factors. For example, the fact that VEGF is a relatively weak endothelial cell mitogen suggests that additional EC mitogens are likely to be recruited. The present study addresses the proposition that VEGF may recruit complementary proangiogenic activities, not only through local upregulation of proangiogenic genes but also through import of “accessory” cells that provide them. Accordingly, a mechanism must exist by which VEGF acts to recruit accessory cells and position them close to angiogenic vessels within the target organ. To address these issues, we devised a transgenic system for conditional and reversible induction of VEGF in selected adult organs. The system has several advantages over previously employed systems of VEGF-induced neovascularization in the adult. First, as a “clean” genetic switch system, it circumvents confounding factors associated with other modes of VEGF delivery, such as stress, inflammatory, and immunological responses. Notably, it allows examining VEGF functions in the absence of hypoxia, an environmental factor recently shown to influence trafficking of hematopoietic cells (Ceradini et al., 2004Ceradini D.J. Kulkarni A.R. Callaghan M.J. Tepper O.M. Bastidas N. Kleinman M.E. Capla J.M. Galiano R.D. Levine J.P. Gurtner G.C. Progenitor cell trafficking is regulated by hypoxic gradients through HIF-1 induction of SDF-1.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). Second, the synchronous and robust reaction to VEGF enables to summon onto an organ of choice circulating cells in quantities allowing their isolation and subsequent characterization. Third, the possibility to switch off VEGF production at any desired schedule allows distinguishing roles of VEGF in initial recruitment of circulating cells from a role in maintaining incoming cells in the organ. Here, we provide evidence that VEGF induces perivascular expression of the chemokine SDF1 that functions, in turn, to position RBCCs in this strategic location from which they act in a paracrine fashion to enhance in situ proliferation of resident, activated endothelial cells. To induce formation of new blood vessels in selected adult organs, a transgenic system in which VEGF expression is induced at will in the respective organ, steadily maintained for the desired duration, and subsequently can be switched off was designed. Briefly, transgenic mice expressing a tetracycline-regulated transactivator protein (tTA) exclusively in the myocardium or liver (driver lines) were mated with transgenic mice harboring a VEGF164-encoding transgene driven by a tetracycline-responsive promoter (responder line). Pups that inherited both transgenes were selected for modulating VEGF expression, whereas littermates that inherited only one of the two transgenes served as controls. The onset of VEGF induction in these animals and the duration of expression were tightly controlled by including or omitting tetracycline from the drinking water (“off” and “on” modes, respectively; see Experimental Procedures for details). Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that in MHCα-tTA+/tet-VEGF+ animals, VEGF164 expression was strongly induced within 24 hr after withdrawal of tetracycline in most cardiomyocytes and in PLAP-tTA+/tet-VEGF+ animals in most hepatocytes (Dor et al., 2002Dor Y. Djonov V. Abramovitch R. Itin A. Fishman G.I. Carmeliet P. Goelman G. Keshet E. Conditional switching of VEGF provides new insights into adult neovascularization and pro-angiogenic therapy.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1939-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Ongoing production of VEGF by the liver resulted in its accumulation in the serum to steady-state levels of 120 to 3000 pg/ml and when induced in the heart, to levels of 70 to 140 pg/ml. For comparison, control mice had only 45–100 pg/ml VEGF in their circulation. The apparent variability among individual mice with respect to the levels of circulating VEGF induced by the genetic switch enabled us to determine the threshold levels of circulating VEGF conducive for an ensuing angiogenic response. Using BrdU+ proliferating endothelial cells as a readout for angiogenesis, a significant angiogenic response was already detected for the lower end of this range in the liver (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) as well as in the heart. Notably, these levels of circulating VEGF are comparable and even lower than the respective levels detected in cancer patients (Kraft et al., 1999Kraft A. Weindel K. Ochs A. Marth C. Zmija J. Schumacher P. Unger C. Marme D. Gastl G.

Manpaa H. Orpana A. Alitalo K. Joensuu H. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor is often elevated in disseminated cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 647-651PubMed Google Scholar), in neovascularization associated with acute myocardial infarction (Ogawa et al., 2000Ogawa H. Suefuji H. Soejima H. Nishiyama K. Misumi K. Takazoe K. Miyamoto S. Kajiwara I. Sumida H. Sakamoto T. et al.Increased blood vascular endothelial growth factor levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction.Cardiology. 2000; 93: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or during wound healing (Infanger et al., 2004Infanger M. Schmidt O. Kossmehl P. Grad S. Ertel W. Grimm D. Vascular endothelial growth factor serum level is strongly enhanced after burn injury and correlated with local and general tissue edema.Burns. 2004; 30: 305-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, we believe that findings obtained with the aid of this transgenic switch system are also valid for naturally triggered angiogenesis, as indeed extended below for wound-healing neovascularization. Inducing VEGF expression in the adult heart or liver led to massive infiltration of circulating cells, specifically into the respective organ. Recruited cells could be readily distinguished morphologically from the resident cells of the respective organ (Figure 1A). Infiltration of circulating cells was already evident shortly after the onset of VEGF induction, clearly visible within the first 4 days, and notably, preceding emergence of new vessels. Thus the notion that these recruited cells may contribute to neovessel formation is at least temporally feasible. To track the BM origin of recruited cells, the marrow of double-transgenic animals was reconstituted with genetically tagged cells prior to switching on VEGF expression. Specifically, BM cells derived from ROSA-βGal mice or, in other experiments, marrow derived from β-actin-eGFP mice were used to replace the marrow of irradiated double transgenic recipients (see Experimental Procedures for details and for analysis of chimerism). In the noninduced liver, only very few βGal- or eGFP-labeled cells were detected (data not shown), whereas following VEGF induction, the organ was heavily populated by BM-derived cells (Figures 1B and 1C), indicating that their accumulation in the liver is due to active recruitment by VEGF and not merely reflecting a natural turnover of organ resident BM-derived cells that have taken place since BM grafting. Recruited RBCCs summoned to the organ by VEGF were only rarely incorporated within the endothelium, arguing against a significant contribution of EPCs to the newly acquired vasculature in this system (Figures 1B and 1C). Instead, RBCCs were mostly distributed around blood vessels with a clear affinity to reside in close proximity to vessels. This spatial relationship between RBCCs and endothelial cells suggested a paracrine angiogenic role for RBCCs rather than a role of serving as endothelial progenitors. VEGF is known to induce mobilization of BM cells into the bloodstream, as reflected in a significant increase in WBC counts by circulating VEGF (Hattori et al., 2001Hattori K. Dias S. Heissig B. Hackett N.R. Lyden D. Tateno M. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Witte L. Crystal R.G. et al.Vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 stimulate postnatal hematopoiesis by recruitment of vasculogenic and hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In our system, an 8-fold increase in WBC count was observed when VEGF was induced in the liver, but only a minor increase in WBC count was observed following a heart switch. This is likely because the levels of circulating VEGF resulting from a heart switch were significantly lower. Yet, even in the case where mobilization of BM cells by VEGF was not excessive, circulating cells were efficiently attracted to and accumulated within the target organ. Thus, we consider the role of VEGF in homing circulating cells to the target organ to be of a greater significance than its role in mobilizing cells into the circulation, a task known to be accomplished also by other cytokines (like GM-CSF). To elucidate the cellular composition of RBCCs, we devised a procedure for their isolation in entirety after their arrival to the liver or heart. Two weeks after the onset of VEGF expression, sufficient amounts of RBCCs have already accumulated in the respective target organ to allow their isolation in sufficient quantities. Importantly, at this time there was no evidence for tissue inflammation or damage that might be associated with a prolonged exposure to VEGF. Advantage was then taken of the fact that recruited cells are loosely associated with the liver for their separation, without the need for proteolysis and for their further purification through banding on a Ficoll gradient. The yield of liver RBCCs was 1.5 × 107 cells per organ whereas only 1% to 10% that amount could be isolated from the noninduced liver using the same procedure. FACS analyses have shown that the vast majority of isolated cells are positive for the panhematopoietic marker CD45 (Figure 2A, left), positive for VEGF-R1 and negative for VEGF-R2 (data not shown), indicating that cells recruited by VEGF are predominantly hematopoietic in nature. In situ hybridization with a CD45-specific riboprobe corroborated the observation that RBCCs are retained close to the vessels from which they have apparently extravasated (Figure 2B). Further analysis, using different hematopoietic cell markers, showed that 40% of CD45+ RBCCs retrieved from the liver were also CD11b positive (data not shown). Since VEGF can induce extra-medullary hematopoiesis in the liver (Hattori et al., 2001Hattori K. Dias S. Heissig B. Hackett N.R. Lyden D. Tateno M. Hicklin D.J. Zhu Z. Witte L. Crystal R.G. et al.Vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 stimulate postnatal hematopoiesis by recruitment of vasculogenic and hematopoietic stem cells.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1005-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar; our unpublished data) and, therefore, the retrieved cell population could have also contained cells engaged in active hematopoiesis, we extended a similar analysis to RBCCs retrieved from induced hearts. Like in the liver, 66% of CD45+ cell recruited by VEGF to the heart were also CD11b positive (Figure 2A, right). Notably, B and T lymphocytes could not be detected in heart RBCCs, as evident by the lack of CD19 or CD3 expression (data not shown), suggesting that the major components in the RBCC population are myeloid cells. To show that the perivascular positioning of RBCCs demonstrated above for CD45 cells, in general, specifically applies to myeloid cells, we bred onto the VEGF switch system a transgenic GFP reporter which is driven by the CX3CR1 promoter. Activity of this chemokine receptor promoter is restricted to mononuclear myeloid cells, including all circulating CD116+ monocytes, and is essentially absent from cells of the lymphoid lineage (Geissmann et al., 2003Geissmann F. Jung S. Littman D.R. Blood monocytes consist of two principal subsets with distinct migratory properties.Immunity. 2003; 19: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, Jung et al., 2000Jung S. Aliberti J. Graemmel P. Sunshine M.J. Kreutzberg G.W. Sher A. Littman D.R. Analysis of fractalkine receptor CX(3)CR1 function by targeted deletion and green fluorescent protein reporter gene insertion.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2C, CX3CR1/GFP-positive cells were indeed localized close to vessels in both the liver and heart. This localization has suggested that recruited mononuclear myeloid cells may act paracrinically on the adjacent endothelium and prompted experiments described below. To explain how VEGF alone may act to retain RBCCs in a perivascular position, we hypothesized that VEGF induces expression of a particular chemokine that functions to capture incoming cells expressing cognate receptors. As a first step, we determined the repertoire of chemokine receptors expressed in incoming cells by analyzing RNA extracted from isolated RBCCs on an Affymetrix gene array. Out of the several C-C and C-X-C type chemokine receptors expressed by these cells, we focused on CXCR4 because it was found to be expressed by the vast majority of CD45+ cells that have entered the organ (Figure 3A) and since its obligatory ligand CXCL12 (also known as SDF1) was previously found to be important for recruiting hematopoietic stem cells to the liver (Kollet et al., 2003Kollet O. Shivtiel S. Chen Y.Q. Suriawinata J. Thung S.N. Dabeva M.D. Kahn J. Spiegel A. Dar A. Samira S. et al.HGF, SDF-1, and MMP-9 are involved in stress-induced human CD34+ stem cell recruitment to the liver.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). We first verified that incoming RBCCs are indeed responsive to SDF1 using a transfilter migration assay. As shown in Figure 3B, RBCCs retrieved from the liver showed a strong chemotactic response to SDF1. Next, we examined whether SDF1 is naturally induced downstream of VEGF and in what locations. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that switching on VEGF expression in either heart or liver resulted in induction of SDF1 protein, predominantly around blood vessels of the respective organ (Figure 3C) and to a lesser extent also in the endothelium (data not shown). Further, in situ mRNA hybridization for SDF1 indicated that perivascular cells are the producers of this secreted chemokine in the VEGF-induced organ (Figure 3D). In situ hybridization for SDF1 and CXCR4 in adjacent serial sections confirmed an intimate spatial relationship where incoming CXCR4+ cells are retained as a halo around the ring of SDF1-expressing cells surrounding vessels (Figure 3D). To better identify the SDF1-expressing cells, double immunostaining was performed using SDF1 antibodies in combination with fibroblastic or smooth muscle/pericyte markers. In the VEGF-induced heart, SDF1 protein mostly colocalized with α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA; Figure 4A, left panels) and with vimentin (data not shown), suggesting the fibroblastic or smooth muscle nature of SDF1-expressing cells. Next, we wished to demonstrate that perivascular expression of SDF1 also accompanies pathophysiological neovascularization. To this end, specimens representing ongoing angiogenesis in the ischemic heart (experimentally induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery [LAD]), in a growing prostate tumor and during healing of excision wounds, were similarly analyzed for SDF1 and αSMA expression. As shown in Figure 4A, colocalized expression of SDF1 and αSMA in perivascular cells was indeed observed in all cases, indicating that perivascular induction of SDF1 is an integral part of adult angiogenesis in general. As evident in Figure 4A, with the exception of the VEGF genetic switch system, SDF1 expression was detected in additional sites besides its perivascular expression. This was anticipated, considering that SDF1 is known to be regulated by different cues (e.g., by hypoxia [Ceradini et al., 2004Ceradini D.J. Kulkarni A.R. Callaghan M.J. Tepper O.M. Bastidas N. Kleinman M.E. Capla J.M. Galiano R.D. Levine J.P. Gurtner G.C. Progenitor cell trafficking is regulated by hypoxic gradients through HIF-1 induction of SDF-1.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar]). It was important, therefore, to determine whether in the pathophysiological settings too, SDF1 is regulated by VEGF. To this end, VEGF signaling was specifically inhibited during wound healing angiogenesis through transgenic induction of a chimeric protein that acts as a “VEGF trap” (see Experimental Procedures for details). Specimens were then retrieved at the midst of the wound healing process and were analyzed for SDF1 expression. SDF1 expression was strongly induced upon wounding the skin, but its upregulated expression was negated when the VEGF trap was activated (Figure 4B and a quantitative summary in Figure 7A). Importantly, inability to upregulate SDF1 in the wound in the face of VEGF suppression was specifically accounted for by the apparent inhibition of its perivascular expression (Figure 4C), suggesting that in wound angiogenesis, induction of perivascular SDF1 is downstream of VEGF. Currently, it is not known whether induction of SDF1 expression in these cells by VEGF is direct or indirect. In vitro, at least, VEGF directly induced SDF1 mRNA in primary fibroblast cultures, but not in primary cultures of smooth muscle cells (Figure S2). Results presented above indicated that VEGF recruits circulating cells to the organ where it is produced. We next examined whether a continued VEGF expression is required for retaining imported cells within the organ and also whether RBCC retention is mediated by SDF1. To this end, we induced VEGF expression for two weeks and then switched it off. While the liver or the heart contained an abundance of RBCCs by the end of the induction period, recruited cells were completely lost within a few days after terminating VEGF expression (Figure 1A). The loss of recruited RBCCs was also evident from a 10- to 100-fold reduction in the yield of RBCCs that could be isolated from livers in which VEGF expression has been switched off. In the organ in which VEGF has been switched off, physical loss of RBCCs was also manifested by a marked reduction in organ CXCR4 expression, the presumed consequence of the observed downregulation in SDF1 expression (Figure S3A). A role for SDF1 in RBCCs retention during wound healing was suggested by a similar coreduction in SDF1 and CXCR4 expression in the wound area upon activation of the VEGF trap (Figure 4B, quantified in Figure 7A). To provide a definite proof that SDF1 is essential for homing and/or retention of incoming CXCR4+ cells, we inhibited SDF1 signaling using AMD3100, a bicyclam that is extensively used as a CXCR4-specific inhibitor (reviewed in De Clercq, 2003De Clercq E. The bicyclam AMD3100 story.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast to VEGF-induced animals harboring a saline-releasing pump where CXCR4 mRNA was abundantly present, CXCR4+-expressing cells could not be detected in the livers of VEGF-induced animals harboring an osmotic pump releasing AMD3100 (Figure S3B). Together, the data support a scenario where SDF1 functions downstream of VEGF to maintain these cells within the target organ. Ectopic expression of SDF1 in the noninduced liver, achieved via adenovirus-mediated delivery of SDF1 cDNA, was not sufficient for homing of CXCR4+ cells to the liver. Yet, ectopically expressed SDF1 partially prevented the loss of RBCCs already recruited to the liver by VEGF, a loss that would have otherwise taken place upon VEGF withdrawal (Figure S4). These findings suggest that SDF1 acts primarily as a RBCCs “retainer” and less, if at all, as a chemoattractant for these cells (see Discussion). We next wished to determine whether VEGF-instructed recruitment of RBCCs is an integral component of adult organ neovascularization and, specifically, to examine whether these imported cells are essential for efficient neovascularization. First, the potential of RBCCs to promote sprouting angiogenesis ex vivo was examined. When placed atop collagen-embedded mouse aortic segments, RBCCs isolated from the induced liver induced extensive sprouting at a magnitude that even exceeded that induced by a recombinant VEGF protein (Figure 5A and quantification in Figure 5B). To show that this is not a peculiarity of cells isolated from the liver, RBCCs summoned by VEGF to the heart and sim"

The 65 angstrom distance between the PAZ and RNase III domains matches the length spanned by 25 base pairs of RNA. Thus, Dicer itself is a molecular ruler that recognizes dsRNA and cleaves a specified distance from the helical end."

How do these cells orient over such a long distance and through complex territories? Here we show that neuroblast migration parallels cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. Beating of ependymal cilia is required for normal CSF flow, concentration gradient formation of CSF guidance molecules, and directional migration of neuroblasts. Results suggest that polarized epithelial cells contribute important vectorial information for guidance of young, migrating neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1970627802,"We have discovered a 716-hertz eclipsing binary radio pulsar in the globular cluster Terzan 5 using the Green Bank Telescope. It is the fastest spinning neutron star found to date, breaking the 24-year record held by the 642-hertz pulsar B1937+21. The difficulty in detecting this pulsar, because of its very low flux density and high eclipse fraction (∼40% of the orbit), suggests that even faster spinning neutron stars exist. If the pulsar has a mass less than twice the mass of the Sun, then its radius must be constrained by the spin rate to be &lt;16 kilometers. The short period of this pulsar also constrains models that suggest that gravitational radiation, through an r -mode (Rossby wave) instability, limits the maximum spin frequency of neutron stars."
https://openalex.org/W1973967768,"Axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (GABAergic) axo-axonic cells (AACs). The axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, AACs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. However, we found that AACs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic GABAergic inputs. Excitation and signal propagation initiated by AACs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon."
https://openalex.org/W2172097008,"Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) must cross the epithelium as they initiate infection, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains uncertain. The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a component of the tight junction and is inaccessible to virus approaching from the apical surface. Many CVBs also interact with the GPI-anchored protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Here, we report that virus attachment to DAF on the apical cell surface activates Abl kinase, triggering Rac-dependent actin rearrangements that permit virus movement to the tight junction. Within the junction, interaction with CAR promotes conformational changes in the virus capsid that are essential for virus entry and release of viral RNA. Interaction with DAF also activates Fyn kinase, an event that is required for the phosphorylation of caveolin and transport of virus into the cell within caveolar vesicles. CVBs thus exploit DAF-mediated signaling pathways to surmount the epithelial barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2169056802,"Understanding the regulation of human gene expression requires knowledge of the “second genetic code,” which consists of the binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) and the combinatorial code by which TF binding sites are assembled to form tissue-specific enhancer elements. Using a novel high-throughput method, we determined the DNA binding specificities of GLIs 1–3, Tcf4, and c-Ets1, which mediate transcriptional responses to the Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways. To identify mammalian enhancer elements regulated by these pathways on a genomic scale, we developed a computational tool, enhancer element locator (EEL). We show that EEL can be used to identify Hh and Wnt target genes and to predict activated TFs based on changes in gene expression. Predictions validated in transgenic mouse embryos revealed the presence of multiple tissue-specific enhancers in mouse c-Myc and N-Myc genes, which has implications for organ-specific growth control and tumor-type specificity of oncogenes.

Identifying mutations responsible for developmental defects and human diseases has made a major contribution to our understanding of biological processes. However, in part because protein-coding regions of genes present larger targets for mutagenesis than TF binding sequences, many genetic analyses are biased toward detecting mutations that affect the activity of proteins rather than the function of elements that regulate gene expression. Therefore, processes that depend on precise transcriptional control, such as regulation of cell proliferation, are presently relatively poorly understood. Cases where growth appears to be controlled in a tissue-specific manner have proven particularly resistant to genetic dissection. Open questions related to such tissue-specific growth control include regulation of organ size (Conlon and Raff, 1999Conlon I. Raff M. Size control in animal development.Cell. 1999; 96: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), the tissue specificity of growth-factor signals, and the tumor-type selectivity of oncogenes. It is well established that cell proliferation can be induced by oncogenic or growth-factor-activated TFs, such as GLI2 or Tcf4, whose activities are regulated by the Hh and Wnt signaling pathways, respectively (Bienz and Clevers, 2000Bienz M. Clevers H. Linking colorectal cancer to Wnt signaling.Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, Taipale and Beachy, 2001Taipale J. Beachy P.A. The Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways in cancer.Nature. 2001; 411: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). However, the conserved enhancer or promoter elements through which these TFs regulate the expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes in vivo are generally not known. Several reasons have made the identification of such elements difficult. First, the information about TF binding specificity is often incomplete, in part due to the difficulty of measuring affinities of large numbers of TFs to DNA using methods such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA; Fried and Crothers, 1981Fried M. Crothers D.M. Equilibria and kinetics of lac repressor-operator interactions by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar) or SELEX (Roulet et al., 2002Roulet E. Busso S. Camargo A.A. Simpson A.J. Mermod N. Bucher P. High-throughput SELEX SAGE method for quantitative modeling of transcription-factor binding sites.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Second, the identification of mammalian enhancer elements by computational or experimental methods has proven to be challenging. Genome-wide in silico analyses of conserved mammalian regulatory sequences have largely concentrated on untranslated regions of mRNAs (Xie et al., 2005Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M. Systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in human promoters and 3′ UTRs by comparison of several mammals.Nature. 2005; 434: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar) or promoter elements (Suzuki et al., 2004Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Shirota M. Sakakibara Y. Chiba J. Mizushima-Sugano J. Nakai K. Sugano S. Sequence comparison of human and mouse genes reveals a homologous block structure in the promoter regions.Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1711-1718Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, Xie et al., 2005Xie X. Lu J. Kulbokas E.J. Golub T.R. Mootha V. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kellis M. Systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in human promoters and 3′ UTRs by comparison of several mammals.Nature. 2005; 434: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), ∼1–3 kb sequences located immediately upstream of the transcription start site. However, the enhancer elements that control promoter activity are often located quite far from the transcription start site (> > 10 kb). A single promoter can be regulated by one or many relatively short (∼1 kb) enhancer modules, which are activated by binding of multiple TFs. If multiple enhancer modules regulate one promoter, the corresponding gene is expressed in all tissues where one or more of the enhancer elements are active, and thus the expression pattern of a gene reflects the combined activity of all the enhancer modules that are capable of activating its transcription (reviewed in Michelson, 2002Michelson A.M. Deciphering genetic regulatory codes: a challenge for functional genomics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 546-548Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whereas in silico methods efficiently identify enhancer modules in Drosophila (Michelson, 2002Michelson A.M. Deciphering genetic regulatory codes: a challenge for functional genomics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 546-548Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), mammalian enhancer prediction on a genomic scale has not been possible due to the higher complexity of mammalian genomes. Experimentally, individual mammalian enhancer elements regulating a particular gene can be identified by locating genomic sequences that direct tissue-specific expression of marker genes in transgenic embryos (Spitz et al., 2003Spitz F. Gonzalez F. Duboule D. A global control region defines a chromosomal regulatory landscape containing the HoxD cluster.Cell. 2003; 113: 405-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), followed by progressive deletion of these sequences, often aided by analysis of conservation of the sequences in multiple species. However, this is a difficult and time-consuming process that is not easily adaptable for genome-wide studies. In this work, we have developed a high-throughput method for TF binding specificity analysis and a novel computational tool, EEL, for the identification of mammalian enhancer elements, which allows genome-wide analysis of human distal enhancer elements. We have further applied these enabling technologies to the identification of target genes of developmental signaling pathways and to the analysis of regulation of two central growth-regulatory genes in mammals, c-Myc and N-Myc. To allow rapid and accurate analysis of TF binding specificities, we developed a high-throughput method that directly determines the relative affinities of a TF to different DNA sequences. For this purpose, we fused the DNA binding domains of all GLI family TFs (GLI1, 2, and 3 and the Drosophila GLI ortholog Ci) to Renilla reniformis luciferase. We next expressed the GLI-Renilla fusion proteins, incubated them with biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence with the highest affinity to GLIs (consensus sequence), and measured the luciferase activity captured on a streptavidin plate. Competing this reaction with different unlabeled oligonucleotides (Figure 1A) allowed determination of the relative affinity of the GLI proteins to all possible single-base substitutions (Liu and Clarke, 2002Liu X. Clarke N.D. Rationalization of gene regulation by a eukaryotic transcription factor: calculation of regulatory region occupancy from predicted binding affinities.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 1-8Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to the consensus sequence (Figures 1B and D). The affinities from the binding assay were consistent with results from an EMSA assay (Figure 1C). We next made similar binding-affinity tables for Tcf4 and c-Ets1 (Figure 1D; see also Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), which are regulated by Wnt and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways, respectively. Relative affinities obtained using our assay were consistent with the crystal structure of GLI1 bound to its consensus sequence (Pavletich and Pabo, 1993Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Crystal structure of a five-finger GLI-DNA complex: new perspectives on zinc fingers.Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), published biologically relevant binding sites of GLI and Tcf/LEF TF families, and the known semiquantitative DNA binding preference of c-Ets1 (see Table S1). To identify conserved enhancer elements regulated by GLI and Tcf4, we developed a novel local (Smith and Waterman, 1981Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. Identification of common molecular subsequences.J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (6718) Google Scholar) alignment algorithm, enhancer element locator (EEL), that aligns the sequence (i.e., order) of TF binding sites found on two orthologous DNA sequences from two species (Figure 2A). The DNA sequence is not directly used in the alignment because only a fraction of all nucleotides in mammalian genomes code for high-affinity TF binding sites and because multiple DNA sequences can code for the same site. Our approach is thus conceptually similar to aligning peptide sequences instead of the corresponding DNA sequence and should similarly result in increased specificity and sensitivity. The scoring scheme of EEL takes into account TF binding-site clustering, affinity, and conservation (Figure 2A; see Supplemental Data for details). A negative score is given for increased distance between adjacent conserved TF binding sites, and a positive score is given for conserved TF binding sites on the basis of their total relative affinities. Assessing true affinities of TF binding sites to DNA is difficult because binding of TFs to DNA is often cooperative, and sequences that by themselves bind only weakly to a particular TF can be occupied and biologically relevant in vivo due to increased affinity caused by secondary interactions between TFs or between the TF and other proteins. Because these secondary interactions cannot be modeled using current data, we included correction factors that describe the maximum loss of free energy caused by loss of secondary interactions due to an insertion of sequence between the adjacent TF binding sites. The correction is based on the energy required for twisting and/or compressing the two DNAs of unequal length into structures that would allow similar 3D positions for both pairs of TFs. An important feature of EEL is that all TFs loaded to the program are treated equally, allowing simultaneous identification of a large number of conserved sites for different TFs. Subsequently, the alignments containing specific TF binding sites can be selected from this general analysis. We first tested EEL by determining whether it could identify enhancer elements in the best characterized gene that is regulated by multiple enhancers, Drosophila even-skipped (eve) (Berman et al., 2002Berman B.P. Nibu Y. Pfeiffer B.D. Tomancak P. Celniker S.E. Levine M. Rubin G.M. Eisen M.B. Exploiting transcription factor binding site clustering to identify cis-regulatory modules involved in pattern formation in the Drosophila genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 757-762Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar, Small et al., 1996Small S. Blair A. Levine M. Regulation of two pair-rule stripes by a single enhancer in the Drosophila embryo.Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Analyzing eve genomic sequences of D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura with EEL using published binding-affinity matrices (Berman et al., 2002Berman B.P. Nibu Y. Pfeiffer B.D. Tomancak P. Celniker S.E. Levine M. Rubin G.M. Eisen M.B. Exploiting transcription factor binding site clustering to identify cis-regulatory modules involved in pattern formation in the Drosophila genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 757-762Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar) for the five known TFs that regulate eve, we could identify all four known enhancer elements that control the segmental expression of eve in Drosophila embryos (Figures 2B and 2C). To adapt EEL for the more complex vertebrate genomes, we optimized the parameters of the penalty function by a greedy hill-climbing procedure (see Supplemental Data) using 107 binding profiles obtained by combining our own analyses with high-quality TF binding profiles available in the literature and in the JASPAR2 database (see Tables S1 and S2 and Sandelin et al., 2004Sandelin A. Alkema W. Engstrom P. Wasserman W.W. Lenhard B. JASPAR: an open-access database for eukaryotic transcription factor binding profiles.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D91-D94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Optimization resulted in relatively large penalties for differences in distance and angle, consistent with the initial hypothesis on the importance of the secondary interactions for TF binding. We next tested EEL on a classic example of a distal enhancer in mammals, the −20 kb enhancer of MyoD (Goldhamer et al., 1995Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Embryonic activation of the myoD gene is regulated by a highly conserved distal control element.Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The highest scoring cis-module resulting from the alignment of 50 kb mouse and human MyoD sequences was located to another gene 3′ of MyoD, the second was the −20 kb distal enhancer of MyoD, and the third was in the MyoD coding region (Figure 2D). These results indicate that EEL can also identify mammalian distal enhancers. To predict enhancers genome-wide, we performed an EEL alignment of all 20,173 homologous human-mouse gene pairs (17,429 human genes with their 20,173 mouse orthologs from the ENSEMBL database). The aligned sequences included the genomic sequences from first to last exon and 100 kb of flanking sequence in both directions. The results were placed in a relational database containing information about the aligned regions, predicted enhancer modules, and conserved TF binding sites (Figure 3A). This database was subsequently used to determine the frequency of conserved binding sites for all of the 107 TFs used in the alignment (Figure 3B, top panel). To test whether the genome-wide data could be used to determine which TFs are activated in an experiment based on gene-expression data, we also determined frequencies of all 107 TF sites in predicted enhancer elements of 13 genes whose expression is induced in the colon of mice after inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor (Sansom et al., 2004Sansom O.J. Reed K.R. Hayes A.J. Ireland H. Brinkmann H. Newton I.P. Batlle E. Simon-Assmann P. Clevers H. Nathke I.S. et al.Loss of Apc in vivo immediately perturbs Wnt signaling, differentiation, and migration.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1385-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The second most overrepresented TF site in the flanking regions of these genes was Tcf4 (Figure 3B), which is known to be activated by the loss of APC (Bienz and Clevers, 2000Bienz M. Clevers H. Linking colorectal cancer to Wnt signaling.Cell. 2000; 103: 311-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). With an even higher confidence value, a pair of Tcf4 sites were identified as the most overrepresented pair of the same binding sites in individual enhancer elements of the APC target genes (Figure 3B; p = 0.00083; 92% confidence after correction for multiple hypothesis testing). We also performed similar analyses for all possible TF site pairs, identifying Tcf4+Tcf4 as the second most overrepresented pair (Figure 3C; Table S2). These results validate the biological relevance of our TF binding-specificity assay and indicate that genome-wide EEL results can be used to identify activated TFs on the basis of expression-profiling data. To further validate EEL through unbiased genome-wide analysis of its predictions and to test the feasibility of identifying conserved target genes of developmental signaling pathways in silico, we performed pairwise genome-wide EEL alignments of human genes to orthologous rat, chicken, and pufferfish genes (Figure 4A). Similarly to in the human-to-mouse analysis, all the 107 TF sites were included in these alignments. Since the presence of two binding sites for the same factor resulted in the highest confidence values in the analysis described above (Figure 3B), we selected elements that contained a minimum of two GLI binding sites of combined relative affinity score of 25 or more, were shorter than 2000 bp, and had an EEL alignment score higher than 500. As few clusters of multiple conserved GLI sites are found in the genome, this high an EEL score requires the presence of multiple conserved sites for other TFs in the predicted element. Using mouse-to-human alignment alone, a total of 42 elements met these criteria. Two out of three (p = 8.8 × 10−5) in vivo-validated direct GLI targets (Table S3; Figure 4B, red typeface; see Supplemental Data for standards of evidence) contained such an element in their aligned regions. These were the two known marker genes for GLI activity, GLI1 and PTCH1 (Ingham and McMahon, 2001Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Hedgehog signaling in animal development: paradigms and principles.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar, Taipale and Beachy, 2001Taipale J. Beachy P.A. The Hedgehog and Wnt signalling pathways in cancer.Nature. 2001; 411: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar), which are induced by Hh ligands in all tissues examined. The predicted enhancer of PTCH1 was the same one that was identified previously (Agren et al., 2004Agren M. Kogerman P. Kleman M.I. Wessling M. Toftgard R. Expression of the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene is regulated by alternative promoters and a single functional Gli-binding site.Gene. 2004; 330: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), containing one high-affinity and one lower-affinity GLI site, an arrangement which is potentially important in graded responses to Hh. Of the 42 elements, 7 were also conserved in the human-to-rat alignment (Figure 4B, blue and red diamonds). Only one element with two GLI sites was also conserved in chicken (Figure 4B, red diamond), and none was conserved in pufferfish. To further validate the predictions, we analyzed the expression pattern of a subset of the predicted genes and enhancers. During early embryogenesis, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expressed by the notochord and floor plate (see Figure 4C) is important for the patterning of the ventral neural tube and the sclerotome and epaxial myotome of the somites (Chiang et al., 1996Chiang C. Litingtung Y. Lee E. Young K.E. Corden J.L. Westphal H. Beachy P.A. Cyclopia and defective axial patterning in mice lacking Sonic hedgehog gene function.Nature. 1996; 383: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar, Wijgerde et al., 2002Wijgerde M.

A direct requirement for Hedgehog signaling for normal specification of all ventral progenitor domains in the presumptive mammalian spinal cord.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2849-2864Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Shh is also characteristically expressed in the endoderm (Figure 4C) and posterior margin of the developing limb buds and at later stages in whisker (E12.5) and hair (E14.5) follicles. Target genes of Shh are expressed in some cases in most or all responding cells (e.g., PTCH1; Figure 4D) but more commonly are restricted to particular Shh-responsive tissues at specific developmental stages (e.g., Tbx2 and FoxF1; Figures 4E and 4F), consistent with the ability of Hh proteins to induce diverse cellular responses during development (for review, see Ingham and McMahon, 2001Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Hedgehog signaling in animal development: paradigms and principles.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the expression pattern of predicted Shh target genes that were located close to 16 conserved enhancer elements having high GLI affinity scores (see Table S3 for details). Ten genes were expressed at the analyzed stage in a relatively restricted pattern. Five expression patterns were consistent with regulation by Shh: Three corresponded to previously known Shh targets (PTCH1, Tbx2, and FoxF1) and two to genes whose regulation by Shh has not been reported. Of these, GPC3 was expressed in the sclerotome of the somites (Figure 4H) and SOX13 in the ventral neural tube (Figure 4G; see Table S9 for overview). To test whether the predicted sequences functioned as enhancer elements, we assessed their ability to direct LacZ marker-gene expression to specific tissues of transgenic mouse embryos. Three of four highest scoring (see Table S8) predicted Shh-regulated enhancer elements analyzed directed LacZ expression into tissues that are specified by Shh. Enhancer from PRDM10 drove expression in ventral neural tube (6 of 6 LacZ-positive embryos; Figure 4I); NM_018271 drove expression in ventral neural tube, whisker follicles, and posterior aspect of limb buds (5 of 6 embryos; Figure 4J); and enhancer from glypican3 (GPC3) specifically directed marker-gene expression into sclerotomally derived tissues (vertebral cartilage primordia, 6 of 6 embryos; Figure 4K; at E12.5, GPC3 is expressed in a similar pattern [Pellegrini et al., 1998Pellegrini M. Pilia G. Pantano S. Lucchini F. Uda M. Fumi M. Cao A. Schlessinger D. Forabosco A. Gpc3 expression correlates with the phenotype of the Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome.Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar]). Although all of the enhancer elements tested (Figures 4I–4K) had two GLI binding sites with similar affinity (Table S3), the specific tissues into which they directed expression were different, indicating that the other TF binding sites in the enhancer modules critically restrict expression to particular tissues. Similar analysis of Tcf4-regulated genes based on the human-to-mouse alignment identified 132 predicted enhancer elements. One of these elements was in aligned regions of AXIN2, one of the three known direct Tcf/LEF target genes that have been validated by enhancer analysis in vivo in transgenic mice (Figure 5A, red typeface; Table S4). A total of six elements (4.5%) were located close to other reported Tcf4-inducible target genes, including LEF-1, LMX1A, c-Met, CDX2, and c-Myc (Figure 5A; Table S4). Elements located close to reported Tcf4 target genes were further enriched among the predictions if only elements conserved also in rat (8.5%; 5 of 59) or both rat and chick (14%; 2 of 14) were considered (Figure 5A). We next assessed whether the predicted genes were expressed in a pattern consistent with Wnt regulation. At E9.5, Wnt3, Wnt5A (Figure 5B), Wnt5B, and many Wnt target genes (e.g., AXIN2; Figure 5C) are expressed in the tail bud, a structure whose formation depends on Wnt signals (Huelsken et al., 2000Huelsken J. Vogel R. Brinkmann V. Erdmann B. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Requirement for beta-catenin in anterior-posterior axis formation in mice.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Wnts are also required for the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the developing limbs (Barrow et al., 2003Barrow J.R. Thomas K.R. Boussadia-Zahui O. Moore R. Kemler R. Capecchi M.R. McMahon A.P. Ectodermal Wnt3/beta-catenin signaling is required for the establishment and maintenance of the apical ectodermal ridge.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Twelve predicted Wnt target genes analyzed that were located close to 25 conserved enhancer elements with high Tcf4 affinity scores (Table S4) were expressed at E9.5 in a specific pattern. Expression patterns of five genes that had previously not been characterized as Wnt targets were clearly consistent with Wnt regulation. Of these, four were expressed in the tail bud (Figures 5D–5G) and one in the AER (Figures 5H and 5I). Four additional genes, including a known Wnt target (LEF1), had somewhat more general expression patterns with markedly elevated expression in the tail (Figure S3). It is interesting to note that several genes that are known to be induced by Shh and/or Wnt also contained enhancer elements having both a conserved GLI and Tcf4 sites, raising the possibility that these genes may be involved in integration of Hh and Wnt signals during development (Figure 5J; Table S5). Finally, we tested the practical utility of EEL in dissecting biological problems by applying it to the analysis of organ-specific growth control. For this purpose, we analyzed whether the expression of a central family of growth-regulatory genes, the Myc genes, is under the control of multiple tissue-specific enhancer elements. We first analyzed the predicted Tcf4-regulated enhancer on the c-Myc gene. c-Myc is a known target of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer (He et al., 1998He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Identification of c-MYC as a target of the APC pathway.Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar), and its expression in vivo appears to depend on distal elements that have not been identified (Lavenu et al., 1994Lavenu A. Pournin S. Babinet C. Morello D. The cis-acting elements known to regulate c-myc expression ex vivo are not sufficient for correct transcription in vivo.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 527-536PubMed Google Scholar). EEL predicted several conserved enhancer elements for the c-Myc locus, two of which (CM3 and CM5) contained conserved Tcf4 sites (Figure 6A). CM3 directed marker-gene expression into the ventral aspect of the neural tube and in the eye (4 of 5 LacZ+ embryos; Figures 6B, 6D, and 6E). CM5, in turn, drove expression in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia (7 of 8 embryos; Figures 6C and 6F; compare to Schmid et al., 1989Schmid P. Schulz W.A. Hameister H. Dynamic expression pattern of the myc protooncogene in midgestation mouse embryos.Science. 1989; 243: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Hh-GLI pathway induces the expression of N-Myc, which encodes a protein that functions similarly to c-Myc. Induction of N-Myc is critical for Shh-induced cell proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs; Kenney et al., 2003Kenney A.M. Cole M.D. Rowitch D.H.

Multiple predicted enhancer modules were identified in the N-Myc locus (Figure 7A), two of which (CM5 and CM7) contained GLI binding sites conserved in human, chimpanzee, and rat. At E12.5, the predicted enhancer located in the second intron (CM7) drove expression specifically in the maxillary arch derivatives, including mouth (Figure 7B), and in the developing tooth buds (6 of 7 embryos; Figure 7E). The pattern of expression in the tooth placode is localized to regions where Shh is specifically expressed and acts as a mitogen (Cobourne et al., 2001Cobourne M.T. Hardcastle Z. Sharpe P.T. Sonic hedgehog regulates epithelial proliferation and cell survival in the developing tooth germ.J. Dent.

The optical spectrum shows a rich pattern of level anticrossings and crossings that can be understood as a superposition of charge and spin configurations of the two dots. Coulomb interactions shift the molecular resonance of the optically excited state (charged exciton) with respect to the ground state (single charge), enabling light-induced coupling of the quantum dots. This result demonstrates the possibility of optically coupling quantum dots for application in quantum information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2069243189,"Long-lasting forms of memory require protein synthesis, but how the pattern of synthesis is related to the storage of a memory has not been determined. Here we show that neural activity directs the mRNA of the Drosophila Ca(2+), Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II (CaMKII), to postsynaptic sites, where it is rapidly translated. These features of CaMKII synthesis are recapitulated during the induction of a long-term memory and produce patterns of local protein synthesis specific to the memory. We show that mRNA transport and synaptic protein synthesis are regulated by components of the RISC pathway, including the SDE3 helicase Armitage, which is specifically required for long-lasting memory. Armitage is localized to synapses and lost in a memory-specific pattern that is inversely related to the pattern of synaptic protein synthesis. Therefore, we propose that degradative control of the RISC pathway underlies the pattern of synaptic protein synthesis associated with a stable memory."

In alumina, grain boundaries play a key role in deformation mechanisms, particularly in the phenomenon of grain boundary sliding during creep at high temperatures. We elucidated the atomic-scale structure in alumina grain boundaries and its relationship to the suppression of creep upon doping with yttrium by using atomic resolution microscopy and high-precision calculations. We find that the yttrium segregates to very localized regions along the grain boundary and alters the local bonding environment, thereby strengthening the boundary against mechanical creep."

Here we report on the identification of plastoglobule proteins using mass spectrometry methods in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate specific plastoglobule association of members of the plastid lipid-associated proteins/fibrillin family as well as known metabolic enzymes, including the tocopherol cyclase (VTE1), a key enzyme of tocopherol (vitamin E) synthesis. Moreover, comparative analysis of chloroplast membrane fractions shows that plastoglobules are a site of vitamin E accumulation in chloroplasts.

At least two PAP/fibrillins were localized at the periphery of plastoglobules (3Kessler F. Schnell D. Blobel G.

Upregulation of several PAP/fibrillins has been correlated with various treatments generating reactive oxygen species (20Gillet B. Beyly A. Peltier G. Rey P.

Biochem. 1999; 37: 305-312Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), nitrogen starvation (34Bondada B.R. Syvertsen J.P. Tree Physiol. 2003; 23: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), or hypersalinity (35Locy R.D. Chang C.C. Nielsen B.L. Singh N.K. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations implicate plastoglobules in stress tolerance. In addition to a role in plastid lipid storage and a possible involvement in stress tolerance, plastoglobules may have other functions in chloroplasts. The presence of yet-unidentified proteins of plastoglobules (3Kessler F. Schnell D. Blobel G. Planta. 1999; 208: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) supports this idea. To identify candidate plastoglobule proteins we used mass spectrometry methods. We found structural proteins of the PAP/fibrillin family as well as metabolic enzymes. In particular, we show that VTE1 (tocopherol cyclase) is localized at plastoglobules and demonstrate that plastoglobules are a site of vitamin E accumulation in chloroplasts. The results imply that plastoglobules do not only store vitamin E but actively participate in its synthesis. Isolation and Fractionation of Intact Chloroplasts—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 6-8-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia 2) plants grown on soil under short days (8 h light) and standard conditions (130 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, 20-22 °C, 80% relative air humidity) according to the protocol described in Hiltbrunner et al. (36Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts corresponding to 40 or 60 mg of chlorophyll were hypertonically lysed in 0.6 m sucrose. To prevent proteolytic degradation, 0.5% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture for plant cell extracts (Sigma) was added to the lysate. The stroma was separated from total membranes by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 45% sucrose in TED buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) using a Potter homogenizer. Total membrane fraction (corresponding to 20-30 mg of chlorophyll) was then overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 6 ml of 38% sucrose, 6 ml of 20% sucrose, 4 ml of 15% sucrose, and 8 ml of 5% sucrose in TED buffer and centrifuged for 17 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C (SW28Ti rotor, Beckman Instruments). 1-ml fractions were collected starting from the top of the gradient. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Plastoglobule-containing fraction 1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with silver nitrate (modified from Blum et al. (37Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar). Visible protein bands were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digest, essentially as described (38Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Before identification by mass spectrometry, tryptic peptides were separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a C18 resin. Peptides were separated on laboratory-made silica capillary columns with an inner diameter of 75 μm (length 8 cm). Five μl of peptides resolved in buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid, or 0.5% acetic acid in Millipore water) were loaded onto the column and eluted with an increasing concentration of acetonitrile (buffer B: 0.5% formic acid or 0.5% acetic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min. Complex peptide mixtures were separated by increasing the acetonitrile concentration from 5 to 65% over 2 h followed by an increase of up to 85% for an additional 15 min. For less complex mixtures a shorter gradient of 40 plus 10 min was developed. Reversed phase liquid chromatography was coupled online to an LCQDecaXP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray source. Analysis was performed in the positive ion mode, and peptides were ionized with a spray voltage of 2.1-2.8 kV and analyzed by one MS full scan and four data dependent MS/MS scans of the four most intense parent ions. The dynamic exclusion function was enabled to allow two measurements of the same parent ion for 1 min followed by exclusion duration of 1 min (39Shabanowitz J. Settlage R.E. Marto J.A. Christian R.E.

MS/MS data were interpreted by the SEQUEST software (Thermo Finnigan) searching the data against either the A. thaliana protein data base or the NCBI non-redundant protein data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Cysteines were allowed to be either unmodified or carboxy-amidomethylated. Protein identification was accepted if two different peptides exceeded an Xcorr value of 2.5 and a ΔCn (change in correlation normalized) value of 0.1. Transient Expression of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), CFP, and YFP Fusion Proteins in A. thaliana Protoplasts—AtPGL35 and AtPGL34 cDNA clones (U16632 and U15686, respectively) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Centre (www.arabidopsis.org/abrc). All other cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcription-PCR performed on RNA extracted from leaves. Complete coding sequences excluding the stop codon were amplified by PCR using 5′ and 3′ primers including NcoI (or XbaI and BspHI) sites (AtPGL30.4, 5′-TTC CAT GCC ATG GCG ACT TCT TCT ACT TTC-3′,5′-GCC ATG CCA TGG CAG CAA TGA CGA ATA CCC-3′; AtPGL34, 5′-CAT GCC ATG GCA TTG ATC CAA CAT GG-3′, 5′-CAT GCC ATG GCA CTG TTG TAT TCA AGA TTC TCT ACA AC-3′; AtPGL35, 5′-CAT GCC ATG GCG ACG GTA CCA TTG-3′, 5′-CAT GCC ATG GCA GGG TTT AAG AGA GAG CTT CCT TC-3′; AtAOS, 5′-TCC ATG CCA TGG CTT CTA TTT CAA CC-3′, 5′-CCA TGC CAT GGC AAA GCT AGC TTT CCT TAA C-3′; AtFBA1, 5′-GTC TAG TCT AGA ATG GCG TCA AGC ACT GCG-3′, 5′-CAA ATC ATG AGG TAG GTG TAG CCT TTT AC-3′; AtFBA2, 5′-CCT AGT CTA GAA TGG CAT CAA CCT CAC TCC-3′,5′-TCA TTC ATG AGA TAG GTG TAC CCT TTG ACG-3′; AtVTE1, 5′-TCC ATG CCA TGG AGA TAC GGA GCT TG-3′, 5′-CCA TGC CAT GGC CAG ACC CGG TGG CTT GAA G-3′). PCR products were ligated into the NcoI (or XbaI and NcoI) sites of pCL60 (40Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), resulting in C-terminal GFP fusions under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and the nos terminator. For co-localization in protoplasts, AtPGL35, AtVTE1, and AtFBA2 coding sequences were cloned in pCL62 or pCL61. pCL62 and pCL61 (Dr. Andreas Hiltbrunner, Institute for Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg) are derivatives from pCL60 with CFP or YFP replacing GFP, respectively. A. thaliana Col. 2 plants used for protoplast isolation were grown for 3-4 weeks on 0.5× Murashige-Skoog medium under long day conditions (16 h light). Transient transformation of protoplasts was done using the polyethylene glycol method as described (41Jin J.B. Kim Y.A. Kim S.J. Lee S.H. Kim D.H. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1511-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) but reducing cellulase and macerozyme (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) concentrations to 1% and 0.25% (w/v), respectively. Fluorescence in transformed protoplasts was monitored 48 to 80 h after transformation by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The fluorescein isothiocyanate (488 nm) laser line from a Leica TCS 4D microscope (Leica Microsystems, Glattbrugg, Switzerland) was used to detect GFP. For double fluorescent experiments, CFP and YFP were detected sequentially using 458- and 514-nm laser lines as well as 460-510- and 520-588-nm detection windows from a Leica SP2 AOBS microscope. Chlorophyll autofluorescence was monitored using either 594-nm or TRITC (568-nm) excitation wavelengths. Protein Analysis—Total proteins were isolated from Arabidopsis leaves according to Rensink et al. (42Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Protoplasts transiently expressing GFP, CFP, and YFP fusion proteins were centrifuged for 1 min at 100 × g and resuspended by vortexing in extraction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplied with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P9599). Proteins were concentrated by chloroform-methanol precipitation (43Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and either stained by silver nitrate or blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane for immunodetection.

Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and AtPGL35 (this paper). Chlorophyll concentration was determined by the method of Arnon (47Arnon D. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and proteins were quantified following the Bradford method (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization in Protoplasts—Immunolocalization in isolated protoplasts was performed as described in Matsui et al. (49Matsui M. Stoop C.D. von Arnim A.G. Wei N. Deng X.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4239-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Protoplasts were fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde in W5 buffer (154 mm NaCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1.5 mm MES, pH 5.6) and permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 in W5. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:50 (v/v, anti-CAB serum) and to 15 ng/μl (anti-AtTOC159 and anti-AtPGL35). Slides were mounted in SlowFade solution (Molecular Probes, Basel, Switzerland), and fluorescence of the fluorescein-coupled secondary antibody (Pierce) was monitored by confocal scanning microscopy using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (488 nm) laser line from a Leica TCS 4D microscope (Leica Microsystems). Preparation of Anti-AtPGL35 Antibody—The coding sequence of AtPGL35 was subcloned from pCL60-AtPGL35 (see above) in pET21d-H6. pET21d-H6 was obtained by digesting pET21d (Novagen) with NcoI and EcoRI and inserting a hexahistidine tag in-frame with the NcoI site using the primers 5′-CAT GGG TCA CCA TCA CCA TCA CCA TTA ACT GCA GG-3′ and 5′-AAT TCC TGC AGT TAA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA CC-3′. The full-length precursor protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) and purified under denaturing conditions by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbit (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) and were affinity-purified against recombinant AtPGL35 coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Electron Microscopy and Immunocytochemistry—Cotyledons from 5-day-old A. thaliana (Landsberg erecta) plants grown on MS-sucrose (Murashige and Skoog medium plus sucrose) medium were excised and transferred to aluminum sample holders, cryo-protected with 150 mm sucrose, and frozen in a Baltec HPM 010 high pressure freezer (Technotrade, Manchester, NH). Samples were then freeze-substituted in 2% OsO4 in anhydrous acetone at -80 °C for 5 days followed by slow warming to room temperature over a period of 2 days, removed from the holders, and infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Epon (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). Polymerization was carried out at 60 °C for 2 days under vacuum. For protein immunogold labeling, the high pressure frozen samples were substituted in 0.2% uranyl acetate plus 0.25% glutaraldehyde in acetone at -80 °C for 5 days and warmed to -60 °C for 18 h. After several acetone rinses, samples were removed from the holders and slowly infiltrated at -60 °C with Lowicryl HM20 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) for 1 day each in 10, 25, and 75 HM20 in anhydrous acetone. For 3 more days, 100% HM20 was used and was replaced with freshly made resin every 8 h. Finally, samples were polymerized at -60 °C under UV light for 72 h. Freeze substitution, embedding, and resin polymerization were carried out under controlled time and temperature conditions in a Leica AFS system (Vienna, Austria). Immunocytochemistry—Samples embedded in Lowicryl HM20 were sectioned into 100-nm-thick sections and placed on Formvar-coated gold slot grids. Immunocytochemistry was performed essentially as described (50Otegui M.S. Mastronarde D.N. Kang B.H. Bednarek S.Y. Staehelin L.A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2033-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were blocked for 20 min with a 5% (w/v) solution of nonfat milk in TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Primary anti-AtPGL35 and anti-AtVTE1 antibodies were diluted 1:20 in a solution of 2.5% nonfat milk in TBST at room temperature for 1 h. The sections were rinsed in a stream of TBS plus 0.5% Tween 20 and then transferred to the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10-nm gold particles, 1:20 in TBST) for 1 h. Control procedures were performed by omitting the primary antibody. Tocopherol and Fatty Acid Analysis—For tocopherol and fatty acid analysis, fractions of sucrose gradient were pooled as follows; fractions 1-4 (referred to as plastoglobule fraction), 5-13 (referred to as in between fraction), 14-18 (referred to as outer envelope membrane/thylakoid fraction), 19-26 (referred to as outer-inner envelope membrane/thylakoid fraction), and 27-31 (thylakoid/envelope membrane fraction). Tocopherol was extracted with diethyl ether and quantified by normal phase fluorescence HPLC using tocol as internal standard (51Thompson J.N. Hatina G. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1979; 2: 327-344Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions were acidified by adding ½ volume of 1 m KCl, 0.2 n H3PO4, and lipids were extracted 3 times with 2 volumes each of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic phases were combined, and the solvent was evaporated in a nitrogen gas stream. Fatty acids were quantified by gas chromatography with pentadecanoic acid (15:0) as the internal standard according to Browse et al. (52Browse J. McCourt P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Characterization of an Arabidopsis Plastoglobule Marker Protein— We have previously identified PG1 (plastoglobulin 1) as a major protein associated with plastoglobules in pea (3Kessler F. Schnell D. Blobel G. Planta. 1999; 208: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, 13 proteins share sequence similarity with pea PG1, constituting the family of PAP/fibrillin proteins as described by Laizet et al. (23Laizet Y. Pontier D. Mache R. Kuntz M. J. Genome Sci. Technol. 2004; 3: 19-28Crossref Google Scholar). Because PAP and FIB have already been defined by the International Arabidopsis community (TAIR; www.arabidopsis.org) as standing for phosphatidic acid phosphatase and fibrillarin, respectively, we propose to abbreviate Arabidopsis PAP/fibrillins as plastoglobulin (PGL). To obtain a marker for Arabidopsis plastoglobules, we produced affinity-purified antibodies against a recombinant Arabidopsis protein AtPGL35 (At4g04020), highly similar to pea PG1. In a total protein extract of Arabidopsis leaves, the anti-AtPGL35 antibodies recognized a single band (Fig. 1A) of the expected mass (∼35 kDa). Immunogold electron microscopy was used to localize AtPGL35 in 1-week-old Arabidopsis cotyledons (Fig. 1B). Labeling was restricted to chloroplasts. Gold particles were detected at the periphery of negatively stained plastoglobules but were absent from thylakoid or envelope membranes. No labeling was found in control experiments where affinity-purified anti-AtPGL35 antibody was omitted (data not shown). The data indicate that AtPGL35 is associated with plastoglobules. The anti-AtPGL35 antibody gave dot-like fluorescence in immunofluorescence experiments using fixed protoplasts (Fig. 1C). The fluorescent dots are consistent with the immunofluorescent labeling of plastoglobules. Control antibodies against AtTOC159 (At3g46740) and CAB resulted in rim-like fluorescence at the envelope or fluorescence at the thylakoids, respectively. Isolation of A. thaliana Plastoglobules—We have previously described the isolation by flotation centrifugation of plastoglobules from pea chloroplasts (3Kessler F. Schnell D. Blobel G. Planta. 1999; 208: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we adapted the method to isolate plastoglobules from Arabidopsis chloroplasts. Total membranes of isolated chloroplasts were separated from stromal proteins by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. To separate plastoglobules from chloroplast membranes, the membrane pellet was resuspended in a 45% sucrose solution and overlaid with a sucrose step gradient consisting of 38, 20, 15, and 5% sucrose solutions and centrifuged overnight at 100,000 × g. This resulted in an apparent separation of membrane fractions (Fig. 2A) corresponding to broad and partially overlapping peaks of marker proteins in Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2C). Antibodies against the CAB protein gave strong signals in fractions 19-31 (Fig. 2C), indicating the presence of thylakoid membranes in the high density 45 and 38% sucrose steps. Weaker CAB signals in fractions 1-13 were most likely due to a minor presence of highly abundant thylakoid membranes. The RuBisCO large subunit was detected in the stromal fraction and more weakly in fractions 21-31, indicating the absence of stromal contamination in the lower density fractions. AtTOC75, a protein of the outer envelope membrane, was detected in fractions 11-31. Similarly, the inner envelope membrane protein AtTIC110 (At1g06950) was detected in fractions 19-29 (Fig. 2C). The lower density fractions 1-9 contained no detectable envelope membranes. The sucrose density (20-38%) of fractions 15-23 is consistent with the presence of envelope membranes (53Schnell D.J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). AtPGL35 was present mostly in fractions 1-11, separated from the CAB, AtTIC110, and AtTOC75 peak fractions, indicating the isolation of plastoglobules. Moreover, the sucrose density (5 and 15%) of fractions 1-11 as well as the creamy-turbid appearance of fractions at the top of the gradient (Fig. 2A) are consistent with plastoglobules (3Kessler F. Schnell D. Blobel G. Planta. 1999; 208: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Greenwood A.D. Leech R.M. Williams J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

Notably, separate peaks of the plastoglobule marker protein AtPLG35 in fractions 1-5 and 9-11 (5 and 15% sucrose steps) suggest the existence of plastoglobule populations of different densities, as previously reported (13Legget Bailey J. Whyborn A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 163-174Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Identification of Plastoglobule Candidate Proteins—To identify proteins associated with plastoglobules, the low density fraction 1 (5% sucrose step) was separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2D) and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Tryptic peptides were extracted and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The results of two replicate experiments are presented in Table 1. Protein identification was accepted if two different peptides exceeded an Xcorr value of 2.5 and a DCn value of 0.1. Only under this condition were the peptides counted, giving a total of peptides for each identified protein. 43 proteins were identified, 40 of which are nuclear encoded. All but two of the 40 proteins are predicted by the targetP softwa"
https://openalex.org/W2041652145,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) coordinates mitosis and G1 by sequentially promoting the degradation of key cell-cycle regulators. Following the degradation of its substrates in G1, the APC catalyzes the autoubiquitination of its E2 UbcH10. This stabilizes cyclin A and allows it to inactivate APC(Cdh1). How the APC establishes this complex temporal sequence of ubiquitinations, referred to as substrate ordering, is not understood. Here we show that substrate ordering depends on the relative processivity of substrate multiubiquitination by the APC. Processive substrates obtain ubiquitin chains in a single APC binding event. The multiubiquitination of distributive substrates requires multiple rounds of APC binding, which render it sensitive to lower APC concentrations, competition by processive substrates, and deubiquitination. Consequently, more processive substrates are preferentially multiubiquitinated in vitro and degraded earlier in vivo. The processivity of multiubiquitination is strongly influenced by the D box within the substrate, suggesting that substrate ordering is established by a mechanism intrinsic to APC and its substrates and similar to kinetic proofreading."

The effector IpgB2 stimulates cellular responses analogous to GTP-active RhoA, whereas IpgB1 and Map function as the active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively.

Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are gram-negative etiological agents of typhoid fever, bacillary dysentery, and gastroenteritis in humans. Virulence associated with these enteric bacteria often correlates with the presence of a functional type III secretion system (TTSS) that acts as a conduit for delivery of bacterial “effector” proteins directly into host cells (Cornelis and Van Gijsegem, 2000Cornelis G.R. Van Gijsegem F. Assembly and function of type III secretory systems.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 735-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, Galan and Collmer, 1999Galan J.E. Collmer A. Type III secretion machines: bacterial devices for protein delivery into host cells.Science. 1999; 284: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). These secreted effectors allow pathogens to limit antibacterial host immune responses or generate a cellular architecture that is advantageous to bacterial replication and disease progression. EPEC, a member of the attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen group, intimately attaches to the apical surface of gut epithelia and destroys tight junction barrier functions through the coordinated activities of at least six type III effectors (Tir, Map, EspF, EspG, EspH, and EspI; Dean et al., 2005Dean P. Maresca M. Kenny B. EPEC's weapons of mass subversion.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Unlike EPEC however, Salmonella and Shigella are intracellular pathogens that orchestrate hosT cell invasion and cellular survival in gut epithelia and immune cells. Each of these pathogens secretes a distinct set of effector proteins that propagate their complex intracellular life cycles (Cossart and Sansonetti, 2004Cossart P. Sansonetti P.J. Bacterial invasion: the paradigms of enteroinvasive pathogens.Science. 2004; 304: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Because of their ubiquitous role in cell biology, Ras-like small G proteins are a common target for virulence factors secreted by bacterial pathogens (Boquet, 2000Boquet P. Small GTP binding proteins and bacterial virulence.Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). There are well over 100 eukaryotic small G proteins that regulate a myriad of cellular processes including growth, differentiation, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and nuclear import. Several key features of small G proteins allow them to perform these essential functions. First, they act as molecular switches cycling between GTP bound (active) and GDP bound (inactive) conformations. Second, most small G proteins are posttranslationally modified; the addition of isoprenoid lipid moieties allows them to associate with specific subcellular compartments. Third, they transmit signaling events in a GTP-dependent manner by activating and/or recruiting downstream target proteins to their sites of action. Previous studies have identified Salmonella type III bacterial effectors that function to regulate the cycling of the nucleotides bound to the GTPases by mimicking eukaryotic GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; Stebbins and Galan, 2001Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Structural mimicry in bacterial virulence.Nature. 2001; 412: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, there are no small G proteins encoded by enteric pathogen genomes. Our interests in the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions led us to identify a 24 member protein family that shares sequence similarities to the E. coli type III effector protein Map. Recent reports demonstrate that Map can induce hosT cell actin dynamics and disrupts tight-junction barrier function when delivered by the TTSS (Dean and Kenny, 2004Dean P. Kenny B. Intestinal barrier dysfunction by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is mediated by two effector molecules and a bacterial surface protein.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, Kenny et al., 2002Kenny B. Ellis S. Leard A.D. Warawa J. Mellor H. Jepson M.A. Co-ordinate regulation of distinct host cell signalling pathways by multifunctional enteropathogenic Escherichia coli effector molecules.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Map is conserved throughout the A/E pathogens including enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Citrobacter rodentium, suggesting that it plays an important role in pathogenesis. While the molecular mechanisms utilized by Map remain undefined, Δmap strains of C. rodentium are attenuated for virulence and display colonization defects (Mundy et al., 2004Mundy R. Petrovska L. Smollett K. Simpson N. Wilson R.K. Yu J. Tu X. Rosenshine I. Clare S. Dougan G. Frankel G. Identification of a novel Citrobacter rodentium type III secreted protein, EspI, and roles of this and other secreted proteins in infection.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have uncovered a number of Map homologs including SifA and SifB found in Salmonella and IpgB1 and IpgB2 found in Shigella. In contrast to the pathogenic function of Map described above, SifA promotes intracellular survival and replication by maintaining the integrity of the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV; Beuzon et al., 2000Beuzon C.R. Meresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E. Holden D.W. Salmonella maintains the integrity of its intracellular vacuole through the action of SifA.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3235-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Likewise, IpgB1 participates in Shigella invasion by regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Ohya et al., 2005Ohya K. Handa Y. Ogawa M. Suzuki M. Sasakawa C. IpgB1 is a novel Shigella effector protein involved in bacterial invasion of host cells: its activity to promote membrane ruffling via RAC1 and CDC42 activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24022-24034Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Because these biologically diverse virulence factors are related by primary sequence, it stands to reason that they all share a common unidentified biochemical activity to promote bacterial pathogenesis. In this report, we determine the biological function of three of our 24-member effector protein family, namely IpgB1 and IpgB2 from Shigella as well as Map from EHEC. As suggested by their sequence relatedness, these three effectors function in a similar manner by mimicking the GTP-active form of Rho-family GTPases. Although these bacterial proteins lack many of the biochemical attributes of GTPases, they induce actin cytoskeletal dynamics in the host cell by stimulating common signaling pathways. Moreover, the signaling specificities of these type III effector proteins are governed in part by eukaryotic-like targeting motifs such as PDZ ligands and CaaX-like sequences at the C terminus. Our results suggest that direct GTPase mimicry and subcellular targeting of effectors may be a widely used mechanism in bacteria-host interactions. We performed BLAST database searches starting with the EHEC effector Map as the index protein. This initial screen revealed a small number of protein homologs mostly found in the A/E pathogen group. Each member of this family shared a common Trp-x-x-x-Glu (WxxxE) motif. Next, we manually searched our BLAST results for WxxxE-containing proteins that fell below the significance threshold. By including these “outliers” in multiple PSI-BLAST iterations, we identified 24 distinct open reading frames that can be subdivided into at least six homolog classes including Map, TrcA, IpgB1, IpgB2, SifA, and SifB (Figure 1A). Although these putative effectors share clear regions of sequence similarity (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), the entire family has only two invariant amino acids, the Trp and Glu found in the WxxxE signature motif (Figure 1A, red residues). Secondary structure analysis predicts that each family member is composed of 6 to 8 α helices that are aligned to well-defined protein sequence boundaries, suggesting that they could have a common protein fold (Figure S1). An N-terminal GFP fusion of Shigella IpgB2 induced the formation of new actin stress fibers upon transfection of HEK293A cells (Figure 1B), HeLa, and Cos-7 cells (data not shown). No stress fibers were apparent in cells expressing only GFP (Figure 1C). Quantification of these results are shown in Figure 1F. It seemed likely that the invariant Trp or Glu residues of the WxxxE motif would be important for IpgB2 activity. As predicted, neither the Trp62→Ala (Figure 1D) nor Glu66→Ala (Figure 1E) mutants induced actin stress fibers. Mutations in the conserved residues Ser72 and Gln76 had no effect on the activity of IpgB2 under these experimental conditions (Figure 1F). Activation of the small G protein RhoA induces actin stress fiber assembly in cells (Ridley and Hall, 1992Ridley A.J. Hall A. The small GTP-binding protein rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to growth factors.Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar). To test if IpgB2 is epistatic to RhoA, various inhibitors were used to disrupt signaling through Rho proteins. The C3-botulinum toxin was used to irreversibly inhibit RhoA–C (Aktories et al., 2004Aktories K. Wilde C. Vogelsgesang M. Rho-modifying C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases.Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 152: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, IpgB2 induced new actin stress fibers in the presence of the C3-exoenzyme at the same rate as IpgB2 alone (Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, C3 abolished exogenous RhoA-induced stress fiber formation, and severe retraction fibers were found in these cells (Figures 2C and 2D). To further explore this observation, we performed additional inhibitor studies. Mutant RhoN19 was used to competitively inhibit Rho guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) in vivo (Ridley and Hall, 1992Ridley A.J. Hall A. The small GTP-binding protein rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to growth factors.Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar). In addition, YopT (Iriarte and Cornelis, 1998Iriarte M. Cornelis G.R. YopT, a new Yersinia Yop effector protein, affects the cytoskeleton of host cells.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), a Yersinia type III effector, was used to irreversibly block all Rho-family GTPases including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (Figure 2E; Shao et al., 2002Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W. Dixon J.E. A Yersinia effector and a Pseudomonas avirulence protein define a family of cysteine proteases functioning in bacterial pathogenesis.Cell. 2002; 109: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Neither RhoN19 nor YopT inhibited IpgB2 induced stress fiber formation (Figure 2F, gray bars), whereas they were both potent antagonists of exogenous RhoA (Figure 2F, black bars). These inhibitor studies demonstrate that IpgB2 induces actin stress fiber assembly through a novel mechanism that is independent of any Rho GTPase activity. We attempted yeast two-hybrid screens with IpgB2, but yeast transformants could not be recovered. Therefore, the readily transformable IpgB2-E66A mutant was used to screen a 9.5/10.5-day-old mouse embryo library. We identified three identical clones corresponding to residues 1157–1329 of Citron kinase (CRIK), a Rho-kinase family member (Figure 3A). These residues encompass the well-defined Rho binding domain (GBD) of CRIK (Madaule et al., 1995Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. A novel partner for the GTP-bound forms of rho and rac.FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). CRIK 1157–1329 interacted with both IpgB2-E66A and the active mutant of RhoA (RhoL63) in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the GBD of CRIK is homologous to the GBD of both ROCKI and ROCKII (Figure 3A), two kinases that are required for actin stress fiber formation (Amano et al., 1997Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions enhanced by Rho-kinase.Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Both endogenous ROCKI and ROCKII were coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-IpgB2 but not with control whole-mouse IgG (Figure 3C). In vitro kinase assays were used to confirm these protein interactions. GFP-IpgB2 was immune-isolated from HEK293A cells and added to an in vitro kinase activity assay. Proteins associated with the GFP-IpgB2 immune complex had significant kinase activity directed toward the S6 substrate peptide (Figure 3D, circles). We identified the IpgB2-associated kinase as ROCK since addition of Y27632, a potent ROCK inhibitor, abolished substrate phosphorylation (Figure 3D, triangles). In control experiments, immune-isolated GFP-Map, a homolog of IpgB2 that also posses a WxxxE motif, had no associated ROCK kinase activity (Figure 3D, squares). Thus, unidentified residues or sequences outside the WxxxE motif are likely to contribute to IpgB2 substrate binding and specificity in vivo. Consistent with our protein-interaction studies, cells transfected with IpgB2 could not form actin stress fibers upon application of the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Figure 3E). These data further implicate ROCK as a critical target of IpgB2 during stress fiber formation. It is well established that RhoA induces stress fiber assembly by stimulating the mammalian homolog of Diaphanous (mDia1; Watanabe et al., 1999Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Cooperation between mDia1 and ROCK in Rho-induced actin reorganization.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). mDia1 is composed of an N-terminal Rho binding sequence (GBD) followed by the Formin homology domains 1 and 2 (Figure 3F). IpgB2 specifically interacted with full-length mDia1 and residues 1–301 encompassing the GBD region (Figure 3G). This data was confirmed in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Figure 3H). The WxxxE family member Map did not bind to any fragment of mDia1, demonstrating the specificity of these interactions (Figure 3G). Taken together, our results suggest the possibility that IpgB2 activates Rho GTPase signaling pathways by interacting with Rho ligands via the GBD domain. Our yeast two-hybrid studies suggested that wild-type IpgB2 is toxic to yeast. We expressed IpgB2 driven off the GAL1 galactose-inducible promoter and scored yeast growth when plated on galactose medium. As seen in Figure 4A, expression of IpgB2 with galactose inhibited yeast growth, whereas repression of IpgB2 allowed growth. Mutations Trp62→Ala and Glu66→Ala in the WxxxE motif abolished IpgB2 yeast toxicity. In contrast, substitutions at conserved (but not invariant) residues had no effect on IpgB2 toxicity in yeast (Figure 4A). To gain additional insights into the mechanism of IpgB2 yeast toxicity, we designed a genetic screening strategy modeled after the synthetic genetic array (SGA); Tong et al., 2001Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. et al.Systematic genetic analysis with ordered arrays of yeast deletion mutants.Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). We refer to this technique as a pathogenic genetic array (PGA) because it allows an ordered array of ∼5000 viable yeast-deletion mutants to be assayed for growth defects associated with conditional expression of any pathogen protein. We introduced GAL1-IpgB2 into ∼5000 viable gene-deletion mutants and examined their growth rates on medium containing galactose (Figure 4B). Since expression of IpgB2 is toxic to wild-type yeast, any gene-deletion mutant that grows should identify the corresponding gene as a potential target for IpgB2-induced toxicity. Out of the ∼5000 strains tested, only gene deletion in BCK1, SLT2, and RLM1 resulted in a robust growth phenotype. Remarkably, each of these genes encodes components of the cell-wall integrity Rho1p/MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling module (Heinisch et al., 1999Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. The protein kinase C-mediated MAP kinase pathway involved in the maintenance of cellular integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) illustrated in Figure 4C. It is notable that PKC1 was not in our gene-deletion library because it has severe growth defects (Figure 4C). In addition, we did not isolate either MKK1 or MKK2 because these genes are functionally redundant. While yeast carrying deletions in BCK1, SLT2, and RLM1 grow well in the presence of IpgB2, deletion of genes encoding components of other MAPK signaling modules continue to result in cell toxicity (Figure 4D). Thus, our PGA screen results are consistent with IpgB2 specifically subverting the Rho1p signaling pathway. To test if IpgB2 signaling compares to Rho1p in yeast, we performed DNA microarray mRNA profiling because overexpression of activated Rho1p (Q68H) has a distinct and reproducible transcriptional profile (Roberts et al., 2000Roberts C.J.

DNA microarray analysis of ∼6000 genes revealed that IpgB2 regulated 351 transcripts at a 99% confidence level (Figure 4E). The overall IpgB2 transcriptional profile strongly correlates with that of Rho1p-Q68H (p = 0.632), a value that resembles the correlation values derived when comparing Rho1p-Q68H to its downstream target Pkc1p-R398A (p = 0.709). In contrast, the IpgB2 profile did not correlate with the profile resulting from activation of the Cdc42 pheromone response MAPK cascade induced by overexpression of Ste4p (p = 0.045; Figure 4E; Whiteway et al., 1990Whiteway M. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Overexpression of the STE4 gene leads to mating response in haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with our PGA screen, the 20 Rlm1p-regulated transcripts (Jung and Levin, 1999Jung U.S. Levin D.E. Genome-wide analysis of gene expression regulated by the yeast cell wall integrity signalling pathway.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) were induced, suggesting that this transcription factor is indeed activated by IpgB2 (Figure 4F). Therefore, two independent genome-screening procedures support the contention that IpgB2 stimulates small G protein signaling events in a similar manner as GTP bound Rho1p. We screened additional WxxxE bacterial effectors shown in Figure 1A for the ability to induce actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Transfection of E. coli Map induced cell-surface filopodia in HEK293A cells (Figure 5A), HeLa, and MDCK cells (not shown). While filopodia formation was the strongest phenotype, lamellipodia extended from the base of the actin projections (Figure 5A, enlargement). Cells expressing the following mutations in Map, W74→A (data not shown) and E78→A (Figure 5B), were indistinguishable from GFP-transfected cells (Figure 5C). Quantification of these results are shown in Figure 5D. Notably, filopodia formation is a hallmark of signaling by the small G protein Cdc42 (Nobes and Hall, 1995Nobes C.D. Hall A. Rho, rac, and cdc42 GTPases regulate the assembly of multimolecular focal complexes associated with actin stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia.Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar). Transfection of Shigella IpgB1 stimulated actin-rich membrane ruffles at the dorsal cell surface of HeLa cells (Figure 5E) and HEK293A and Cos-7 cells (data not shown). Dorsal ruffles were absent in mutant IpgB1 E80→A (Figure 5F) or flag vector-expressing cells (Figure 5G). Quantification of these results are shown in Figure 5H. Notably, the dorsal actin ruffles shown in Figure 5E closely resemble those formed by the small G protein Rac1 (Nobes and Hall, 1995Nobes C.D. Hall A. Rho, rac, and cdc42 GTPases regulate the assembly of multimolecular focal complexes associated with actin stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia.Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3610) Google Scholar). Next, we focused on the signaling properties of Map. It is well established that Cdc42 and Rac1 stimulate the Jun kinase (JNK) signal transduction cascade. JNK activity can be monitored by its phosphorylation state using phosphospecific antibodies. Both JNK and its downstream target c-jun were hyperphosphorylated in Map-transfected cells but not in Map-E78A-transfected cells (Figure 5I). In control experiments, the p42/44 MAP kinase (MAPK 1/2) was not phosphorylated under these conditions, demonstrating that Map specifically activates the JNK signal transduction pathway. We conducted a series of inhibitor studies to determine if Map is epistatic to Rac1 or Cdc42 (Figure 5J). Neither inhibition of cellular GEFs with RacN17 and Cdc42N17 or direct inhibition of Rac1 and Cdc42 by YopT proteolysis could abrogate Map-induced actin reorganization (Figure 5K). Both Rac1 and Cdc42 induce F actin nucleation by indirectly stimulating the Arp2/3 complex via the Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome protein (Wasp/Wave) family (Machesky and Insall, 1998Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Scar1 and the related Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, WASP, regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2/3 complex.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The C-terminal verpolin-cofilin-acidic (VCA) fragment of Wasp/Wave can inhibit Arp2/3-mediated events (Machesky and Insall, 1998Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Scar1 and the related Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, WASP, regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the Arp2/3 complex.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We found that VCA domain expression inhibited actin filopodia induced by Map (Figure 5K). In control experiments, VCA domain expression also blocked filopodia formation induced by active Cdc42V12 (data not shown). However, IpgB2 could stimulate actin stress fiber formation under similar experimental conditions (data not shown), demonstrating that the VCA inhibits specific Arp2/3-mediated events. These data further suggest that Map functions operationally similar to IpgB2 as molecular mimic of GTPases. We noticed that some WxxxE proteins have putative C-terminal subcellular targeting sequences (Figure 6A, yellow). In fact, the last three residues of Map (-Thr-Arg-Leu-stop) conform to a consensus type I PDZ ligand motif (-Ser/Thr-X-Hydrophobic-stop). To identify binding partners for the putative PDZ ligand in Map, a mouse embryo library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid method. We identified seven identical clones corresponding to the second PDZ domain of Ezrin binding protein 50 (Ebp50, also known as NHERF1; Figure 6B). Remarkably, C-terminal VQDTRL∗ sequence is identical to the C terminus of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a high-affinity Ebp50 binding protein (Figure 6C; Short et al., 1998Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. An apical PDZ protein anchors the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator to the cytoskeleton.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To test this interaction in vitro, a recombinant maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion of either Map or IpgB2 (Figure 6D) was mixed with recombinant [35S]-labeled Ebp50 produced in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system (Figure 6E). Amylose-Sepharose pull down revealed that Ebp50 directly interacts with Map but not with control IpgB2 (Figure 6F). In addition, endogenous Ebp50 interacted with GFP-Map in co immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that Map and Ebp50 form a complex in HEK293A cells (Figure 6G). In contrast, Ebp50 did not bind to mutant MapΔTRL, confirming that this binding occurs through a type I PDZ domain interaction (Figure 6G). Ebp50 is a component of cell surface microvilli where it functions to target membrane receptors to the apical surface of epithelial cells (Bretscher et al., 2000Bretscher A. Chambers D. Nguyen R. Reczek D. ERM-Merlin and EBP50 protein families in plasma membrane organization and function.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 113-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Thus, Ebp50 may direct Map to the plasma membrane through the PDZ domain interaction. As a functional test of this idea, we observed cell surface filopodia formation in cells expressing the Ebp50 binding-deficient mutant MapΔTRL. Compared to the filopodia induced by wild-type Map (Figure 6H), the actin cytoskeleton in cells expressing MapΔTRL (Figure 6I) was indistinguishable from that of GFP-transfected cells (see Figure 5C). Quantification of these results are shown in Figure 6J. We asked if subcellular localization could impart signaling specificity to the WxxxE effectors. As noted in Figure 6J, IpgB2-expressing cells display stress fiber formation with an apparent absence of filopodia. We fused the C-terminal PDZ motif (TRL) of Map to the C terminus of IpgB2. Transfection of the IpgB2-TRL chimera resulted in new cell surface filopodia in the majority of cells (Figure 6J). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Ebp50 interacts with the IpgB2-TRL chimera (data not shown). These data suggest that Ebp50 is a critical component of Map signaling and specificity. To ensure that our observed phenotypes were not the result of overexpression of Map in cultured cells, we investigated host cell filopodia formation in cells infected with EPEC, a pathogen that naturally expresses Map during infection (Kenny and Jepson, 2000Kenny B. Jepson M. Targeting of an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) effector protein to host mitochondria.Cell. Microbiol. 2000; 2: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). EPEC infected HeLa cells produced cell surface filopodia that surround the bacterial microcolonies (Figure 7A; Kenny et al., 2002Kenny B. Ellis S. Leard A.D. Warawa J. Mellor H. Jepson M.A. Co-ordinate regulation of distinct host cell signalling pathways by multifunctional enteropathogenic Escherichia coli effector molecules.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, a map gene-deletion strain (EPECΔmap) did not induce filopodia in host cells (Figure 7B;Kenny et al., 2002Kenny B. Ellis S. Leard A.D. Warawa J. Mellor H. Jepson M.A. Co-ordinate regulation of distinct host cell signalling pathways by multifunctional enteropathogenic Escherichia coli effector molecules.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1095-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Next, we introduced expression plasmids carrying the wild-type map gene (denoted as pmap) or a map gene harboring a single E78→A point mutation (pmapE78A) into the EPECΔmap strain. While type III delivery of MapE78A failed to induce cell surface filopodia (Figure 7C), the phenotype was recovered by complementing the EPECΔmap with wild-type Map in trans (Figure 7D). Quantification of these results are shown in Figure 7E. These data reaffirm the critical role that residues in the WxxxE motif play for proper function of Map during EPEC pathogenesis. Next, we investigated the physiological relevance of Map targeting to the cell surface through its interaction with host cell Ebp50. First, we expressed plasmid-encoded MapΔTRL (pmapΔTRL) in the EPECΔmap strain. As shown in Figure 7E, type III delivery of MapΔTRL failed to induce filopodia in HeLa cells. To determine if this result is due to the interaction between Map and Ebp50 we knocked down Ebp50 protein levels by RNA interference. Ebp50 protein was reduced ∼70% by specific siRNA treatment compared to controls (Figure 7F). Application of Ebp50 siRNA to cells 24 hr prior to wild-type EPEC infections significantly reduced the incidence of cellular filopodia formation (Figure 7G). Similar results were found upon infection of the EPECΔmap + pmap strain (Figure 7G). These data further demonstrate that intracellular targeting by host cell Ebp50 is required for proper Map function during bacterial pathogenesis. In this study, we have used the Shigella effector IpgB1 and IpgB2 as well as the E. coli effector Map as experimental prototypes to demonstrate that several WxxxE family members functionally mimic the activated forms of distinct Rho family small G proteins (Figure 7H). These results further highlight the remarkable ability of bacterial effectors to subvert small G protein signaling pathways through molecular mimicry of eukaryotic proteins (Stebbins and Galan, 2001Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Structural mimicry in bacterial virulence.Nature. 2001; 412: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence support our GTPase mimicry postulate. First, three individual WxxxE effectors, IpgB1, IpgB2, and Map induce three distinct phenotypes, dorsal ruffles, stress fibers, and filopodia that normally result from activation of Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42, respectively. Whereas IpgB2 and Map maintained the ability to induce actin cytoskeletal changes in the absence of Rho family GTPases, inhibition of downstream GTPase signaling pathways abolished the activity of these bacterial effectors. Consistent with these observations, we found that IpgB2 interacted with the GBD regions of several natural RhoA ligands. Interestingly, the biological effects of IpgB2 are not restricted to mammalian cells; PGA analysis suggests that IpgB2 induced yeast cell death by overstimulating the Pkc1p Rho-kinase signal transduction pathway. In fact, the gene transcription profiles induced by IpgB2 compares favorably to that of GTP bound Rho1p. Finally, we confirmed the role of Map as a physiological mimic of GTPases with a series of EPEC infection studies. Thus, our studies provide evidence in support of a GTPase-independent mechanism for the induction of critical actin dynamic events. We aligned our effector protein family using the invariant WxxxE motif as a molecular signature of functionality. This initial criterion was proven correct as mutations in the invariant Trp or Glu residues inhibited the GTPase mimicry activity of IpgB1, IpgB2, and Map. These effector proteins appear to be a bacterial “invention” since there are no WxxxE motifs in eukaryotic small G proteins and IpgB1, IpgB2, nor Map bind guanine nucleotides or display sequences, suggesting that they have GTPase activity. It is unlikely that two invariant residues could impart this remarkable signaling specificity. We imagine that the sequences surrounding the WxxxE motif may also contribute to binding and induce a conformational switch in GBD-containing target proteins. This scenario would be analogous to the mechanisms that have been proposed for GTP bound small G proteins affecting their downstream targets (Lei et al., 2000Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Structure of PAK1 in an autoinhibited conformation reveals a multistage activation switch.Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Since this is only speculation, additional structural data showing WxxxE effectors bound to their downstream target proteins should provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of GTPase mimicry. Based on the function of IpgB1, IpgB2, and Map it may be possible to infer the activities of additional WxxxE family members. In light of this information, we now recognize that the Salmonella effector SifA displays cell-signaling characteristics analogous to members of the Rab subfamily of small G proteins. For instance, SifA has been suggested to regulate membrane trafficking to the intracellular vacuole that houses Salmonella in the host cell cytoplasm (Beuzon et al., 2000Beuzon C.R. Meresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E. Holden D.W. Salmonella maintains the integrity of its intracellular vacuole through the action of SifA.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3235-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In addition, SifA plays a role in extending the Salmonella-inducible filament (Sif) membrane networks along the microtubule cytoskeleton (Beuzon et al., 2000Beuzon C.R. Meresse S. Unsworth K.E. Ruiz-Albert J. Garvis S. Waterman S.R. Ryder T.A. Boucrot E. Holden D.W. Salmonella maintains the integrity of its intracellular vacuole through the action of SifA.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3235-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, Brumell et al., 2002Brumell J.H. Goosney D.L. Finlay B.B. SifA, a type III secreted effector of Salmonella typhimurium, directs Salmonella-induced filament (Sif) formation along microtubules.Traffic. 2002; 3: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Stein et al., 1996Stein M.A. Leung K.Y. Zwick M. Garcia-del Portillo F. Finlay B.B. Identification of a Salmonella virulence gene required for formation of filamentous structures containing lysosomal membrane glycoproteins within epithelial cells.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, a recent report demonstrates that SifA recruits kinesin motor proteins to the Sif membranes through the adaptor protein SifA-kinesin-interacting protein (SKIP; Boucrot et al., 2005Boucrot E. Henry T. Borg J.P. Gorvel J.P. Meresse S. The intracellular fate of Salmonella depends on the recruitment of kinesin.Science. 2005; 308: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Similarly, Rab GTPases direct membrane fusion events and are required for membrane trafficking along cytoskeletal networks by coupling motor proteins to cognate membranes. Thus, the biological function of SifA is in agreement with our hypothesis that effectors from this family are likely to possess GTPase mimicry capabilities. Several of the WxxxE effectors have evolved sequences that serve as localization determinants in the host cell. For example, we identified a functional eukaryotic PDZ ligand at the C terminus of Map. Remarkably, VQDTRL sequence is identical to the well-characterized PDZ ligand found in eukaryotic CFTR. Consistent with this finding, both Map and CFTR interact with the adaptor protein Ebp50 through a PDZ/ligand interaction. Although this is only speculation, the PDZ motif of Map most likely acts as an apical membrane retention sequence since Ebp50 is highly enriched in this cellular compartment and this is the site of enteric E. coli type III secretion. Because bacterial effectors are injected at low concentrations, specific eukaryotic targeting sequences could direct these effectors to specific sites within the host cell. Future experimentation will be aimed at understanding the physiological role of Map as a functional mimic of GTPases at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Interestingly, eukaryotic targeting sequences seem to be common among the WxxxE effector family. For example, SifA also possesses a functional C-terminal targeting motif that is quite similar to the C-terminal CaaX box found in many eukaryotic small G proteins (Figure 6A, yellow; Boucrot et al., 2003Boucrot E. Beuzon C.R. Holden D.W. Gorvel J.P. Meresse S. Salmonella typhimurium SifA effector protein requires its membrane-anchoring C-terminal hexapeptide for its biological function.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14196-14202Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, this CaaX motif is required for targeting SifA to newly forming Salmonella inducible filaments, a process that is necessary for its proper signaling function (Boucrot et al., 2003Boucrot E. Beuzon C.R. Holden D.W. Gorvel J.P. Meresse S. Salmonella typhimurium SifA effector protein requires its membrane-anchoring C-terminal hexapeptide for its biological function.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14196-14202Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, at least two WxxxE family members, Map and SifA, have evolved functional C-terminal targeting motifs that are used by eukaryotic proteins. We expect other WxxxE effector will be localized to specific host cell compartments through yet-to-be-identified targeting sequences. Yeast can serve as an excellent model organism to study bacterial effector protein functions (Lesser and Miller, 2001Lesser C.F. Miller S.I. Expression of microbial virulence proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae models mammalian infection.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have describing two high-throughput genome-screening procedures used to elucidate the functions of specific effectors that are toxic to yeast. The PGA screen illustrated in Figure 3B was designed based on previously described synthetic lethality screens and the SGA screen (Tong et al., 2001Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. et al.Systematic genetic analysis with ordered arrays of yeast deletion mutants.Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). In addition, we used DNA microarray expression profiling as a second method to analyze the role of IpgB2 in yeast. Although we used these genome screening procedures as an unbiased conformation of our mammalian cell biology data, the PGA screen, and DNA microarray profiling may serve as useful tools to help identify the functions of other pathogen effector proteins or toxins that target-specific substrates in yeast. Our studies suggest for the first time that IpgB1, IpgB2, and Map function by a common molecular mechanism as functional mimics of distinct Rho family GTPases. As shown in Figure 7H, IpgB2 induces actin stress fibers, IpgB1 induces dorsal lamellipodia, and Map induces cell surface filopodia. The respective GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 share these phenotypes. Future studies should reveal the actions of additional WxxxE effectors, findings that may provide important new insights into both eukaryotic small G protein signaling pathways and bacterial pathogenic mechanisms."

The DDB1 structure reveals an intertwined three-propeller cluster, which contains two tightly coupled beta propellers with a large pocket in between and a third beta propeller flexibly attached on the side. The rigid double-propeller fold of DDB1 is targeted by the viral V protein, which inserts an entire helix into the double-propeller pocket, whereas the third propeller domain docks DDB1 to the N terminus of the Cul4A scaffold.

https://openalex.org/W2096622242,"Molecular chaperones assist the folding of newly translated and stress-denatured proteins. In prokaryotes, overlapping sets of chaperones mediate both processes. In contrast, we find that eukaryotes evolved distinct chaperone networks to carry out these functions. Genomic and functional analyses indicate that in addition to stress-inducible chaperones that protect the cellular proteome from stress, eukaryotes contain a stress-repressed chaperone network that is dedicated to protein biogenesis. These stress-repressed chaperones are transcriptionally, functionally, and physically linked to the translational apparatus and associate with nascent polypeptides emerging from the ribosome. Consistent with a function in de novo protein folding, impairment of the translation-linked chaperone network renders cells sensitive to misfolding in the context of protein synthesis but not in the context of environmental stress. The emergence of a translation-linked chaperone network likely underlies the elaborate cotranslational folding process necessary for the evolution of larger multidomain proteins characteristic of eukaryotic cells."

In biochemical assays, the Xlr proteinase has similar affinities for its endogenous substrate Chordin and for its competitive inhibitor Sizzled, which is resistant to enzyme digestion. Extracellular levels of Sizzled and Chordin in the gastrula embryo and enzyme reaction constants were all in the 10−8 M range, consistent with a physiological role in the regulation of dorsal-ventral patterning. Sizzled is also a natural inhibitor of BMP1, a Tolloid metalloproteinase of medical interest. Furthermore, mouse sFRP2 inhibited Xlr, suggesting a wider role for this molecular mechanism."

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar). To obtain nutrients and other molecules that are necessary for growth and function of the cell, Gramnegative bacteria have channels within their OM that facilitate uptake of these molecules. With respect to the transport of small, hydrophilic substances, these channels can be divided in three classes, based on their mode of transport (1Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar): general porins, substrate-specific transporters, and active transporters. A wealth of structural and functional information is available for many of these OM channel proteins, which form monomeric or trimeric barrels that are each composed of 12-22 antiparallel β-strands. In addition to OM proteins with established transport functions, the OM also contains a considerable number of smaller, monomeric β-barrels that are composed of 8 or 10 β-strands. These proteins have been implicated in a wide range of functions including OM lipid metabolism, cell adhesion, and structural functions. One of these small OM proteins is OmpA from Escherichia coli, which belongs to a protein family with a number of established and putative functions, the most important of which is to provide structural stability to the cell via interactions of its C-terminal domain with the periplasmic peptidoglycan layer (1Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar). Another member of the small OM protein family is NspA from Neisseria meningitidis, which belongs to the Opa family of proteins that are thought to mediate adhesion to host cells (2Vandeputte-Rutten L. Bos M.P. Tommassen J. Gros P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24825-24830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A fundamental question is whether these small barrels can function as transport channels. Arguing against this possibility are the crystal structures that have been determined for several of these proteins, and which do not show continuous channels that would be consistent with transport functions. On the other hand, it has been shown that, at least in vitro, OmpA forms both small and large ion channels (3Arora A. Rinehart D. Szabo G. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is permeable to larger uncharged solutes (4Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2507-2511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the static pictures provided by the crystal structures may be misleading. The OmpW/AlkL family (5Busch W. Saier Jr., M.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 227: 21-36PubMed Google Scholar) is a family of small OM β-barrel proteins for which some, albeit indirect, evidence for transport exists. The proteins belonging to this family are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, have a length of about 200-230 amino acids, and are predicted to form 8-stranded β-barrels. One member of this family, OmpW from Vibrio cholerae, was first described more than 20 years ago and has attracted interest for vaccine development, as it is very immunogenic and seems to be present in all known V. cholerae strains (6Jalajakumari M.B. Manning P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Das M. Chopra A.K. Cantu J.M. Peterson J.W. FEMS Immunol. Med.

Microbiol. 2005; 7: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). E. coli OmpW, which under normal growth conditions is expressed in only minor amounts, is a receptor for colicin S4 (9Pilsl H. Smajs D. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3578-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but otherwise nothing is known about its function. Interestingly, E. coli OmpW shows 27% sequence identity to AlkL from Pseudomonas oleovorans, which is located in an operon that is dedicated to the degradation of alkanes by this organism (10Van Beilen J.B. Eggink G. Enequist H. Bos R. Witholt B. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3121-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A similar degree of sequence identity is observed between E. coli OmpW and NahQ/DoxH, which are proteins of the naphthalene upper catabolic pathway operon that is present in several Pseudomonas species (11Eaton R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7757-7762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These sequence similarities suggest an as of yet unproven role for OmpW in the transport of various hydrophobic molecules across the OM. A putative, albeit ill-defined, transport function is also suggested by the fact that growth of Vibrio species in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl results in a dramatic (10-20-fold) induction of OmpW, implying an involvement of this protein in osmoregulation (12Xu C. Ren H. Wang S. Peng X. Res. Microbiol. 2004; 155: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Xu C. Wang S. Ren H. Lin X. Wu L. Peng X. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3142-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The lack of a high-resolution structure of any of the OmpW/AlkL family proteins has so far hindered attempts to assign more specific functions to members of this OM protein family. To address the question of whether OmpW homologues could form channels for the transport of small (hydrophobic) molecules, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of OmpW from E. coli and performed single-channel conductance experiments of OmpW in planar lipid bilayers. The results suggest that members of the OmpW/AlkL family form channels for the transport of small (hydrophobic) compounds. Protein Expression and Purification—The gene for E. coli OmpW, including the signal sequence and with a hexa-histidine tag following the C-terminal phenylalanine residue, was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, and cloned into the pB22 vector (14Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), which is under control of the arabinose promoter (15Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). OmpW was expressed in C43 (DE3) cells (genotype F- ompT gal hsdSB (r-B m-B) dcm lon λDE3 pLys-S and two uncharacterized mutations described in Ref. 16Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) grown in 2× YT medium by induction with 0.2% arabinose for 3 h at 37°C. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in TSB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8) and ruptured by two passes at 15,000-20,000 psi in a microfluidizer (Avestin Emulsiflex C-3). Total (inner and outer) membranes were collected by centrifugation at 131,000 × g and solubilized by homogenization in 1% n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylamine-N-oxide (LDAO) in TSB buffer, followed by stirring of the suspension at 4 °C for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 131,000 × g, the membrane extract derived from 12 liters of cells (A600 ∼ 1.0) was loaded onto a 10-ml nickel affinity column (Chelating Sepharose; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.2% LDAO in TSB. The nickel column was washed with 20 volumes of buffer containing 5 mm imidazole and eluted with 200 mm imidazole. OmpW was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-200 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% LDAO, pH 5.5. This step was followed by cation exchange on a Resource-S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 10 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.45% tetraethylene-monooctylether (C8E4), pH 5.5, and employing a linear NaCl gradient to 0.5 m. In addition to C8E4, OmpW was also purified by cation exchange in 0.05% LDAO and 1% β-octylglucoside. The pure protein (final yield ∼5-10 mg per 12 liters of cells) was concentrated to 5-10 mg/ml and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—C43 (DE3) cells expressing OmpW were ruptured as described above in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, followed by collection of total membranes as described above. Membranes were resuspended in 4 ml of buffer and layered on a step gradient of 35-60% sucrose in buffer, with 5% increments of sucrose (10 ml each). Following centrifugation at 131,000 × g for 18 h, the two membrane fractions were drawn off, solubilized in 1% LDAO, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described above. OmpW was located in the heavier outer membrane fraction located at the 50-55% sucrose interface (data not shown). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization trials of OmpW purified in LDAO, β-octylglucoside, and C8E4 were set up at 295 K by mixing 0.8 μl of protein solution with 0.8 μl of reservoir solutions from commercially available crystallization screens (Crystal Screen I from Hampton Research and The Classics and MbClass II screens from Nextal Biotechnologies). Whereas crystals proved difficult to obtain in β-octylglucoside and LDAO, OmpW purified in C8E4 crystallized readily under various conditions. After optimization, two crystal forms were obtained that diffracted to sufficient resolution to allow collection of x-ray data. The first of these (referred to as “trigonal”) crystallized as diamonds in space group P3121 from 28 to 32% PEG400, 0.2 m CaCl2, and 50 mm glycine, pH 9, and contained 3 molecules in the asymmetric unit (Vm ∼2.8 Å3/Da, corresponding to ∼56% solvent content). The diffraction from these crystals was highly anisotropic, with diffraction limits ranging from 2.4 to 3.6 Å. The second crystal form (referred to as “orthorhombic”) crystallized as bipyramids in space group P212121 from 27 to 33% MPD, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 50 mm citrate, pH 5.6, and contained 6 molecules in the asymmetric unit (Vm ∼3.2 Å3/Da, corresponding to ∼62% solvent content). The diffraction of these crystals was more isotropic and extended to 2.7 Å resolution. The diffraction patterns of the orthorhombic crystals could also be indexed and integrated in higher symmetry lattices (primitive cubic (P23), rhombohedral (R3), and primitive tetragonal (P4)), but subsequent scaling resulted in an unacceptable (5-20%) number of rejections and high χ2 values. Both crystal forms were frozen directly from the mother liquor in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Native and derivative data were collected at NSLS beamlines X25 and X6A at Brookhaven National Lab. All diffraction data were processed with HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; : 307-326Crossref Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Heavy Atom Derivatization, Phasing, and Refinement—Despite extensive efforts, selenomethionine-substituted protein did not yield crystals that diffracted to high resolution. Consequently, we had to solve the OmpW structure by multiple isomorphous replacement methods. Because co-crystallization approaches were not successful, a large number of heavy atom compounds were soaked into the trigonal crystals (which were obtained prior to the orthorhombic crystals). Several of the heavy atom compounds (K2PtCl4, OsCl3) resulted in derivatives that were severely non-isomorphous with respect to the native crystals, and single anomalous dispersion and single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) approaches did not produce useful phases. A useful derivative was eventually obtained by soaking the crystals in 2-5 mm YbCl3 for ∼3 h. A single anomalous dispersion dataset at the ytterbium peak wavelength (1.38 Å) was recorded for a derivatized crystal that diffracted to 3.2 Å resolution. Heavy atom sites (three in total; one for each molecule) were identified using SOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 55: 849-861Crossref Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Phases were obtained by SIRAS and refinement of the heavy atom sites within SHARP (19de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density maps (after phase extension to 3.0 Å) differed greatly in quality for the three OmpW molecules within the asymmetric unit, presumably because of the anisotropy in the crystals. Initially this allowed only two of the three OmpW molecules in the asymmetric unit to be built manually, using O (20Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). During the course of refinement in CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), the third molecule could be built as well, although its B-factors were much higher than those of the other two molecules. The orthorhombic crystal form was solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER (22Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) implemented in ccp4 (23The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar), using the trigonal OmpW structure as a search model. A clear solution with 6 molecules in the asymmetric unit was obtained. The model was refined in CNS as described above. During refinement of both crystal forms, it was necessary to impose tight NCS restraints on the protein to obtain acceptable Rfree values. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Both OmpW crystal forms have good stereochemistry. Only one residue lies within the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. This residue (Ser175) is present in the least well defined molecule in the asymmetric unit of trigonal OmpW (Table 1), and is located in surface loop L4 in a region with weak electron density.TABLE 1Summary of data collection and refinement statisticsTrigonalOrthorhombicYbCl3NativeData set and phasing statisticsWavelength (Å)1.381.101.10Resolution range (outer shell) (Å)50-3.2 (3.31-3.2)50-3.0 (3.11-3.0)40-2.7 (2.80-2.70)Space groupP3121P3121P212121Unit cell parameters (Å, °)82.0, 82.0, 186.382.2, 82.2, 186.2118.7, 118.8, 118.590, 90, 12090, 90, 9090, 90, 120Mosaicity (°)0.680.390.45Rmerge (%) (outer shell)aRmerge=∑(I-〈I〉)/∑(I).16.3 (47.8)7.6 (37.5)8.7 (52.9)Completeness (%) (outer shell)94.5 (63.4)98.8 (99.0)99.5 (100.0)I/σI (outer shell)17.8 (2.4)34.0 (6.1)25.7 (4.2)SIRAS phasing power after SHARP (iso/ano)1.08/1.37SIRAS FOM after SHARP (centric/acentric)0.32/0.41Refinement statisticsResolution range8.0-3.08.0-2.7Total no. atoms (non-hydrogens)45218586RworkbRwork=∑||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs| for the 95% of reflection data used in refinement./RfreecRfree=∑||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs| for the remaining 5%.27.4/32.829.3/31.4r.m.s. deviationdr.m.s. deviation, root mean square deviation. bond lengths (Å)/bond angles (°)0.0085/1.600.0095/1.63Average B-factorProtein (Å2)70.1 (57.0)eThe values between parentheses are for the best defined molecule within the asymmetric unit.42.0LDAO105.6 (80.3)eThe values between parentheses are for the best defined molecule within the asymmetric unit.Glycerol61.6 (56.8)eThe values between parentheses are for the best defined molecule within the asymmetric unit.56.2C8E488.6 (92.3)eThe values between parentheses are for the best defined molecule within the asymmetric unit.%Residues in regions of Ramachandran plotFavored and additionally allowed/disallowed96.0/0.2 (97.3/0.0)eThe values between parentheses are for the best defined molecule within the asymmetric unit.100.0/0.0a Rmerge=∑(I-〈I〉)/∑(I).b Rwork=∑||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs| for the 95% of reflection data used in refinement.c Rfree=∑||Fobs|-|Fcalc||/∑|Fobs| for the remaining 5%.d r.m.s. deviation, root mean square deviation.e The values between parentheses are for the best defined molecule within the asymmetric unit. Open table in a new tab Single-channel Conductance Experiments—Samples for single-channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers were prepared in two ways: 1) by 100-fold dilution of concentrated (8-10 mg/ml) detergent-solubilized protein in 20 mm C8E4 buffer (OmpW: pH 5.5, 10 mm potassium acetate; OmpA: pH 9.3, 10 mm glycine; Tsx: pH 8.0, 10 mm Tris-HCl) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2) by detergent removal and reconstitution into dipalmitoleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) proteoliposomes. For this, 80-100 μg/ml of detergent-solubilized (OmpW, Tsx) or refolded (OmpA) protein prepared by method 1 was mixed with DPPC to give a final lipid concentration of 10 mm. More C8E4 was added until the solutions became clear. The mixtures were dialyzed for 72 h (with 4 solution changes) against the corresponding detergent-free buffer. 5 μl of protein in C8E4 micelles or DPPC proteoliposomes were added to the cis- and trans-compartments of a bilayer setup for single-channel recordings. The two compartments, each containing 1.5 ml of 1 m KCl buffer (1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3) and a chloride silver electrode, were separated by a preformed DiPhPC/decane planar bilayer in a 500-μm hole in a Teflon partition. The cis-compartment was grounded while the potential was applied to the trans-compartment. For titration with ligands, channels were prepared by adding 5 μl of OmpW solution (200 μg/ml) reconstituted into 10 mm DPPC to both compartments. Small aliquots of 1 m arabinose or 0.25 mm LDAO stock solutions were alternately added to the cis- and trans-compartments, followed by mixing and application of +140 or -140 mV potentials. No attempts were made to reconstitute the protein unidirectionally or to determine the effect of unilateral additions of the ligands. The current fluctuation across the bilayer was filtered at 100 Hz with an 8-pole low-pass filter and recorded digitally at 1 kHz using the LABMAN program. 3G. Szabo and C. Q. Ye, University of Virginia, unpublished data. Single channel conductance events were analyzed interactively using IGOR software (Wave-metrics, Portland, OR) (3Arora A. Rinehart D. Szabo G. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Description of the Structure—The final trigonal OmpW model contains three protomers, three glycerols, eight C8E4 molecules, and three LDAO molecules in the asymmetric unit. The entire OmpW molecule could be built, with the exception of the N-terminal histidine residue and residues Gly20-Leu28 in loop L1, for which no electron density was observed. One residue of the C-terminal His6 tag was visible as well. The refined orthorhombic model contains six protomers and six glycerol molecules in the asymmetric unit, and was virtually identical to trigonal OmpW (including the fact that no density was observed for residues Gly20-Leu28 in loop L1). In contrast to trigonal OmpW, no unambiguous density could be observed for any detergent molecules in the orthorhombic crystals, and they were not included in the refinement. In addition, no water molecules could be assigned that resulted in lower Rfree values upon their inclusion during refinement, and they were not included in the final model. The OmpW molecules are packed in both crystal forms as trimers. These are likely to be crystallographic, in view of the non-physiological orientation of the monomers relative to each other (data not shown). Supporting the monomeric arrangement in the crystals is the observation that OmpW, expressed in its native form in the E. coli OM, purifies as a monomer (data not shown), indicating that the protein is likely to function as a monomer. OmpW forms an ∼50-Å long 8-stranded β-barrel, with extended loops (L) on one side of the barrel and short turns (T) on the other side (Fig. 1, A and B). Because in all known OM proteins the longer loops are exposed to the extracellular surface, with the N and C terminus located in the periplasmic space, we assume that this is the case for OmpW as well. The cross-section of the barrel is ellipsoid in shape (Fig. 1C), with approximate dimensions of ∼17 × 12 Å (between Cα atoms) along the whole length of the barrel. The shear number (24Schultz G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) of the barrel is 10, making OmpW structurally similar to OmpA and NspA. The most remarkable feature in the OmpW structure is the hydrophobic character of the interior of the barrel, as shown in Fig. 2. Of the 62 inward-pointing residues of the barrel wall, only 20 are hydrophilic (Ser, His, Asp, Glu, Asn, Gln, Arg, and Lys) and the rest are hydrophobic. The apolar character of the barrel interior extends about 30-35 Å from the extracellular exit to almost the middle of the membrane (Fig. 2), where Leu56 in strand S3 and Trp155 in strand S7 form a “hydrophobic gate” (Fig. 3A), closing the channel. The interior of the barrel on the periplasmic side of the gate has a more hydrophilic character, comparable with that found in most other OM proteins (Fig. 2). In this hydrophilic vestibule region, salt bridges are likely present between the residue pairs Glu54-Arg9, Arg97-Glu2, and Arg190-Glu5.FIGURE 3A, ribbon representation of OmpW viewed from the side, with the putative ligands LDAO and glycerol, as present in the trigonal crystals, indicated as CPK models. For clarity the ribbon diagram has been made transparent to show the ligands bound in the channel more clearly. The residues Leu56 and Trp155 that are part of the putative hydrophobic gate are shown as stick models in blue.

Amino acid residues that line the binding pocket are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the trigonal crystals, an elongated stretch of density is present in the center of the hydrophobic channel at the extracellular side (Fig. 3A). In the orthorhombic crystals this density, although present, is much weaker and not continuous, and for this reason we have not built anything at this site in the orthorhombic crystal form. The length of the density is consistent with an LDAO detergent molecule, which was used during the purification of the protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). The environment of the putative LDAO molecule is remarkably hydrophobic, and no polar or charged residue comes within 4 Å of the bound detergent. Instead, only the hydrophobic residues Phe31, Ile65, Val76, Leu123, Leu126, Leu128, Tyr165, and Val176 are close (within 4 Å) to the hydrophobic tail of the LDAO molecule (Fig. 3B). The polar head group of the LDAO molecule is located at the end of the barrel, and is solvent accessible (Fig. 3A). Because the LDAO molecule is still bound to OmpW after detergent exchange to C8E4 (see “Experimental Procedures”), it is likely to bind in the channel with relatively high affinity. In the periplasmic vestibule, a significant (∼5 σ) patch of density is present at identical positions in the 2Fo-Fc maps of both the trigonal and orthorhombic crystals (Fig. 3C). Both hydrophobic (Phe7, Tyr88, Leu143, and Met46) and charged residues (Glu2, Glu5, Arg9, Arg190, and Asp141) contribute to this binding pocket (Fig. 3C). Although it is not possible to identify this density unambiguously at the current resolution, we have assigned it as a molecule of glycerol for several reasons. The binding pocket is similar in character to glycerol binding sites in other proteins (for example, GlpF; Ref. 25Fu D. Libson A. Miercke L.J. Weitzman C. Nollert P. Krucinski J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2000; 290: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The hydroxyl groups of the putative glycerol molecule are close (between 2.2 and 2.8 Å) to the carboxyl groups of Glu5, Glu2, and Asp141, whereas the glycerol carbon backbone is stacked against the aromatic ring of Phe7 (Fig. 3C). Supporting this assignment is the fact that inclusion of glycerol during refinement resulted in a slightly lower (0.2%) Rfree value. This contrasts with the inclusion of a water molecule or several different cations at this site, which resulted in somewhat increased values of Rfree. It should be noted that an arabinose molecule (and probably other pentose sugars as well) is also compatible with the density at this site, giving similar Rfree values as for glycerol. However, because both OmpW crystal forms were purified and crystallized in the presence of 10% glycerol, the density in the binding pocket is more likely to correspond to glycerol than to arabinose. Single-channel Conductance Measurements—Single-channel conductance recordings of OmpW reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers are shown in Fig. 4. Similar traces are observed when the protein is reconstituted from C8E4 micelles or DPPC proteoliposomes. A statistical analysis shows that OmpW reconstituted from C8E4 has a conductance of 17 ± 8 pS (mean ± S.E.) at 140 mV in 1 m KCl (determined from 279 events in two independent experiments). When reconstituted from DPPC, the conductance of OmpW is 19 ± 8 pS (determined from 629 events in four experiments) (Fig. 5). Under identical conditions, OmpA has a conductance of 60-70 pS independent of the method of reconstitution (Figs. 4 and 5). These values for OmpA are similar to those reported before (3Arora A. Rinehart D. Szabo G. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1594-1600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and correspond to the formation of a small channel by the 8-stranded β-barrel of the N-terminal ∼176 residues of OmpA. For comparison, we also measured the single-channel conductance of the nucleoside transporter Tsx reconstituted from C8E4 micelles. This protein has recently been shown to form a 12-stranded β-barrel with a narrow central pore (26Ye J. van den Berg B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which displays one of the smallest single-channel conductance values of any OM protein (27Benz R. Schmid A. Maier C. Bremer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The single-channel conductance of Tsx, measured under the same conditions as OmpW and OmpA is 10 ± 4 pS (Figs. 4 and 5), similar to the value previously reported for this protein under the same electrolyte conditions (27Benz R. Schmid A. Maier C. Bremer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Histograms for the single-channel conductance distributions of OmpW, OmpA, and Tsx in planar lipid bilayers.

Recent telescope and Cassini orbiter observations are now providing an insight into cloud climatology. To study clouds, we have developed a general circulation model of Titan that includes cloud microphysics. We identify and explain the formation of several types of ethane and methane clouds, including south polar clouds and sporadic clouds in temperate regions and especially at 40 degrees in the summer hemisphere. The locations, frequencies, and composition of these cloud types are essentially explained by the large-scale circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2028678199,"In contrast to current models, fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements using a single-cell imaging assay with fluorescent forms of PER and TIM showed that these proteins bind rapidly and persist in the cytoplasm while gradually accumulating in discrete foci. After ∼6 hours, complexes abruptly dissociated, as PER and TIM independently moved to the nucleus in a narrow time frame. The per L mutation delayed nuclear accumulation in vivo and in our cultured cell system, but without affecting rates of PER/TIM assembly or dissociation. This finding points to a previously unrecognized form of temporal regulation that underlies the periodicity of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W1978862543,"The 660-kilometer discontinuity, which separates Earth's upper and lower mantle, has been detected routinely on a global scale in underside reflections of precursors to SS shear waves. Here, we report observations of this discontinuity in many different regions, using precursors to compressional PP waves. The apparent absence of such precursors in previous studies had posed major problems for models of mantle composition. We find a complicated structure, showing single and double reflections ranging in depth from 640 to 720 kilometers, that requires the existence of multiple phase transitions at the base of the transition zone. The results are consistent with a pyrolite mantle composition."
https://openalex.org/W2065415889,"Osteoblast (OB) differentiation is suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an inflammatory stimulus that is elevated in arthritis and menopause. Because OB differentiation requires the expression of the transcription factor osterix (Osx), we investigated TNF effects on Osx. TNF inhibited Osx mRNA in pre-osteoblastic cells without affecting Osx mRNA half-life. Inhibition was independent of new protein synthesis. Analysis of the Osx promoter revealed two transcription start sites that direct the expression of an abundant mRNA (Osx1) and an alternatively spliced mRNA (Osx2). Promoter fragments driving the expression of luciferase were constructed to identify TNF regulatory sequences. Two independent promoters were identified upstream of each transcription start site. TNF potently inhibited transcription of both promoters. Deletion and mutational analysis identified a TNF-responsive region proximal to the Osx2 start site that retained responsiveness when inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter. The TNF response region was a major binding site for nuclear proteins, although TNF did not change binding at the site. The roles of MAPK and NFκB were investigated as signal mediators of TNF. Inhibitors of MEK1 and ERK1, but not of JNK or p38 kinase, abrogated TNF inhibition of Osx mRNA and promoter activity. TNF action was not prevented by blockade of NFκB nuclear entry. The forced expression of high levels of NFκB uncovered a proximal promoter enhancer; however, this site was not activated by TNF. The inhibitory effect of TNF on Osx expression may decrease OB differentiation in arthritis and osteoporosis. Osteoblast (OB) differentiation is suppressed by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an inflammatory stimulus that is elevated in arthritis and menopause. Because OB differentiation requires the expression of the transcription factor osterix (Osx), we investigated TNF effects on Osx. TNF inhibited Osx mRNA in pre-osteoblastic cells without affecting Osx mRNA half-life. Inhibition was independent of new protein synthesis. Analysis of the Osx promoter revealed two transcription start sites that direct the expression of an abundant mRNA (Osx1) and an alternatively spliced mRNA (Osx2). Promoter fragments driving the expression of luciferase were constructed to identify TNF regulatory sequences. Two independent promoters were identified upstream of each transcription start site. TNF potently inhibited transcription of both promoters. Deletion and mutational analysis identified a TNF-responsive region proximal to the Osx2 start site that retained responsiveness when inserted upstream of a heterologous promoter. The TNF response region was a major binding site for nuclear proteins, although TNF did not change binding at the site. The roles of MAPK and NFκB were investigated as signal mediators of TNF. Inhibitors of MEK1 and ERK1, but not of JNK or p38 kinase, abrogated TNF inhibition of Osx mRNA and promoter activity. TNF action was not prevented by blockade of NFκB nuclear entry. The forced expression of high levels of NFκB uncovered a proximal promoter enhancer; however, this site was not activated by TNF. The inhibitory effect of TNF on Osx expression may decrease OB differentiation in arthritis and osteoporosis. Osteoblasts (OBs) 2The abbreviations used are: OB, osteoblast; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BMP, bone morphogenic protein. are derived from pluripotent precursor cells of mesenchymal origin that are capable of differentiation to chondrocytes, myocytes, adipocytes, or fibroblasts (1Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Marcus R. Feldman D. Kelsey J. Osteoporosis. 2nd. 1. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2001: 21-72Crossref Google Scholar). Bone formation in the embryo and remodeling in the adult require that a sufficient number of precursor cells differentiate to functional OBs. New OBs are continuously required for the synthesis of bone matrix and replacement of cells becoming osteocytes or undergoing apoptosis. A coordinated expression of transcription factors determines the commitment of precursor cells toward the OB phenotype under the control of autocrine, paracrine, and hormonal stimuli. Two of these transcription factors, RUNX2 (Cbfa1/AML3/Pebp2αA) and Osx, are required for differentiation to the OB lineage. In mice, RUNX2 gene knock-out causes a lethal mutation with a cartilaginous skeleton. RUNX2 is presumed to function as an organizer on promoters of skeletal-specific genes (2Lian J.B. Javed A. Zaidi S.K. Lengner C. Montecino M. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2004; 14: 1-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A phenotype similar to the RUNX2 knock-out is observed with knock-out of Osx. Here the arrest in development occurs slightly later but also results in a cartilaginous skeleton (3Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). In addition, Osx induces OB differentiation of dispersed embryonic cells (4Tai G. Polak J.M. Bishop A.E. Christodoulou I. Buttery L.D. Tissue Eng. 2004; 10: 1456-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RUNX2 is expressed in Osx knock-outs, suggesting that Osx functions downstream of RUNX2 in the differentiation pathway. Differentiation of precursor cells to OBs in adult bone is impaired by inflammatory stimuli. In rheumatoid arthritis, estrogen deficiency, and aging, there is an increased expression of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). In adult bone, inflammatory cytokines blunt the formation rate of new bone in the face of increased resorption, contributing to net bone loss (5Pacifici R. Calcif.

Cytokines could interfere with the expression of factors required for OB differentiation. We have previously shown that TNF inhibits osteoblast differentiation at the stage of precursor cell commitment to the OB lineage (6Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Osteoblast precursors, including fetal calvaria cells, murine marrow stromal cells, and the clonal pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3, fail to differentiate in the presence of TNF. These models of osteoblast progenitors uniformly show enhanced sensitivity to TNF blockade of differentiation at an early stage in culture when the key transcription factors RUNX2 and Osx are required. An inhibitory effect of TNF on the RUNX2 promoter that could contribute to decreased expression and differentiation of cells has been described previously (12Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Rubin J. Drissi H. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Nanes M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2695-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This effect of TNF is isoform-specific, inhibiting the osteoblastic MASNS RUNX2 isoform 50% and the more ubiquitously expressed MRIPV isoform >90%. These results suggest that TNF may have additional targets. Here we present evidence that TNF is a potent inhibitor of Osx expression. In addition, we have evaluated the structure and regulation of the Osx promoter and report transcriptional regulation by TNF at a discrete site via a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal. Reagents—MC3T3-E1 (clone 14) mouse pre-osteoblast cells were provided by Dr. Renny Franceschi (University of Michigan). C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from the America Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human TNF-α was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Real-time PCR was done using the Bio-Rad ICycler. SYBR Green was obtained from Bio-Rad. MAPK inhibitors PD98059 and SB203580 were obtained from Calbiochem. SP600125 was purchased from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO). Minimal essential medium was purchased from Invitrogen and fetal bovine serum from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Treatment and RNA Harvest—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated on day 0 at 7.4 × 106 cells/150-mm plate in minimal essential medium + 10% fetal bovine serum (medium). On day 1, medium was replaced with differentiating medium (minimal essential medium + 10% fetal bovine serum + 50 μg/ml l-ascorbate). On day 2, TNF-α was added in the doses indicated for each experiment. The half-life of Osx mRNA was measured in MC3T3-E1 cells plated on day 0 at 4.4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates in medium. Actinomycin D (0.5 μg/ml) was added 2 h prior to TNF-α, and RNA was obtained at the time points indicated under “Results.” For experiments using cycloheximide, the same protocol was followed as for actinomycin D, except 5 μg/ml cycloheximide was used. RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The addition of MAPK chemical inhibitors was done 2 h prior to TNF treatment. Transient transfection of dominant negative MEK1 or ERK1 was done with the Osx promoter reporter construct followed by TNF 24 h later and cell lysates for luciferase assay after an additional 24 h. The addition of the siRNA-p65 expression plasmid or the siRNA control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was done 48 h prior to TNF and transfection of the N terminus-deleted IκB 24 h prior to TNF treatment. Real-time RT-PCR—Quantitation of Osx mRNA in total cell RNA samples was carried out using standard RT and PCR procedures, setting up duplicate or triplicate reactions. The primers used were OsxQRTf, 5′-CCT CTC GAC CCG ACT GCA GAT C-3′ and OsxQRTr, 5′-AGC TGC AAG CTC TCT GTA ACC ATG AC-3′. The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 20 s for 40 cycles. Reporter and Deletion Constructs—The Osx promoter sequence selected for further study spans nucleotides –1360 to –10 of the Osx gene locus relative to the position (+1) of the initiation methionine for the Osx open reading frame. The sequence was amplified from mouse genomic F-factor-based bacterial artificial chromosome RP23–118K10 by PCR using the following 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively: 5′-ACA GGT ACC CAC ACA TAC ACG-3′ and 5′-CAA GCA GAG AGG ACG CCA TCC TCG AGC T-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with KpnI and XhoI and inserted into the pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The serial 5′ deletion mutants of the Osx promoter were constructed by PCR using the same 3′ primer that amplified the F-factor-based bacterial artificial chromosome and the following 5′ primers, respectively: 5′-CCTTT CGGTA CCAGC GCGGC-3′ (–665/+91); 5′-AGATG GTACC CAGCG CCCTC-3′ (–471/+91); 5′-CCAAG GTACC TCTGA CAACT TG-3′ (–304/+91); and 5′-GGTGG TACCC TACAG ACAGA-3′ (–121/+91). The two 3′ deletion mutants used the same 5′ primer as for the F-factor-based bacterial artificial chromosome amplification and the following 3′ primers, respectively: 5′-TGATG AAGCT TCACA GACAA-3′ (–1269/–469) and 5′-CTCTG AAGCT TGGGATCCAC-3′ (–1269/–69). The resulting PCR products were digested by KpnI and HindIII and inserted into the pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter. The two smaller deletion and mutation mutants of the Osx promoter were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The Osx promoter –665/+91 deletion mutant was used as the DNA template with the following pair of PCR primers: pair 1, 5′-GATTG TAGGA TTGGA AGCTG GCCTG AGAGA-3′ and 5′-TCTCT CAGGC CAGCT TCCAA TCCTA CAATC-3′ (D520/500); pair 2, 5′-AACAA GAGTG AGCTG GCCTG TTGCC AGTAA TCTTC AAGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCTT GAAGA TTACT GGCAA CAGGC CAGCT CACTC TTGTT-3′ (D488/450); pair 3, 5′-TTGGA TCTGA GGTTT AACAA GAGTG AGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCT CACTC TTGTT AAACC TCAGA TCCAA-3′ (mutated 514/510). Direct ligation into the promoter SV40-luciferase (pGL-promoter) was done to create the heterologous reporter with a dimer of the sequence 5′-CTCTG AGTGG GAACA AGAGT GTCTG AGTGG GAACA AGAGT GTCTG AGTGG GAACA AGAGT G-3′. All constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. Transfection—The C3H10T1/2 cells (n = 3 wells/group) were plated at a density of 7 × 104 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates (Corning, NY). After 24 h, the cells were transfected with a mixture of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), medium, promoter reporter, and pRL-TK control vector (Promega, Madison, WI). 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed using firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase substrates in the Dual Luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase data to correct for variation in transfection efficiency. Rapid Amplification of 5′-cDNA Ends—The 5′-end sequence of the alternatively spliced exon was obtained using BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primer used was 5′-GAG CTT CTT CCT CAA GCA GAG AGG ACG CCA TCC TCG A-3′. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Automated sequencing was done to determine the transcription start sites from the 5′-RACE products. Primer Extension—Total RNA was extracted as described above and used for primer extension analysis. Reactions were performed by annealing 1 pmol of [32P]-labeled primer, complementary to the Osx gene untranslated 5′-end (GGACT GGAGC CATAG TGAGC TTC), to 10 μg of total RNA. Following annealing at 58 °C for 20 min, extension was performed with 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (0.5 mm) for 30 min at 42 °C. cDNA products were denatured and analyzed on 6% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and analyzed in a phosphorimaging device. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Electrophoretic mobility shifts were done as previously described (12Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Rubin J. Drissi H. van Wijnen A.J. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Nanes M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2695-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 13Farmer P.K. He X. Schmitz M.L. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E213-E220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—ANOVA was used to determine a statistical difference between multiple groups. Multiple comparisons between individual groups were done by the method of Tukey. Comparisons between any one group and a common control were done by the method of Dunnet. Analyses were done using Prism software, (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). TNF Inhibits Osx Steady State mRNA—Osx expression was observed by day 2 of culture in MC3T3 cells. The effect of TNF was studied using doses previously shown to inhibit osteoblast differentiation in MC3T3, bone marrow stromal, and fetal rat calvaria pre-osteoblasts (6Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 14Gilbert L.C. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 288: E1011-E1018Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows that treatment with 10 ng/ml TNF on day 2 of culture inhibited Osx steady state mRNA. TNF inhibited Osx mRNA 50% by 4 h, 85% by 8 h, and 95% by 24 h compared with levels in the control cultures. Fig. 1B shows that the inhibitory effect of TNF was dose-dependent with 50% inhibition of mRNA occurring at 0.75 ng/ml. This IC50 is similar to that reported for TNF inhibition of osteoblast differentiation (6Gilbert L. He X. Farmer P. Boden S. Kozlowski M. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNF decreased Osx by destabilization of mRNA, MC3T3 cells were treated with actinomycin D 2 h prior to the addition of TNF to stop RNA synthesis. The half-life of the Osx mRNA was then measured over 14 h using real-time RT-PCR. TNF did not decrease the brief (1.5 h) Osx mRNA half-life (Fig. 1C). MC3T3 cells were treated with cycloheximide to determine whether TNF action required new protein synthesis. Fig. 1D shows that cycloheximide alone decreased Osx mRNA, although TNF further inhibited the Osx mRNA level in the presence of cycloheximide treatment. Cloning of the Osx Promoter and Determination of Transcriptional Start Sites—A 1357-bp fragment of the proximal promoter including a portion of 5′-untranslated RNA was amplified from a murine F-factor-based bacterial artificial chromosome containing genomic Osx, sequenced for confirmation, and cloned into the KpnI and XhoI sites of the pGL3 Basic-luciferase reporter. A map of homologous transcription factor binding sites was generated using MatInspector to assess potential regulatory sites (15Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the promoter contains putative homologous binding sites for factors known to influence differentiation of pluripotent precursor cells to the osteoblast, chondrocyte, adipocyte, or myoblast lineage. These included MyoD, AML-1, RUNX2, cEBP, Msx, DLX, and NFκB core consensus sequences. The Osx promoter fragment also included 14 contiguous repeats of a Myf5-binding site. The transcriptional start site of the Osx promoter was determined by 5′-RACE. Fig. 3A shows that 5′-RACE yielded two bands of 100 and 300 kb size, suggesting two potential start sites. (also identified in Fig. 2). These sites were confirmed by primer extension (not shown). Amplification using unique 5′ primers and a common 3′ primer yielded two mRNA species designated Osx1 and Osx2 (Fig. 3B). Sequencing revealed that the more abundant Osx1 corresponded to the expected mRNA as reported previously for murine Osx and the highly homologous human Osx (16Milona M.A. Gough J.E. Edgar A.J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Gao Y. Jheon A. Nourkeyhani H. Kobayashi H. Ganss B. Gene. 2004; 341: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The less abundant Osx2 includes alternatively spliced exons 1 and 2. Fig. 3C maps the genomic Osx structure as deduced from these experiments. Deletion Analysis Reveals Independent Promoter Activities Upstream Of Osx1 and Osx2—The basal activity of the Osx promoter was analyzed by making successive deletions from the 3′- or 5′-end. These were inserted upstream of a promoterless pGL3basic luciferase reporter. Fig. 4A shows a diagram of the –1269/+91 promoter with the locations of the Osx1 and Osx2 transcription start sites labeled for reference. Fig. 4B shows the effect of the deletions on promoter activity. The proximal promoter containing the Osx1, but not Osx2, start site had 40% of the activity of the full-length reporter (Fig. 4B, construct C versus A). Interestingly, deletion of the regions proximal to the Osx1 start site retained substantial activity (Fig. 4B, constructs D, E, and F versus A). Activity was lost with deletions upstream of –469 (Fig. 4B, constructs G, J, and K versus A). To determine whether there were independent promoter activities associated with the Osx1 and Osx2 start sites, –669/–469 and –269/+91 fragments were cloned upstream of the promoterless pGLbasic. These reporters retained independent activity that was 40% of the full-length –1269/+91 (Fig. 4B, constructs H and I versus A) and five times that of the pGLbasic control (H versus L). As previously noted, the region around Osx1 was also capable of independent promoter activity (Fig. 4B, construct C versus A). TNF Regulation of the Osx Promoter—The effect of TNF on the Osx promoter was then measured. Time course and dose response effects of TNF on the –1269/+91 Osx promoter were done in MC3T3 cells (Fig. 5, A and B) and also the primitive mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 (Fig. 5, C and D). TNF caused a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of Osx promoter activity with an IC50 between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/ml, consistent with the effects on Osx mRNA and the inhibition of OB differentiation. Two major signal pathways mediating TNF action are NFκB and MAPK (11Nanes M.S. Gene. 2003; 321: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The effect of NFκB expression on the promoter activity was determined by transfection of C3H10T1/2 cells with NFκB or its individual p50 or p65 subunits. Expression was done with a pef-Myc-nuc vector containing an independent nuclear localization signal and driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter (18Lu X. Farmer P. Rubin J. Nanes M.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows the results for this transfection and also the effect of other stimuli for comparison, including RUNX2, Msx2, dexamethasone, 1,25(OH)2D3, or parathyroid hormone. Surprisingly, NFκB caused a potent stimulation of the Osx promoter. This effect was mediated by the p65 subunit of NFκB, which retained 40% of the activity of the intact dimer. The p50 subunit did not significantly increase Osx promoter activity. Msx2 expression increased Osx promoter activity 5.7-fold, but none of the other stimuli were effective. In a separate experiment, treatment with bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) did not stimulate Osx promoter activity (not shown). Deletions of the promoter were studied to localize the regions conferring the inhibitory effect of TNF. Fig. 7 shows the effect of TNF as fold stimulation relative to the activity of the respective control constructs. Most of the TNF inhibition was localized to a region between –514 to –510, as seen by the effect of deletion of this region (Fig. 7, constructs F and G versus A). This region was downstream of the Osx2 start site and embedded within the region of independent promoter activity shown in Fig. 4B. To further localize the TNF response element, small deletions or a four-base mutation were made within the –665/+91 construct (Fig. 7, constructs D and E). These localized TNF inhibition of the promoter to a region between –514 and –510. Confirmation of the localization was done by inserting three copies of the –520/–500 sequence upstream of the heterologous SV40 promoter (Fig. 7, construct H). TNF inhibited the activity of this promoter but had no activity on pSV40 alone (not shown). Identification of Protein-DNA Binding in the TNF-responsive Region—EMSA was done using overlapping probes that spanned 200 bp around the TNF-responsive region to determine sites of nuclear protein-DNA binding. Nuclear extract obtained from control and TNF-treated C3H10T1/2 cells was used for incubation with the probes. Five sites were found with strong protein-DNA interaction, one of which overlapped the TNF-responsive region (Fig. 8, probe 9, specific). Binding to probes 3 and 5 represented binding to the Myf5 consensus, whereas probe 6 spanned the Osx2 start site. Localization of the TNF response by deletion and mutational analysis led us to focus on a region within probe 9 (–520/–500); however, TNF did not change the pattern of binding at this site, although a small 2-fold increase in binding intensity was confirmed in repeated experiments. Incubation with antibodies to transcription factors was done using probe 9, but no supershifts were observed for p65, p50, RUNX2, RUNX1, JunD, RBP-Jκ, Fra-1, or Fra-2 (not shown). TNF Inhibition of Osx Is Mediated by MAPK Signaling—The TNF-bound p55 receptor activates a MAPK cascade in addition to the NFκB pathway. These pathways diverge downstream of activation of the cytosolic adapter protein TRAF2 in osteoblastic cells (11Nanes M.S. Gene. 2003; 321: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We evaluated MAPK as a possible mediator of TNF inhibitory action, because NFκB paradoxically stimulated Osx transcription. Cells were pre-incubated for 2 h with PD98059, SP600125, or SB203580, inhibitors of MEK1 (the immediate upstream activator of ERK1/2), cJun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), or p38 kinase, respectively. The effect of these treatments on TNF inhibition of the Osx promoter was measured in the –1269/+91 Osx reporter. Fig. 9A shows that the MEK inhibitor reversed TNF inhibition of Osx transcription, whereas the inhibitors of JNK and p38 had no effect. The MEK inhibitor alone increased Osx promoter activity above the level of control. The effect of the MEK inhibitor was also observed using a reporter limited to the –669/–469 TNF-responsive region. The MEK inhibitor (PD98059) completely abrogated TNF inhibition of this limited promoter and also increased basal activity (Fig. 9B). Fig. 9C shows that the MEK inhibitor also abrogated TNF inhibition of the heterologous SV40-LUC promoter bearing the 3×(–520/–500) sequence, indicating that the TNF element was sufficient to confer MAPK responsiveness. To determine whether the MEK inhibitor blocked TNF inhibition of Osx mRNA, MC3T3 cells were treated with PD98059 for 5 h before the addition of TNF. RNA was harvested 18 h later for measurement of Osx mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. Fig. 9D shows that the MEK inhibitor completely abrogated TNF inhibition of Osx mRNA. PD98059 alone caused a significant increase in steady state Osx mRNA. Similar results were obtained for the –1269/+91 Osx promoter using a dominant negative MEK1 or ERK1. Fig. 10 shows that these dominant negatives partially reversed TNF inhibition of the promoter, confirming the results obtained using PD98059.FIGURE 10Blockade of MAPK with dominant negative MEK1 or ERK1 partially reverses TNF inhibition of the Osx promoter. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 9. Dominant negative constructs were co-transfected with the –1269/+91 Osx promoter, and 24 h later, the cells were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) or control. After an additional 24 h, cell lysates were obtained for luciferase activity. Results show arbitrary luciferase units corrected for a constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase control. Bars with different letters (a, b, and c) to the right are significantly different from each other (p < 0.05 by ANOVA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of the NFκB Regulatory Element—The pattern of NFκB stimulation of the promoter was determined by overexpression of the p65 subunit, as described for Fig. 6. NFκB responsiveness was abolished with deletion of the proximal promoter between –270 and –70 (Fig. 11, construct J versus A or I). A promoter fragment containing the TNF response site, but not the proximal promoter sequence, was not stimulated by NFκB (Fig. 7, construct H). Further deletions localized the NFκB response to a region within 200 bp of the consensus p50 binding site indicated in Fig. 2 (-214/-217). Mutation of four bases representing the core binding motif abolished NFκB stimulation of the –1269/+91 promoter (Fig. 11K). These bases and their flanking sequence conferred NFκB activation in a heterologous SV40 promoter, confirming independent NFκB enhancer activity (Fig. 11L). The potency of the NFκB stimulus to Osx transcription was predominant over the inhibitory effect of TNF in the full-length –1269/+91 construct, because TNF treatment did not inhibit transcription when NFκB was simultaneously overexpressed (not shown, C = 1.0 ± 0.1, p65 = 13.1 ± 0.6, TNF + p65 = 12.4 ± 0.8). This paradox led to a more detailed assessment of the effects of these treatments on binding to the NFκB element. The NFκB Element Is Not Activated by TNF—The nuclear protein binding characteristics of the NFκB-responsive region were investigated by generating probes spanning a 231-bp sequence centered around the p50 binding motif. Fig. 12A shows a map of the promoter and indicates the sequence of probes used for EMSA analysis with recombinant NFκB. Fig. 12B shows that probes 2 and 4 bound a recombinant p50 monomer and a p50/p65 dimer but not the p65 monomer. The sequence bound was concordant with the functional sequence identified by deletion and mutational analysis of the promoter. This sequence is compared with the NFκB consensus in Fig. 12C. Binding of recombinant p50 to this sequence was of very low affinity compared with binding to the NFκB consensus sequence (Fig. 12D). Nuclear protein from TNF-treated C3H10T1/2 cells did not bind this low affinity site, demonstrating that the amount of NFκB stimulated by TNF was insufficient to bind and activate the enhancer (Fig. 12E, lane 5). To confirm that NFκB activation was not modulating TNF inhibition of the Osx promoter, NFκB activation was blocked by siRNA-p65 or expression of a degradation-resistant N terminus-deleted IκB (ΔIκB, (19Chu Z.L.

https://openalex.org/W2101327974,"The highly reactive species, peroxynitrite, is produced in endothelial cells in pathological states in which the production of superoxide anion and NO is increased. Here, we show that peroxynitrite added exogenously or generated endogenously in response to exposure to an NO donor or oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) increases p21ras activity in bovine aortic endothelial cells. The activation is not dependent on upstream elements but rather is due to direct targeting of p21ras by reversible S-glutathiolation of cysteine thiols as demonstrated by biotin-labeling techniques. The time course of p21ras S-glutathiolation following peroxynitrite corresponds to the increase in its Raf-1 binding activity and translocation to the membrane. Moreover, p21ras S-glutathiolation and activation can be reversed by dithiothreitol, confirming the importance of a disulfide bond. S-glutathiolation also promoted guanine nucleotide exchange of recombinant p21ras. In addition, the oxidant-induced activation of Mek/Erk and PI3 kinase/Akt was abrogated by dominant-negative and Cys-118 p21ras mutants, and the latter also prevented S-glutathiolation of p21ras. These results indicate that peroxynitrite arising from NO donors or pathological stimuli such as oxLDL triggers direct S-glutathiolation of p21ras Cys-118, which increases p21ras activity and mediates downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2092434419,"In the absence of erythropoietin (Epo) cell surface Epo receptors (EpoR) are dimeric; dimerization is mediated mainly by the transmembrane domain. Binding of Epo changes the orientation of the two receptor subunits. This conformational change is transmitted through the juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains, leading to activation of JAK2 kinase and induction of proliferation and survival signals. To define the active EpoR conformation(s) we screened libraries of EpoRs with random mutations in the transmembrane domain and identified several point mutations that activate the EpoR in the absence of ligand, including changes of either of the first two transmembrane domain residues (Leu226 and Ile227) to cysteine. Following this discovery, we performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in the EpoR juxtamembrane and transmembrane domains. Many mutants formed disulfide-linked receptor dimers, but only EpoR dimers linked by cysteines at positions 223, 226, or 227 activated EpoR signal transduction pathways and supported proliferation of Ba/F3 cells in the absence of cytokines. These data suggest that activation of dimeric EpoR by Epo binding is achieved by reorienting the EpoR transmembrane and the connected cytosolic domains and that certain disulfide-bonded dimers represent the activated dimeric conformation of the EpoR, constitutively activating downstream signaling. Based on our data and the previously determined structure of Epo bound to a dimer of the EpoR extracellular domain, we present a model of the active and inactive conformations of the Epo receptor.

The cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) 2The abbreviations used are: Epo, erythropoietin; EpoR, erythropoietin receptor; EBP, Epo-binding protein; EMP, Epo mimetic peptide; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IL, interleukin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; HA, hemagglutinin; JH, Janus kinase homology; IRES, internal ribosomal entry site. is the primary regulator of mammalian erythropoiesis. The erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), a member of the cytokine receptor family, is comprised of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain (1D'Andrea A.D. Fasman G.D. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1989; 58: 1023-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Epo binding triggers trans-phosphorylation and activation of the Janus family protein tyrosine kinase JAK2 that is appended to the intracellular domain of EpoR. Activated JAK2 then phosphorylates tyrosine residues in EpoR, creating docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins such as STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and SHP1. These events lead to the activation of several signal transduction pathways and specific gene expression, resulting in the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of erythroid progenitors (2Constantinescu S.N. Ghaffari S. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 18-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Without Epo or EpoR, definitive erythropoiesis cannot occur (3Wu H. Liu X. Jaenisch R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 83: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Previous studies on a constitutively activated EpoR mutant, R129C, revealed that the activated EpoR is a dimer (4Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that surface EpoR exists as a dimer in the absence of Epo, and that Epo binding likely activates the EpoR through defined conformational changes (5Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 6Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F.

The EpoR extracellular segment consists of two fibronectin III domains, D1 and D2. The crystal structure of two EpoR extracellular ligand binding domains (Epo-binding protein, EBP) bound to one Epo molecule showed that the D1 domains of the two dimerized EpoRs are positioned at a 120° angle when viewed perpendicular to the membrane plane (7Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of the EpoR extracellular domains bound to a less potent Epo mimetic peptide (EMP) assumes a symmetric orientation with a 180° angle between the two D1 domains (8Livnah O. Stura E.A. Johnson D.L. Middleton S.A. Mulcahy L.S. Wrighton N.C. Dower W.J. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1996; 273: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). This suggests that there is more than one conformation that can activate EpoR signaling, and that a 120° angle between the two receptors may be important for optimal signaling (7Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that Epo activates EpoR by positioning the two EpoR molecules in a particular dimeric conformation, which brings the active site of one (poorly active) JAK2 kinase immediately adjacent to the critical tyrosine residue in the activation loop of the second JAK2. By phosphorylating this tyrosine, the second JAK2 becomes catalytically active, triggering all downstream signaling events. EpoR dimerization in the absence of ligand is mediated mainly by its transmembrane domain (5Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the EpoR transmembrane domain is a membrane-spanning leucine zipper that strongly induces dimer formation (9Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Abrogating its dimerization by introducing mutations in the transmembrane domain impaired EpoR signaling in mammalian cells (9Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmuller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The EpoR cytosolic juxtamembrane domain contains a highly conserved hydrophobic motif (Leu253, Ile257, and Trp258) that is required for JAK2 activation (11Huang L.J. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1327-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Experiments in which 1, 2, 3, or 4 alanines were inserted between the transmembrane segment and this motif suggested that the transmembrane and cytosolic juxtamembrane domains of EpoR form a continuous and rigid α-helix (12Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This rigid structure may be important for “locking” the unliganded dimeric EpoR in an inactive conformation and thus preventing adventitious, inappropriate receptor activation. Clearly the EpoR transmembrane and juxtamembrane segments play key roles in properly orienting the EpoRs in both its active liganded and inactive unliganded states, and structural information of the EpoR transmembrane domain will be crucial for understanding the molecular details of EpoR activation. However, as yet there is no molecular structure of any cytokine receptor transmembrane or intracellular domain, and we do not know how phosphorylation of the appended JAK2s are triggered by cytokine binding. To approach this problem, the EpoR transmembrane domain has been fused to a leucine zipper coiled-coil segment from the Put3 transcription factor, and active and inactive orientations of EpoR transmembrane dimer have been deduced by changing the dimer interface through serial deletions in the transmembrane domain of the chimeras (6Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In these chimeras, the parallel dimeric helices dictated by the Put3 coiled-coil domains most likely resemble the symmetric activated configuration induced by the Epo mimetic peptide, rather than the asymmetric active conformation triggered by Epo binding (6Seubert N. Royer Y. Staerk J. Kubatzky K.F. Moucadel V. Krishnakumar S. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1239-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here we undertook a less invasive way to investigate the active states of the EpoR. Because the EpoR transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains form a rigid α-helix that locks it in an inactive configuration in the absence of ligand, mutations in this region may mimic the conformational changes that the Epo binding imposes on the EpoR, causing the realignment of the intracellular domains and the associated JAK2 kinases, and leading to activation of JAK2. By comprehensively screening designed libraries of EpoRs with all possible single and many multiple mutations in their transmembrane domains, we identified several mutations that activate EpoR in the absence of Epo. Many introduce charged amino acids in the transmembrane domain, but several have changes of either of the first two transmembrane domain residues (Leu226 and Ile227) to cysteine. We then performed cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the EpoR juxtamembrane extracellular and transmembrane domains. Many mutants form disulfide-linked dimers, but only EpoR dimers linked by cysteine at positions 223, 226, or 227 activate all of the EpoR signal transduction pathways we tested and also support proliferation of Ba/F3 cells in the absence of cytokines. These results suggest that activation of dimeric EpoR by Epo binding is achieved by reorienting the EpoR transmembrane domains and that certain disulfide-bonded dimers represent the activated dimeric conformation of the EpoR. Structural analysis of disulfide-linked synthetic EpoR transmembrane domains, locked in either an inactive or an active state as defined by these mutations, will elucidate how the conformational changes in a dimeric EpoR activates JAK2 and downstream signaling pathways. Mutant Library Construction—The murine EpoR coding region was inserted in a bicistronic retroviral vector to generate pMX-mEpoR-IRES-GFP vector (13Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Silent mutations were made to create 4 unique restriction sites around the EpoR transmembrane and juxtamembrane coding segments (Fig. 1A, S1, S2, S3, and S4). Coding sequences for EpoR between restriction cloning sites S1 and S2, or between S3 and S4, were replaced by annealed oligos with two or three random codon (NNS) in tandem (Fig. 1A). The random codons encompass the entirety of the transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions (226–256) except the essential Leu253, and 19 retroviral libraries expressing these mutant EpoRs were generated. Each library has a complexity from 1,000 (2 random codons) to 32,000 (3 random codons). IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were infected with these libraries. To avoid multiple infections in one cell, the infection efficiency was controlled so that only 10% of Ba/F3 cells were infected with retroviruses. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive cells were isolated by FACS after 48 h. These cells were then plated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum without IL-3 and Epo. Surviving clones were selected after 7–10 days of culture. The identities of these clones were revealed by genomic PCR with vector-specific primers and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products (Fig. 1C). Assay for Epo-independent and Epo-dependent Proliferation—Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type or mutant EpoRs were extensively washed and plated in RPMI medium with 10% FBS, without adding any growth factors. Cell numbers were counted at 24, 72, and 120 h with a Coulter particle counter. To measure Epo-dependent proliferation, Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type or mutant EpoRs were plated in RPMI medium with 10% FBS and a range of concentrations of Epo (0 to 1 units/ml) in 96-well dishes. After 3 days of incubation, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagent (Promega) was added to each well according to the manufacturer's protocol, and A570, which reflects the total number of live cells, was measured by a plate reader. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Ba/F3 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant EpoRs were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) with sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). These lysates were then incubated with antibodies against JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) or STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as indicated. Immune complexes were recovered by adding protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Protein A-Sepharose beads were then washed extensively in lysis buffer, and the proteins associated with the beads were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated on a 7% Tris acetate NuPAGE gel from Invitrogen, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). These membranes were probed with antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology). Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, 1:5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce). To reprobe the immunoblots for total JAK2 and STAT5, nitrocellulose membranes were incubated in 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8) with 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, then washed extensively in 10 mm Tris (pH 8) with 150 mm NaCl and 0.2% Tween 20. The membranes were then reprobed with antibodies specific for JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) or STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described. Measurement of Surface EpoR by Equilibrium Epo Binding—Purified carrier-free recombinant mouse Epo (R&D Systems) was labeled with iodine-125 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using IODO-GEN (Pierce). Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type or mutant EpoRs from a bicistronic vector also expressing GFP were first gated for their GFP intensity, and cells with similar GFP expression were sorted. These cells were then incubated in pH 7.3 culture medium with different concentrations of 125I-Epo for 18 h at 4 °C, in duplicate. Bound and free 125I-ligand was separated by centrifuging cells through a layer of FBS. Parental Ba/F3 cells were used as a control to measure nonspecific Epo binding. Bmax was determined by fitting the model for a single-class of non-cooperative binding sites to data obtained over a range of ligand concentrations, using MATLAB software (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA), and the total number of receptors on the cell surface was calculated using Bmax, Avogadro number, and the number of cells assayed (14Gross A.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2024-2032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Endo H Digestion of the EpoR—Ba/F3 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant EpoRs were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with protease inhibitors at 4 °C. Proteins in the cell lysates were denatured in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol followed by digestion with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (New England Biolabs, 500 units) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digested products were then separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blotted with anti-EpoR antibodies (M-20, Santa Cruz). Mutations in the Transmembrane Region of EpoR Result in Epo-independent Proliferation of BaF3 Cells—EpoR transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains play critical roles in receptor dimerization and activation (5Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 12Constantinescu S.N. Huang L.J. Nam H. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 377-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that certain mutations in this region could mimic the activated dimeric state of EpoR, thus supporting the survival and proliferation of erythroid progenitors in the absence of Epo. A few activating mutations in the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domain have been identified in other cytokine receptors (15Onishi M. Mui A.L. Morikawa Y. Cho L. Kinoshita S. Nolan G.P. Gorman D.M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but there has been no systematic attempt to identify them in EpoR. To create a comprehensive set of EpoR mutant libraries, we undertook a saturation mutagenesis approach detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, we used synthesized oligonucleotides with two or three random codons in tandem to replace the coding sequences for the EpoR transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains in the bicistronic pMX-mEpoR-IRES-GFP vector also encoding GFP (13Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In total 19 retroviral libraries expressing these mutant EpoRs were generated and used to infect IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Ba/F3 cells expressing mutant EpoRs were sorted by FACS, and ligand-independent Ba/F3 clones were isolated after 7–10 days in the absence of Epo and IL-3. Their EpoR coding regions were sequenced following genomic PCR (Fig. 1C). These mutant EpoRs were then reconstructed and expressed individually in Ba/F3 cells using a bicistronic retrovirus in which GFP is co-expressed from the same mRNA as the EpoR. Stable cell lines expressing these mutant receptors were sorted for the same level of GFP fluorescence and then tested for their ability to support Epo-dependent and Epo-independent growth (Fig. 2). The confirmed mutations that constitutively activate the EpoR are shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Constitutively activating mutations in the EpoR transmembrane domain identified by a random mutagenesis screenTABLE 1Constitutively activating mutations in the EpoR transmembrane domain identified by a random mutagenesis screena Amino acid sequences from EpoR transmembrane domain (in bold) and juxtamembrane domain.b Amino acids that are identified to wild-type EpoR are represented by a dot. Only mutated residues are shown using the one-letter abbreviation. a Amino acid sequences from EpoR transmembrane domain (in bold) and juxtamembrane domain. b Amino acids that are identified to wild-type EpoR are represented by a dot. Only mutated residues are shown using the one-letter abbreviation. Most mutations reside in the very N-terminal 2 or 3 residues of the transmembrane domain, which predominately are mutated to polar residues or cysteines. These mutations support Ba/F3 cell proliferation in the absence of Epo, as shown in Fig. 2. Compared with Ba/F3 cells bearing the wild-type EpoR, which undergo apoptosis in the absence of Epo, cells that express these mutant receptors continue to survive and proliferate at various rates (Fig. 2A). Simply deleting one, two, or three residues from the very N terminus of the transmembrane domain does not cause Epo-independent receptor activation or cell proliferation, suggesting that constitutive cell proliferation in these mutants is not caused by changing the length of the hydrophobic region of the EpoR transmembrane domain (data not shown). Fig. 2B shows that cells expressing one of these constitutive mutants, L226N/I227K/L228K, grew at a faster rate in the presence of physiological concentrations of Epo (0.01–0.1 units/ml). In contrast, cells expressing the constitutively active mutants L226C/I227C and L236W/I237K showed very little Epo-stimulated growth over the same range of Epo concentrations. Fig. 2C, lanes 4–9, shows that Ba/F3 cells expressing the constitutively active EpoR mutants L226C, I227C, L226C/I227C, L226N/I227K/L228K, L226V/I227P, and L236W/I237K all exhibit activation of JAK2 even when deprived of growth factors for 4 h. In contrast and as expected no activation of JAK2 was seen when Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild-type EpoR (Ba/F3-EpoR cells) were deprived of Epo and IL-3 for 4 h (lane 2). The level of constitutive JAK2 activation by these mutant EpoRs is comparable with that seen in Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild-type EpoR but growing continuously in a physiological concentration of Epo, about 0.1 unit/ml (lane 3). This level of JAK2 activation is, as expected, less than that seen in Ba/F3 cells expressing the wild-type EpoR deprived of Epo for 4 h and then stimulated with a high concentration of Epo (10 units/ml) for 10 min (lane 1). In cells expressing the wild-type EpoR growing continuously in the presence of Epo a number of negative regulatory proteins are induced or activated, dampening the signaling from the Epo-activated EpoRs. Thus Fig. 2C documents that in Ba/F3 cells expressing any of the constitutively active mutant EpoRs, there was an expected level of JAK2 phosphorylation in the absence of Epo stimulation. Thus these receptor mutants assume an active conformation even in the absence of Epo that is permissive for JAK2 trans-phosphorylation. Notably, mutation of either of the two most exoplasmic residues of the EpoR transmembrane domain, Leu226 or Ile227, to cysteine caused Epo-independent growth and constitutive JAK2 phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Considering the unique property of cysteine residues, we suspected that the constitutive activation of these EpoRs was a result of disulfide bond formation that fixed the EpoR dimers in an activating conformation. Three other mutations in the murine EpoR extracellular domain, R129C, E132C, and E133C, also form disulfide-linked constitutively active EpoR homodimers, suggesting that these mutant receptors are also “locked” in an active dimeric conformation (4Watowich S.S. Yoshimura A. Longmore G.D. Hilton D.J. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Yoshimura A. Longmore G. Lodish H.F.

If indeed disulfide formation in these mutants lead to their constitutive activation, unlike the R129C mutation in the extracellular domain, the structure of these disulfide-dimerized EpoR transmembrane domains could provide structural information about the active orientation of the EpoR transmembrane domain and intracellular domains. Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis of EpoR Transmembrane and Juxtamembrane Domains—To further study the effect of cysteine substitution in the EpoR transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains, we carried out cysteine scanning mutagenesis. We changed each of the transmembrane residues (amino acids 226–247) one-at-a-time to cysteine. We also mutated adjacent residues in the exoplasmic and cytosolic juxtamembrane domains (residues Asp222 to Pro225, and Ser248 and His249, respectively) to cysteine because the exoplasmic juxtamembrane domain was not included in our original saturation mutagenesis. These mutant EpoRs were introduced into the bicistronic pMX-IRES-GFP vector and expressed in populations of Ba/F3 cells through retroviral infection. EpoR-expressing cells were isolated by FACS sorting on the basis of GFP fluorescence (13Liu X. Constantinescu S.N. Sun Y. Bogan J.S. Hirsch D. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 280: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These cells were then plated in the RPMI medium with 10% serum, and their cytokine-independent growth was measured. Ba/F3-EpoR cells growing in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml Epo were used as controls. Of these mutants, only mutants L223C in the exoplasmic domain and only L226C and I227C in the transmembrane domain supported extensive ligand-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Another mutation, D224C, supported a much weaker ligand-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells; following long times in cytokine-free culture a small fraction of the cells survived and grew poorly, whereas the majority of the cells died. Thus the D224C EpoR mutant can support a low level of receptor self-activation that prevents some Ba/F3 cells from undergoing apoptosis. In contrast, replacement of amino acid residues 228–249 with cysteine yielded receptors with wild-type properties. Ba/F3 cells expressing these receptors responded normally to Epo stimulation and did not exhibit any Epo-independent proliferation (Fig. 3 and data not shown). This suggests that our original saturation mutagenesis and screening did not miss any other activating cysteine substitutions in the targeted EpoR segments. Fig. 4A shows that Ba/F3 cells expressing EpoRs with cysteine substitutions at amino acids 222–228 all proliferate in the presence of 0.1 unit/ml Epo, as judged by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Only D224C and P225C showed an impaired response to Epo, whereas other mutants responded normally to Epo (D222C, L226C, I227C, L228C) or exhibited hypersensitivity to 0.1 unit/ml Epo (L223C). Formation of Disulfide-linked Receptor Dimers Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for Epo-independent Activation—Having found that cysteine substitutions at Leu223, Leu226, and Ile227 constitutively activate the EpoR, we suspected that formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds at these positions might drive receptor self-activation. To determine whether these mutants, when expressed in Ba/F3 cells, indeed form intermolecular disulfide bonds, non-reducing SDS-PAGE was performed (Fig. 4B). In contrast to wild-type EpoR, EpoR mutants with cysteines at positions 222–228 all formed disulfide-linked dimers. Dimeric forms of EpoR could not be detected in mutants with cysteine substitution at or following residue Thr229 (T229C to H249C; Fig. 3D and data not shown). This probably results from the inaccessibility of these cysteine residues to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumenal enzymes that catalyze disulfide bond formation. These mutants also do not exhibit constitutive activation in Ba/F3 cells, suggesting that in these EpoR mutants with cysteine substitutions formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond is necessary for Epo-independent activation. Importantly, the data in Fig. 4B shows that formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond is not sufficient for Epo-independent activation; clearly the level of the disulfide-linked dimer is not correlated with the extent of Epo-independent proliferation. As an example, as judged by the ratio of dimeric to monomeric EpoR (Fig. 4B), D224C shows the strongest extent of dimerization, with almost 40% of total cellular EpoR in a disulfide-linked dimer. This mutant exhibits very low levels of Epo-independent proliferation (Fig. 4A). Mutant D222C, which forms the next highest proportion of disulfide-linked dimers, does not support ligand-independent proliferation in Ba/F3 cells. The extent of formation"

Here, we report that granzyme B targets the cytoskeleton by cleaving and removing the acidic C-terminal tail of α-tubulin. Consistent with this, Granzyme B markedly enhanced rates of microtubule polymerization in vitro, most likely by removal of an autoinhibitory domain within the tubulin C terminus. Moreover, delivery of Granzyme B into HeLa target cells promoted dramatic reorganization of the microtubule network in a caspase-independent manner. These data reveal that granzyme B directly attacks a major component of the cell cytoskeleton, which may contribute to the incapacitation of target cells during CTL/NK-mediated killing.

CTL/NK cells also play an important role in the attack of transplanted tissue during graft versus host disease (3Graubert T.A. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 1232-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular basis of CTL/NK killing is likely to reveal proteins that are important for the maintenance of cell viability and/or proliferative potential or, conversely, that act as important mediators of cell death. One way in which CTL/NK cells induce apoptosis of their targets is by exocytosis of specialized secretory granules, known as cytotoxic lymphocyte (CL) granules, in the vicinity of target cells (2Lieberman J.

The key constituents of CL granules are perforin, a pore-forming protein, and the granzymes (Gzm), a family of closely related cytotoxic serine proteases (5Masson D. Tschopp J.

Humans possess five granzymes exhibiting distinct enzymatic activities, although some of these enzymes await full characterization as substrates for some of the granzymes remain to be identified (7Grossman W.J.

At present, GzmA and GzmB are the most highly characterized granule proteases as the proteolytic specificity of these enzymes has been elucidated and some substrates have been identified (2Lieberman J.

Whereas GzmA is a tryptase, GzmB shares with the caspase family of proteases a preference for aspartate residues in the P1 position of its substrates (10Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D.

In addition, GzmB possesses an extended substrate specificity, determined by the recognition of P1′ and P2′ amino acid residues at the C terminus of the proteolytic cleavage site (10Harris J.L.

This extended specificity may explain, in part, the fact that although several hundred substrates have been identified for executioner caspases only a handful of GzmB targets have thus far been identified (14Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Current knowledge suggests that GzmB can induce apoptosis of target cells in two mechanistically distinct ways. GzmB can directly process caspases-3, -7, -8, and -10, thereby directly activating the cell death machinery (15Metkar S.S. Wang B. Ebbs M.L. Kim J.H. Lee Y.J. Raja S.M. Froelich C.J. J.

Browne K.A. Wowk M.E. Newbold A. Sutton V.R. Clarke C.J. Oliaro J. Lindemann R.K. Bird P.I. Johnstone R.W. Trapani J.A. J. Biol.

Proteolysis of Bid enhances its ability to translocate to mitochondria and trigger the opening of cytochrome c-releasing channels comprised of Bax and/or Bak oligomers (18Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L.

These two GzmB-initiated pathways converge at the point of engaging caspase-dependent cell death. However, several studies have shown that GzmB can kill target cells even in the presence of caspase inhibitors (19Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M.

This suggests that caspase-independent pathways regulated by GmzB may exist and predicts that as yet unidentified GzmB substrates may participate in caspase-independent killing (16Adrain C.

To further elucidate the mechanism of GzmB-dependent killing, we and others have undertaken screens to search for novel targets of this protease (12Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E.

Here, using a proteomics-based approach, we have identified α-tubulin as a GzmB substrate. α-Tubulin represents a highly sensitive target of GzmB as this major microtubule component is cleaved at concentrations of GzmB that fail to cleave caspase-3. GmzB-mediated proteolysis of purified α-tubulin dramatically enhanced the ability of the latter to assemble into microtubules, as assessed by in vitro polymerization assays. Moreover, delivery of GzmB into target cells resulted in an altered microtubule morphology characterized by increased microtubule length and diameter. Thus, targeting of microtubules by GzmB represents a novel biological end point for CTL/NK-mediated apoptosis. GzmB-mediated perturbation of microtubule networks during CTL/NK attack may contribute to disabling target cell function. Antibodies and Reagents—α-Tubulin and β-tubulin antibodies were purchased from MP Biomedicals; anti-caspase-3, anti-XIAP, and anti-Bid antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences; rhodamine-coupled anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Purified human granzyme B was purchased from Calbiochem; Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Bachem; immobilized pH gradient strips were purchased from Bio-Rad, and streptolysin-O was purchased from Aalto BioReagents. Oligofectamine and Genejuice were purchased from Invitrogen and Novagen, respectively. Unless stated otherwise, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts and Induction of Granzyme B- or Cytochrome c-induced Caspase Activation—Cell-free extracts were generated from exponentially growing healthy Jurkat T lymphocytic cells as previously described (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). For in vitro Granzyme-B-mediated activation of caspases, aliquots of cell-free extract were diluted 2-fold in cell extract buffer supplemented with a final concentration of 100 nm purified human granzyme-B and 5 μm Z-VAD-fmk. Alternatively, to trigger apoptosome-dependent caspase activation, bovine heart cytochrome c and dATP were added to parallel reactions to final concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 1 mm, respectively. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—For proteomic analysis, cell-free extracts were analyzed by isoelectric focusing (350 μg/gel) and two-dimensional electrophoresis as previously described (23Hill M.M. Adrain C. Duriez P.J. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2134-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Candidate protein spots were excised, trypsin-digested, and analyzed in positive reflectron mode in a Voyager DE Pro MALDI mass spectrometer (Applied Biosciences). After applying a filter to remove common background contaminant peaks, the de-isotoped spectra were submitted to the MS-Fit and MASCOT web-based databases for protein identification. Coupled in Vitro Transcription and Translation—35S-labeled proteins were generated using the TNT kit (Promega) as described previously (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Microtubule Polymerization Assays—Microtubule polymerization assays utilized purified bovine tubulin purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. To determine the effects of GzmB on microtubule polymerization rates, bovine tubulin was solubilized in polymerization buffer (80 mm piperazine-N,N′-bis[2-ethanesulfonic acid] sequisodium salt, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ethylene glycol-bis (b-amino-ethyl ether) N,N,N′,N′-tetra-acetic acid, pH 6.9, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol) at a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. Following incubation with GzmB for 40 min at 30 °C, polymerization of microtubules was stimulated by the addition of 1 mm guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP). Change in microtubule turbidity was monitored at 340 nm in an automated fluorimeter at 37 °C (Tecan). Loading of GzmB and Detection of Microtubule Morphology by Immunostaining—HeLa cells were plated on coverslips at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. 24 h later, cells were loaded with GzmB using sublytic doses of the pore-forming protein streptolysin-O (SLO). Briefly, an aliquot of SLO was pre-activated by incubating for 30 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were then washed in serum-free medium, followed by drop-wise addition of 110 μl of RPMI containing 6.5 μm dithiothreitol, 2.25 μg/ml of SLO, and 300 nm GzmB to the cell monolayers. Wells were flooded 30 min later with 2 ml of RPMI containing 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were cultured for a total of 7 h before fixation in phosphate-buffered saline/3% paraformaldehyde and immunostaining with anti-α-tubulin antibodies (clone DM1A) followed by rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies. Fluorescence images were acquired at ×60 and ×100 magnification on an Olympus UV microscope (Mason Technology). siRNA-mediated Ablation of α-Tubulin Expression Levels and Expression of Non-cleavable α-Tubulin—To examine the effects of siRNA-mediated ablation of α-tubulin, HeLa cells were transfected with Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following α-tubulin-specific oligos were used: Oligo 1, 5′-AAG TCC AAG CTG GAG TTC TCC-3′; Oligo 2, 5′-AAG GTA CAG AGA GCT GTG TGC-3′. As a negative control, an oligo specific to the nuclear matrix protein p84 was used: 5′-AAG UCC UGA UGU UCG GCG AGA-3′.To examine the effects of overexpression of non-cleavable α-tubulin, we transfected HeLa cells with Genejuice, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For apoptosis assays, HeLa cells were transfected with either siRNAs or α-tubulin expression plasmids for 24 h prior to exposure to pro-apoptotic stimuli or co-incubation with the NK cell line, YT. Identification of α-Tubulin as a Novel GzmB Target—To identify novel substrates of the CTL/NK protease GzmB, we utilized an in vitro assay in which cell-free extracts generated from Jurkat T lymphocytes were incubated with purified GzmB (16Adrain C. Murphy B.M. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4663-4673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To eliminate proteolytic events caused by caspases activated by GzmB, we exploited the fact that the inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk potently blocks caspase activity but does not inhibit GzmB (24Sarin A. Wu M.L. Henkart P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, under these conditions only GzmB-dependent changes were observed. To identify novel GzmB substrates, we incubated cell-free extracts in the presence of GzmB (100 nm) and Z-VAD-fmk and analyzed the extracts by isoelectric focusing coupled to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). This analysis revealed several protein spots that were consistently altered in a GzmB-dependent manner. In particular, two prominent protein spots were found to be altered upon incubation of cell-free extract in the presence of GzmB. As shown in Fig. 1A, one of these spots was a highly abundant protein present in untreated cell-free extracts that was lost upon incubation with GzmB, whereas the other was a novel protein spot that appeared only in GzmB-treated samples. Both of these spots were excised from two-dimensional gels and were identified by mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed that both protein spots were α-tubulin (Fig. 1B), strongly suggesting that this protein is a substrate for GzmB. These data are in agreement with a recent study that reported that murine GzmB cleaves α-tubulin (12Bredemeyer A.J. Lewis R.M. Malone J.P. Davis A.E. Gross J. Townsend R.R. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11785-11790Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Examination of the amino acid coverage identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the cleaved form of α-tubulin revealed peptide coverage of ∼70% of the α-tubulin sequence. This suggested that GzmB cleaves α-tubulin either within the first 20 amino acids or within the last ∼20 amino acids of the protein (Fig. 1C). GzmB-mediated Proteolysis of α-Tubulin in Vitro—To confirm that the alterations observed by two-dimensional gel analysis represented proteolysis of α-tubulin (as opposed to some other post-translational modification), we performed immunoblotting experiments. To this end, we treated Jurkat cell-free extract with purified GzmB, with or without Z-VAD-fmk, and monitored the electrophoretic mobility of α-tubulin by immunoblotting. As the MALDI-TOF mapping suggested that GzmB potentially removed only a small fragment from α-tubulin, we ran 8% SDS-PAGE gels in order to detect subtle changes in the molecular weight of this protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, within 15 min of the addition of 100 nm GzmB, α-tubulin became truncated to a lower molecular weight form, indicative of proteolysis. Importantly, proteolysis of α-tubulin was directly mediated by GzmB and not by adventitious caspase activity as addition of Z-VAD-fmk to extracts failed to block α-tubulin cleavage (Fig. 2A). By contrast, Z-VAD-fmk completely blocked processing of the caspase substrate XIAP (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, whereas α-tubulin was cleaved in a completely GzmB-dependent but caspase-independent manner, β-tubulin also appeared to be cleaved when Z-VAD-fmk was omitted from the reactions (Fig. 2A). Thus, GzmB selectively cleaves α-tubulin, and β-tubulin might be a substrate for caspase-mediated proteolysis (see below). α-Tubulin Is a Preferential Target of GzmB—To examine the relative susceptibility of α-tubulin to GzmB-mediated proteolysis compared with other GzmB substrates, we titrated GzmB into Jurkat cell-free extract. Once again, Z-VAD-fmk was included in all reactions to inhibit caspase activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, low concentrations of GzmB (25 nm) were sufficient to induce significant cleavage of α-tubulin and of the well known GzmB substrate Bid (Fig. 2B). By contrast, caspase-3 was somewhat less sensitive to GzmB-mediated cleavage under the same conditions. These data indicate that α-tubulin is cleaved by GzmB at concentrations of this granzyme that are comparable with those required to cleave Bid. GzmB-mediated Proteolysis of α-Tubulin during NK/GzmB-dependent Attack of Target Cells—Because some proteins are cleaved by GzmB in vitro but not in vivo, we next assessed whether proteolysis of α-tubulin occurred within the context of NK-mediated attack. To explore this, we exposed HeLa target cells to the NK cell line YT in the presence or the absence of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Consistent with previous reports, NK killing was comprised of caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent components (19Sarin A. Williams M.S. Alexander-Miller M.A. Berzofsky J.A. Zacharchuk C.M. Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 209-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 20Andrade F. Roy S. Nicholson D. Thornberry N. Rosen A. Casciola-Rosen L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27934-27938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk afforded only partial protection to HeLa cells from NK attack (Fig. 2C). Lysates generated from the apoptotic HeLa targets were then immunoblotted with tubulin-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2C, α-tubulin was completely cleaved in the HeLa targets even when caspases were inhibited. By contrast, loss of the full-length form of β-tubulin was blocked in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, again suggesting that β-tubulin may be cleaved by caspases but not directly by GzmB. These data show that NK killing instigates direct proteolysis of α-tubulin, most likely via GzmB. Caspases Cleave α- and β-Tubulin—Most, if not all, of the currently identified GzmB substrates are also substrates of executioner caspases. We therefore asked whether microtubules are also targeted by caspases during apoptosis. Similar proteomic-based experiments using Jurkat cell-free extracts in which caspases were activated using cytochrome c and dATP (to initiate assembly of the Apaf-1 apoptosome) identified the same α-tubulin proteolytic fragment that was detected in GzmB-treated cell-free extracts (Fig. 3A). To confirm α-tubulin proteolysis by caspases, we also Western blotted cell-free extracts that had been incubated in the presence or absence of cytochrome c/dATP (22Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, a truncated form of α-tubulin similar to the GzmB-cleaved form was observed, although this fragment appeared with slower kinetics than observed with GzmB (Fig. 2A). In addition, β-tubulin was found to be cleaved under these conditions, as indicated by loss of the full-length form of the protein (Fig. 3B). Thus, although GzmB selectively targets only one half of the tubulin dimer, caspases appear to cleave both isoforms of tubulin. Interestingly, neither form of tubulin was cleaved in parallel experiments using extracts generated from MCF-7 cells, which lack caspase-3 (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that caspase-3, or a protease activated downstream of caspase-3, is responsible for cleavage of both α- and β-tubulin. GzmB Cleavage of α-Tubulin at a Canonical Site Removes the C-terminal Acidic Tail Motif—We then sought to map the cleavage site for GzmB within α-tubulin. As GzmB exhibits a near absolute preference for Asp residues in the P1 position, we scanned the α-tubulin amino acid sequence for possible GzmB cleavage motifs. Inspection of the α-tubulin amino acid sequence identified only three candidate Asp residues in the areas outside the MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprint coverage, suggesting that GzmB cleaves α-tubulin at one or more of these sites (Fig. 1C). In addition, two-dimensional-based detection of full-length versus GzmB-truncated α-tubulin suggested that GzmB proteolysis generated a fragment with a substantially more basic isoelectric point than the full-length molecule (Fig. 1A). As the C-terminal tail of α-tubulin is highly enriched in acidic amino acids, removal of this region would generate a substantially more basic proteolytic fragment. Two amino acids (Asp431 and Asp438) within the α-tubulin tail therefore represented the most likely GzmB cleavage sites (Fig. 4A). Of particular interest, one of these motifs, VGVD↓SV highly resembled many previously identified GzmB cleavage sites, with a valine residue in the predicted P4 position and a highly conserved serine residue in the P1′ position that has been identified to play an important role in determining the extended substrate specificity of this granzyme (Fig. 4B) (10Harris J.L.

J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30751-30759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To identify the GzmB cleavage site, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change both candidate P1 aspartate residues to alanine. We then examined the ability of GzmB to cleave in vitro translated versions of these proteins. As shown in Fig. 4C, whereas the D431A mutant was cleaved as readily as wild-type α-tubulin, the D438A mutant was profoundly resistant to GzmB proteolysis. Thus, GzmB cleaves α-tubulin at a single canonical cleavage site (Asp438). We next asked whether caspases also cleave α-tubulin at this site, by adding the in vitro translated proteins into Jurkat cell-free extracts supplemented with cytochrome c/dATP. As shown in Fig. 4D, whereas the D431A mutant was cleaved by caspases, the D438A mutant resisted proteolysis. Therefore, both GzmB and caspases target α-tubulin at the same cleavage site. Inspection of the acidic tail of α-tubulin from several mammalian species revealed complete conservation of the GzmB/caspase cleavage site (Fig. 4E). Moreover, alignment of all the human α-tubulin isoforms revealed that this site was present in all α-tubulin isoforms except α-tubulin-4 (Fig. 4F). GzmB Enhances Microtubule Polymerization—α-Tubulin can be demarcated into several distinct domains, including the GTP binding motif in the N terminus and the acidic C-terminal tail (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, many studies have implicated the tubulin tail as a critical regulator of microtubule polymerization/aggregation (25Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharyya B. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10208-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is utilized in vivo by MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins) such as tau and MAP that bind to the tubulin tail to regulate microtubule polymerization dynamics (27Serrano L. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28Paschal B.M. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1989; 342: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Because GzmB cleavage removes the C-terminal 13 amino acids of the α-tubulin tail, we were interested to determine what effect this might have on microtubule polymerization. To explore this, we used highly purified bovine α- and β-tubulin that can be induced to form microtubules in vitro upon addition of GTP. Microtubule polymerization in vitro can be measured as an increase in absorbance at 340 nm (25Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharyya B. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10208-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Serrano L. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To analyze the effects of GzmB in this system, we preincubated unpolymerized tubulin with GzmB to facilitate tubulin proteolysis, after which GTP was added to stimulate microtubule polymerization. Because the GzmB cleavage site is conserved in bovine α-tubulin, we readily detected cleavage of the latter by GzmB (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5A, the kinetics of microtubule polymerization was dramatically enhanced in the GzmB-treated reaction compared with a mock-incubated buffer-alone control. Indeed, concentrations as low as ∼30 nm GzmB enhanced microtubule polymerization rates under reaction conditions where tubulins were present at >1000-fold molar excess compared with GzmB (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that GzmB-mediated removal of the acidic tail of α-tubulin dramatically alters the propensity of microtubules to form. Enhanced Microtubule Polymerization during GzmB-mediated Killing—To examine the effects of GzmB cleavage of α-tubulin in vivo, we loaded HeLa cells with GzmB using low doses of the bacterial pore-forming toxin, SLO. As shown in Fig. 6A, exposure of HeLa cells to GzmB/SLO rapidly induced apoptosis in the majority of these cells within 3.5 h. Because cells undergoing GzmB-mediated apoptosis rapidly detached from the substratum, we included the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) to delay cell detachment and other caspase-dependent features of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6A, inclusion of Z-VAD-fmk blocked the induction of apoptosis in the HeLa cells, enabling us to exclude caspase-dependent effects on microtubules. To visualize microtubules, cells treated with GzmB/SLO for 7 h were fixed and immunostained with the α-tubulin-specific monoclonal antibody DM1A. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, in cells treated with SLO alone or GzmB in the absence of SLO, the microtubule network appeared normal and was composed of fine filamentous tubules. In sharp contrast, many of the cells treated with GzmB/SLO exhibited abnormal microtubules that appeared noticeably thicker and longer than in untreated cells (Fig. 6, B and C). Note that inclusion of Z-VAD-fmk made it easier to visualize the changes to microtubule networks as this blocked rounding and detachment of cells due to caspase activation. These aberrant microtubules were particularly obvious where they projected into foci at the edges of the cells (Fig. 6C). Taken together with the in vitro data, these data suggest that GzmB-catalyzed removal of the α-tubulin tail perturbs normal microtubule networks and that this may contribute to the inactivation of target cells during CTL/NK-mediated killing. Role of α-Tubulin in Apoptosis—We next investigated whether manipulation of cellular α-tubulin levels could influence sensitivity to apoptosis. To this end, we designed two siRNA oligos to down-regulate α-tubulin expression (see “Experimental Procedures”). Based on sequence conservation, these siRNAs were designed to match the K-α1 and α-6 isoforms of α-tubulin, which represent the most abundant α-tubulin isoforms expressed in HeLa cells (29Verdier-Pinard P. Wang F. Burd B. Hogue Angeletti R. Band Horwitz S. Orr G.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12019-12027Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Verdier-Pinard P. Wang F. Martello L. Burd B. Orr G.A. Band Horwitz S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that these siRNAs exhibited sequence mismatches toward other α-tubulin isoforms, including α-tubulin-2 and α-tubulin-8, and may not silence expression of these isoforms. As shown in Fig. 7A, transfection of HeLa cells with either siRNA achieved a significant, but incomplete, down-regulation of α-tubulin. Down-regulation of α-tubulin induced apoptosis in 25–30% of cells, whereas a control siRNA did not elicit this effect (Fig. 7B). This is consistent with the known ability of microtubule-disrupting drugs such as vinblastine and vincristine to promote apoptosis. Moreover, transfection with α-tubulin siRNA also increased the frequency of mitotic cells in the cultures (Fig. 7C), which is not unexpected given that tubulin is required to form the spindle apparatus essential for sister chromatid separation during mitosis. We also asked whether siRNA-mediated silencing of α-tubulin in HeLa cells increased their susceptibility to YT-mediated killing. However, as shown in Fig. 7D, this treatment did not enhance NK-mediated killing above the levels seen using control oligos. This result is compatible with the view that CTL/NK cells most likely utilize multiple parallel strategies (via cleavage of Bid, caspases, and perhaps other substrates) to disable target cells and that disruption of microtubule networks is only one component of the CTL/NK killing process. Notwithstanding this, we were interested to determine whether expression of a non-cleavable (D438A) α-tubulin mutant could alter the kinetics or morphology of YT-mediated killing. However, as shown in supplemental Fig. S1, expression of non-cleavable α-tubulin elicited little or no impact upon cell death induced by NK cells or by the cytotoxic drug actinomycin D. However, it is important to note that we were unable to detect overexpression of either wild-type α-tubulin or of the α-tubulin point mutants in HeLa cells. This is most likely because of the very high levels of endogenous α-tubulin expressed in these and many other cells (30Verdier-Pinard P. Wang F. Martello L. Burd B. Orr G.A. Band Horwitz S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also made similar observations using human embryonic kidney 293T cells (data not shown). We can readily rule out trivial reasons for the latter observations as all tubulin constructs were fully sequenced and were translatable using an in vitro transcription/translation system (see Fig. 4C). Thus, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the non-cleavable α-tubulin mutant may interfere with the kinetics or phenotype of apoptosis under circumstances where sufficient amounts of this protein can be expressed to compete effectively with wild-type α-tubulin. Future investigations will explore this possibility. The present study demonstrates that severing of microtubules by GzmB-dependent or caspase-dependent proteolysis is characteristic of apoptosis induced by CTL/NK attack as well as by other triggers of cell death. Whereas both α- and β-tubulin subunits were readily processed by caspases, GzmB preferentially hydrolyzed α-tubulin and did not cleave β-tubulin. We also show that cleavage of microtubules by GzmB dramatically enhanced their polymerization rates and led to aberrant microtubule networks. Therefore, proteolysis of tubulin by GzmB is likely to impair microtubule function during CTL/NK-mediated killing. It has long been established that the microtubule network fulfills numerous critical biological roles. These include, but are not restricted to, coordinating sister chromosome separation during mitosis, transporting of vesicles and organelles, and regulating cell motility (31Small J.V. Geiger B. Kaverina I. Bershadsky A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). In addition, many viruses exploit the host microtubule network upon entry into host cells (33Dohner K. Nagel C.H. Sodeik B. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 320-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In light of these diverse biological roles, it is not surprising that pharmacological interference with microtubule stability has been successfully exploited as an important chemotherapeutic strategy (32Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). As well as inhibiting mitosis of tumor cells, microtubule poisons also trigger apoptosis in many contexts (34Martin S.J. Cotter T.G. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1990; 23: 545-559PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have found that both GzmB and caspases cleave a site within the α-tubulin C terminus. In this context, it is interesting to note that previous studies have highlighted a critical role for this disordered and highly acidic region as a regulator of microtubule polymerization dynamics (25Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharyya B. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol.

In agreement with our observations using GzmB, studies using the Bacillus subtilis protease subtilisin have demonstrated that removal of the C-terminal tail from α- and β-tubulin dramatically enhances the propensity of microtubules to polymerize (25Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 43-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bhattacharyya B. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10208-10216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have identified a motif (Glu447-Gly-Glu-Glu450) within the extreme C terminus of tubulin as being responsible for binding to MAPs such as MAP2, tau, and Dynein (27Serrano L. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28Paschal B.M. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1989; 342: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MAPs can be subdivided into two biological categories: MAP2 and tau regulate tubulin polymerization, whereas dynein and other molecular motors facilitate cargo transport (32Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar). Proteolytic removal of the tubulin C terminus by subtilisin digestion renders tubulin insensitive to binding of MAP proteins and impairs dynein and kinesin activity in vitro (28Paschal B.M. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1989; 342: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Wang Z. Sheetz M.P. Biophys.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we have identified that endogenous proteases can proteolytically remove the MAP binding region within tubulin during apoptosis. This would predictably have severe consequences for the regulation of microtubule function, causing deregulated microtubule polymerization dynamics (Figs. 5 and 6) or abrogating microtubule-dependent motor protein activity. In light of their important biological roles, it is interesting and perhaps predictable that microtubules constitute targets of cell death-associated caspases and of GzmB. Severing of microtubules represents a novel biological function for GzmB during NK/CTL killing and may complement additional GzmB-dependent killing mechanisms (via Bid and caspases) to limit the mitotic potential of tumor cells. Alternatively, because microtubules are known to be exploited by viruses for entry as well as exit from the host cell, it is possible that disruption of microtubule function by GzmB may help to rapidly terminate virion production in infected target cells.

https://openalex.org/W2078235041,"Many ATP-dependent molecular chaperones, including Hsp70, Hsp90, and the chaperonins GroEL/Hsp60, require cofactor proteins to regulate their ATPase activities and thus folding functions in vivo. One conspicuous exception has been the eukaryotic chaperonin CCT, for which no regulator of its ATPase activity, other than non-native substrate proteins, is known. We identify the evolutionarily conserved PhLP3 (phosducin-like protein 3) as a modulator of CCT function in vitro and in vivo. PhLP3 binds CCT, spanning the cylindrical chaperonin cavity and contacting at least two subunits. When present in a ternary complex with CCT and an actin or tubulin substrate, PhLP3 significantly diminishes the chaperonin ATPase activity, and accordingly, excess PhLP3 perturbs actin or tubulin folding in vitro. Most interestingly, however, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PhLP3 homologue is required for proper actin and tubulin function. This cellular role of PhLP3 is most apparent in a strain that also lacks prefoldin, a chaperone that facilitates CCT-mediated actin and tubulin folding. We propose that the antagonistic actions of PhLP3 and prefoldin serve to modulate CCT activity and play a key role in establishing a functional cytoskeleton in vivo.

We propose that the antagonistic actions of PhLP3 and prefoldin serve to modulate CCT activity and play a key role in establishing a functional cytoskeleton in vivo. A significant proportion of proteins requires the assistance of molecular chaperones to ensure proper biogenesis during and following translation on ribosomes (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar, 2Stirling P.C. Lundin V.F. Leroux M.R. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 565-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Most chaperones that actively fold polypeptides depend on ATP hydrolysis, a process often regulated by cofactor proteins. For example, Hsp40 modulates the ATPase function of Hsp70, whereas factors such as GrpE or Bag1 control nucleotide exchange (3Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5930-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). One class of toroid-shaped chaperones, termed chaperonins, are conserved across all domains of life and assist the folding of many cytosolic proteins (7Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J.

In eukaryotes, the chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT 3The abbreviations used are: CCT, chaperonin containing TCP-1; PFD, prefoldin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MAP, microtubule associated protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, or 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; rho, rhodamine.3The abbreviations used are: CCT, chaperonin containing TCP-1; PFD, prefoldin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MAP, microtubule associated protein; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; DAPI, or 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole; rho, rhodamine., also termed TRiC or c-cpn) consists of two stacked rings each formed by eight related subunits (1Hartl F.U.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). CCT binds substrate proteins and, through ATP-dependent conformational changes, encapsulates them in a central cavity. Upon release into the cytosol, the substrates may have folded to the native state or may require additional rounds of CCT binding and release (10Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 11Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). CCT is required for folding nascent actin and tubulin and has been shown by immunoprecipitation studies to interact with a wide range (∼10%) of polypeptides, many of which may be substrates (7Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Unlike other ATP-dependent chaperones, there is no evidence that CCT cooperates with protein cofactors to modulate its ATP hydrolysis. Hop/p60, a cofactor of Hsp70 and Hsp90, promotes nucleotide exchange by CCT in vitro, but the significance of these findings is unknown (12Gebauer M. Melki R. Gehring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29475-29480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CCT differs from its bacterial chaperonin counterpart, GroEL, in that it does not encapsulate its substrates with a GroES-like cofactor that fits over the chaperonin cavity (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Instead, built-in protrusions within the apical regions of CCT close the central cavity during folding (9Spiess C. Meyer A.S. Reissmann S. Frydman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 13Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). At least for actins and tubulins, another chaperone, prefoldin (PFD, also named GimC), participates in CCT-mediated folding. PFD is a heterohexameric complex that uses its octopus-like structure to clamp onto non-native proteins (14Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I.

In eukaryotes, PFD interacts with nascent chains and facilitates their transfer to CCT via direct interactions with the chaperonin (11Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A.

Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) by a mechanism that is not understood. Recently, PhLP1 (phosducin-like protein 1) was shown to inhibit CCT-mediated folding, and a regulatory interaction was proposed (20McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosducin, which does not interact with CCT, modulates retinal phototransduction by binding Gβγ subunits of transducin and preventing their reassociation with Gα following a signaling event (20McLaughlin J.N.

The three known families of phosducin-like proteins likely participate in G-protein signaling, but they have also been implicated in other processes. PhLP1, a close relative of phosducin, binds newly made Gβ and assists in the assembly of a Gβγ complex (22Lukov G.L. Hu T. McLaughlin J.N. Hamm H.E. Willardson B.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1965-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A recent electron microscopy reconstruction of a mammalian CCT-PhLP1 complex shows that PhLP1 binds to the apical domains of multiple chaperonin subunits, simultaneously occluding the cavity of the cis ring and altering the conformation of the trans ring (23Martín-Benito J. Bertrand S. Hu T. Ludtke P.J. McLaughlin J.N. Willardson B.M. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17410-17415Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the biological consequence of PhLP1 binding to the chaperonin is not completely understood. PhLP2 has an unknown but essential function in yeast and Dictyostelium, where it has been implicated in cell cycle progression and G-protein signaling (24Blaauw M. Knol J.C. Kortholt A. Ruchira Roelofs J. Postma M. Visser A.J. van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5047-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Flanary P.L. DiBello P.R. Estrada P. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18462-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PhLP3 (called APACD or TXNDC9 in mammals) has been linked to G-protein signaling in yeast but also influences tubulin function in both yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans (25Flanary P.L. DiBello P.R. Estrada P. Dohlman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18462-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Lacefield S. Solomon F.

Deletion of the yeast PhLP3 gene orthologue, PLP1, rescues the benomyl supersensitivity of strains such as pac10Δ (a PFD subunit) or tub3Δ (an α-tubulin variant) that have an excess of undimerized β-tubulin (26Lacefield S. Solomon F. Genetics. 2003; 165: 531-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Folded but undimerized β-tubulin is thought to interfere with normal microtubule assembly/function and is toxic when not associated with α-tubulin. Plp1p does not affect the levels of β-tubulin but rather its stability, so that in the absence of Plp1p some β-tubulin appears in nontoxic aggregates. Aside from the presence of aggregates, the deletion of PLP1 in yeast has not been shown to possess obvious defects, consistent with the wild-type (WT) phenotype of PhLP3 knockouts in Dictyostelium discoideum (24Blaauw M. Knol J.C. Kortholt A. Ruchira Roelofs J. Postma M. Visser A.J. van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5047-5057Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlike yeast and Dictyostelium, however, C. elegans PhLP3 is essential as its disruption by RNA interference results in a failure of the first embryonic cell division. The arrested embryos possess short astral microtubules compared with control embryos, suggesting that PhLP3 plays a role in microtubule organization (27Ogawa S. Matsubayashi Y. Nishida E.

We show that PhLP3 forms ternary complexes with CCT and either actin or tubulin and negatively impacts their folding. Functional assays suggest that this occurs by slowing the ATPase activity of the chaperonin and not through direct competition with substrates. In vivo, yeast PhLP3 appears to coordinate the proper biogenesis of actin and tubulin with PFD. Our results identify PhLP3 as a novel CCT cofactor and suggest that the balance of PhLP3 and PFD activities helps CCT modulate the levels of folded actin and tubulin, an essential process for maintenance of a functional cytoskeleton. Purification of PhLP3 and CCT—Human PhLP3 (full-length; GenBank™ accession number NM_005783) and a truncated version (tPhLP3; residues 1–193), cloned into pRSET6a, or GST-tagged variants (Fig. 1F) cloned into pGEX-6p, were produced in BL21[DE3]pLysS as described (16Lundin V.F. Stirling P.C. Gomez-Reino J. Mwenifumbo J.C. Obst J.M. Valpuesta J.M. Leroux M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4367-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies were washed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.75% Triton X-100, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 8 m urea, pH 8.0, filtered, and passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing pure PhLP3 or tPhLP3 were refolded by dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0. GST-tagged proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). CCT was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate as described (28Melki R. Batelier G. Soulie S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and was shown to be functional by its ability to refold denatured actin in vitro (data not shown and see Ref. 28Melki R. Batelier G. Soulie S. Williams Jr., R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc-PhLP3 or empty vector with PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). For immunoprecipitations, HEK cells were lysed mechanically in IP buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with anti-Myc beads (Covance) at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were washed three times in IP buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. TCP1 was detected with a rat anti-TCP1 antibody (StressGen Biotechnology). Cell lysate supernatants were fractionated on a Superose 6 column PC3.2/30 (Amersham Biosciences). 52-μl fractions were collected, and 10 μl of each was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western-blotted for Myc or TCP1. Separately run size standards were blue dextran (2 MDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), aldolase (150 kDa), serum albumin (69 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). In Vitro Translation, Folding Assays, and GST Pull-downs—Actin and tubulin were translated with the T7 quick-coupled translation kit (Promega) in the presence of 2 μm recombinant PhLP3 or tPhLP3 (29Cowan N.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Leroux M.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 140: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). At time points, aliquots of the reaction were frozen in native gel running buffer and then thawed on ice and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis (30Leroux M.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 140: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). GST pull-downs were done according to the manufacturer's instructions by using glutathione-Sepharose-4B (Amersham Biosciences). CCT (∼100 nm) was incubated with ∼10× m excesses of GST, GST-PhLP3, or GST-PhLP3 and 30× excess untagged PhLP3. GST-fused truncations of PhLP3 were incubated in 10% reticulocyte lysate (Promega) for 30 min on ice. Verification of Actin and Tubulin Folding Inhibition by PhLP3—We verified that PhLP3 inhibited native actin production by the addition of DNase I, which interacts only with native actin. In the absence of full-length PhLP3, a new band corresponding to a DNase I-actin complex appeared, but when PhLP3 was present, no such shift was observed because of the lack of native actin (see Ref. 30Leroux M.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 140: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). To positively identify the lowest band in the tubulin-folding assay, we added taxol to the reactions to stabilize microtubules, thus removing αβ-heterodimers from the material loaded on the gel. The intensity of the lowest band was diminished in the presence of taxol, indicating that heterodimers are present (data not shown). However, the band did not disappear completely, leaving the possibility that some β-tubulin-cofactor A complex is present. 35S-Actin and β-tubulin were expressed and purified as described (30Leroux M.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 140: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase Activity Measurements—ATP hydrolysis at 30 °C was measured in folding buffer containing 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP and either 1 μm CCT alone, CCT with denatured client proteins (0.1 mg/ml actin or β-tubulin), CCT with PhLP3 (0.9 mg/ml) or CCT with denatured client proteins and either full-length or truncated PhLP3 (tPhLP3 at 1.1 mg/ml), by extraction of the [32P] phosphomolybdate complex formed in 1 N HCl as described (31Melki R. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8921-8932Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purification of Tubulin and Microtubule-associated Proteins—Dimeric αβ-tubulin was purified from pig brain by three polymerization cycles followed by phosphocellulose chromatography and stored at –80 °C in buffer D (0.05 m PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 3.4 m glycerol, and 200 μm GTP) (32Melki R. Fievez S. Carlier M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12038-12045Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MAPs were isolated from microtubules by phosphocellulose and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography (33Kuznetsov S.A. Rodionov V.I. Gelfand V.I. Rosenblat V.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 135: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C in buffer D. Co-sedimentation Assay—Microtubules (50 μm tubulin) were assembled in buffer E (0.1 m K3PO4, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and a 2 m excess of taxol. After 15 min at 37 °C, the microtubule solution was supplemented with PhLP3 (to 50 μm) or MAPs (to 0.5 mg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before spinning at 200,000 × g at 37 °C for 10 min in a TL100-Tabletop ultracentrifuge (Beckman). Supernatant and pellet fractions were then analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Sedimentation Velocity Measurements—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a 60 Ti four-hole rotor and cells with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Measurements were made at 45,000 rpm and 15 °C using tubulin and PhLP3 (0.3 and 0.44 mg/ml, respectively) in buffer E. The apparent distributions of sedimentation coefficients were obtained with the program DCDT (34Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Sample Preparation for Electron Microscopy—CCT was purified from bovine testis as described previously (15Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The CCT-PhLP3 complexes were formed by incubating CCT and PhLP3 in a 1:10 molar ratio for 30 min at 25 °C. The CCT-tubulin complexes were formed by denaturing bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and subsequent 100-fold dilution in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) containing 0.9 μm purified CCT (chaperonin:tubulin molar ratio of 1:12). For the ternary complex between CCT, PhLP3, and unfolded tubulin, denatured tubulin was diluted 100 times in buffer containing PhLP3. After 5 min, CCT was added so that the CCT:PhLP3:tubulin molar ratio was 1:10:10. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—For electron microscopy of the various CCT complexes, 5-μl aliquots were applied to glow-discharged carbon grids for 1 min and then stained for 1 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were recorded at 0°-tilt in a JEOL 1200EX-II electron microscope operated at 100 kV and recorded at ×60,000 nominal magnification. Micrographs were digitized in a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a sampling window corresponding to 3.5 Å/pixel. For two-dimensional classification and averaging, top views of CCT particles were selected, classified, and averaged using a maximum-likelihood multireference refinement algorithm (35Scheres S.H.W.

Yeasts were grown on YPD or YPD + 200 μg/ml geneticin sulfate (Invitrogen). Matings and tetrad dissections were performed as described (37Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 139-159Google Scholar). Latrunculin B (Sigma) sensitivity assays were performed according to Ref. 38Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar. For microscopy, cells were grown to mid-log phase before live imaging or formaldehyde or methanol:acetic acid fixing and staining with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (rho-phalloidin) or 4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions (37Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 139-159Google Scholar). For cell sizing, cell diameters were measured perpendicular to the mother-bud axis at the largest point. Cellular defects were statistically validated using either an independent variable t test or χ2 analysis as appropriate.

Open table in a new tab Native PhLP3 Associates with CCT Likely as a Monomer Using Both N and C Termini—Based on literature showing that PhLP1 interacts with CCT, and that yeast and C. elegans PhLP3 are implicated in β-tubulin folding and microtubule dynamics, respectively (20McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Lacefield S. Solomon F. Genetics. 2003; 165: 531-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ogawa S. Matsubayashi Y. Nishida E. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we investigated whether mammalian PhLP3 also interacts with CCT. It could not be assumed that PhLP3 would bind CCT, as it has only 15% identity and 37% similarity to human PhLP1, whereas phosducin, which does not bind CCT, is 38% identical and 64% similar to PhLP1. However, translation of PhLP3 cDNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate followed by native gel analysis showed a radiolabeled CCT co-migrating band similar to that seen for nascent actin (Fig. 1A). To observe the association of PhLP3 and CCT in vivo, we expressed Myc epitope-tagged PhLP3 in HEK cells and immunoprecipitated PhLP3 using a monoclonal antibody specific for the Myc epitope. CCT was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated from Myc-PhLP3-expressing cells but not from cells transfected with vector alone (Fig. 1B), suggesting that PhLP3 interacts physiologically with CCT. To assess whether the interaction is direct or indirect, we expressed and purified recombinant GST-tagged PhLP3 from Escherichia coli, and we found that GST-PhLP3, but not GST alone, precipitated purified CCT complex in pull-down assays, indicating that CCT directly interacts with PhLP3 (Fig. 1C). GST-tagged PhLP3 also selectively bound CCT from either HEK cell or rabbit reticulocyte lysates (data not shown). The interaction of the purified components likely involves native PhLP3 because addition of excess folded (native) untagged PhLP3 (see below) competes with GST-PhLP3 for CCT binding in solution (Fig. 1D). These findings provide evidence that PhLP3 interacts with CCT in vivo in a folded, native form, rather than as a non-native substrate, similar to PhLP1 (20McLaughlin J.N. Thulin C.D. Hart S.J. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Willardson B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7962-7967Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Untagged recombinant PhLP3 adopts a high degree of secondary structure and is thermally stable by circular dichroism, two indications that it is properly folded (data not shown). Moreover, PhLP3-CCT complexes resemble native PhLP1-CCT complexes by electron microscopy, and PhLP3 does not behave like a non-native substrate in functional assays with CCT (see Figs. 4, 5, 6 below). Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation yielded measurements of 2.7 S for PhLP3, consistent with its 26.5-kDa monomeric size (Fig. 2B). Additionally, when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, Myc-PhLP3 from HEK cell extracts eluted not only at the position predicted for a PhLP3 monomer but also co-eluted with CCT (Fig. 1E). Our observations are therefore consistent with the existence of cytosolic monomeric and CCT-associated forms of PhLP3. Indeed, we also observed a cytosolic staining pattern for Myc- and green fluorescent protein-tagged PhLP3 by immunocytochemistry (data"
https://openalex.org/W2040529878,"Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that plays a critical role in many physiologic processes such as T-cell activation, skeletal myocyte differentiation, and cardiac hypertrophy. We previously showed that active MEKK3 is capable of stimulating calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling in cardiac myocytes through phosphorylation of modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 (MCIP1). However, the protein kinases that function downstream of MEKK3 to mediate MCIP1 phosphorylation and the mechanism of MCIP1-mediated calcineurin regulation have not been defined. Here, we show that MEK5 and big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1) function downstream of MEKK3 in a signaling cascade that induces calcineurin activity through phosphorylation of MCIP1. Genetic studies showed that BMK1-deficient mouse lung fibroblasts failed to mediate MCIP1 phosphorylation and activate calcineurin/NFAT in response to angiotensin II, a potent NFAT activator. Conversely, restoring BMK1 to the deficient cells restored angiotensin II-mediated calcineurin/NFAT activation. Thus, using BMK1-deficient mouse lung fibroblast cells, we provided the genetic evidence that BMK1 is required for angiotensin II-mediated calcineurin/NFAT activation through MICP1 phosphorylation. Finally, we discovered that phosphorylated MCIP1 dissociates from calcineurin and binds with 14-3-3, thereby relieving its inhibitory effect on calcineurin activity. In summary, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized essential regulatory role of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in calcineurin activation through the reversible phosphorylation of a calcineurin-interacting protein, MCIP1.

Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive process accompanied with a series of changes in gene expression allowing the heart to maintain or increase cardiac output in response to increased workload. Prolonged hypertrophy, usually secondary to other pathology (e.g. hypertension), often leads to irreversible cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The pathological hypertrophy response is characterized by the transcriptional activation of fetal genes encoding contractile proteins. Numerous signal transduction pathways have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, many of which are mediated by intracellular calcium signaling (13mFrey N. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin is an especially effective inducer of cardiac growth and has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for hypertrophy in response to physiological and pathological stimuli (7Molkentin J.D.

Consistent with the notion that NFAT mediates cardiac hypertrophy, forced expression of an active form of NFATc4 is sufficient to induce hypertrophy (7Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B.

In addition to the well known Ca2+-calmodulin-mediated regulation of calcineurin activity, other calcineurin-interacting proteins are believed to play a regulatory role in calcineurin activity. One such protein is modulatory calcineurin-interacting protein 1 (MCIP1). MCIP1 was first cloned as the product of the Down syndrome critical region 1 gene on chromosome 21 (19Fuentes J. Pritchard M. Planas A. Bosch A. Ferrer I. Estivill X. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1935-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). MCIP1 is expressed at the highest levels in striated muscles and brain (20Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and interacts with the catalytic domain of CnA. The function of MCIP1 as a suppressor of calcineurin activity has been defined largely from studies of MCIP1 overexpression and supports the hypothesis that high levels of MCIP1 antagonize the pro-hypertrophic actions of calcineurin. For example, cardiac overexpression of MCIP1 in transgenic mice diminishes hypertrophy in response to overexpression of a constitutively active form of calcineurin, as well as to chronic isoproterenol administration, pressure overload, and exercise (21Hill J.A. Rothermel B. Yoo K-D. Cabuay B. Demetroulis E. Weiss R.M. Kutschke W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol.

Recent evidence indicates that the phosphorylation of RCN1, a yeast ortholog of MCIP1, enhances calcineurin activity (23Hilioti Z. Gallagher D.A. Low-Nam S.T. Ramaswamy P. Gajer P. Kingsbury T.J. Birchwood C.J. Levchenko A. Cunningham K.W. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our more recent findings that MEKK3-induced calcineurin/NFAT activation is associated with the phosphorylation of MCIP1 are in good agreement with the report. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the phosphorylation of MCIP1 switches its inhibitory effect to a stimulatory effect on calcineurin signaling remain unknown. Here we sought initially to identify protein kinases functioning downstream of MEKK3 to mediate MCIP1 phosphorylation and activate calcineurin-NFAT signaling. Next we wished to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the phosphorylation of MCIP1 results in the activation of calcineurin. We determined that MEK5 and BMK1 function downstream of MEKK3 in a signaling cascade that is required for MCIP1 phosphorylation and calcineurin activation. We discovered that phosphorylated MCIP1 dissociates from calcineurin and associates with 14-3-3, thereby relieving its inhibitory effect on calcineurin activity. Thus, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized essential regulatory role of MAP kinase signaling in calcineurin activation through the phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of MCIP1 from calcineurin. Mammalian Expression Constructs and Reporter Constructs—Plasmids for HA-tagged or non-HA-tagged MEKK3 (wild type (WT), constitutively active (CA), and dominant negative (DN)) have been described (24Chao T.H.

The dominant negative MEK5 expression vector was constructed by replacing serine 311 and threonine 315 with alanine. The dominant negative BMK1 expression vector was generated by replacing threonine 218 and tyrosine 220 with alanine and phenylalanine.

Mutants of MCIP1 were generated as follows: an alanine was substituted for the serines at positions 108 and 112 using a PCR-directed mutagenesis technique as described previously (31Maruta H. Holden J. Sizeland A. D'Abaco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11661-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MEKK3 Small Interference RNA—The mammalian expression vector pSUPER (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used for expression of MEKK3 siRNA in the cells. For expressing short hairpin RNA, one siRNA targeting MEKK3 with the following sense and antisense sequences was fused to pSUPER-MEKK3: 5′-GATCCCCGCAAGGAGGTGAGTGCTCTTTCAAGAGAAGAGCACTCACCTCTTGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGCAAGGAGGTGAGTGCTCTTCTCTTGAAAGAGCACTCACCTCTTGCGGG-3′. The two oligonucleotides were annealed and subcloned into pSUPER vector digested with HindIII and BglII. Antibodies—Anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-FLAG, anti-calcineurin A (CnA), and anti-14-3-3 were purchased from Sigma. Anti-BMK1, anti-phospho-BMK1, and anti-MEKK3 were purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA). Cell Culture—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (1–2 days old) were isolated as described previously (59) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT). The cells were plated in six-well dishes (21 cm2/well) at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well for transient transfection experiments (32Xia Y. McMillin J.B. Lewis A. Moore M. Zhu W.G. Williams R.S. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1855-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After 24 h, for some experiments the cells were rinsed and then maintained for the remainder of the experiment in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin with or without Ang II treatment. CHO-AT1 cells were cultured as described previously (33Xia Y. Wen H.Y. Kellems R.E. J. Biol.

The suspended cells were transiently transfected with various expression plasmids. 48 h after transfection, the cellular extracts were collected and used for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation assays. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Primary cardiac myocytes were cotransfected with a 4 × NFAT-luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) and various expression plasmids (0.1 μg) that use the cytomegalovirus promoter to drive expression of the WT, CA, or DN form of MEKK3, respectively, as described (34Xia Y.

In addition, 4 × NFAT-luciferase reporter plasmids were cotransfected with constitutively active MEKK3 in the presence of constitutively active or dominant negative MEK5, MEK6, MEK7, or BMK1 in a dosage range of 0.1–1 μg. The pCMVlacZ plasmid (1 μg) was used as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. The data are presented as fold increases in luciferase activity relative to the activity of β-galactosidase. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Full-length Myc-MCIP1 constructs were transiently cotransfected with wild type or dominant negative forms of FLAG-tagged BMK1 with or without various forms of HA-MEK5 or HA-MEKK3 (wild type, constitutively active, or dominant negative) into CHO-AT1 cells. Similarly, cellular extracts were collected from CHO-AT1 cells cotransfected with Myc-MCIP1 with or without constitutively active MEKK3 or MEK5 in the presence of wild type or dominant negative BMK1. Finally, Myc-MCIP1, Myc-S112A-MCIP1, Myc-S108A-MCIP1, or Myc-S112A/S108A-MCIP1 constructs were cotransfected with the pIRES-HA-14-3-3ϵ/Myc-14-3-3ζ expression plasmid in the presence or absence of constitutively active MEKK3. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer, consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P40, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations were performed with specific antibodies, respectively, with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed with specific antibodies, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (35Xia Y. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12593-12598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Vivo [35S]Methionine Labeling and Immunoprecipitation Pull-down Assay—CHO-AT1 cells (36Thway T.M. Shlykov S.G. Day M.C. Sanborn B.M. Gilstrap L.C. II I Xia Y. Kellems R.E. Circulation. 2004; 110: 1612-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with Myc-MCIP1 expression plasmids with or without constitutively active MEKK3 or MEK5 in the presence or absence of dominant negative BMK1. 12 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and changed to serum-free and methionine-free DMEM and labeled with 100–300 μCi of [35S]methionine/ml in 2 ml of medium in 10-cm Petri dishes. 12 h after the incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed immediately with immunoprecipitation lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc as described above. After three washes, the immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and exposed to x-ray film for 48 h. Generation of MEKK3–/– Murine Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFs) and Stable Transformants—The matings of MEKK3+/– mice were timed, and the embryos generated were dissected at embryonic day 9.5 as described (37Yang J. Boerm M. McCarty M. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Zhuang Y. Su B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Yolk sacs were isolated and genotyped with the use of the polymerase chain reaction; each individual embryo was homogenized and treated with trypsin for 30 min. After washing with DMEM (1 ml) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, the embryonic fibroblast cells were cultured in 6-well plates that had been coated with 0.1% gelatin in DMEM with 15% fetal bovine serum. Genotypes of the established MEFs were further confirmed, after three or four passages, by Southern blot and PCR analysis (38Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To establish stable MEKK3 transformants, pBabe-HA-MEKK3 expression vector (2 μg) was transfected into 5 × 106 MEKK3–/– MEF cells in a 10-cm dish. Two days after transfection, the cells were treated for 8–10 days with puromycin (3 μg/ml). The puromycin-resistant clones were collected and are referred to as the MEKK3–/+ cells herein. Establishment of BMK1–/– Murine Lung Capillary Fibroblast Lines by Adeno-Cre Virus Infection—Mouse capillary fibroblast lines were prepared from BMK1flox/flox mice as described previously (39Hayashi M. Kim S.W. Imanaka-Yoshida K. Yoshida T. Abel E.D. Eliceiri B. Yang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1138-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fibroblast lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and interferon-γ (10 units/ml) at 33 °C. The cells were infected with either or in combination with Ade, Ade-Cre, and Ade-BMK1 for 12 h. 12 h following infection, the cells were cotransfected with expression construct encoding active MEKK3 in the presence of either NFAT-luciferase reporter construct or Myc-tagged MCIP1 expression plasmid. 24–48 h later, the cells were lysed for NFAT-luciferase activity measurement or Western blot analysis to determine the phosphorylation status of MCIP1 as described above. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—Rat neonatal cardiac myocytes were transfected with an expression construct encoding murine MCIP1 with Myc tag or wild type MEKK3 with HA tag. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with or without Ang II from 0 to 60 min. Then cellular extracts were collected as described above. The lysates were treated with 1 unit of calf alkaline phosphatase/100 ml of cellular lysates at room temperature for 30 min (Roche Applied Science) (40Shahrzad A. Rodney Bing Su Kellems E. Yang Jianhua Xia Yang J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36737-36746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The samples were processed for Western blot analysis as described above. Statistical Analysis—All of the values are expressed as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed for statistical significance using GraphPad Prism software. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test or analysis of variance test. A value of p < 0.05 was interpreted to mean that observed experimental differences were statistically significant. MEK5 and BMK1 Function Downstream of MEKK3 to Stimulate Calcineurin/NFAT Signaling—Previously we showed that MEKK3 is capable of activating calcineurin/NFAT signaling. To identify the signaling pathway functioning downstream of MEKK3 leading to calcineurin/NFAT activation, we tested the effect of a panel of inhibitors on MEKK3-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 1A). NFAT activation was inhibited not only by FK506, which is consistent with our early study (40Shahrzad A. Rodney Bing Su Kellems E. Yang Jianhua Xia Yang J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36737-36746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but also by staurosporin, which is a general serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitor. NFAT activation was partially inhibited by PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. However, MEKK3-induced NFAT activation was not inhibited by compounds that inhibit Raf (ZM336372), Ras (FPT inhibitor III), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (HA-89), calmodulin kinase (AIP), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002 or wortmannin), or mTOR (rapamycin). Conversely, p38 inhibitors (SB203580 and SB202190) and a c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor showed a slight increase in NFAT activation. These results are consistent with previous reports that inhibition of p38 or Jun kinase results in NFAT activation (41Braz J.C. Bueno O.F. Liang Q. Wilkins B.J. Dai Y.S. Parsons S. Braunwart J. Glascock B.J. Klevitsky R. Kimball T.F. Hewett T.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 42Liang Q. Bueno O.F. Wilkins B.J. Kuan C.Y. Xia Y. Molkentin J.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5079-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Overall, the results shown in Fig. 1A demonstrate that MEKK3-mediated calcineurin/NFAT activation is potentially mediated through a MAPKK family member but is independent of the Ras/Raf pathway. Previous studies demonstrated that MEK5 and BMK1 function downstream of MEKK3 in epidermal growth factor induced mitogenesis (24Chao T.H. Hayashi M. Tapping R.I. Kato Y. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36035-36038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 28Kato Y. Zhao M. Morikawa A. Sugiyama T. Chakravortty D. Koide N. Yoshida T. Tapping R.I. Yang Y. Yokochi T. Lee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18534-18540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that MEK5 and BMK1 function downstream of MEKK3 to mediate NFAT activation, we performed a series of cotransfection assays. We cotransfected NFAT luciferase reporter constructs with constitutively active MEK5, MEK6, or MEK7 expression constructs. We found that only MEK5(CA) stimulated NFAT activation (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that MEK5 functions downstream of MEKK3 leading to calcineurin/NFAT activation. The fact that MEK5(CA) provides less NFAT activation than MEKK3(CA) may be due to differences in the way these constitutively active kinases were engineered or to the possibility that MEKK3 activates other downstream kinases in addition to MEK5. We also cotransfected the NFAT luciferase reporter with DN forms of the various MAP kinases in the presence or absence of expression constructs encoding constitutively active MEKK3. We found that dominant negative forms of either MEK5 or BMK1 inhibited MEKK3(CA)-induced NFAT activation (Fig. 1, C and D). Incomplete inhibition by MEK5(DN) or BMK1(DN) may be due to competition from endogenous wild type enzymes (Fig. 1D). More importantly we have shown that coexpression of dominant negative MEK5 and BMK1 resulted in an almost complete inhibition of MEKK3-mediated NFAT activation (Fig. 1D). These results provide strong evidence that MEK5 and BMK1 function downstream of MEKK3 to mediate NFAT activation. Conversely, slightly enhanced NFAT activation was seen with the dominant negative forms of p38 and Jun kinase without or with MEKK3(CA) (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with the results obtained by using specific compounds to inhibit p38 or Jun kinase (Fig. 1A). Overall, the results presented in Fig. 1 (B–D) indicate that MEK5 and BMK1 function downstream of MEKK3 in calcineurin/NFAT activation. MEK5 and BMK1 Function Downstream of MEKK3 in a Signaling Pathway Resulting in the Phosphorylation of MCIP1—It is possible that MEK5 and/or BMK1 activate calcineurin through the phosphorylation of MCIP1. To test this possibility, we monitored the phosphorylation status of Myc-tagged MCIP1 by Western blot analysis following cotransfection with expression constructs encoding wild type and various mutant forms of the MEKK3, MEK5, or BMK1 (Fig. 2A). We found that the mobility of HA-tagged MEK5 and FLAG-tagged BMK1 was significantly retarded following cotransfection with constitutively active MEKK3 (Fig. 2A, lane 9). Likewise the mobility of BMK1 was significantly retarded following cotransfection with constitutively active MEK5 (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Previous studies have shown that the slower migrating forms represent the phosphorylated forms of MEK5 and BMK1, respectively (25Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D.

https://openalex.org/W2125334861,"Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-SYN) plays a key role in Parkinson's disease (PD). We have used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to study alpha-SYN aggregation in vitro and discovered that this process is clearly accelerated by addition of FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs). This effect was observed both with E. coli SlyD FKBP and with human FKBP12 and was counteracted by FK506, a specific inhibitor of FKBP. The alpha-SYN aggregates formed in the presence of FKBP12 showed fibrillar morphology. The rotamase activity of FKBP apparently accelerates the folding and subsequent aggregation of alpha-SYN. Since FK506 and other non-immunosuppressive FKBP inhibitors are known to display neuroregenerative and neuroprotective properties in disease models, the observed inhibition of rotamase activity and alpha-SYN aggregation, may explain their mode of action. Our results open perspectives for the treatment of PD with immunophilin ligands that inhibit a specific member of the FKBP family."
https://openalex.org/W2010162728,"Contact inhibition, the inhibition of cell proliferation by tight cell-cell contact is a fundamental characteristic of normal cells. Using primary cultured hepatocytes, we investigated the mechanisms of contact inhibition that decrease the mitogenic activity of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), focusing on the regulation of c-Met/HGF-receptor activation. In hepatocytes cultured at a sparse cell density, HGF stimulation induced prolonged c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation for over 5 h and a marked mitogenic response. In contrast, HGF stimulation induced transient c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in <3 h and failed to induce mitogenic response in hepatocytes cultured at a confluent cell density. Treatment of the confluent cells with HGF plus orthovanadate, a broad spectrum protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, however, prolonged c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation for over 5 h and permitted the subsequent mitogenic response. The mitogenic response to HGF was associated with the duration of c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation even in the sparse cells. We found that the activity and expression of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR increased following HGF stimulation specifically in confluent hepatocytes and not in sparse hepatocytes. LAR and c-Met were associated, and purified LAR dephosphorylated tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Met in in vitro phosphatase reactions. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides specific for LAR mRNA suppressed the expression of LAR, allowed prolonged c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, and led to acquisition of a mitogenic response in hepatocytes even under the confluent condition. Thus functional association of LAR and c-Met underlies the inhibition of c-Met-mediated mitogenic signaling through the dephosphorylation of c-Met, which specifically occurs under the confluent condition.

Inhibition of cell proliferation regulated by cell-cell contact is a fundamental characteristic of normal cells by which cellular adhesion successfully maintains formation and highly organized tissue architecture. On the other hand, the loss of contact inhibition is associated with cellular transformation, which is a precursor to malignant disorder (1Stoker M. Curr. Top. Dev.

Mature hepatocytes, which are terminally differentiated cells, undergo proliferation depending on exogenous growth factors. Proliferation of primary cultured hepatocytes is strictly regulated by cell-cell contact. When hepatocytes are cultured at sparse cell density, the cells undergo DNA synthesis in response to growth factors. However, when the cells are in a confluent density, DNA synthesis is mostly inhibited even in the presence of growth factors.

Conversely, it has been proposed that protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities are involved in regulating the balance of tyrosine phosphorylation states of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Met and the possible downstream signal mediators, such as Shc, the Stat families, phospholipase Cγ1, β-catenin, γ-catenin, and p120CAS in the normal liver (18Ruff S.J. Chen K. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of PTPs in hepatocyte proliferation is not well clarified. In the present study, focusing on the activation states of c-Met, we investigated the mechanisms by which tight cell-cell contact in primary hepatocytes prevents mitogenic response to HGF. We found that LAR, a transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase, plays a definitive role in inactivation, i.e. tyrosine dephosphorylation of c-Met through their physical interaction, which specifically occurs in hepatocytes under the confluent condition. Additionally, specific suppression of LAR expression prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met and released contact inhibition. Our results indicate that regulation of the activation states of c-Met by LAR underlies contact inhibition of the mitogenic response to HGF in hepatocytes. Cell Culture—Hepatocytes were prepared from 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats by in situ perfusion of the liver with collagenase, as described elsewhere (6Nakamura T. Tomita Y. Ichihara A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 94: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 19Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured on plastic dishes coated with type I collagen at a cell density of 1.2 × 105/cm2 for the confluent culture and 0.3 × 105/cm2 for the sparse culture. The cells were cultured in Williams' E medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5 nm insulin, and 10 nm dexamethasone under normal atmosphere conditioned by 5% CO2. Analysis of Mitogenic Response—DNA synthesis of hepatocytes was measured by the incorporation of 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) into nuclei, as described elsewhere (20Gratzner H.G. Science. 1982; 218: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar, 21Dolbeare F. Gratzner H. Pallavicini M.G. Gray J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5573-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Briefly, following preculture for 20 h, the hepatocytes were stimulated with 10 ng/ml HGF and labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 h. The cells were fixed and permeabilized with methanol. The samples were further treated with 2 m HCl for 15 min and neutralized with 0.1 m sodium tetraborate for 10 min. The samples were incubated with anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) and probed by Alexa-549-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). The nuclei were stained by Hoechst 33342. The number of the nuclei stained for BrdUrd and Hoechst were counted using laser microscopy. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in a buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and the cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The cell lysates were incubated with anti-c-Met mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-LAR goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose for anti-LAR antibody or protein G-Sepharose for anti-c-Met antibody. The immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blotting. Proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine mouse monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Charlottesville, VA), anti-cyclin D1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-ERK1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) rabbit polyclonal antibody (Biogenesis, Poole, Dorset, UK), anti-c-Met antibody, or anti-LAR antibody for 2 h. The membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, anti-rabbit IgG antibody, or anti-goat antibody (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The signals were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In-gel PTP Assays—PTPs were monitored by an in-gel PTP assay according to the method reported by Burridge and Nelson (22Burridge K. Nelson A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, tyrosine residues on poly(Glu:Tyr) peptides were phosphorylated by purified c-Src tyrosine kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) and ATP and used for a substrate of PTPs. The cell lysates prepared as described above were incubated in Laemmli sample buffer at 70 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel, which contained the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides. The gel was washed by a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20% isopropyl alcohol to remove SDS, denatured by a guanidine hydrochloride buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA, and renatured in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. The gel was further incubated in this buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 h at 30 °C to achieve tyrosine phosphatase reactions in the gel. To scavenge the background signals from phosphoserine/threonine, the gel was washed in 1 m Ba(OH)2 for 30 min at 50 °C and neutralized by dry acetic acid. The gel was washed with H2O, and tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides were stained by Pro-Q Diamond, an in-gel phosphoprotein staining reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The gel was analyzed using a laser image analyzer, Typhoon (Amersham Biosciences). PTPs were detected as colorless bands. Immunostaining for LAR in Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-LAR antibody for 2 h. After washing by phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with Alexa-488-labeled anti-goat IgG. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. Fluorescent signals for LAR and the nuclei were analyzed by laser microscopy. In Vitro PTP Assays—Hepatocytes cultured under the sparse condition were stimulated by 10 ng/ml HGF for 20 min, harvested, and disrupted in a glass Teflon homogenizer with hypotonic buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 42 mm KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin. The nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellets (cell membranes) were suspended in 50 ml of a reaction buffer composed of 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl and used for the substrate in in vitro PTP reactions. For the preparation of LAR, hepatocytes cultured under confluent conditions were stimulated with 10 ng/ml HGF for 5 h. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer as described above, and LAR was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using anti-LAR antibody covalently cross-linked with protein A-Sepharose. The immunocomplexes were washed with 0.5 m NaCl, and LAR was eluted by 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 3.0). Thereafter, the elution buffer was replaced by the reaction buffer using a Microcon ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). PTP reactions were started by mixing cell membranes and purified LAR, run for 30 min at 30 °C, and stopped by the addition of 1 mm orthovanadate. c-Met was immunoprecipitated from the reaction mixtures and then subjected to Western blot analysis to determine the tyrosine phosphorylation and amount of c-Met using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-c-Met antibodies, respectively. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Poly(A) RNA was prepared from hepatocytes using a FastTrack poly(A) RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) and then incubated with DNase to remove any contaminating DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized by Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers. The LAR mRNA level was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCCTGTCCTGGCAGTCATTCTC-3′ and 5′-ACTGGTGACATTTCTCCCTGCCCATC-3′, respectively, corresponding to nucleotides 3970–3992 and 5202–5227 from the adenine nucleotide of the starting ATG codon of rat LAR mRNA. PCR primers for GAPDH were purchased from TOYOBO (Osaka, Japan). The domain structures of LAR mRNA expressed in hepatocytes were elucidated by RT-PCR for distinct regions of LAR, as illustrated in Fig. 4E. Poly(A) RNA was prepared and reverse-transcribed as described above. PCR was performed using different sets of primers. For Fig. 4E, rows 1–3, forward primer, 5′-ATAGAGGCCACAGCCCAGGTCAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGTGCTGGCGCTCAGCATTCG-3′, 5′-AAGTCTGCAGGCTGTGCAGGCAC-3′, or 5′-CTCTACGGTGGGAGTGAAGACGC-3′. For Fig. 4E, rows 4–6, respectively, forward primer, 5′-GCGTCTTCACTCCCACCGTAGAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ACGTCCTCGTCGGTGCGCACCAG-3′, 5′-GTAGTAACCACTTTGGGCTTGC-3′, or 5′-GAAAGCCACTGGGCGCATCCTCG-3′. For Fig. 4E, row 7, forward primer, 5′-CTACCAGGTCACCTATGTGCGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTAGTAACCACTTTGGGCTTGC-3′. For Fig. 4E, rows 8–10, forward primer, 5′-GCAAGCCCAAAGTGGTTACTAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAAAGCCACTGGGCGCATCCTCG-3′, 5′-CTTGGCAAACACTTGCTCCATG-3′, or 5′-GCTTCTGAGGCAGGAGGTCTGG-3′. For Fig. 4E, row 11, forward primer, 5′-GCCCTGTCCTGGCAGTCATTCTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTGAGCCCATCATTGGCTTTGAGACG-3′. The PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Antisense DNA to Suppress LAR Expression—Single strand antisense DNA for LAR mRNA was designed as 5′-CATCCATGTGATTCGAGGCTT-3′ corresponding to the 181–201st nucleotide from the starting codon of rat LAR mRNA (Genbank™ accession number L11586), and the control oligonucleotide was designed as 5′-CAGTAGCTGACTTAGCTGCTT-3′. Antisense and control oligonucleotides were added, respectively, to the cultures of confluent hepatocytes using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty hours later, the medium was changed for the fresh one, and the cells were further cultured in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml HGF for 5 h. Expression of LAR and c-Met and the tyrosine phosphorylation level of c-Met were analyzed by Western blotting, as described above. To analyze the effects of the suppression of LAR expression on mitogenic response to HGF, confluent hepatocytes were pretreated with 10 mm antisense or control oligonucleotide for 20 h and subsequently cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml HGF for 30 h. The mitogenic response in hepatocytes was analyzed by BrdUrd labeling, as described above. Distinct Mitogenic Response Regulated by Cell-Cell Contact—To demonstrate any cell density-dependent regulation of mitogenic response, primary hepatocytes were cultured at sparse (0.3 × 105 cells/cm2 at plating) or confluent (1.2 × 105 cells/cm2 at plating) cell density. Following preculture for 20 h, the cells were cultured in the absence or presence of HGF for 30 h, and S phase DNA synthesis was measured using BrdUrd labeling. Under the sparse condition, only a few cells underwent BrdUrd incorporation in the absence of HGF, and the BrdUrd signals increased following stimulation with HGF (Fig. 1A). The distribution of cells undergoing BrdUrd incorporation indicates that <10% cells entered S phase in the absence of HGF, yet it reached over 76% in the presence of HGF. Under the confluent condition, BrdUrd-positive cells were almost 5% in the absence of HGF. However, in contrast to the sparse conditions, HGF failed to enhance DNA synthesis. The results show that mitogenic responses of hepatocytes are strictly regulated between sparse and confluent conditions. When hepatocytes were cultured at altered cell densities, wherein the cells were confluently or sparsely attached in the same well, HGF markedly stimulated DNA synthesis in the sparse region but did not do so in the confluent region (Fig. 1B), which clearly ruled out the possibility that the contact inhibition may be regulated by humoral factors. Next, to address whether the distinct mitogenic response of hepatocytes is associated with distinct cell cycle transition, changes in the expression of cyclin D1, a G1/S transition marker, were analyzed using Western blots (Fig. 1C). In the sparse hepatocytes, increase in cyclin D1 expression was detected 6 h after HGF stimulation, and it reached a maximal level 12–24 h following the stimulation. In contrast, the cyclin D1 expression did not increase even in the presence of HGF when cells were cultured under the confluent condition. These results indicate that hepatocytes under the confluent condition remain at a quiescent state even after HGF stimulation. Suppression of Prolonged ERK Activation and c-Met Receptor Tyrosine Phosphorylation under the Confluent Condition—In various types of cells, entry into G1 following extracellular stimuli is regulated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1/2 (23Guan K.L. Cell Signal. 1994; 6: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To search for the possible involvement of ERK1/2 in the mitogenic response to HGF in hepatocytes, we first examined the activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2A, left panels). The sparse hepatocytes were stimulated with HGF, and the phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine and threonine residues on ERK1/2 were analyzed by Western blotting. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not detectable in the absence of HGF, but it was enhanced at 5 min after the HGF stimulation, which means ERK1/2 were intracellular signal mediators of HGF stimulation. Under the treatment with PD098095, an inhibitor for the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase, an activator of ERK1/2, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and increase in cyclin D1 expression following HGF stimulation were inhibited. When S phase entry was analyzed by BrdUrd incorporation, treatment with PD098095 abrogated the BrdUrd uptake even after HGF stimulation (Fig. 2A, right graph). This indicates that ERK1/2 activation was essential for the c-Met-mediated G1/S transition of hepatocytes. We next examined whether ERK1/2 activation is affected by cell densities (Fig. 2B). In the sparse cells, ERK1/2 were highly phosphorylated at 5 min and were sustained for up to 3 h after HGF stimulation (Fig. 2B, left panels). In confluent hepatocytes, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was slightly induced for up to 5 min and was highly enhanced 20 min after HGF stimulation. However, the phosphorylation level gradually decreased and returned to the unstimulated level within 3 h (Fig. 2B, right panels). The results showed that ERK1/2 activation by HGF stimulation was sustained in the sparse cells and transient in confluent cells, demonstrating that intracellular signal transduction leading to ERK1/2 activation was regulated by cell densities. The difference in the duration of ERK1/2 activation was reminiscent of the possibility that activation of the c-Met/HGF receptor may be initially regulated by cell densities. Thus, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation states of c-Met during HGF stimulation. Hepatocytes cultured under sparse or confluent conditions were stimulated with HGF, and tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blot with anti-PY antibody (Fig. 2, C and D). In sparse cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was barely detectable in the absence of HGF. On the stimulation with HGF, the tyrosine phosphorylation was induced within 5 min and reached a peak at 60 min after the stimulation (Fig. 2C). Thereafter, the phosphorylation level was sustained for at least 5 h following HGF stimulation (Fig. 2D). In confluent cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met was similarly induced within 5 min and reached a peak at 20 min following HGF stimulation (Fig. 2C). It was noteworthy that the tyrosine phosphorylation level of c-Met under the confluent condition decreased thereafter, and 3 h after HGF stimulation, it returned to the basal level (Fig. 2D). Because c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation faded away until 3 h following HGF stimulation in the confluent hepatocytes, we predicted the involvement of tyrosine phosphatase activity in this down-regulation of c-Met phosphorylation. To address this possibility, the effects of orthovanadate (Na3VO4), an inhibitor for protein-tyrosine phosphatases with broad spectrum, on c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation were analyzed in confluent hepatocytes (Fig. 2D). In the presence of Na3VO4, c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation slightly increased even before HGF stimulation, and the phosphorylation level became progressively enhanced following HGF stimulation. Importantly, even under the confluent condition, the enhanced level of c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation was sustained for at least 5 h by Na3VO4 treatment, indicating that protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) participates in the loss of sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met under the confluent condition. Prolonged c-Met Activation Is Essential for HGF-mediated Proliferation—To determine whether sustained c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of Na3VO4 permits cell cycle transition into the S phase, we analyzed the expression of cyclin D1 and BrdUrd incorporation in confluent hepatocytes (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, HGF failed to stimulate cyclin D1 expression when cells were cultured at confluent density. However, in the presence of Na3VO4, cyclin D1 expression increased even following HGF stimulation (Fig. 3A). Likewise, in the presence of Na3NO4, 70% of hepatocytes underwent DNA synthesis after HGF stimulation under the confluent condition, whereas HGF or Na3VO4 alone showed no influence on the quiescent states of the cells (Fig. 3B). Because c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation for <3 h was not associated with mitogenic response, whereas a longer c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation for at least 5 h led to the induction of mitogenic response, sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met >3 h may be essential to induce the mitogenic response to HGF. To confirm this possibility, sparse hepatocytes were stimulated with HGF for different periods (1, 3, and 5 h), and thereafter, the medium was changed for one free of HGF, and c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed (Fig. 3C). Stimulation of sparse hepatocytes with HGF highly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Met within 1 h, whereas the tyrosine phosphorylation returned to the basal level until 2 h after the change of medium. In the course of HGF stimulation for 3 h, c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation was highly detected at 1 and 3 h, but it also returned to the basal level 2 h after the change of the medium. Stimulation of hepatocytes with HGF for 5 h showed sustained c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation during the stimulation. The DNA synthesis for 30 h following the start of HGF stimulation revealed that the limited stimulation with HGF for 1 h failed to induce DNA synthesis, whereas HGF stimulation for 3 and 5 h increased the labeling index to 42 and 69%, respectively (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that sustained c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation for over 3 h is required for entry into the S phase. Expression of LAR in Confluent Hepatocytes—The effects of Na3VO4 on c-Met tyrosine phosphorylation, shown in Fig. 2D, suggested that protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) is involved in the dephosphorylation of c-Met later than 3 h following HGF stimulation in confluent hepatocytes. To search protein-tyrosine phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylation of c-Met, we examined the expression of tyrosine phosphatase(s) in hepatocytes, using in-gel tyrosine phosphatase assays (Fig. 4A). Hepatocytes were cultured under the sparse or confluent conditions, and the extracts prepared from cells following HGF stimulation were subjected to SDS-PAGE using a polyacrylamide gel containing the substrate peptides of tyrosine phosphatases. The dephosphorylated peptides were detected as unstained bands. Four major bands at molecular mass units of 45, 60, 70 (shown in supplemental Fig. S1), and 80 kDa were detected in this assay, and among these bands, the 80-kDa band showed a unique change. The 80-kDa band was not detected in sparse hepatocytes even after HGF stimulation. However, in confluent hepatocytes, the 80-kDa band was detectable at 1 h, and it markedly increased within 3 h following HGF stimulation. The result suggested that the 80-kDa tyrosine phosphatase is a candidate for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of c-Met under the confluent condition. Based on the molecular mass, we predicted that the 80-kDa protein-tyrosine phosphatase is a catalytic subunit (P-subunit) of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase LAR. To address this possibility, expression of LAR in hepatocytes was analyzed by Western blot using anti-LAR antibody (Fig. 4B). In the sparse cells, expression of LAR was negligible regardless of HGF stimulation. On the other hand, basal expression of LAR was weak but more detectable in the confluent cells, and the expression was markedly stimulated within 3 h after HGF stimulation. Similarly, immunostaining for LAR in hepatocytes revealed"
https://openalex.org/W2146835805,"Tissue fibrosis results when dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover favors deposition of collagen and other ECM proteins over degradation. Fibrosis may then lead to organ dysfunction and pathology as observed in systemic sclerosis (SSc). In the present study, we investigated the antifibrotic properties of proteasome blockade. A dose- and time-dependent reduction in type-I collagen and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) production was observed in normal fibroblasts exposed to proteasome inhibitors (PI). In the same culture conditions, metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) protein and the collagenolytic activity on type I collagen was increased. The steady-state mRNA levels of COL1A1, TIMP-1, and MMP-1 paralleled protein levels. These effects were dominant over the profibrotic properties of TGF-beta and were observed with fibroblasts generated from normal and SSc skin. PI decreased type I collagen mRNA levels with kinetics similar to those observed with DRB, a specific RNA polymerase II inhibitor, thus indicating transcriptional inhibition. Of interest, PI induced c-Jun phosphorylation and c-Jun nuclear accumulation. The specific N-terminal Jun-kinase inhibitor SP-600125 selectively abrogated c-Jun phosphorylation and, in a dose-dependent fashion, the up-regulated synthesis of MMP-1 induced by PI. Finally, PI did not affect fibroblast viability. Thus, the coordinated down-regulation of collagen and TIMP-1 and up-regulation of MMP-1 renders proteasome blockade an attractive strategy for treating conditions as SSc, characterized by excessive fibrosis."

Inhibitory profile studies with 25-azalanosterol (Ki value of 39 nm) or 24(R,S), 25-epiminolanosterol (Ki value of 49 nm), ergosterol (Ki value of 27 μm) and 26,27-dehydrozymosterol (Ki and kinact values of 29 μm and 0.26 min–1, respectively) and data showing zymosterol as the preferred acceptor strongly suggest that the protozoan SMT has an active site topography combining properties of the SMT1 from plants and yeast (37–47% identity). The enzymatic activation of this and other SMTs reveals that the catalytic requirements for the C-methyl reaction are remarkably versatile, whereas the inhibition studies provide a powerful approach to rational design of new anti-sleeping sickness chemotherapeutic drugs. Health in sub-Saharan Africa is threatened by protozoan parasites that generate an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 new cases of African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, each year. Trypanosoma brucei (TB), 2The abbreviations used are: TB, Trypanosoma brucei; SMT, sterol methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. the causative agent of sleeping sickness in humans, is a non-photosynthetic flagellate parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly (Glossina). T. brucei has many unusual features, including morphologies at different life stages that contain variant sterol mixtures to respond to the different physiological environments of its human and insect hosts (1Dixon H. Ginger C.D. Williamson J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1972; 41: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recent whole-genome sequencing of TB revealed a set of conserved isoprenoid/phytosterol genes that can give rise to squalene and ergosterol (2Berriman M. et al.Science. 2005; 309: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar), consistent with the observation that the parasite synthesizes sterols de novo in either the procyclic or bloodstream form (3Low P.

Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 2937-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The sterol methyl transferases (SMT) that catalyze the attachment of a methyl group from AdoMet to the sterol side chain lie on a pathway that is key for the biosynthesis of fungal and plant sterols. These enzymes are additionally unique in that they have no counterpart in humans, they can generate various side chain constructions, and they can serve as the rate-limiting enzymatic step in the overall conversion of lanosterol or cycloartenol to ergosterol and phytosterols involved with membrane structure and function (5Nes W.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 63-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). SMT is also of interest enzymologically because the reaction that is catalyzed can be bifunctional with the enzyme accepting different substrate olefins (6Nes W.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In those protozoans that synthesize ergosterol (7Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the C-methylation step makes it possible to develop microbial-specific sterol biosynthesis inhibitors to block a critical slow enzyme in the pathway to treat infected individuals (7Roberts C.W.

Molecules. 2003; 9: 185-203Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Previous studies on phytosterol synthesis in soluble enzyme preparations from yeast versus vascular plants have demonstrated the presence of two separable activities that catalyze the first and second C1-transfer reactions to produce a C24 methyl and C24 ethyl side chain, respectively (10Fonteneau P. Hartmann M.A. Benveniste P. Plant Sci. Lett. 1977; 10: 147-155Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 11Rahier A. Genot J-C. Benveniste P. Narula A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15213-15215Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, using cloned enzymes to study product profiles as well as deuterium isotope effects on these enzymatic reactions assayed with native enzymatic preparations has indicated that a single SMT enzyme can produce mixtures of mono-methyl(ene) or di-methyl(ene) sterol products (12Guo D.

SMTs are presently categorized mechanistically based on substrate specificity and product distribution as: 1) SMT1, which catalyzes the first C1-transfer reaction of cycloartenol to 24 (28)-methylene cycloartanol (EC.2.1.1.143, e.g. Glycine max); 2) SMT1, which catalyzes the first C1-transfer reaction of zymosterol to fecosterol (EC.2.1.1.41, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae); or 3) SMT2, which catalyzes the second C1-transfer reaction of 24 (28)-methylene lophenol to a mixture of 24 (28)Z-ethylidene lophenol, 24 (28)E-ethylidene lophenol, and 4α-methyl 24β-ethyl cholesta-7, 25 (27)-dienol (EC.2.1.1.143, e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana) (13Nes W.D.

A recently cloned SMT from the trypanosmatid parasite Leishmania donovani was shown to support ergosterol production in ERG6 null mutant S. cerevisiae yeasts, suggesting that it falls into the SMT1 category (17Pourshafie M. Morand S. Virion A. Rakotmanga M. Dupuy C. Loiseau P.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This coupled with the fact that several azasterols were found to inhibit the Leishmania SMT in vitro as well as under physiological conditions (7Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Magaraci F. Jimenez C.J. Rodrigues C. Rodrigues J.C.F. Braga V.M. Yardley V. de Luca-Fradley K.

Nes W.D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Kanagasabai R. Zhou W. Liu J. Nguyen T.T.M. Veeramachaneni P. Nes W.D. Lipids. 2004; 39: 737-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we have described the characterization of the SMT cDNA and recombinant enzyme from TB and reported on the substrate selectivity, inhibitory profile studies, and structure and stereochemistry of the products of the reaction. Quite unexpectedly, we found that the TB SMT generated a set of plant-like products from a zymosterol substrate, including ergosta-8,24 (25)-dienol and 24,24-dimethyl ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol, which raises the intriguing possibility that TB has a novel 24-dimethyl sterol pathway that is unlike the fungal ergosterol (C1-methyl group) or plant sitosterol (C2-methyl group) pathways and represents a new, catalytically distinct type of sterol methyl transferase that may possess a different active site motif than those of previously described SMTs. Substrates and Reagents—The preparation, proof of structure, and purification of 26,27-dehydrozymosterol, 25-azalanosterol, 24(R,S),25-epiminolanosterol, and ergosterol have been described (9Zhou W.

S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as the iodine salt was purchased from Sigma. [methyl-3H3]AdoMet (10–15 Ci/mmol) and [methyl-2H3]AdoMet (99.3% 2H enrichment) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and MSD Isotopes, respectively. All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher, unless noted otherwise. Trypanosoma brucei SMT Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Sequence data for T. brucei SMT were obtained from the web site of The Institute of Genomic Research (www.tigr.org) using Blast search against SMT from S. cerevisiae. The amino acid sequence was aligned with known SMTs (20Nes W.D. Phytochemistry. 2003; 64: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The putative TBSMT cDNA was PCR amplified from T. brucei brucei genomic DNA using Vent DNA polymerase (NEB); the details are provided as supplemental information. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The correctness of the inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The second codon of the TBSMT cDNA was mutated to alanine (GCT) to optimize foreign gene expression in E. coli (supplemental information); silent mutation (GCC to GCA) was introduced into the third codon to decrease the GC content at the 5′-region. The insert was excised by digestion with NdeI (NEB) and HindIII, cloned into the pCW expression vector, and transformed into the expression host E. coli HMS-174 (Novagen) for ampicillin selection to provide TBSMT-native or TBSMT-His (the details on expression and purification are provided as supplemental information). The protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method for total protein (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 680-685Crossref Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) or by UV absorption at A280 using an extinction coefficient of 49,560 M–1 cm–1 for pure protein. Native molecular weight of the pure protein was determined by gel permeation chromatography (22Nes W.D. Jayasimha P. Zhou W. Kanagasabai R. Jin C. Jaradat T.T. Shaw R.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SMT Assay and Inhibitor Studies—The standard assay for enzyme activity was conducted in 2-ml vials in final volume of 600 μl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol (v/v) with either 50 μm sterol substrate or sterol varied at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, and 150 μm and [methyl-3H3]AdoMet concentration fixed at saturation of 100 μm (1.2 μCi). The reaction was initiated by addition of 5–15 μg of pure protein or 1–2 mg of total protein and terminated with 500 μl of 10% methanolic KOH. The methylated sterol product was extracted in hexane (Fisher), dried, and the sample analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to determine the conversion rate. The steady-state kinetic parameters, kcat and Km, under initial velocity conditions were calculated by fitting the liquid scintillation data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Enzyme Kinetic Module from SPSS Inc. Inhibition of SMT using the native construct was assessed by the graphical procedures provided by the Enzyme Kinetic Module, and rate data were analyzed by linear regression analysis (13Nes W.D. Song Z. Dennis A.L. Zhou W. Nam J. Miller M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34505-34516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The error in work up of duplicate samples was generally 5% (up to 10% at low conversions). Boiled controls were included in each experiment, and in all cases nonenzymatic formations were negligible. For determination of the pH, temperature, and optimal amount of enzyme, single time point assays containing 2 mg of soluble native SMT were studied as described (13Nes W.D. Song Z. Dennis A.L.

Variable inhibitor concentrations were performed in the presence of several sterol concentrations, from 5 to 100 μm; fixed substrate was incubated at subsaturating concentrations normally about the Km value, and the inhibitor concentration was tested at ranges previously found to inhibit SMT (13Nes W.D.

Product Analysis—Radioactivity in organic extracts was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter) of aliquots in a ScintiVerse BD mixture, and all samples were counted to an S.E. <1% at a 3H efficiency of 40%. Structures of enzyme-generated products were determined after reverse phase HPLC purification of the total sterol faction of the non-saponifiable lipids using either a semi-preparative TSK gel C18-column (Toso Hass) operated at room temperature (eluted with 100% methanol at 2.5 ml/min) or an analytical column operated at 15 °C (eluted with acetonitrile/isopropanol (85:15, v/v) at 1 ml/min). The UV detector was set at 210 nm. In some radioactivity experiments, once the enzyme-generated products were characterized, they were used as authentic carrier standards added prior to solvent concentration to minimize losses and assist the chromatography during HPLC. The details on gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis and NMR spectroscopy are provided in the supplemental information. A TBLASTN search of the T. brucei genome sequence in The Institute of Genomic Research data base using SMT from S. cerevisiae as a query yielded a high probability match to a single 1,077-bp open reading frame from T. brucei, encoding an apparent protein of 359 amino acids. The sequence of the putative TB SMT (Fig. 1) shares 31–47% amino acid identity with other known SMT sequences deposited in the GenBank™ data base and shows strongest homology to SMT1- (59% similarity) rather than SMT2- (45% similarity) type catalysts (Fig. 1). The primary structure of the putative TB SMT contained two highly conserved motifs of 8 to 12 contiguous residues, referred to as Regions 1 and 2 (20Nes W.D. Phytochemistry. 2003; 64: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These motifs are arranged in the same order and separated by comparable intervals along the polypeptide side chain of SMTs. Region 1, which stretches from Tyr-81 to Phe-91 (ERG6 numbering system), has been identified by chemical affinity using the yeast SMT1 to be a sterol binding site (24Nes W.D. Marshall J.A. Jia Z. Jaradat T.T. Song Z. Jayasimha P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42549-42556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Region 1 is unique to SMTs and is not found in other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. Region 2, which stretches from Lys-124 to Arg-135, has been identified as an AdoMet binding site by site-directed mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 680-685Crossref Scopus (217370) Google Scholar, 26Fujimoto Y. Sato N. Iwai K. Hamada H. Yamada J. Morisaki M. Chem. Commun. 1997; : 681-682Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and is present in many other AdoMet-dependent methyl transferases (25Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To determine whether the putative TB SMT was functional to generate the predicted activity, we separately expressed the full-length protein as well as that containing a His4 tag and tested both with zymosterol, a substrate considered to be acceptable to the SMT based on the known sterol composition of protozoa (7Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). TB SMT was overexpressed in E. coli HMS-174 cells and yielded target protein migrating on SDS-PAGE with the expected size of ∼40 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1). Fractionation of the total protein starting with the cell lysate generated ∼1 or 2 mg of purified His4 tag or native protein. The calculated Km for the native protein using zymosterol as substrate was 47 ± 5 μm, with an apparent kcat value of 0.013 s–1, a pH optimum between 6.8 and 7.5, and temperature optimum between 35 and 40 °C. The conversion rate was linear with increasing time up to 65 min in a total soluble protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The recombinant His-tagged protein exhibited similar properties and kinetic constants (data not shown). The 40-kDa SMT eluted from the SDS-PAGE gel revealed the N-terminal set of amino acids MSAGS (Texas Tech University Core Facility), consistent with the predicted amino acids in the primary structure (Fig. 1). The protein was analyzed on gel permeation chromatography and found to possess a native molecular mass of ∼160 kDa, suggesting the expected tetramer subunit organization. Initial assay with zymosterol and analysis of the enzyme-generated product by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the SMT catalyzed the formation of four sterols (Fig. 2). Systematic testing of 10 Δ24-sterol substrates (Table 1 and Fig. 3) indicated that neither lanosterol nor other C4-methyl-containing sterols bind productively to the enzyme. Alternatively, C4-demethyl sterols with double bonds in the nucleus at positions 8, 7, or 5 are acceptable substrates (catalytic competence of 81% (cholesta-7,24-dienol) and 26% (cholesta-5,24-dienol) relative to zymosterol (cholesat-8,24-dienol)) and confirmed the optimal substrate to be zymosterol: Km = 47 μm/Vmax = 901 pmol/min/mg) (Table 1). The enzyme-generated product profiles resulting from test substrates found to be active were similar to the control (data not shown). In this way, the protozoan SMT is similar to the yeast SMT, and like the ergosterol pathway in yeast the ergosterol pathway in T. brucei is expected to position the C24-methylation step after the three demethylation steps in the nucleus but before the rearrangement of the Δ8-bond to the Δ7-bond.TABLE IKinetic parameters of sterol substrates assayed with T. brucei sterol methyl transferaseSubstrateStructureaSee Fig. 3 for a key to the structures.KVV/K (catalytic competence)b% Transformation of substrate compared to zymosterol 1 activity (in bold).μmpmol/min/mgLanosterol6NANA0 (0)31-Norlanosterol735541.5 (8)14α-Methyl cholesta-8, 24-dienol8461413.1 (16)4α-Methyl cholesta-8, 24-dienol9281134.0 (21)Cholesta-8, 24-dienol14790119.2 (100)Cholesta-7, 24-dienol104062115.5 (81)Cholesta-5, 24-dienol11522595.0 (26)24,25-Dehydro-pollinastanol1230812.7 (14)31-Norcycloartenol1328271.0 (5)Cycloartenol14NANA0 (0)24(28)-Methylene lophenol15NANA0 (0)a See Fig. 3 for a key to the structures.b % Transformation of substrate compared to zymosterol 1 activity (in bold).

Notable was the formation of multiple enzyme-generated products, which was quite unexpected based on the sterol composition reported in the literature for protozoan sterols, which includes 24β-methyl cholesta-5,7,22E-trineol (ergosterol) and stigmasta-5,7,22E-trineol end products, representing side chain modification of the C1- and C2-transfer activities, respectively (7Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). From a preparative scale assay incubated overnight, zymosterol was found converted to methyl product in 78% yield with four enzyme-generated products formed in an approximate 62:13:13:12 ratio (Fig. 2). For biosynthetic reasons, the C-methyl product ergosta-8,24 (28)-dienol (fecosterol; 3) was expected; however, three other 24-methyl sterols were detected corresponding to ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol (2), ergosta-8,24 (25)-dienol (4), and 24,24-dimethyl-ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol (5). The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of the HPLC pure ergostenols generated by the TB SMT (Table 2) confirmed the structures assigned in the chromatogram reported in Fig. 2. Product stereochemistry at C24 and regiochemistry of the double bond in the sterol side chain of each compound was determined by comparison of the 1H NMR signals at C21 and C28, and those signals associated with the olefinic bonds at Δ24 (28) versus Δ25 (27) to reference specimens (14Nes W.D.

Phytochemistry. 2003; 64: 75-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 1HNMR chemical shifts of the pure compound 5 unambiguously reveal the geminal dimethyl group at C24 (signals resonating at 1.007 and 1.012 ppm) and a double bond at C25 (27Kalinowska M. Nes W.R. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3427-3434Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (signals at 4.654 and 4.717 ppm). The side chain structures of compounds 4 and 5 have been reported in plants (27Kalinowska M. Nes W.R. Crumley F.G. Nes W.D.

Taken together, these spectral data prove a doubly alkylated side chain at carbon-24, and contrary to expectation, the 2 “extra methyls” are not in the normal 24-ethyl arrangement but in the unusual 24,24-dimethyl arrangement.TABLE IIH-NMR assignments of T. brucei enzyme-generated productsSignal2345H3-180.948 (s)0.952 (s)0.951 (s)0.597 (s)H3-190.603 (s)0.614 (s)0.612 (s)0.947 (s)OH-3β3.615 (m)3.616 (m)3.621 (m)3.608 (m)H3-261.636 (s)1.023 (d, J = 6 Hz)1.635 (s)1.635 (s)1.681 (s)H3-274.657 (s)1.028 (d, J = 6 Hz)1.617 (s)H2-271H 4.654 (s)1H 4.717 (m)H3-280.986 (d, J = 6.5 Hz)1H 4.659 (s)1.629 (s)1.007 (s)H2-281H 4.715 (s)H3-291.012 (s) Open table in a new tab Deuterium-labeled methyl AdoMet ([methyl-2H3]AdoMet) was employed to assess the course of the enzymatic reaction and to confirm that all the products were generated by TB SMT. [methyl-2H3]AdoMet was incubated with TB SMT in the usual way and resulting enzyme-generated products analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. When compared with the mass spectra of control specimens (Table 3), all four of the enzyme-generated methyl products were labeled with deuterium atoms (Table 3). Ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol 2 and ergosta-8, 24 (25)-dienol 4 incorporated three deuterium atoms into the side chain (M+ enhanced by three mass units from M+ 398 to 401 atomic mass units), ergosta-8,24 (28)-dienol 3 incorporated two deuterium atoms (M+ enhanced by two mass units from M+ 398 to 400 atomic mass units), and 24,24-dimethyl ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol incorporated six deuterium atoms into the side chain (M+ enhanced by six mass units from 412 to 418 atomic mass units). The observation that ergosta-8,24 (25)-dienol carried three deuterium atoms and 24,25-dimethyl ergost-8,25 (27)-dienol carried six deuterium atoms is noteworthy. Thus far, for mechanistic and biosynthetic reasons (29Goad L.J. Lenton J.R. Knapp F.F. Goodwin T.W. Lipids. 1974; 9: 582-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Arigoni D. Ciba Found. Symp. 1978; 60: 243-258Google Scholar), the formation of the ergosta-8,24 (25)-dienol side chain is thought to result from the isomerization of the 24 (28)-side chain, which if this were the case then 4 should carry two rather than three deuterium atoms following assay with [methyl-2H3]AdoMet. In addition, if sterol 5 were a 24-ethyl sterol such as a stigmasterol-type compound (7Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) rather than a 24,24-dimethyl sterol, the deuterium-labeled compound following assay with [methyl-2H3]AdoMet will carry four deuterium atoms (14Nes W.D. McCourt B.S. Marshall J.A. Ma J. Dennis A.L. Lopez M. Li H. He L. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the SMT reaction proceeds stepwise, undergoing first a C1-transfer reaction to give three products, ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol, ergosta-8,24 (28)-dienol, and ergosta-8,24 (25)-dienol followed by a second C1-transfer reaction to give 24,24-dimethyl ergosta-8,25 (27)-dienol. To determine the substrate specificity for the second C1-transfer reaction, 100 μm [methyl-3H3]AdoMet and 100 μm each of the three monoalkylated sterols generated by the TB SMT during the first C1"

https://openalex.org/W2093983285,"To gain further insight into the interactions involved in the allosteric transition of DnaK we have characterized wild-type (wt) protein and three mutants in which ionic interactions at the interface between the two subdomains of the substrate binding domain, and within the lid subdomain have been disrupted. Our data show that ionic contacts, most likely forming an electrically charged network, between the N-terminal region of helix B and an inner loop of the β-sandwich are involved in maintaining the position of the lid relative to the β-subdomain in the ADP state but not in the ATP state of the protein. Disruption of the ionic interactions between the C-terminal region of helix B and the outer loops of the β-sandwich, known as the latch, does not have the same conformational consequences but results equally in an inactive protein. This indicates that a variety of mechanisms can inactivate this complex allosteric machine. Our results identify the ionic contacts at the subdomain and interdomain interfaces that are part of the hinge region involved in the ATP-induced allosteric displacement of the lid away from the peptide binding site. These interactions also stabilize peptide-Hsp70 complexes at physiological (37 °C) and stress (42 °C) temperatures, a requirement for productive substrate (re)folding.

These interactions also stabilize peptide-Hsp70 complexes at physiological (37 °C) and stress (42 °C) temperatures, a requirement for productive substrate (re)folding. The ubiquitous Hsp70 chaperone proteins are essential to prevent aggregation of misfolded proteins under heat shock conditions. They also participate in cellular processes such as folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, protein translocation across membranes, assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, and refolding of protein aggregates (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). Hsp70 proteins consist of two major structural domains: a conserved N-terminal ATPase domain and a more variable C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD). 4The abbreviations used are: SBD, substrate binding domain; DnaK1A, DnaK(D526A); DnaK2A, DnaK(D540A/K548A); DnaK3A, DnaK(E531A/R536A/R547A); DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; ESI, electrospray ionization; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; wt, wild type; F-APPY, fluorescein-CALLQSRLLLSAPRRAAATARY peptide; ACN, acetonitrile. The SBD contains a β-sandwich, which holds the peptide binding groove, and an α-helical subdomain that folds over the β-structure and might control accessibility of the peptide binding site. High resolution three-dimensional structures of isolated forms of both structural domains with different bound ligands have been reported (2Flaherty K.M. Peluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B.

Biol. 2004; 342: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently a model of a two-domain truncated Hsp70 from Thermus thermophilus has been proposed based on NMR studies (12Revington M. Zhang Y. Grovern N.B. Alexander Y.-V. Kurochkin and Zuiderweg E.R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 163-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Some of the interdomain contacts are better revealed in the x-ray structure of a bovine Hsc70 that lacks most of the helical subdomain at the SBD (13Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In DnaK, the best known bacterial representative of the Hsp70 family, the substrate peptide is bound in an extended conformation between two loops that protrude from the β-sandwich subdomain (L1,2 and L3,4), and are in turn buttressed by two other loops (L4,5 and L5,6). The helical subdomain of the SBD acts like a lid over the β-sandwich subdomain. The α-helices A and B are packed onto the β-sandwich, and helix B covers the substrate binding cavity. The distal part of helix B, together with helices C, D, and E, builds up a hydrophobic helical core that acts as a “lid” (6Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 9Stevens S.Y. Caif S. Pellecchia M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2588-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although interdomain coupling occurs in the absence of the lid and the bound peptide contacts the β-structure but not the α-helical subdomain, its presence has been confirmed to be essential in stabilizing Hsp70-substrate complexes (14Buckzynski G. Slepenkov V. Shorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12224-12235Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), especially at stress temperatures (16Moro F. Fernández-Sáiz V. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19600-19606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The broad spectrum of activities that Hsp70 proteins exhibit requires their interaction with hydrophobic segments of (partially) unfolded polypeptide chains, in a nucleotide-controlled unknown mechanism (17Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14491-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ATP binds the ATPase domain of Hsp70s, an allosteric signal is transmitted to the SBD that adopts a conformation with fast substrate association and dissociation rates and, therefore, low substrate affinity. In contrast, the substrate is tightly bound to the ADP-bound conformation, which displays a high affinity for substrates (18Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One of the most important characteristics of DnaK conformations, that has been proposed to dictate their affinity for peptides, is the position of the lid relative to the β-subdomain of the SBD. The displacement of the lid away from the peptide binding site seems to facilitate substrate dissociation (18Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, analysis of the interactions that anchor the lid to the β-subdomain at the SBD might be relevant to localize the hinge regions of the protein that allow lid movement. Among these interactions, those in which helix B is involved seem to be especially relevant, because residues at this helical segment interact with amino acids belonging to both SBD folding units (6Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). In this work, we systematically compare three mutants of DnaK that lack different ionic interactions between residues at helix B and amino acids at the lid and β-subdomains, respectively. Our results indicate that the salt bridge Asp526-Arg445 plays a pivotal role in properly positioning the lid, relative to the β-subdomain. Data presented here favor a structural transition between the open and closed DnaK conformations that involves structural changes in the α-helical subdomain larger than those initially proposed from the DnaK SBD crystal structure (6Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Mutants DnaK1A, DnaK2A, and DnaK3A were obtained by sequential PCR steps using DnaK flanking primers (19Moro F. Fernández V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and mutagenic primers (underlined letters show the nucleotides changed for each mutation): A, 5′-GVVGAAGCTGCCCGTAAGTTG-3′ and B, 5′-CTTACGGGCAGCTTCGGCG-3′, for DnaK1A (D526A); C, 5′-CGCCCATCTGCTGCACAGCACCCGTGCCAGGTTGAAG-3′ and D, 5′-GCGCACGGGTGCTGTGCAGCAGATGGGCGCCCTGG-3′, for DnaK2A (D540A/K548A); E, 5-GAAGCGCTGGTACAGACTGCCAACCAGGCG-3′; F, 5′-GTTGGCAGTCTGTACCAGCGCTTCAAAC-3′; G, 5′-CACAGCACCGCTAAGCAGGTTGAAGAAG-3′ and H, 5′-CTGCTTAGCGGTGCTGTGCAG-3′ for DnaK3A (E531A/R536A/R547A). PCR products were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (19Moro F. Fernández V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and sequenced to verify the encoded proteins. DnaK wild-type and mutants were expressed, purified, and extensively dialyzed to obtain nucleotide-free samples (20Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). DnaJ and GrpE were expressed in BL21 cells and purified as described elsewhere (21Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. Mc Kittrick N. Sell S. Geosgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mehl A.F. Heskett L.D. Neal K.M. BBA. 2001; 282: 562-569Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the colorimetric Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). F-APPY peptide (fluorescein-CALLQSRLLLSAPRRAAATARY) binding experiments were performed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. To ensure equilibrium, mixtures containing 35 nm F-APPY and different Hsp70 concentrations (from 1 nm to 50 μm) were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescence anisotropy data were recorded on a SLM8100 spectrofluorometer (Aminco) with excitation at 492 nm, emission at 516 nm, and slit widths of 8 nm. The fraction of peptide bound for each Hsp70 protein concentration was calculated, and the data were fitted as described previously (23Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 296: 915-932Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Moro F. Fernandez-Saiz V. Slutsky O. Azem A. Muga A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3184-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Peptide binding kinetics were analyzed at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C using F-APPY and Hsp70 concentrations of 35 nm and 1 μm (wt DnaK, DnaK1A, and DnaK2A) or 3 μm (DnaK3A) Hsp70, respectively, as well as 0.5 mm ADP to stabilize the ATPase domain at stress temperatures. Data were fitted to a monoexponential equation consistent with a bimolecular reaction and the kobs value was plotted against Hsp70 concentration to obtain the binding parameters k+1 and k-1 as described (14Buckzynski G. Slepenkov V. Shorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Moro F. Fernandez-Saiz V. Slutsky O. Azem A. Muga A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3184-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder. The collection parameters were 0.5-mm path length, 1 nm bandwidth, 50 nm min-1 scan rate, and 0.5-s response time. Scans were performed at 20 °C in 10 mm sodium borate (pH 9.0) and 0.3 mg·ml-1 protein concentration. Spectra were averaged from 10 scans and normalized for protein concentration. For the thermal stability experiments, the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored using a 2-mm path length cell, and temperature was increased from 20 °C to 90 °C at a scanning rate of 60 °C h-1. DSC was performed in a VP-DSC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). Protein samples were extensively dialyzed against 25 mm glycine, pH 9.0, centrifuged to remove aggregates, and degassed prior to be loaded in the calorimeter. At pH 9.0 the solubility of the thermally denatured conformation is high enough to make the denaturation transition highly reversible (25Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out under positive pressure to avoid degassing during heating. The calorimetric data were analyzed using ORIGIN software provided with the calorimeter. Protein concentration was 1-2 mg·ml-1 and the scanning rate was 60 °C·h-1. Experiments were carried out at least twice on two different batches of each protein. Partial proteolysis of wild-type DnaK and mutants was carried out in 40 mm Hepes buffer, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.6). 5 μm Hsp70 proteins were incubated at 30 °C with 1.6 units of trypsin, in the absence or presence of 1 mm ATP or ADP. Aliquots containing 5 μg of protein were taken at different incubation times and diluted directly into Laemmli loading buffer for 12.5% SDS-PAGE analysis. In-gel Digestion—Selected tryptic bands were cut from Coomassie Blue-stained, fixed gels and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion according to Shevchenko et al. (26Shevchenko A. Loboda A. Shevchenko A. Ens W. Standing K.G. Anl. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The gel pieces were swollen in a digestion buffer containing 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 12.5 ng·μl-1 trypsin (Roche Diagnostics, recombinant, proteomic grade trypsin, Penzberg, Germany) in an ice bath. After 30 min the supernatant was removed and discarded, and 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added to the gel piece, the digestion proceeding at 37 °C overnight. Supernatant was recovered, and peptides were extracted twice: first with 25 mm NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile (ACN) (Romil, Cambridge, UK) and second with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and ACN. Supernatants of each sample were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac. Prior to MS analysis, pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for MALDI-MS and in 10 μl of 0.1% formic acid (Merck) for ESI-MS analysis and sonicated for 5 min. Sample Preparation for MALDI-MS Analysis—Recovered peptides were purified prior to MALDI analysis using customized nano-columns as described by Gobom et al. (27Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodoskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass. Spect. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A column consisting of 100-300 nl of activated charcoal from Sigma (C-5510) was packed in a constricted GELoader tip (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) (28Larsen M.R. Cordwell S.J. Roepstorff P. Proteomics. 2002; 9: 1277-1287Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A 1-ml syringe was used to force liquid through the column by applying air pressure. The column was equilibrated and washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and bound peptides were subsequently eluted directly onto the MALDI target with 0.5 μl of a solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (20 μg·μl-1 in ACN:trifluoroacetic acid, 70:30, v/v). MALDI-MS Analysis—Peptide mass fingerprinting was performed on a Bruker Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Positively charged ions were analyzed in reflector mode, using delayed extraction. The spectra were obtained by randomly scanning the sample surface. Typically 200-300 spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Spectra were externally calibrated resulting in a mass accuracy of <70 ppm. Protein identification was performed by searching in a non-redundant protein data base (NCBI) using the Mascot searching engine (www.matrixscience.com). The following parameters were used for data base searches: one missed cleavage was allowed, and carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were selected as fixed and variable modification, respectively. ESI-MS Analysis—Tandem electrospray mass spectra were acquired using a Micro Q-TOF (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) mass spectrometer interfaced to a CapLC capillary chromatograph. 7 μl of sample was loaded onto a Symmetry300 C18 NanoEase Trap precolumn (Waters) and washed with 0.1% formic acid for 5 min at a flow rate of 20 μl·min-1. Precolumn was connected to an Atlantis dC18 NanoEase column (Waters) equilibrated in 5% ACN, 0.1% formic acid. A flow splitter was used to decrease the flow rate to 200 nl·min-1, and peptides were eluted with a 30-min linear gradient from 10% to 60% ACN directly to the nano-electrospray capillary tip (New Objective, Woburn, MA). The capillary voltage was set to 1750 V, and data-dependent MS/MS acquisitions were performed on precursors with charge states of 2, 3, or 4 over a survey m/z range of 400-1500. Obtained spectra were searched against the Swiss-Prot data base using ProteinLynx Global Server 2.1 (Waters). For protein identification the following parameters were adopted: complete carbamidomethylation of cysteines; 25 ppm of peptide mass tolerance; 0.05-Da fragment mass tolerance; and 1 missed cleavage. When the presence of a particular peptide on a sample was checked, an inclusion list of m/z of the precursor was used for the MS/MS acquisition. ATPase Activity—Steady state ATPase activity was assayed in 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 11 mm magnesium acetate buffer at 30 °C, as described previously (19Moro F. Fernández V. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 533: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein and ATP concentration were 3 μm Hsp70 and 1 mm, respectively. Reactions were followed measuring the absorbance decay at 340 nm for 30 min in a Cary spectrophotometer (Varian). In the peptide and co-chaperone stimulation assays, NRLLLTG (NR) peptide was added at a final concentration of 0.3 mm, and DnaJ and GrpE were added at 0.3 and 0.9 μm respectively, as previously described (29Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Schonfeld H.J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6643-6649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Refolding of Denatured Luciferase—Luciferase was denatured for 45 min at 25 °C, in 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Refolding was achieved by diluting luciferase to 25 nm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 55 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg·ml-1 bovine serum albumin, containing an ATP-regenerating system (4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 20 ng·ml-1 pyruvate kinase) and 6 μm Hsp70, 6 μm DnaJ, and 7.2 μm GrpE. Reactivation was initiated by addition of 5 mm ATP. Luciferase activity was measured after a 90-min reactivation period at at 25 °C, 37 °C, or 42 °C, using the luciferase assay system (Promega E1500) in a Sinergy HT (Biotek) luminometer. Design of Mutants—Analysis of the ionic interactions at the SBD reveals that in six of the ionic contacts found, one of the involved residues is located in helix B. This helical segment communicates the helical and β-subdomains participating, via its N-terminal region, in the folding unit formed by the β-sandwich and helix A, and through its C-terminal region, in the second folding unit formed by the remaining helical segments of the lid subdomain (6Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of these ionic contacts in the structural and functional properties of DnaK, each corresponding residue in helix B was substituted by alanine (Fig. 1A). It is important to note that none of the mutated residues were located in the β-sandwich subdomain, because this might modify the peptide substrate-binding properties of the protein. In the first mutant, DnaK(D526A), named DnaK1A, a salt bridge between the N-terminal half of helix B and the inner loops of the β-sandwich subdomain is disrupted. The second mutant, DnaK2A, bears two mutations (D540A/K548A) that break a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond between the C-terminal part of helix B and the outer loops of the β-subdomain. These interactions are part of the so-called “latch,” that is believed to control the accessibility of the peptide binding site (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol.

The third mutant, DnaK3A, holds three substitutions (E531A/R536A/R547A) that hamper formation of two salt bridges and a hydrogen bond between residues at helix B and helices C and D of the lid. The main difference between these proteins is that mutations in DnaK1A and DnaK2A modify the interaction between helix B and the β-sandwich subdomain, whereas those in DnaK3A might alter the interaction between helix B and the lid subdomain. Multiple alignment of Hsp70 sequences reveals the conservation degree of residues mutated in this study (Fig. 1B). Although Asp526/Arg445 is widely conserved among the Hsp70 family members, the ionic contacts at the latch are not equally conserved, and those within the lid show the lowest conservation degree. Interaction with Peptide Substrates—The ability of wt and the three mutants to bind peptide substrates was analyzed by measuring the change in anisotropy of a fluorescence labeled peptide (F-APPY). In the presence of wt DnaK, the anisotropy value increases as the peptide binds DnaK, as previously reported (16Moro F. Fernández-Sáiz V. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19600-19606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Montgomery D.L. Morimoto R.I. Gierasch L.M. J. Mol.

Equilibrium binding curves were obtained with increasing protein concentrations, and the anisotropy increase for each protein was fitted to a single site binding model (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The mutants, particularly DnaK1A and DnaK3A, show a slightly decreased affinity for F-APPY (Table 1).TABLE 1F-APPY dissociation and binding constantsKdk+1k−1μmm−1 ·s−1s−1·103DnaK0.11 (±0.009)5700.60DnaK1A0.25 (±0.019)91,400aThese values are a rough estimation of the kinetic constants (see text).16.45aThese values are a rough estimation of the kinetic constants (see text).DnaK2A0.18 (±0.013)13760.81DnaK3A0.41 (±0.007)6140.50a These values are a rough estimation of the kinetic constants (see text). Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters k+1 and k-1 were also estimated by following F-APPY binding at increasing protein concentrations. The data were fitted to a single exponential compatible with a single site binding model (Fig. 3A). From the linear plots of kobs versus protein concentration, k-1 (y-intercept) and k+1 (slope) were obtained (Fig. 3B). These parameters are clearly different for the mutants analyzed here, as seen in Table 1. Although the kinetic constants of wt and DnaK3A are very similar, those of DnaK2A are 1.4- to 2-times higher, and the single mutation in DnaK1A induces a dramatic increase of the association (∼160-fold) and dissociation (∼27.4-fold) rates. The Kd values estimated from these kinetic parameters for wt DnaK, DnaK2A, and DnaK3A also indicate that their affinity for F-APPY is comparable. In the case of DnaK1A, the binding process is too fast to obtain a reliable Kd value from kinetic measurements with our experimental time resolution (see Fig. 3A), and only a rough estimation of the kinetic constants can be achieved. This behavior is similar to that observed for a DnaK lidless mutant (14Buckzynski G. Slepenkov V. Shorn M.G. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27231-27236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Moro F. Fernández-Sáiz V. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19600-19606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As expected for a bimolecular reaction, increasing temperatures enhance the rate of DnaK-peptide complex formation, the final anisotropy value being slightly lower at higher temperatures (Fig. 4, A and B). When the same experiment is performed with DnaK2A and DnaK3A, essentially the same temperature dependence of the peptide anisotropy is observed. It should be noted that the final protein concentration was adjusted (1 μm for wt DnaK, DnaK1A, and DnaK2A; 3 μm for DnaK3A, Fig. 2A) to account for the differences in affinity, so that >90% of the added peptide substrate was bound. The stability of the substrate-protein complex against the thermal challenge is clearly different for DnaK1A mutant. In this case, the amount of bound peptide diminishes with temperature in such a way that at stress temperatures this mutant is unable to stably bind F-APPY (Fig. 4, A and B). Cycling the sample between 25 °C and 42 °C induces reversible changes in the anisotropy of the DnaK1A-peptide mixture (Fig. 4C), indicating that the temperature-induced conformational transition responsible for the change in affinity of DnaK1A for F-APPY is reversible, as described for a lidless mutant of DnaK (16Moro F. Fernández-Sáiz V. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19600-19606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Secondary Structure and Stability of wt DnaK and the Mutants—The secondary structure of wt DnaK and the three mutants studied here was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5A, a comparison of the shapes and ellipticity values suggests that mutant proteins adopt a secondary structure similar to that of wt DnaK and, therefore, that mutations do not alter this structural level. To analyze whether the thermal stability of the protein was modified by the mutations, the ellipticity at 222 nm was measured as a function of temperature. Similar melting curves were obtained for wt DnaK, DnaK1A, and DnaK2A mutants (Fig. 5B). They do display transitions with similar amplitudes at ∼43 °C and 70 °C, as previously reported for the wild-type protein (33Palleros R.D. Shi L. Reid L. Katherine and Fink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the melting curve of DnaK3A displays a transition at ∼45 °C, whereas that at ∼70 °C is hardly detected. It should be noted that the ellipticity value at 90 °C is similar for all proteins indicating that their thermally denatured conformation is also similar. Protein stability was also characterized by DSC, which provides the thermodynamic parameters of the unfolding process. The thermogram of wt DnaK (Fig. 6) shows three transitions that have been previously assigned (25Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The lowest temperature transition comes from the unfolding of the ATPase domain, the second peak is due to the denaturation of the substrate binding domain, and the high temperature one contains contributions from the denaturation of both protein domains. The DSC profiles of all mutants differ considerably from that of wt DnaK. The thermogram of DnaK1A reflects a destabilization of the ATPase and substrate bind"

We previously showed that the germ cell-specific proteins FRGY2a and FRGY2b were responsible for this unusually drastic nucleolar disassembly. The nucleolar disassembly occurs without inhibition of pre-rRNA transcription, a well known trigger for nucleolar segregation, and the mechanism for the nucleolar disassembly by FRGY2a and FRGY2b remains largely unknown. In this study, we searched for FRGY2a-interacting proteins and investigated the functional consequences of their interactions through a series of experiments. We showed that during the nucleolar disassembly, FRGY2a localized to the nucleoli of isolated nuclei and was capable of disassembling purified nucleoli, suggesting a direct interaction between FRGY2a and nucleolar components. Using a His tag pulldown approach, we identified the abundant and multifunctional nucleolar protein B23 as a potential target of FRGY2a and its related human protein YB1. A specific interaction between FRGY2a/YB1 and B23 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Finally, B23 knockdown using short interfering RNA and a subsequent add-back experiment confirmed that B23 was necessary for nucleolar disassembly by YB1. We propose that FRGY2a and YB1 disassemble nucleoli by sequestering B23, which is associated with pre-ribosomes and other structurally important nucleolar components.

We propose that FRGY2a and YB1 disassemble nucleoli by sequestering B23, which is associated with pre-ribosomes and other structurally important nucleolar components. Reversible disassembly of nucleoli is one of the most striking phenomena that donor nuclei exhibit in Xenopus somatic cell nuclear cloning. Physiologically, Xenopus eggs and early embryos do not contain nucleoli or transcribe rRNA until the midblastula transition, when zygotic transcription initiates and nucleoli are assembled (1Verheggen C. Le Panse S. Almouzni G. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When somatic nuclei are injected into eggs, the nucleoli of the donor nuclei disappear within 40 min and reappear during the midblastula transition, exactly recapitulating physiological nucleolar disassembly and reassembly (2Gurdon J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism of nucleolar disassembly in the donor nuclei and gain new insight into the physiological dynamics of nucleoli in early Xenopus embryos, we established an in vitro nucleolar disassembly assay by combining Xenopus egg extract and somatic nuclei. Using this assay, we have found that the Xenopus germ cell-specific proteins FRGY2a and FRGY2b (collectively called FRGY2a/b) are responsible for the reversible disassembly of somatic nucleoli in egg cytoplasm (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). FRGY2a/b were initially isolated as key proteins responsible for masking maternally derived mRNA within eggs and early embryos to prevent premature translation of mRNA (4Sommerville J. Ladomery M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Later, they were additionally discovered to be transcription factors for several germ cell-specific genes (5Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). FRGY2a (336 amino acids) and FRGY2b (324 amino acids) share 83.0% identity at the amino acid level, and each recombinant protein can disassemble nucleoli on its own (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains of these proteins contain the evolutionarily conserved cold shock domain, which is responsible for their binding to the Y-box DNA sequence 5′-CTGATTGG-3′ of germ cell-specific gene promoters during transcriptional activation or repression (6Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 7Kohno K. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Ashizuka M. Kuwano M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domains also contain two RNA-binding motifs, RNP1-like and RNP2-like, within the cold shock domain, providing binding sites for mRNA. The C-terminal domains of these proteins are about 200 amino acids long, including four basic/aromatic amino acid islands, and are capable of disassembling nucleoli in isolated nuclei and in transfected cells, without the N-terminal domains. When Xenopus somatic nuclei are treated with the C-terminal domain of FRGY2a for 2 h, the nucleoli are almost completely disassembled, leaving only tiny remnants containing rDNA and associated RNA polymerase I transcription machinery. Surprisingly, the nucleolar remnants can continue pre-rRNA transcription as efficiently as intact nucleoli, indicating that nucleolar disassembly mediated by FRGY2a/b is not due to the inhibition of pre-rRNA transcription, which is the most common trigger for nucleolar segregation (8Simard R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1970; 28: 169-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Hernandez-Verdun D. Roussel P. Gebrane-Younes J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2265-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until now, virtually nothing was known about how FRGY2a/b disassemble nucleoli. Since FRGY2a/b are the first identified proteins that have the capability of disassembling nucleoli, determining the molecular basis by which they promote this process will yield new insights into the structural organization of the nucleolus in a broader context than that of nuclear cloning. In this study, we isolated proteins that interact with FRGY2a during nucleolar disassembly and found that the multifunctional nucleolar protein B23 was necessary for nucleolar disassembly by FRGY2a. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—cDNAs of FRGY2a, FRGY2a-C (amino acids 120-336; -N and -C after the protein names indicate the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively), FRGY1, FRGY1-C-(113-303), YB1, YB1-N-(1-134), YB1-C-(135-325), enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged FRGY2a (EGFP 4The abbreviations used are: EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RNP, ribonucleoprotein. -FRGY2a), EGFP-FRGY2a-N-(1-119), and EGFP-FRGY2a-C-(120-336) were subcloned into the pET-21c(+) vector with a His6 tag at the C terminus (Novagen). The accuracy of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. These plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and production of the recombinant proteins was induced by treatment with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside for 3 h. E. coli pellets obtained from an 8-liter culture were resuspended in 160 ml of recombinant binding buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 8 m urea, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) and sonicated with a Sonifier 450 (Branson) for 1 min six times with 50% duty cycle at output 6. The sonicated E. coli suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was gently rocked with 40 ml of nickel resin nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C. The nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid was packed into an Econo-column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 480 ml of recombinant binding buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with recombinant elution buffer (the same as recombinant binding buffer except for 500 mm imidazole, instead of 10 mm). Eluted recombinant protein (about 10 ml) was renatured by dialysis against a series of buffers at 4 °C as follows. First, 1 liter of 1 m urea, 2 m NaCl buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 2 m NaCl, 1 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 0.003% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) was used for 1 h. Second, 1 liter of 0.5 m urea, 2 m NaCl buffer (the same as 1 m urea, 2 m NaCl buffer, except for 0.5 m urea) was used for 1 h. Third, 1 liter of 2 m NaCl buffer (the same as 1 m urea, 2 m NaCl buffer, except for no urea) was used for 12 h. Finally, 2 liters of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.003% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) was used for 4 h. Purification of YB1 from HeLa Cells—We prepared whole cell extract from a 10-liter culture of HeLa S3 cells (National Cell Culture Center) as described previously with some modifications (10Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). Briefly, we added 100 μl of cytoplasmic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, and 0.025% Nonidet P-40) to 107 cells and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, we recovered supernatant as the cytoplasmic extract. We then added 50 μl of nuclear buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm leupeptin, and 1.5 mm pepstatin A) to the pellet and incubated it on ice for 20 min. We centrifuged the sample at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and collected supernatant as the nuclear extract. The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were combined and kept in aliquot at -70 °C. The extract was first applied to an SP-Sepharose cation exchange column, and bound protein was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 150 mm to 1 m in Buffer A. The fractions that showed nucleolar disassembly activity, eluted by 700-800 mm NaCl, were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A. The dialyzed sample was applied to a HiTrap heparin column, and bound protein was eluted by an NaCl gradient from 150 mm to 1 m in Buffer A. Pooled active fractions, eluted by 650-750 mm NaCl, were dialyzed against Buffer A, applied to a Mono Q 5/5 anion exchange column, and fractionated by a linear gradient of NaCl from 150 mm to 1 m in Buffer A. Finally, the pooled active fractions, eluted by 450-550 mm NaCl in Buffer A, were fractionated by a Superdex 200 gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer A. All columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Throughout this purification process, the nucleolar disassembly activity co-fractionated with YB1, as monitored by immunoblotting using anti-YB1 antibody (gift from V. Evdokimova) (11Evdokimova V. Ruzanov P. Imataka H. Raught B. Svitkin Y. Ovchinnikov L.P. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5491-5502Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although YB1 was widely distributed in fractions obtained from the SP-Sepharose column, only the fractions that demonstrated nucleolar disassembly activity were further fractionated as described above. Reverse Transcription-PCR of FRGY1 from XL2 Cells—Total RNA isolated from XL2 cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). cDNA of FRGY1 was amplified with the primers 5′-GGTAGCAGCGAGGTTGAAACAC-3′ and 5′-CTCAGCCCCGCCCTGCTCAG-3′ using Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The amplified cDNA was sequenced for verification. In Vitro Nucleolar Disassembly Assay—HeLa and Xenopus embryonic fibroblasts XL2 cells at 2 × 106 cell/ml were treated with digitonin (50 μg/ml) to permeabilize both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope (12Kikyo N. Wade P.A. Guschin D. Ge H. Wolffe A.P. Science. 2000; 289: 2360-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells are hereafter called nuclei. The nucleolar disassembly reaction consisted of 15 μm FRGY2a-related proteins (FRGY2a, FRGY1, YB1, and their N- and C-terminal domains), 1 × 105 nuclei, and the energy regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 20 mm phosphocreatine, and 1 μm creatine phosphokinase) in Buffer A. After incubation of the reaction mix for 2 h at 25 °C, the nuclei were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and spun onto coverslips by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 7 min for immunofluorescence microscopy as described below. For Fig. 2C, the nuclei on coverslips were treated with 0.1 u/μl (final concentration) of DNase I (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of Buffer A for 30 min at 25 °C. HeLa cell nucleoli were prepared based on a published protocol (13Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 HeLa cells were resuspended in 500 μl of Buffer 1 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and were ground 10 times with a Micro Duall tissue grinder (Kontes, 0.15-mm clearance) followed by centrifugation at 230 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Buffer 2 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and 250 mm sucrose) and overlaid onto 3 ml of Buffer 3 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 350 mm sucrose) in a 5-ml test tube. After centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer 3 and sonicated with a Sonifier 450 for 1 min 5 five times with 50% duty cycle at output 3. After confirmation under a phase contrast microscope that grossly intact nucleoli were isolated, the nucleolar suspension was overlaid onto 3 ml of Buffer 4 (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 880 mm sucrose) in a 5-ml tube and centrifuged at 2,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nucleolar pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer 3 and incubated with Buffer A or FRGY2a as described above for the nucleolar disassembly assay. Transfection of FRGY1, YB1, and YB1-C into HeLa Cells—We subcloned cDNAs of FRGY1, YB1, and YB1-C into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-)A with a His6 tag at the C terminus (Invitrogen). For transfection of the plasmids, we added 1 μg of plasmid and 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to 1 × 105 HeLa cells cultured on cover slides in 48-well plates following the instruction of Lipofectamine 2000. Vector alone was used for the mock transfection. Protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted at 1:1,000) and Cy3-labeled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:1,000) 24 h after transfection. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Nuclei were stained with primary antibodies against Xenopus B23 (provided by M. Schmidt-Zachmann, diluted at 1:30,000) (14Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Hugle B. Scheer U. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 153: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), mouse B23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1,000), UBF (a gift from B. McStay, 1:1,000) (15Cairns C. McStay B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4583-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and fibrillarin (Cytoskeleton, 1:1,000), and secondary antibodies labeled with Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, all 1:1,000). Topro 3 (Molecular Probes) was used for DNA counterstaining. The mounting solution for the cover slides contained 1,4-diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (Sigma), 50% glycerol, and phosphate-buffered saline. Images were captured with an Axioskop 2 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Radiance 2100 confocal system (Zeiss). The results were quantified with 200 randomly selected nuclei or cells in each experiment. Electron Microscopy—This procedure was performed as described previously (1Verheggen C. Le Panse S. Almouzni G. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The nuclei were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. They were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and embedded in Polybed 812 (Polysciences). Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with the Joel 1200-EX electron microscope. His Tag Pull-down—After incubation of HeLa or XL2 nuclei with 15 μm YB1, YB1-N, YB1-C, and FRGY2a-C for 1.5 h, extract was prepared from the nuclei as described above. Thirty μl of extract prepared from 2 × 106 nuclei was incubated with 150 μl of binding buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 350 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) and 50 μl of nickel resin at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was washed with 800 μl of binding buffer, and the bound proteins (input and associated proteins) were eluted by elution buffer (the same as binding buffer except for 250 mm imidazole). The input and associated proteins were compared by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were cut out from the SDS protein gel and digested with trypsin. The peptide fragments were applied to Biflex III (Bruker Daltonics) for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and analyzed with the MASCOT software (Matrix Science). Protein identities were confirmed by LCQ Classic ion trap mass spectrometry (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with the Pico View nanoelectrospray source (New Objective). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells transfected with YB1-C-His6 using Lipofectamine 2000 were incubated for 24 h. Fifty μl of extract prepared from these cells as described above was precleared with GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and then incubated with 4 μg of anti-His antibody or control IgG (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Following the addition of 30 μl of GammaBind G, the extract was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The proteins bound to GammaBind G were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, applied to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-His antibody (diluted at 1:1,000) and anti-B23 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., 1:1,000). For immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled proteins, cDNAs encoding YB1-C and B23 were subcloned into the pSP64 poly(A) expression plasmid. These two proteins were separately prepared in vitro in the presence of [35S]Met using the TnT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Fifty μl of the reaction mix containing 35S-labeled YB1-C was precleared with 40 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose and then incubated with 4 μg of recombinant B23-His6 for 1 h at 4°C. After another incubation for 1 h at 4°C with 6 μg of anti-His antibody or control IgG, 20 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose was added and further incubated for 1 h at 4°C. Finally, the proteins bound to the GammaBind G were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and applied to gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation from the combination of YB1-C-His6 and 35S-labeled B23 was performed by the same procedure. B23 Knockdown by siRNA—The sense strand sequences of short interfering RNA (siRNA) are as follows: WT-1 (5′-AAGUAUAUCUGGAAAGCGGUC-3′), MT-1 (5′-AAGUAUAUCUCCAAAGCGGUC-3′, underlined are mutated ribonucleotides), WT-2 (5′-AGUGGAAGCCAAAUUCAUCTT-3′), and CTL (5′-ACUACCGUUGUUAUAGGUGTT-3′). These siRNA were fluorescein-labeled at the 5′ end. HeLa cells (3 × 106) were seeded in a 10-cm tissue culture plate and transfected with 100 nm siRNA on day 1 and day 4 using 70 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 each. The cells were used for the nucleolar disassembly assay on day 8. It was necessary to transfect siRNA twice to knock down the B23 level below the threshold of detection by immunostaining. To add back B23, we subcloned B23 cDNA into the pDsRed-C1 vector (Clontech). We introduced 50 μg of the plasmid with 50 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 into HeLa cells in a 10-cm dish that had already been treated with B23 siRNA. The DsRed-positive cells were sorted with a FACSAria fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and used for the nucleolar disassembly assay with 15 μm YB1-C. Nucleolar Disassembly by FRGY2a-related Proteins—We first studied nucleolar disassembly with FRGY1, a Xenopus FRGY2a-related protein, and its human ortholog, YB1. FRGY1 is a ubiquitously expressed somatic cell protein that is 46.7% identical to FRGY2a at the amino acid level (5Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). FRGY1 is expressed in Xenopus XL2 cells as demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1A). In human cells, YB1 plays multiple roles in transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes, masking of mRNA in many cell types, and mediation of stress responses (7Kohno K. Izumi H. Uchiumi T. Ashizuka M. Kuwano M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In immunofluorescence staining, YB1 is primarily detectable in the cytoplasm without any clear signal in nucleoli (16Zhang Y.F. Homer C. Edwards S.J. Hananeia L. Lasham A. Royds J. Sheard P. Braithwaite A.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2782-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To examine the roles of these proteins in nucleolar disassembly, we prepared recombinant fulllength, N-terminal, and C-terminal domains of FRGY2a, FRGY1, YB1, and EGFP-FRGY2a (Fig. 1B). In addition, we purified endogenous YB1 from HeLa cell extract based on its ability to disassemble HeLa cell nucleoli in isolated nuclei (Fig. 1B). Since HeLa cells contain 2.6 × 106 YB1 molecules/cell (17Davydova E.K. Evdokimova V.M. Ovchinnikov L.P. Hershey J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2911-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and 1 ml of HeLa cell pellet, which was depleted with culture medium as much as possible, contains 0.7-1.2 × 109 cells, we estimated the YB1 concentration within HeLa cells to be 3.0-5.2 μm. (2.6 × 106 molecules/cell × 0.7 × 109 cells/ml × 103 ml/l)/(6.02 × 1023 molecules/mole) = 3.0 μm. (6.02 × 1023 is Avogadro's number.) Endogenous YB1 was undetectable in the isolated nuclei (data not shown). All of these proteins, except for the N-terminal domains, could disassemble nucleoli in over 90% of the nuclei from HeLa and XL2 cells, as monitored by loss of definitive nucleoli with phase contrast microscopy and the disappearance of the abundant nucleolar protein B23 (also called numatrin, NO38, and nucleophosmin) from nuclei in the in vitro nucleolar disassembly assay (Fig. 1C). These proteins were effective above 15 μm, which was slightly higher than the estimated YB1 concentration within the cells. This difference can be explained by potential problems with the recombinant proteins, such as aggregation and aberrant three-dimensional structures. Although FRGY2a purified from Xenopus egg extract could disassemble Xenopus and mammalian nucleoli, crude Xenopus egg extract could disassemble only Xenopus nucleoli (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reason for this species specificity of egg extract is currently unknown. Transfected full-length FRGY2a is sequestered in the cytoplasm of XL2 cells, presumably by association with mRNA through the RNP1-like and RNP2-like motifs in the N-terminal domain, and does not disassemble nucleoli (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, transfected FRGY2a-C can enter nuclei and disassemble nucleoli (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Likewise, although transfected full-length FRGY1 and YB1 did not enter nuclei or disassemble nucleoli (data not shown), FRGY1-C and YB1-C could enter nuclei and disassemble nucleoli in 25-40% of the expressing HeLa and XL2 cells (Fig. 1D). The nuclei with dispersed nucleoli displayed irregular shapes 48 h after transfection, and most of these cells died by 72-96 h after transfection (not shown). Nucleolar Accumulation of FRGY2a during Nucleolar Disassembly—Next we investigated the subnuclear localization of EGFP-FRGY2a during nucleolar disassembly in XL2 nuclei. Although video microscopy of a single cell would have been ideal for this purpose, the high background level of the EGFP signal in the reaction mix made it difficult to interpret. As an alternative, we incubated XL2 nuclei with EGFP-FRGY2a and aborted the reaction at several time points by paraformaldehyde fixation to observe the temporal profile of the EGFP-FRGY2a localization during nucleolar disassembly. A preliminary study confirmed that EGFP alone did not localize to nucleoli (data not shown). The combination of EGFP-FRGY2a localization and nucleolar disassembly could roughly be divided into four patterns (Fig. 2, A and B). Pattern A showed negligible nuclear uptake of EGFP-FRGY2a and no dispersal of B23. Fifteen minutes into the reaction, pattern B, in which EGFP-FRGY2a primarily accumulated in the nucleoli and was weakly distributed in the nucleoplasm, appeared in ∼20% of the nuclei. Although the nucleoli remained grossly intact in the phase contrast image of this pattern, the B23 level was significantly decreased, suggesting that nucleolar disassembly was already taking place at the molecular level. After 30 min of incubation, EGFP-FRGY2a localized to small nucleolar remnants accompanied by significant nucleoplasmic distribution in about 80% of the nuclei (pattern C). B23 was undetectable in the nucleoli in this pattern. Pattern C remained until the end of the course, except that EGFP-FRGY2a was no longer detectable in the nucleoplasm in ∼10% of the nuclei after 2 h (pattern D). In pattern D, EGFP-FRGY2a colocalized with the RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF, which remained bound to rDNA during nucleolar disassembly (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), implying binding of EGFP-FRGY2a to rDNA or associated molecules (Fig. 2C). This was confirmed by the disappearance of the EGFP signal with DNase I treatment of the nuclei. EGFP-FRGY2a-C showed essentially the same four distribution patterns during nucleolar disassembly (data not shown). The nucleolar localization indicates direct interactions between FRGY2a and an unidentified nucleolar component(s). Because pre-rRNA transcription is not grossly affected by FRGY2a (3Gonda K. Fowler J. Katoku-Kikyo N. Haroldson J. Wudel J. Kikyo N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we do not know the functional implications of the localization of EGFP-FRGY2a on rDNA or associated molecules. FRGY2a Directly Disassembles Nucleoli—To further examine whether FRGY2a disassembles nucleoli as a result of direct interactions with nucleolar components or it requires other nuclear or cytoplasmic components during this process, we incubated isolated HeLa cell nucleoli with FRGY2a. We washed the isolated nucleoli extensively with Buffer A prior to incubation to eliminate other nuclear and cytoplasmic components from the nucleolar suspension. Double staining of the nucleoli with antibodies against B23 and UBF (as an indicator of rDNA) was used to monitor nucleolar disassembly. The nucleoli incubated in Buffer A remained as large as those in intact cells (B23 stain) and contained both B23 (green) and UBF (red), as shown by the yellow signals in the merged image (Fig. 3). By contrast, the nucleoli incubated with FRGY2a were smaller (B23 stain), and their B23 was separated from UBF as demonstrated by the many red particles in the merged image. This result shows that FRGY2a can directly disassemble nucleoli without significant contributions from other cellular components. Isolation of FRGY2a-interacting Proteins—To identify molecules that interact with FRGY2a during nucleolar disassembly, we employed the His tag pull-down approach. After incubation of HeLa nuclei with YB1-N, YB1-C, and FRGY2a-C (all tagged with His6) separately for 90 min, the His-tagged bait and associated proteins were isolated using nickel resin and applied to SDS-PAGE. Since only YB1-C and FRGY2a-C could disassemble nucleoli, we focused on proteins that were pulled down with both YB1-C and FRGY2a-C (Fig. 4A, second gel from the left, YB1-C HPD and FRGY2a-C HPD) but not with YB1-N (YB1-N HPD). Only one band at about 40 kDa fulfilled this criterion (Fig. 4A, arrowheads). Mass spectrometry identified this protein as B23. When this experiment was repeated with the combination of XL2 nuclei and FRGY2a-C, B23 was again recovered with FRGY2a-C (Fig. 4A, a doublet indicated by an arrow). Because B23 is involved in ribosome biogenesis by interacting with 40 S and 65 S pre-ribosomal particles (18Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Hu"
https://openalex.org/W2037742726,"Mutations of myosin VIIA cause deafness in various species from human and mice to Zebrafish and Drosophila. We analyzed the kinetic mechanism of the ATPase cycle of Drosophila myosin VIIA by using a single-headed construct with the entire neck domain. The steady-state ATPase activity (0.06 s–1) was markedly activated by actin to yield Vmax and KATPase of 1.72 s–1 and 3.2 μm, respectively. The most intriguing finding is that the ATP hydrolysis predominantly takes place in the actin-bound form (actin-attached hydrolysis) for the actomyosin VIIA ATPase reaction. The ATP hydrolysis rate was much faster for the actin-attached form than the dissociated form, in contrast to other myosins reported so far. Both the ATP hydrolysis step and the phosphate release step were significantly faster than the entire ATPase cycle rate, thus not rate-determining. The rate of ADP dissociation from actomyosin VIIA was 1.86 s–1, which was comparable with the overall ATPase cycle rate, thus assigned to be a rate-determining step. The results suggest that Drosophila myosin VIIA spends the majority of the ATPase cycle in an actomyosin·ADP form, a strong actin binding state. The duty ratio calculated from our kinetic model was ∼0.9. Therefore, myosin VIIA is classified to be a high duty ratio motor. The present results suggested that myosin VIIA can be a processive motor to serve cargo trafficking in cells once it forms a dimer structure.

The present results suggested that myosin VIIA can be a processive motor to serve cargo trafficking in cells once it forms a dimer structure. Myosins are motor proteins that interact with actin filaments and convert the energy from ATP hydrolysis to produce a mechanical force. Myosins are classified based upon phylogenetic sequence comparisons of the motor domain and divided into at least 18 classes (1Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 2Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Myosin VIIA has received a great deal of interest because it was identified as a responsible gene of human Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B) (8Weil D. Blanchard S. Kaplan J. Guilford P. Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A. Levilliers J. Weston M.D. Kelley P.M. Kimberling W.J. Wagenaar M. Levi-Acobas F. Larget-Piet D. Munnich A. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.M. Petit C. Nature. 1995; 374: 60-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), and two forms of nonsyndromic deafness, DFNB2 and DFNA11 (9Weil D. Kussel P. Blanchard S. Levy G. Levi-Acobas F. Drira M. Ayadi H. Petit C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 10Liu X.Z. Walsh J. Mburu P. Kendrick-Jones J. Cope M.J. Steel K.P. Brown S.D. Nat.

Genet. 1997; 17: 268-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Quite recently, it was reported that myosin VIIA mutations lead to deafness in Drosophila (12Todi S.V. Franke J.D. Kiehart D.P. Eberl D.F. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 862-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the reason why the lack of myosin VIIA causes these abnormalities is unknown, but obviously, this is due in part to the lack of knowledge regarding the myosin VIIA function at a molecular basis. The N-terminal domain of myosin VIIA is a conserved motor domain, and there are no obvious large extensions or insertions in this domain. The neck domain contains five IQ motifs that are thought to be a light chain binding site. Because calmodulin is co-purified with myosin VIIA (13Todorov P.T. Hardisty R.E. Brown S.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is thought that myosin VIIA has calmodulin as its light chain subunit. The tail domain consists of a proximal segment of coiled-coil domain followed by a globular domain. Because of the presence of the coiled-coil domain, it has been assumed that myosin VIIA exists as a dimer, i.e. two-headed structure. However, there is no hard evidence showing that myosin VIIA is a two-headed myosin. The tail of myosin VIIA contains two large repeats, each containing a MyTH4 domain and a talin homology domain (14Chen Z.Y. Hasson T. Kelley P.M. Schwender B.J. Schwartz M.F. Ramakrishnan M. Kimberling W.J. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. Genomics. 1996; 36: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Although the function of MyTH4 domain is obscure, it has been proposed that this domain may function as a cargo-binding site. The talin-like domain is similar to domains in talin, ezrin, moesin, and other proteins. Because of the presence of these domains, myosin VIIA has been thought to be associated with membranes or vesicles. Mammalian myosin VIIA is exclusively expressed along the stereocilia in the sensory hair cells (15Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Self T. Mahony M. Fleming J. Walsh J. Brown S.D. Steel K.P. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that myosin VIIA may play a role in the assembly of the stereocilia into a bundled array, thus maintaining rigidity during the movement of the bundles. Myosin VIIA also serves as a transporter in the pericuticular necklace of the hair cell (15Hasson T. Gillespie P.G. Garcia J.A. MacDonald R.B. Zhao Y. Yee A.G. Mooseker M.S. Corey D.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1287-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) and photoreceptor cell (17Liu X. Udovichenko I.P. Brown S.D. Steel K.P. Williams D.S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6267-6274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, myosin VIIA plays an important role in phagocytosis in the photoreceptor cell (18Hasson T. Heintzelman M.B. Santos-Sacchi J. Corey D.P. Mooseker M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9815-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and in Dictyostelium (19Titus M.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1297-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These cell biological studies have suggested the two potential functions, i.e. cargo transport and contraction. One critical issue for the physiological relevance of each motor protein in diverse cellular motile systems is the processivity of each motor protein. It is known that conventional myosin is a typical nonprocessive motor in which the motor protein dissociates from the track (actin) during each cross-bridge cycle. On the other hand, a processive motor such as myosin Va, which can move on actin filaments for a long distance without dissociation (20Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A. Mooseker M.S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), is suitable for cargo transport. It is unknown whether or not myosin VIIA is a processive motor. The motor function of myosin VIIA at a molecular basis is largely unknown, and the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanoenzymatic characteristics of myosin VIIA by analyzing the kinetic mechanism of actomyosin VIIA ATPase. In particular, we attempted to determine the duty ratio that is closely related to the processivity of the motor proteins. Our results suggest that myosin VIIA is a high duty ratio motor. Materials—Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 7-methylguanosine, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase were obtained from Sigma. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pyrene-actin was prepared as described (25Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Recombinant calmodulin was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (28Ikebe M. Kambara T. Stafford W.F. Sata M. Katayama E. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17702-17707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Drosophila Myosin VIIA Protein—Drosophila myosin VIIA cDNA was obtained from Drosophila total RNA by using reverse transcriptase-coupled PCR. The nucleotide sequence was determined by direct DNA sequencing to confirm the authenticity of the DNA sequence of the clone. The cDNA fragment encoding Met1–Glu926 was subcloned into modified pFastBacHT baculovirus transfer vector containing a FLAG tag sequence at the 5′-end of the polylinker region. This construct (DM7AIQ5) encodes the entire motor domain plus all five IQ motifs of myosin VIIA. To express the recombinant DM7AIQ5 protein, Sf9 cells (about 1 × 109 cells) were co-infected with two viruses expressing the DM7AIQ5 heavy chain and calmodulin. The infected cells were cultured for 3 days at 28 °C. Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline and 5 mm EGTA. Cells were then lysed with sonication in 20 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated with 300 μl of anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4°C. The resin suspension was then loaded on a column (1 × 10 cm) and washed with 30 ml of buffer A (20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). DM7AIQ5 was eluted with buffer A containing 0.1 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The DM7AIQ5 was dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The purified DM7AIQ5 was stored on ice and used within 2 days. 0.1–0.2 mg of the purified protein was obtained from a standard infection. Protein concentration was determined by the densitometry analysis of SDS-PAGE using smooth muscle myosin heavy chain as a standard. All experiments were done with three to six independent preparations. ATPase Assay—The steady-state ATPase activity was measured in the presence of the ATP-regeneration system (20 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) at 25 °C. The reaction was carried out in buffer B with 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described (29Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stopped-flow Measurements—Kinetic measurements were performed in buffer B with 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin at 25 °C using a KinTek SF-2001 apparatus (KinTek Co., Clarence, PA) with a 75-watt xenon lamp. Mant-nucleotides (λex = 280 or 360 nm) and pyrene-actin (λex = 365 nm) were monitored through a 400 nm cut-off filter. Intrinsic tryptophan residues in DM7AIQ5 were excited at 295 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored through 340 nm cut-off filter. Light scattering was monitored at 420 nm. MDCC-PBP (λex = 465 nm) was monitored through a 450 nm cut-off filter. In the measurement of phosphate release, all solutions and syringes were preincubated with 3 μm MDCC-PBP, 0.02 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 0.2 mm 7-methylguanosine. The volume ratio of the syringe was 1:1 in all single mixing experiments, and 1:1:1 in double mixing experiments. Kinetic simulations were performed using STELLA software (isee systems™, Lebanon, NH). Quenched-flow Measurement—Quenched-flow measurement was performed in buffer B with 0.2 mg/ml calmodulin at 25 °C using a KinTek RQF-3 apparatus (KinTek Co., Clarence, PA) as described (30Kambara T. Rhodes T.E. Ikebe R. Yamada M. White H.D. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16400-16406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of MyosinVIIA Construct—We produced a Drosophila myosin VIIA construct having the motor domain and the entire neck domain (Met1–Glu926). We found that this construct (DM7AIQ5) is a single-headed structure based upon the molecular mass estimated by gel filtration analysis and electron microscopic observation (data not shown). DM7AIQ5 was used in this study to avoid the possible complexity because of the head-head interaction. DM7AIQ5 and calmodulin were co-expressed in Sf9 cells and purified with the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin column. The isolated DM7AIQ5 had an apparent molecular mass of 108 kDa and was co-purified with a low molecular mass peptide (Fig. 1A). The mobility of the low molecular mass peptide on an SDS-PAGE increased with Ca2+, suggesting that it is calmodulin (data not shown). Steady-state ATPase Activity of DM7AIQ5—The steady-state ATPase activity of DM7AIQ5 was markedly activated by actin. Fig. 1B shows the ATPase activity of DM7AIQ5 as a function of actin concentration. The ATPase activities at various actin concentrations were fitted with a Michaelis-Menten equation, giving Vmax and KATPase of 1.72 ± 0.12 s–1 and 3.2 ± 1.1 μm, respectively. MgATP Binding to DM7AIQ5 and Acto-DM7AIQ5—Fig. 2 shows the mant-ATP concentration dependence of the rate of mant-ATP binding to DM7AIQ5. The time course of an increase in the fluorescence intensity was fitted with single exponential kinetics for both DM7AIQ5 and acto-DM7AIQ5 (Fig. 2, insets). The observed rate constants showed a linear dependence on the mant-ATP concentration. Based upon the tangent of the slope, a second order rate constant (K1k+2) of 3.4 ± 0.2 μm–1 s–1 for DM7AIQ5 was obtained. Most interestingly, the mant-ATP binding rate was markedly decreased by actin to yield a second order rate constant (K1′k+′2) of 0.47 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1. Because the y intercepts reflect the rate of the reverse reaction of the ATP binding step, k–2 and k–′2 were estimated to be <0.3 and 0.58 ± 0.04 s–1, respectively. MgATP-induced Dissociation of Acto-DM7AIQ5—It is known that myosin quickly dissociates from actin upon the binding of ATP. The kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of acto-DM7AIQ5 was monitored by measuring the ATP-induced change in the light-scattering intensity of acto-DM7AIQ5. The decrease in the light-scattering intensity because of the dissociation of DM7AIQ5 from actin followed single exponential kinetics (Fig. 3, inset). The obtained apparent rate constants showed a hyperbolic saturation curve against ATP concentration (Fig. 3). The initial tangent of the ATP dependence of the hyperbola represents a second order rate constant of ATP binding to acto-DM7AIQ5 (K1′k+′2). The value (0.35 ± 0.04 μm–1 s–1) was consistent with that obtained by measuring directly using mant-ATP (Fig. 2). The results suggest that the mant-moiety does not significantly influence the ATP binding rate to DM7AIQ5. The observed rate constants were saturated at >200 s–1, which was more than 100-fold larger than the Vmax value of the steady-state ATPase activity of DM7AIQ5. Pyrene-labeled actin was also employed to monitor the ATP-induced population of the weakly bound acto-DM7AIQ5 state. The fluorescence intensity of pyrene-actin increased upon the addition of ATP to pyrene-acto-DM7AIQ5. From the time course of the observed fluorescence transition, the apparent rate constants were determined at various ATP concentrations. The results showed a hyperbolic dependence against ATP concentration, and the ATP dependence was almost identical to that obtained from the change in light scattering (Table 1). These results suggest that the ATP binding step and the following isomerization step (k′+2) are not rate-limiting for acto-DM7AIQ5 ATPase cycle, and the dissociation of acto-DM7AIQ5 (k+8, k–8 pathway) is a rapid process.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of DM7AIQ5 ATPase cycle and comparison with myosin VIIBSignalDrosophila VIIADrosophila VIIBaData are from Ref. 41.Mouse VIIBbData are from Ref. 42.Steady statev0 (s-1)0.057 ± 0.0410.020.03Vmax (s-1)1.72 ± 0.128.41.17KATPase (μm)3.2 ± 1.1390.66ATP bindingK1 k+2 (μm-1 s-1)Mant-ATP3.4 ± 0.23.41.8Tryptophan2.6 ± 0.24.74.1K′1 k′+2 (μm-1 s-1)Mant-ATP0.47 ± 0.022.2, 0.46Light-scattering0.35 ± 0.041.1Pyrene-actin0.36 ± 0.051.3, 0.311.4k+2 (s-1)Light-scattering>200>400, >50cPyrene-actin.729k-2 (s-1)Mant-ATP<0.3k′-2 (s-1)Mant-ATP0.58 ± 0.04ATP hydrolysisk+3 + k-3 (s-1)Tryptophan12.6 ± 0.9160318Quenched-flow13.2 ± 3.4K3Quenched-flow0.53 ± 0.052.80.94k′+3 + k′-3 (s-1)Quenched-flow>50Phosphate releasek+4 obs (s-1)MDCC-PBP0.067 ± 0.005k+4 obs (s-1)Quenched-flow0.064 ± 0.025k+4 (s-1)k+4 obs (1 + K3)/K30.17 ± 0.020.0270.02k′+4 (s-1)MDCC-PBP>50>40>100ADP bindingk+5 (s-1)Mant-ADP cold chase2.3 ± 0.19Mant-ADP binding1.8 ± 0.3k-5 (μm-1 s-1)Mant-ADP3.7 ± 0.12.3K5 (μm)k+5/k-50.62 ± 0.033.8k′+5 (s-1)Light-scattering1.86 ± 0.039.8cPyrene-actin.1.52cPyrene-actin.Mant-ADP cold chase2.1 ± 0.59.6Mant-ADP binding2.3 ± 0.516k′-5 (μm-1 s-1)Mant-ADP4.7 ± 0.22.75.2cPyrene-actin.K′5 (μm)k′+5/k′-50.40 ± 0.043.6-5.90.3Actin bindingk-6 (μm-1 s-1)Pyrene-actin0.88 ± 0.031.212.1k+6 (s-1)Pyrene-actin<0.00430.0420.054K6 (μm)k+6/k-60.00480.0350.0045k-10 (μm-1 s-1)Pyrene-actin0.32 ± 0.02116.3k+10 (s-1)Pyrene-actin<0.0300.0340.043K10 (μm)k+10/k-100.0940.0340.0026a Data are from Ref. 41Yang Y.

Open table in a new tab Enhancement of Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Intensity— Drosophila myosin VIIA contains a conserved tryptophan residue (Trp478) located at the rigid relay loop, which is correlated to Trp510 of skeletal muscle myosin II, a residue predominantly responsible for the ATP-induced conformational change of the myosin motor domain. The time course of an increase of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity upon the addition of ATP followed single exponential kinetics (Fig. 4, inset). The ATP dependence of the apparent rate constants showed a hyperbolic relationship to yield a maximum rate constant of 12.6 ± 0.9 s–1 (Fig. 4). The ATP binding rate constant estimated from the initial slope of the hyperbola (K1k+2) was 2.6 ± 0.2μm–1 s–1. This value was in good agreement with the value obtained using mant-ATP (Fig. 2). We assumed that the observed maximal rate constant of 12.6 s–1 corresponds to the rate of the ATP hydrolysis step (k+3 + k–3), because this value is much less than the ATP binding rate at a high ATP concentration. Quenched-flow Measurements of ATP Hydrolysis by Acto-DM7AIQ5—Fig. 5A shows the time course of the Pi burst of DM7AIQ5 ATPase reaction measured by a quenched-flow experiment. Single turnover experiments were carried out in which the active site concentration exceeded the substrate concentration. Because all given ATP is bound to the ATP-binding site of DM7AIQ5, the equilibrium of the ATP hydrolysis step can easily be determined by the fraction of the fast Pi burst phase. The time course of the Pi burst followed double exponential kinetics. The fast phase corresponds to the initial rapid ATP hydrolysis in which ATP binding is rate-limiting. The slow phase (0.064 ± 0.025 s–1) represents the apparent Pi release rate (k+4(obs)). From the fractional amplitudes of the fast and slow phase, the Pi burst size was estimated to be 0.34 ± 0.03, and the equilibrium constant of ATP hydrolysis (K3) was calculated to be 0.53 ± 0.05. The result indicates that the equilibrium of the ATP hydrolysis step is significantly shifted to the pre-hydrolyzed form (MT). The rate of the ATP hydrolysis was also measured at a higher ATP concentration where multiple turnover of ATP hydrolysis takes place (Fig. 5B). The initial Pi burst rate was 13.2 ± 3.4 s–1 in the presence of 100 μm ATP. Because the ATP binding rate at this ATP concentration does not limit the rate of ATP hydrolysis, the obtained rate constant represents the rate of ATP hydrolysis (k+3 + k–3). The observed value is consistent with the value obtained by the measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence change. It should be noted, however, that the rate constant of the ATP hydrolysis step is still significantly larger than the steady-state ATPase cycle rate, thus not limiting the overall ATPase rate. We also measured the Pi burst rate in the presence of actin (at 10 μm that is three times of the KATPase value). Most interestingly, the Pi burst rate was significantly larger than that in the absence of actin, and the Pi burst rate of 43.6 ± 6.5 s–1 was obtained at 100 μm ATP. Furthermore, the Pi burst size in the presence of actin was nearly 1 and was much larger than that in the absence of actin. The results suggest that the ATP hydrolysis rate of the actin-bound form of DM7AIQ5 is much faster than that of the actin-dissociated form. This is quite different from the other myosins reported so far. It has been thought that the ATP hydrolysis rate is significantly decreased with bound actin (26White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), although the overall ATPase cycle rate is largely accelerated because of the enhancement of the rate-limiting product release steps. These results suggest that the actin-attached ATP hydrolysis is the major ATP hydrolysis pathway of actomyosin VIIA ATPase reaction. Phosphate Release Rate—The rate of the phosphate release step was determined by measuring the fluorescence increase of the fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP). Double-mixing single turnover experiments were carried out in which DM7AIQ5 was mixed with substoichometric amounts of ATP, aged for 10 s to allow ATP binding and hydrolysis, and then mixed with various concentrations of actin. Upon the release of phosphate, MDCC-PBP rapidly binds to the phosphate, and the observed fluorescence increase followed single exponential kinetics in the absence of actin (Fig. 6A, inset). The observed rate (k+4(obs)) of 0.067 ± 0.005 s–1 was consistent with the rate of the slow phase obtained from the quenched-flow experiment (Fig. 5A). In the presence of actin, the time course of the fluorescence increase followed double exponential kinetics. At 50 μm actin, the fast and slow apparent rate constants were 24.5 ± 1.1 and 0.91 ± 0.31 s–1, respectively (Fig. 6A). The fast phase was actin concentration-dependent, which reflects the actin re-binding step as shown in the kinetics scheme (Scheme 1). The observed rate constant increased with actin concentration, and a second order rate constant was determined to be 0.49 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1. The maximum Pi release rate from acto-DM7AIQ5·ADP·Pi was estimated to be >50 s–1 based upon the lack of curvature in Fig. 6B. The fractional amplitude of the slow phase was ∼15% of the total amplitude, and the rate was actin concentration-independent in contrast to the fast phase (Fig. 6B, inset). A similar slow phase was previously observed for myosin X (31Kovacs M. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Homma K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29381-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Kovacs et al. (31Kovacs M. Wang F. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15071-15083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) proposed that the slow phase is derived from an “actin-attached hydrolysis” (AMT-AMDP transition; where A is actin; M is myosin; T is ATP; and D is ADP). On the other hand, Homma and Ikebe (32Homma K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29381-29391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found that the slow phase is because of ATP rebinding to myosin X, because the rate of the slow phase was linearly increased with myosin concentration. At the ATP concentration in this experiment (0.2 μm), the rate constant of the forward reaction is ∼0.7 s–1. Furthermore, from the rate constant of <0.3 s–1 for the reverse reaction (k–2) and the equilibrium constant of the ATP hydrolysis step (K3 = 0.53), the observed contribution of the slow phase to the total phase can be estimated to be ∼20%. Therefore, we conclude that the actin-independent slow phase observed in Fig. 6A is because of the ATP re-binding step of DM7AIQ5. The obtained results indicate that the phosphate release step (>50 s–1) is not the rate-limiting step of acto-DM7AIQ5 ATPase cycle. Kinetics of ADP Binding to and Dissociation from Acto-DM7AIQ5—We employed mant-ADP as a probe to determine the rate of ADP binding to acto-DM7AIQ5. Both in the presence and absence of actin, the fluorescence intensity of mant-ADP increased after mixing with DM7AIQ5 because of the binding of mant-ADP to the active site of DM7AIQ5. The time course of an increase in fluorescence intensity followed single exponential kinetics (Fig. 7, A and B, insets), and the observed apparent rate constants were linearly increased with mant-ADP concentration in both the absence and presence of actin (Fig. 7). In the absence of actin, a second order rate constant (k–5) was 3.7 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 7A). The y intercept of the mant-ADP dependence gave the rate constant of the mant-ADP release, which was determined to be 1.8 ± 0.3 s–1. In the presence of actin, a second order rate constant (k′–5) for mant-ADP binding was 4.7 ± 0.2 μm–1 s–1. The mant-ADP dissociation rate constant of 2.3 ± 0.5 s–1 was obtained from the y intercept (Fig. 7B). The rate of ADP dissociation from acto-DM7AIQ5 was also determined by measuring acto-DM7AIQ5 dissociation after the addition of ATP. In the presence of ADP, the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of acto-DM7AIQ5 is limited by ADP release. DM7AIQ5 and actin were mixed in the presence of excess ADP, and then the ATP-induced change in the light-scattering intensity was monitored. Fig. 8 shows the rate of ATP-induced dissociation of the acto-DM7AIQ5·ADP complex as a function of ATP concentration. In contrast to the result obtained in the absence of ADP (Fig. 3), the rate of the change in the light-scattering intensity of acto-DM7AIQ5 plateaued at a lower ATP concentration to yield the maximum rate of 1.86 ± 0.03 s–1. The observed rate of dissociation of acto-DM7AIQ5 is explained by the ADP dissociation step (k+′5) from acto-DM7AIQ5, because the ATP binding step does not limit the dissociation rate at these ATP concentrations. Actin Binding to DM7AIQ5—The rate of actin binding to DM7AIQ5 was measured using pyrene-actin. The fluorescence intensity of pyrene-actin was decreased upon the binding"
https://openalex.org/W2100853481,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes severe life-threatening airway infections that are a frequent cause for hospitalization of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. These Gram-negative pathogens possess flagella that contain the protein flagellin as a major structural component. Flagellin binds to the host cell glycolipid asialoGM1 (ASGM1), which appears enriched in luminal membranes of respiratory epithelial cells. We demonstrate that in mouse airways, luminal exposure to flagellin leads to inhibition of Na+ absorption by the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC, but does not directly induce a secretory response. Inhibition of ENaC was observed in tracheas of wild-type mice and was attenuated in mice homozygous for the frequent cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation G551D. Similar to flagellin, anti-ASGM1 antibody also inhibited ENaC. The inhibitory effects of flagellin on ENaC were attenuated by blockers of the purinergic signaling pathway, although an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration by recombinant or purified flagellin or whole flagella was not observed. Because an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway also attenuated the effects of flagellin on Na+ absorption, we conclude that flagellin exclusively inhibits ENaC, probably due to release of ATP and activation of purinergic receptors of the P2Y subtype. Stimulation of these receptors activates the MAPK pathway, thereby leading to inhibition of ENaC. Thus, P. aeruginosa reduces Na+ absorption, which could enhance local mucociliary clearance, a mechanism that seem to be attenuated in CF."

Although the molecular lesions underlying many hereditary muscle diseases are known, the downstream pathways that contribute to disease pathogenesis and compensatory muscle remodeling are poorly defined. We have recently identified and characterized mutations in Myosin Heavy Chain (Mhc) that lead to hypercontraction and subsequent degeneration of flight muscles in Drosophila. To characterize the genomic response to hypercontraction-induced myopathy, we performed expression analysis using Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide microarrays in Drosophila Mhc hypercontraction alleles. The altered transcriptional profile of dystrophic Mhc muscles suggests an actin-dependent remodeling of the muscle cytoskeleton. Specifically, a subset of the highly up-regulated transcripts is involved in actin regulation and structural support for the contractile machinery. In addition, we identified previously uncharacterized proteins with putative actin-interaction domains that are up-regulated in Mhc mutants and differentially expressed in muscles. Several of the up-regulated proteins, including the dystrophinrelated protein, MSP-300, and the homolog of the neuronal activity-regulated protein, ARC, localize to specific subcellular muscle structures that may provide key structural sites for cytoskeletal remodeling in dystrophic muscles. Defining the genome-wide transcriptional response to muscle hypercontraction in Drosophila has revealed candidate loci that may participate in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and in compensatory muscle repair pathways through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

Defining the genome-wide transcriptional response to muscle hypercontraction in Drosophila has revealed candidate loci that may participate in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and in compensatory muscle repair pathways through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies represent a large group of heterogeneous myopathic disorders in humans that are characterized by progressive muscle degeneration of skeletal or cardiac muscle (1Choh R.D. Campbell K.P. Muscle Nerve. 2000; 10: 1456-1471Google Scholar, 2Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). As a genetic model for characterizing the pathogenesis of muscle disease, flightless mutants in Drosophila have revealed parallels with the underlying molecular mechanisms found in human cardiac dysfunction (3Ferrus A. Acebes A. Marin M.C. Hernandez-Hernandez A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 4Vigoreaux J.O. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Many of the genes affected in human cardiac diseases lead to flightless defects when mutated in Drosophila, including Myosin Heavy Chain (Mhc), actin88F (act88F), wings up A (wupA, troponin I), and upheld (up, troponin T) (3Ferrus A.

The parallels between the underlying molecular causes of cardiomyopathies and flightlessness in Drosophila may extend to concomitant cellular changes that occur in response to single gene mutations, allowing characterization of conserved pathogenic mechanisms and compensatory responses in a tractable model system. In a large scale screen for TS 2The abbreviations used are: TS, temperature-sensitive; ARC, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein; SAM, significance analysis of microarrays; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; d, Drosophila. behavioral mutants in Drosophila, we identified dominant mutations in Mhc that lead to hypercontraction and degeneration of the adult indirect flight muscles (5Montana E.S. Littleton J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Mhc locus encodes the muscle-specific motor that mediates contraction of sarcomeres in Drosophila muscles. The hypercontraction defects are caused by single amino acid substitutions in the ATP-binding/hydrolysis domain of myosin heavy chain (MHC), leading to unregulated contraction cycles that occur independently of calcium influx. In addition to muscle hypercontraction and degeneration, Mhc mutants display abnormal TS behavior at restrictive temperatures, reflected in an acute loss of motor coordination and walking ability at 38 °C. Most surprisingly, we found that TS-induced behavioral dysfunction was a common feature of all Drosophila hypercontraction muscle mutants assayed, in contrast to muscle mutants that lead to hypocontraction (5Montana E.S. Littleton J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These shared behavioral defects suggest that hypercontracted muscles have fundamentally different electrical properties than hypocontracted and normal muscles, resulting in TS dysfunction at elevated temperatures. Because hypercontraction may represent a common mechanism for muscle damage, as observed during cardiac reperfusion injury (6Piper H.M. Abdallah Y. Schafer C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), determining the long term cellular consequences that occur during states of prolonged muscle hypercontraction is critical. In response to altered activity of the contractile machinery in cardiomyopathy, cardiac cells undergo a transcriptional response that includes up-regulation of fetal cardiac genes and immune response genes, and down-regulation of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes and calcium handling proteins (7Chien K.R.

The underlying signaling pathway mediating transcriptional recoding is thought to involve a calcineurin-dependent signaling cascade, leading to deacetylation of histones and activation of genes that are normally expressed at low levels in adult tissue (14Molkentin J.D.

To further characterize the transcriptional profile in hypercontracted muscles, we have completed a genome-wide expression analysis of Drosophila Mhc hypercontraction-induced myopathy mutants utilizing high density oligonucleotide DNA microarrays. The transcriptional response to hypercontraction-induced myopathy includes an up-regulation of many known and putative actin-binding proteins that are differentially expressed in muscle, suggesting an actin remodeling response in damaged tissue. The characterization of these novel transcripts may identify conserved molecular response mechanisms to muscle dysfunction and could potentially reveal novel targets for therapeutic treatment of muscle diseases. Drosophila Genetics—Drosophila were maintained on standard culture media at room temperature. All crosses were performed at 25 °C. Tissue Processing for Microarrays—Tissue was derived from 3- to 4-day-old adult male flies of the indicated genotype raised at 25 °C. Flies were frozen in liquid nitrogen and vortexed in order to obtain isolated heads and bodies (wings and legs were discarded). Circadian differences were minimized by processing tissue between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. A total of eight independent microarrays were analyzed (four control, two MhcS1/+, and two MhcS2/+). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 7-12 flies were processed in 200 μl of TRIzol. Five batches (1 ml) of processed tissue were then used to isolate the total RNA. From the total RNA, mRNA was isolated using a Qiagen Oligotex mRNA extraction kit. cDNA was created with random hexamer and T7-poly(T) oligonucleotides using the cDNA kit from Invitrogen. cDNA was then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and Phase Lock Gel extraction tubes (Eppendorf) as suggested by Affymetrix®. Biotin-labeled cRNA was made with the Enzo High Yield Bioarray kit using the supplied protocol with the modification of running half-reaction mixes. Reactions were cleaned with the Qiagen RNeasy kit, precipitated overnight, and resuspended into 13 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated double distilled H2O. Fragmentation was done with fragmentation buffer (200 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mm KOAc, 150 mm MgOAc) at 94 °C for 35 min and then brought up into 33 μl total volume. cRNA was sent to the Affymetrix® processing lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology for hybridization and signal detection. Expression Analysis—Statistical analysis was done with the Affymetrix® Microarray Suite software using the following normalization values: scaling target, 1500; alpha1, 0.04; alpha2, 0.06; tau, 0.015; gamma1L, 0.0025; gamma1H, 0.0025; gamma2L, 0.0030; gamma2H, 0.0030; and perturbation, 1.1. Gene changes were called based upon the stringency criteria that differential regulation must be reported by Affymetrix software for at least 75% of the pairwise comparisons. Additionally, an analysis utilizing SAM version120 was done in order to provide an independent analysis of the normalized data, giving higher stringency in differential regulation hits. Analysis with SAM was done as two-class, unpaired data sets, setting Δ to ∼25% false-positive rate. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to verify select genes from the microarray analysis. PCR primers were designed to sequences used in the design of probe pairs by Affymetrix. Isolated cDNA was diluted into the equivalent amount isolated from 1 μg of total RNA per 1 μl. This solution was further diluted 1:100, and 0.1 to 1 μl was used in the reactions depending upon transcript abundance and primer efficiency. Reaction samples were taken from cycles 21 to 30 in order to determine linear regions of the reactions. If linear regions were overlapping, comparisons were made in those cycles. If linear regions were not overlapping, reactions were run until mutant reactions were within linear cycles. In Situ Analysis—In situ expression analysis was performed using standard procedures. Probes were designed to ∼200-bp fragments, amplified by PCR using a 3′ primer that includes the T7 sequence. Sequences used for in situ hybridization coincide to sequences used by Affymetrix for probe pair design. In most cases, the same sequence used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used for in situ analysis. Immunostaining—Immunostaining of third instar larval fillets was done as described previously (5Montana E.S. Littleton J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For detecting MSP-300, we utilized α-MSP-300 antisera at 1:500 (17Volk T. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 721-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary goat α-rabbit conjugated to Cy2 was used at 1:500 (The Jackson Laboratories). F-actin was labeled with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin at 1:500, incubated simultaneously with secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Antisera to dARC1 was kindly provided by Leslie Griffith and used at 1:1000. Production of Transgenic UAS-dARC1 and UAS-dARC1-GFP Lines—The open reading frame of dARC1 was PCR-amplified from cDNA libraries prepared for the microarray experiments and cloned into the pUAST vector. The dARC1-GFP fusion was created using standard PCR fusion techniques and cloned into the pUAST vector as well. The cloned constructs were sequence-verified at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Facility (Cambridge, MA) and sent to Genetic Services, Inc. (Cambridge, MA) for production of transgenic animals. Expression Analysis of MhcS1 and MhcS2 Hypercontraction Mutants—Both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms are likely to be altered in dystrophic muscles, contributing to subsequent pathology. To identify transcriptional differences between hypercontracted and normal muscles in Drosophila, we performed expression profiling with Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide GeneChip arrays. The gene arrays contain representative sequences for most of the 14,000 genes in Drosophila, allowing a survey of the majority of the genome for dystrophy-related alterations in gene expression. In our expression analysis, we utilized two independent alleles of Mhc (MhcS1 and MhcS2) that cause flight muscle hypercontraction defects. These alleles are missense mutations (V235E and E187K) that localize near the ATP binding/hydrolysis domain of MHC (Fig. 1). The use of two independent alleles allowed us to look for conserved responses to MHC dysfunction by reducing background and allele-specific changes. In addition, these two mutations map to a region of the MHC protein in which at least nine different mutations have been identified that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (18Rayment I. Holden H.M. Sellers J.R. Fananapazir L. Epstein N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3864-3868Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A total of eight independent arrays were performed as follows: four CantonS, two MhcS1/+, and two MhcS2/+. For experiments, we used circadian-matched CantonS males of identical age and rearing conditions as controls. For each chip used in our analysis, we isolated RNA from the heads and bodies of 50 animals to reduce individual variability in gene expression. The data were processed using the Affymetrix statistical expression algorithm in a total of 16 pairwise comparisons between mutant and wild type arrays (Fig. 2, A and B). To analyze the mutant chips as a group against the controls, SAM version 1.20 analysis was performed using the two-class unpaired response type (Fig. 2C) (19Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9773) Google Scholar). To increase the chances of making relevant gene change calls, we set stringent conditions to analyze the data. For a gene to be differentially regulated, it must have been labeled up- or down-regulated by the Affymetrix algorithm in 75% of the pairwise comparisons. To further rank the results, we subdivided the data into the following two categories: 1) differentially regulated in 75% of all pairwise comparisons, and 2) differentially regulated in only one of the two mutants. We then analyzed statistical overlap between genes identified by the Affymetrix statistical expression algorithm and the SAM analysis. Using these criteria, 228 genes were up-regulated and 118 were down-regulated in response to hypercontraction-induced myopathy (Table 1 and supplemental Tables S1 and S2).TABLE 1Summary of differentially regulated genes from the expression analysisUp-regulated genesCategoryNo.Muscle structure/function35Serine proteases24Novel54Chaperones8Nuclear biology13Metabolism and energy55Immune response15Signaling8Other16Total228Down-regulated genesCategoryNo.Metabolism and energy77Muscle structure/function6Other22Novel13Total118 Open table in a new tab To verify that vectorial changes in gene expression identified by microarrays were correct, a subset of the differentially regulated genes was tested using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We quantified the results from three separate RT-PCRs for the genes encoded from the Act57B, GH05741, MSP-300, CG12505 (dARC1), CG32030 (dFHOS), Mlp60A, and CG2330 (dNeurochondrin) loci. As a control, we compared expression to the GAPDH2 locus, whose RNA levels were unchanged in mutant animals. RT-PCR results from these genes revealed similar expression changes compared with the microarray analysis, corroborating expression levels reported by microarray analysis (Fig. 2, D-L). To categorize genes that were transcriptionally altered in dystrophic muscles, we performed a BLAST analysis for each transcript to identify known homologs and previously characterized structural domains. The genes were then categorized according to known or putative functions based on current literature or sequence similarity (see Table 2 and supplemental Tables S1 and S2). Overall, the most striking gene set identified in the microarray analysis was the up-regulation of genes known or predicted to be involved in muscle structure and function at the level of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a remodeling of the cytoskeleton or its structural support in response to hypercontraction (Fig. 3; Table 2). Of the 10 most up-regulated genes across all statistical analyses, 6 fall within this category. Differentially regulated transcripts included in this category are Mlp60A, Mlp84B, Kettin, MSP-300, flw, sqh, capulet, slingshot, act88F, act57B, Mbs, and talin. Mlp60A, Mlp84B, Kettin, MSP-300, flw, capulet, and talin have all been shown to provide or modulate structural supports of the muscle cytoskeleton (20Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Renert-Pasca M. Volk T. Mech.

Such a response may represent a functionally beneficial compensation mechanism by which the muscle responds to increased forces induced by hypercontraction.TABLE 2Differentially regulated genes in Mhc mutants with known or predicted roles in muscle structure/function Open table in a new tab The differential regulation in the MhcS1 and MhcS2 mutants also includes an up-regulation of developmentally controlled genes that are required for earlier stages of muscle development, similar to transcriptional responses observed in cardiomyopathies (7Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 26Chen Y.W. Zhao P. Borup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Mlp60A and Mlp84B, which normally show high expression during the initial setup of embryonic and adult musculature, are up-regulated in Mhc mutants (Fig. 3A) (27Stronach B.E. Siegrist S.E. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1179-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Likewise, Act57B, the predominant actin of the larval body wall musculature, also shows up-regulation (Fig. 3A) (28Labuhn M. Brack C. Gerontology. 1997; 43: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A second predominant class of up-regulated genes includes chaperones and serine proteases, further supporting a remodeling of the muscle architecture (Table S1). In addition to the potential muscle remodeling response, we observed an up-regulation of immune response genes as has been observed in mammalian muscular dystrophy models (26Chen Y.W. Zhao P. Borup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The largest class of down-regulated transcripts in dystrophic muscles consists of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes and genes involved in energy and metabolism, suggesting metabolic dysfunction in damaged muscles. An additional down-regulated transcript of interest encodes the calcium pump responsible for transporting calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, Ca-P60A (11Aronow B.J. Toyokawa T. Canning A. Haghighi K. Delling U. Kranias E. Molkentin J.D. Dorn II, G.W. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 6: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This down-regulation may be responsible for potential Ca2+ homeostasis defects in Mhc flight muscles. Indeed, our previous analysis suggested that intracellular Ca2+ is dysregulated in Mhc mutant fibers, as larval body wall muscles exhibit spontaneous contraction cycles even in the absence of external Ca2+ (5Montana E.S. Littleton J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A subset of the genes that were identified as differentially regulated in our hypercontraction-induced myopathy model have been implicated previously in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in mammals. These include the Drosophila homologs of the mammalian proteins ARC (CG12505 and CG13941), neurochondrin/norbin (CG2330), and CPG2 (Msp-300) (29Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A.

These activity-regulated genes are thought to modulate actin dynamics to strengthen activated synapses during plasticity (29Lyford G.L. Yamagata K. Kaufmann W.E. Barnes C.A. Sanders L.K.

Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), suggesting similar actin-dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements may occur during muscle remodeling. A Subset of Novel Differentially Regulated Genes Is Expressed in Somatic Musculature—Most of the genes identified in our analysis as differentially regulated in dystrophic muscles are largely uncharacterized. To determine whether these genes may be important for muscle function, we analyzed the expression patterns of several novel genes encoding proteins with domain structures suggestive of a role in actin biology. These included CG32030 (CG5797 and CG5775) (dFHOS), CG12505 (dARC1), CG2330 (dNeurochondrin), CG2471 (dSCLP), CG6972 and CG9025 (dFEM-1). As performing in situ hybridization to adult tissues is technically difficult, we chose to examine the expression pattern of the transcripts in whole mount embryos where we could follow gene expression during myogenesis, as well as in differentiated embryonic muscles. Although we expect these patterns of expression to reflect the adult musculature, further analysis will be required to confirm tissue-specific expression of the transcripts in adults. CG5797 and CG5775, encoding the 5′ and 3′ regions of the CG32030 locus (hereafter referred to as dFHOS), represented the third highest up-regulated transcript (7-fold) identified in the microarray screen. The locus encodes an FH1- and FH2-domain containing protein with armadillo repeats in the N terminus. This gene is the Drosophila homolog of FHOS, a human “formin-homology containing protein overexpressed in the spleen” (33Westendorf J.J. Mernaugh R. Hiebert S.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has shown that formin-containing proteins regulate polymerization of nonbranched actin filaments (34Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C. Science. 2002; 297: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), suggesting dFHOS may function in assembly of the muscle sarcomere. In situ analysis with dFHOS probes reveals strong somatic muscle expression and staining in the putative midline mesectodermal cells (Fig. 4B). dARC1 is one of three Drosophila homologs (CG12505, CG13941, and CG10102) of the mammalian activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated ARC gene and the most highly up-regulated transcript identified in our analysis. In situ hybridization with dARC1 probes reveal a broad staining pattern, with differential expression in both somatic and visceral musculature (Fig. 4C). Additionally, higher expression is observed in the central nervous system. Most interestingly, the central nervous system expression pattern is localized to synaptic regions of the ventral ganglion. In the mammalian central nervous system, ARC mRNA is trafficked to activated synapses and locally translated in the dendrites (36Steward O. Worley P. Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2002; 78: 508-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The localization of dARC1 mRNA to synaptic regions, together with our previous identification of dARC1 as a seizure-induced gene in Drosophila (37Guan Z. Saraswati S. Adolfsen B. Littleton J.T. Neuron. 2005; 48: 91-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggests ARC function may be conserved in synaptic plasticity. In addition, the identification of dARC1 expression in somatic muscle, together with its dramatic up-regulation in Mhc mutants, suggests dARC1 may also play a previously unrecognized role in muscular dystrophy. Mammalian neurochondrin was isolated as an up-regulated transcript in neurons that have undergone tetraethylammonium-induced long term potentiation. Subsequent studies have revealed that neurochondrin overexpression in Neuro2a cells induces neurite outgrowth (31Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Drosophila homolog, dNeurochondrin (CG2330), is strongly up-regulated in Mhc mutants and shows expression in both somatic and visceral musculature (Fig. 4D), suggesting it functions in muscles in Drosophila. dSCLP, a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, is a homolog of SCLP, a gene originally identified in Manduca as an up-regulated transcript in skeletal muscle cells undergoing programmed cell death (38Kuelzer F. Kuah P. Bishoff S.T. Cheng L. Nambu J.R. Schwartz L.M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 41: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). dSCLP is up-regulated in Mhc mutants, and in situ probes show strong expression in the mesoderm (Fig. 4E), suggesting its primary function resides in muscles. CG6972 is an armadillo repeat protein also up-regulated in Mhc mutants. Expression analysis reveals RNA localization only in somatic musculature (Fig. 4F), again suggesting a function in muscle.

Ribonuclease A forms oligomers by the three-dimensional domain-swapping mechanism. Here, we demonstrate the ability of ribonuclease S, a proteolytically cleaved form of ribonuclease A, to oligomerize efficiently. This unexpected capacity has been investigated to study the effect of proteolysis on oligomerization and amyloid formation. The yield of the RNase S dimer was found to be significantly higher than that of RNase A dimers, which suggests that proteolysis can activate oligomerization via the three-dimensional domain-swapping mechanism. Characterization by chromatography, enzymatic assays, and NMR spectroscopy indicate that the structure of the RNase S dimer is similar to that of the RNase A C-dimer. The RNase S dimer dissociates much more readily than the RNase A C-dimer does. By measuring the dissociation rate as a function of temperature, the activation enthalpy and entropy for RNase S dimer dissociation were found to resemble those for the release of the small fragment (S-peptide) from monomeric RNase S. Excess S-peptide strongly slows RNase S dimer dissociation. These results strongly suggest that S-peptide release is the rate-limiting step of RNase S dimer dissociation.

VOLUME 281 (2006) PAGES 9400-9406Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 282Issue 17PreviewPAGE 9400: Full-Text PDF Open Access Three-dimensional domain swapping is a common mechanism for oligomerization with important implications for protein evolution and amyloid formation (1Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, two monomers trade structural motifs, called “swap domains,” which adopt essentially identical conformations in the monomeric and oligomeric forms; for recent reviews see Refs. 2Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar and 3Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Itzhaki L.S. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar. The swap “domains” can range in size from a single α-helix or β-strand to large protein domains. Domain-swapped oligomers can be stable or metastable relative to their monomers. In the latter case, destabilizing conditions and high protein concentrations typically favor oligomerization by this mechanism. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) was the first protein whose oligomerization was proposed to occur by three-dimensional domain swapping (4Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1 (suppl.): 217-222PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, investigation of RNase A oligomerization has shown that this protein can form a variety of dimers, trimers, and higher oligomers (5Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) via three-dimensional domain swapping of the N-terminal α-helix (called N-dimer), the C-terminal β-strand (named C-dimer), or both (6Liu Y.

The oligomerization of RNase A has been reviewed recently (10Libonati M. Gotte G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The observation of a new two-stranded β-sheet with an amyloid-like conformation present in the C-dimer of RNase A led Eisenberg and co-workers (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) to propose a model for amyloid formation based on three-dimensional domain swapping. This hypothesis has been supported by the structural characterization of domain-swapped oligomers of amyloid-forming proteins (11Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 12Janowski R. Kozak M. Jankowska E. Grzonka Z. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. Jaskolski M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and is now essentially confirmed by very recent work from Eisenberg's laboratory showing that an RNase A variant with a polyglutamine insertion into the C-terminal hinge loop forms amyloid fibrils by three-dimensional domain swapping (13Sambashivan S. Liu Y. Sawaya M.R. Gingery M. Eisenberg D. Nature. 2005; 437: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). RNase A oligomerization can be induced by lyophilization from 40% acetic acid (4Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1 (suppl.): 217-222PubMed Google Scholar) or incubation in heated alcohol/water solutions (14Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, Park and Raines (15Park C. Raines R.T. Prot. Sci. 2000; 9: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have shown that RNase A can dimerize in heated water without cosolvents, which suggests the existence of small amounts of dimeric RNase A in vivo. All RNase A oligomers formed are metastable and slowly dissociate into monomers. The swap domains, which consist of residues 1–15 in the N-dimer and 116–124 in the C-dimer, have the same secondary and tertiary structures regardless of whether they are bound to their own protein core in the monomer or to the alternate core in the oligomer. In contrast, their respective hinge loops, formed by residues 16–22 in the N-dimer and 112–115 in the C-dimer adopt strikingly different conformations in the dimers versus the monomer. RNase A is cleaved at the peptide bond between residues 20 and 21 by subtilisin (16Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1459-1465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The small fragment (residues 1–20, named S-peptide) and the large one (residues 21–124, S-protein) remain tightly associated by non-covalent interactions. This complex, RNase S, conserves the catalytic activity (16Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1459-1465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and native conformation (17Wyckoff H.W. Tsernoglou D. Hanson A.W. Knox J.R. Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Biol.

Although N-terminal domain swapping cannot occur, RNase S monomers might still be able to oligomerize by swapping C termini, which are not cut by subtilisin. However, given the reduced conformational stability of RNase S, many would not expect it to form oligomers. Here, we describe the discovery of RNase S dimers; this is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of a two-chain protein that oligomerizes via the three-dimensional domain-swapping mechanism. The main objectives of this present work are to (i) compare the ability of RNase S to form domain-swapped oligomers relative to RNase A, (ii) characterize the structure of the RNase S dimer, and (iii) measure the kinetics and thermodynamics of RNase S dimer dissociation and propose a mechanism for this process. Materials—Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (grade XII-A, lot 104H-7110) was obtained from Sigma and further purified by cation-exchange chromatography as described (5Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) prior to use. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease S (grade XII-S, lot 106F-8055), S-peptide (grade XII-PE, lot 99F8205), and S-protein (grade XII-PR, lot 125C8045) also obtained from Sigma, eluted as single peaks from a cation exchange column and were used as supplied. Recombinant RNase A uniformly labeled with 15N or 15N and 13C was prepared as described previously (23Ribó M. Benito A. Canals A. Nogués M.V. Cuchillo C.M. Vilanova M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using labeled Martek9 medium from Spectra Stable Isotopes. Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 were obtained from Merck and combined in equal molar proportions to give a solution that is 0.20 m in total Pi and has a pH of 6.7. Double-distilled water was deionized using a MilliQ system. All other reagents were the highest purity grade available. Oligomer Formation—The ability of RNase S and S-protein to form oligomers was tested using two procedures that efficiently induce oligomerization of RNase A; namely (i) incubation in 40% glacial acetic acid, 60% water for 1 h, followed by lyophilization (4Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem.

Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Incubation temperatures ranging from 30 to 60 °C were tested. NaPi buffer (0.2 m, pH 6.7) was added to the samples after lyophilization or heat treatment. Pi binds to His12 and His119 at the active site (24Cohen J.S. Griffen J.H. Schechter A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4305-4310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); because these residues are contributed by different monomers, Pi binding stabilizes domain-swapped oligomers of RNase as does the binding of DNA (25Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chromatography—All chromatography experiments were performed on an Amersham Biosciences ΔKTA FPLC system at ambient temperature (18–20 °C) using Mono S 5/5 and Superdex HR 75 10/30 columns for cation exchange and gel filtration, respectively. Cation exchange chromatography was carried out by applying a linear gradient of 20–200 mm NaPi (pH 6.70) as previously described (14Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed in 0.2 m NaPi buffer. Elution volume determination and peak integration was performed using the Amersham Biosciences Unicorn software. Thermal Denaturation—Thermal transitions (0–70 °C) of RNase S and RNase A (≈0.5 mg/ml) in 40% ethanol, 60% water were recorded in a 0.1-cm cuvette using a JASCO J-810 circular dichroism spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. These samples were unbuffered, pH ≈ 6.8, to be consistent with the EtOH/heat oligomerization conditions. The scan speed was 60 °C/h. The reversibility of unfolding was checked by recording the ellipticity during recooling to 0 °C and was found to be better than 95%. The data shown are representative of four independent experiments. Enzyme Kinetics—The enzymatic activities of ribonuclease monomers and dimers were measured against single stranded yeast RNA (ssRNA) 4The abbreviations used are: ssRNA, single stranded RNA; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; MD, molecular dynamics; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. using the Kunitz assay (26Kunitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and against synthetic double stranded RNA, poly(A)·poly(U) as previously described (27Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All assays were repeated in duplicate, and the uncertainty of these activity values is typically ∼±7% and ±15%, against ssRNA and poly(A)·poly(U), respectively (5Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because gel filtration analysis found that the RNase S dimer sample contained 56% dimer and 44% monomer, the activity of 100% dimer was calculated by subtracting the activity due to monomer from the observed activity and then dividing by the fraction of dimer. The specific activity values were then normalized to the RNase A monomer. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance—All NMR spectra were recorded at 25.0 °C, in NaPi buffer (0.2 m, pH 6.7) containing 90% H2O, 10% D2O or in 99.9% D2O using the most upfield resonance of sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate as the internal chemical shift reference on a Bruker 800 MHz Avance US2 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (1H,13C,15N) probe and X, Y, Z-gradients. Three-dimensional 13C,15N,1H NHCOCA, NHCA, and NHCACB spectra were recorded on a monomeric RNase A sample uniformly labeled in 13C and 15N. Peak assignments were made by following standard procedures in combination with comparison of previous assignments (18Rico M. Bruix M. Santoro J. González C. Neira J.L. Nieto J.L. Herranz J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Neira J.L. Sevilla P. Menéndez M. Bruix M. Rico M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on these assignments, two-dimensional 1H NOESY (mixing time = 50 ms), COSY, and total correlation spectroscopy spectra of monomeric and dimeric RNase S were recorded and assigned in the same solution conditions and temperature. The assignments are deposited in the BMRB data bank. RNase S dimer samples for NMR contained an excess of S-peptide to slow dissociation (see below). Structural Modeling of the RNase S Dimer—The chemical shift and NOE data sets of RNase A, RNase S, and the RNase S dimer are almost identical; significant differences are only observed near the subtilisin cleavage site (see Fig. 2 in Neira et al. (21Neira J.L. Sevilla P. Menéndez M. Bruix M. Rico M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) and in the C-terminal hinge loop (see Fig. 2, above). Therefore, their tertiary structures are very similar except at those sites. Starting from two RNase A solution structures, the RNase S dimer structure was modeled by cleaving the 20–21 peptide bonds and then changing the backbone torsion angles of the C-terminal hinge loop to a C-dimer-like conformation using the program Sybyl (Tripos, Inc.). This model was refined with extensive (500 ps) MD simulations with explicit solvent. For further details, see Ref. 28Gómez-Pinto I. Cubero E. Kalko S.G. Monaco V. van der Marel G. van Boom J.H.

Dimer Dissociation—The kinetics of the separation of RNase S dimers, in NaPi buffer (0.2 m, pH 6.7), into monomers was monitored by gel filtration analysis of aliquots incubated at 0, 19.0, 25.0, 31.2, and 37.0 °C. To determine the dissociation rate constant, k, a least-squares algorithm was used to fit first order kinetic rate equations to the experimentally observed increase in monomer (M) or the decrease in dimer (D) with time (t), D(t)=D(t=0)exp-kt+D(t=∞)(Eq. 1) and, M(t)=(1-M(t=0))exp-kt+M(t=∞)(Eq. 2) The rate constants (k) as a function of the inverse of the absolute temperature (T) were analyzed using the linear form of the Arrehenius equation, lnk=-ΔH‡/RT+ΔS‡/R(Eq. 3) to determine the apparent activation enthalpy (ΔH‡) and entropy (ΔS‡) for rate-limiting step of RNase S dimer dissociation. HAc/Lyophilization-induced Oligomerization—To test whether or not RNase S can form three-dimensional domain-swapped oligomers under the conditions that induce oligomerization of RNase A, samples of both proteins were subjected to HAc/lyophilization treatment, and the subsequent products were separated by chromatography (Fig. 1). Cation exchange chromatography was tried first, because it highly resolves RNase A oligomers (5Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, a very good separation of RNase A oligomers was also obtained with a 0.02–0.20 m NaPi gradient, and the elution positions and oligomer yields are consistent with previous results (5Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Libonati M. Gotte G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). However, in the case of HAc/lyophilization treated RNase S, a single peak with a long trailing shoulder was observed to elute soon after the main monomeric peak. Next, the separation of the oligomerization products was attempted using a gel filtration column equilibrated in 200 mm NaPi. As previously observed (5Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), RNase A tetramers elute earliest, followed by trimers, the C-dimer, the N-dimer, and finally the monomer (Fig. 1b). The ability to partly resolve the two dimers of RNase A by gel filtration is likely because of the more elongated shape of the C-dimer (Fig. 1b, inset). The chromatogram of RNase S, oligomerized by the HAc/lyophilization procedure, reveals the presence of two peaks, which elute before monomeric RNase S and that were not observed in untreated RNase S (Fig. 1b). The smaller peak, whose yield is ∼5 ± 1% (1σ, n = 11), has an elution volume that corresponds approximately to a trimeric species. The major RNase S oligomer is probably a dimer, as it elutes 2.08 ± 0.02 ml (1σ, n = 32) before monomeric RNase S, whereas the RNase A N-dimer and C-dimer elute 1.90 ± 0.02 ml and 2.15 ± 0.01 mσ (1 s, n = 4), respectively, before the RNase A monomer. This putative dimer is referred to henceforth as the RNase S dimer. It is remarkable that the yield of the RNase S dimer (32 ± 3%, 1σ, n = 11) is significantly higher than that of the RNase A C-dimer (18 ± 1%) (29Gotte G. Libonati M. Laurents D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46241-46251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and is even marginally superior to the typical yields (26–30%) (10Libonati M. Gotte G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) of the sum of all the RNase A oligomers formed after HAc/lyophilization treatment. The stability of the interactions maintaining the quaternary structure of the RNase S oligomers could be low. Phosphate binding to the active site of RNase oligomers cross-links the subunits and thereby stabilizes them. RNase S oligomers might have been present but dissociated in the early stages of cation exchange chromatography, where the concentration of Pi is minimal. To test this possibility, the products of RNase S oligomerization were applied to gel filtration column equilibrated with 200, 90, or 10 mm NaPi buffer (Fig. 1c). The recovery of oligomers decreases substantially as the Pi concentration is lowered. S-protein might be able to oligomerize because it contains the C-terminal swap domain of RNase A. HAc/lyophilization-treated S-protein analyzed by gel filtration yielded a broad peak whose elution volume is close to that of the RNase S monomer (Fig. 1d). The shoulder preceding the elution of the main peak is more prominent for the HAc/lyophilization-treated S-protein than for untreated S-protein; this shoulder might possibly be because of S-protein oligomers, which dissociate into monomers during the chromatography run. A strikingly different result is obtained, however, if a 1.3 molar excess of S-peptide is included in the NaPi buffer used to redissolve the lyophilized S-protein powder; namely, significant amounts of oligomers are detected (Fig. 1d). These results strongly suggest that S-protein can oligomerize by three-dimensional domain swapping of the C-terminal β-strand, as does RNase A, but that S-protein oligomers are much less stable. Formation of RNase S Oligomers in Heated 40% EtOH—Oligomer formation by RNase S was also found to occur when the protein was incubated at elevated temperatures in 40% ethanol. The average percent oligomer yields as a function of the incubation temperature are shown in Fig. 2a. The highest yields of oligomers are obtained near 40 °C for RNase S but at a much higher temperature, ∼60 °C, for RNase A (14Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To gain further insight, the thermal denaturation in 40% ethanol of RNase A and S, the concentration of the latter being 43 μm, was followed by CD and thermal midpoint (TM) values of 30.7 ± 0.2 °C for RNase S and 42.0 ± 0.2 °C for RNase A were obtained (Fig. 2b). The TM value for RNase S is concentration-dependent; when corrected for its concentration under oligomerization conditions (7.3 mm) using the expression of Catanzano et al. (20Catanzano F. Giancola C. Graziano G. Barone G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13378-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) increases to ≈41 °C (see the supplemental text for additional data analysis details). Altogether, these data suggest that RNase A oligomerizes most efficiently at high temperatures where it is completely denatured, whereas RNase S oligomerization is highest at physiological temperatures near the midpoint of its unfolding transition. Enzymatic Activities—Because the catalytic activities of RNase A depend strictly on its tertiary and quaternary structure (10Libonati M. Gotte G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), enzymatic assays can shed light on the nature of the RNase S dimer structure. First, both the monomeric and dimeric species of RNase A and RNase S were assayed against yeast ssRNA. The RNase S dimer shows significant activity against ssRNA, which parallels that shown by the RNase A C-dimer (data not shown) and constitutes good evidence that the subunits of the dimer have correctly folded tertiary structures. The RNase A C-dimer shows a remarkably increased activity against poly(A)·poly(U) relative to the monomer, whereas the enhanced activity of the N-dimer against poly(A)·poly(U) is much smaller (9Gotte G. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36670-36679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Sorrentino S. Barone G. Bucci E. Gotte G. Russo N. Libonati M. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Against poly(A)·poly(U), the RNase S dimer demonstrated a strongly enhanced activity like that of the RNase A C-dimer when assayed side-by-side (Fig. 3a). Structural Characterization by NMR—The aromatic region of the two-dimensional NOESY 1H spectra of the RNase S monomer and dimer are shown in Fig. 3b. Although the chemical shifts of most peaks are essentially identical, those of the RNase S dimer are broader, which reflects its slower tumbling in solution. The ring protons of Tyr115, a residue located in the C-terminal hinge loop, alter their chemical shifts in the RNase S dimer relative to the monomer (Fig. 3b). The Tyr115 1Hδs and Cys58 1Hβs have strong NOE signals in the monomeric forms of RNase S and A, which are absent in the spectra of the RNase S dimer (Fig. 3b) as well as the C-dimer of RNase A (data not shown). The differences in the backbone chemical shifts of monomeric versus dimeric RNase S are small, except in the hinge loop region where significant differences are observed (Fig. 3c). As NMR chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive to conformation, these data indicate that the backbone structure of the monomer and dimer are similar, except in the hinge loop region. A key conformational difference in the hinge loop is revealed by the NOESY spectroscopy. Strong Asn113 1Hα-Pro114 1H,H′δ NOE signals, which are diagnostic of a trans peptide bond, are observed in the RNase S dimer spectrum but are absent in the monomer spectrum (Fig. 3d). Similar NOEs are observed for the RNase A C-dimer but are absent in RNase A monomer and N-dimer NOESY spectra (data not shown). The NMR signals that are characteristic for C-terminal domain swapping, namely those of the Tyr115 side chain and NOE signals between the Asn113 1Hα-Pro114 1H,H′δ, are lost when the RNase S dimer dissociates (see the supplemental text describing additional NMR experiments). Hydrogen Exchange—Some 30 amide protons in the RNase S dimer resist exchange for more than 2.5 h at pH 6.7, 25 °C when the protein is dissolved in D2O but are fully exchanged after 14 h. Based on these observations, protection factors on the order of 105-106 can be estimated for these protons. These values are comparable to those previously reported for the RNase S monomer (21Neira J.L. Sevilla P. Menéndez M. Bruix M. Rico M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 627-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Chakshusmathi G. Ratnaparkhi G.S. Mudhu P.K. Varadarajan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7899-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and this resemblance suggests that the conformational stabilities of the RNase S monomer and dimer are also similar. The identities of the highly protected protons match closely in the RNase S monomer and dimer; this is an additional indication that they share similar tertiary structures (see supplemental Table 1 for a list of the protected amide protons in the monomer and dimer). Structural Model—A structure of the RNase S dimer modeled on the basis of the NMR data is shown in Fig. 3e. Overall, the structure is very similar to the C-dimer of RNase A (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), cleaved between Ala20 and Ser21 in the two subunits. The evolution of the structure during the course of the MD simulation (shown in supplemental Fig. 2) suggests that it is well folded and contains no strained regions. Dissociation Kinetics—The stability of the RNase S dimers against dissociation upon incubation at various temperatures was monitored by gel filtration chromatography, and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. Essentially equivalent rate constants were found by fitting the increase in monomer or the decrease in dimer with time (data not shown). The dissociation kinetics depend strongly on temperature, with the kinetic lifetimes at 0 and 37 °C being: τ0° = 78,000 ± 1500 min (54 ± 1 days) and τ37° = 5 ± 1.5 min, respectively. In comparison, the monomerization of the RNase A C-dimer is very slow under these conditions. After 1 month at 37 °C in 0.20 m NaPi, pH 6.7, less than 10% had dissociated into monomers (data not shown). The ability of additional S-peptide to stabilize the RNase S dimers was also tested. When a 3-fold molar excess of S-peptide was added to RNase S dimers, their dissociation kinetics slowed dramatically. At 31.2 °C with a 3-fold excess of S-peptide, less than 25% of the RNase S dimer dissociates after 3 h, whereas without additional S-peptide, the dimer has essentially completely disassociated after 2 h (Fig. 4a). At 37 °C, a 3-fold molar excess of S-peptide reduces the RNase S dissociation rate 20-fold, with τ37°, 3× S-pep = 106 ± 18 min. Thermodynamics of RNase S Dimer Dissociation—Arrhenius plots of the rate of RNase S dimer dissociation and the release of S-peptide from monomeric RNase S determined by Goldberg and Baldwin (31Goldberg J.M.

https://openalex.org/W1982436066,"The yeast SPT10 gene encodes a putative histone acetyltransferase that binds specifically to pairs of upstream activating sequence (UAS) elements found only in the histone gene promoters. Here, we demonstrate that the DNA-binding domain of Spt10p is located between residues 283 and 396 and includes a His2-Cys2 zinc finger. The binding of Spt10p to the histone UAS is zinc-dependent and is disabled by a zinc finger mutation (C388S). The isolated DNA-binding domain binds to single histone UAS elements with high affinity. In contrast, full-length Spt10p binds with high affinity only to pairs of UAS elements with very strong positive cooperativity and is unable to bind to a single UAS element. This implies the presence of a “blocking” domain in full-length Spt10p, which forces it to search for a pair of UAS elements. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that, unlike wild-type Spt10p, the C388S protein does not bind to the promoter of the gene encoding histone H2A (HTA1) in vivo. The C388S mutant has a phenotype similar to that of the spt10Δ mutant: poor growth and global aberrations in gene expression. Thus, the C388S mutation disables the DNA-binding function of Spt10p in vitro and in vivo. The zinc finger of Spt10p is homologous to that of foamy virus integrase, perhaps suggesting that this integrase is also a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. The yeast SPT10 gene encodes a putative histone acetyltransferase that binds specifically to pairs of upstream activating sequence (UAS) elements found only in the histone gene promoters.

Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, which contain 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a central core histone octamer composed of two molecules each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The core histones have “tail” domains that project out of the nucleosome core and are not necessary for the integrity of the nucleosome (1van Holde K.E. Springer Series in Molecular Biology: Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988: 118-168Google Scholar). The majority of post-translational modifications occur in the tail domains; they include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and ADP-ribosylation. These post-translational modifications play important roles in gene regulation. The “histone code” hypothesis proposes that histone modifications are “marks” recognized by regulatory proteins (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Acetylation remains the best studied of all of the histone modifications, but new acetylation sites are still being identified (3Zhang L. Eugeni E.E. Parthun M.R. Freitas M.A. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2003; 112: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A recent example is the acetylation of Lys56 of histone H3 in budding yeast (4Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 5Ozdemir A. Spicuglia S. Lasonder E. Vermeulen M. Campsteijn C. Stunnenberg H.G. Logie C. J.

Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This particular acetylation is unusual in that it occurs at a residue located in the nucleosome core rather than in the histone tails. It seems likely that acetylation of histone H3 Lys56 would have a major effect on nucleosome conformation because it eliminates a positive charge involved in DNA binding within the nucleosome (4Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), although there is as yet no evidence for this. Acetylation of histone H3 Lys56 in nucleosomes at the core histone promoters is dependent on the SPT10 gene (4Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), which encodes a putative histone acetyltransferase (7Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), suggesting that Spt10p itself is responsible for this histone H3 Lys56 acetylation. However, it has not yet been possible to demonstrate that Spt10p has histone acetyltransferase activity in vitro (4Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Hess D. Liu B. Roan N.R. Sternglanz R. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown previously that targeted acetylation of histone H3 Lys9/Lys14 and of the histone H4 tail at the CUP1 promoter is dependent on SPT10 (9Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the questions of whether Spt10p is indeed a histone acetyltransferase and the identity of its target residues remain unsolved. SPT10 was originally identified as one of a set of SPT genes. Mutations in the SPT genes suppress phenotypes associated with insertion of the yeast Ty1 transposable element into promoters (10Fassler J.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1988; 118: 203-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SPT genes turned out to encode many important transcription proteins, including subunits of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase histone-modifying complex (11Grant P.A. Sterner D.E. Duggan L.J. Workman J.L. Berger S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), TATA box-binding protein, and histones (12Winston F. Sudarsanam P.

(Tokyo). 2001; 129: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SPT10 is not an essential gene, but the null allele is associated with very slow growth and defects in gene regulation (14Natsoulis G. Dollard F. Winston F. Boeke J.D. New Biol. 1991; 3: 1249-1259PubMed Google Scholar, 15Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Natsoulis G.

However, we have shown recently that Spt10p is in fact a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes histone upstream activating sequence (UAS) 2The abbreviations used are: UAS, upstream activating sequence; HA, hemagglutinin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus. elements with the consensus sequence (G/A)TTCCN6TTCNC (19Eriksson P.R.

Spt10p appears to be the activator of the yeast core histone genes, which has been sought after for many years (20Osley M.A. Gould J. Kim S. Kane M. Hereford L.

Biol. 1992; 12: 5455-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that it binds with high affinity and with extraordinary positive cooperativity to pairs of histone UAS elements. Because pairs of histone UAS elements are found only in the core histone promoters and nowhere else in the yeast genome, there are no other predicted sites for Spt10p binding. Although it remains formally possible that Spt10p is recruited to other promoters as a conventional coactivator, without employing its ability to recognize the histone UAS, it seems more likely that its effects at other genes are indirect, mediated through defects in chromatin structure arising from a deficit of histones in spt10Δ cells (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the DNA-binding domain of Spt10p is located between residues 283 and 396. It can recognize a single histone UAS element, unlike the full-length protein. This implies the presence of a blocking domain in Spt10p, which guarantees that the protein will bind only pairs of histone UAS elements. The binding of Spt10p to DNA is zinc-dependent, and the DNA-binding domain contains a predicted basic zinc finger, which is necessary but not sufficient for DNA binding. We show that a mutation in this zinc finger (C388S) seriously compromises the binding of Spt10p to the histone UAS elements in vitro and in vivo. This mutation is associated with a very poor growth phenotype similar to that of the null mutant. The DNA-binding domain of Spt10p has an intriguing homology to the zinc finger domain of foamy virus integrase. We speculate that foamy virus integrase might recognize a similar DNA sequence.

McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); this results in the integration of DNA encoding three C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tags and URA3 as selection marker just downstream of the chromosomal SPT10 gene. The C388S, H355S, and H416S mutants were constructed using derivatives of p355. BJ-SPT10(C388S)-HA was constructed using p383, which was made by substituting the 731-bp BstEII-MscI fragment of wild-type SPT10 in p355 with the mutant version obtained from pGN1622 (a gift of Dr. Jef Boeke) (15Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C388S mutation was marked with a TaqI site. BJ-SPT10(H355S)-HA was constructed using p384, in which the 664-bp SwaI-BstEII fragment of SPT10 in p355 was substituted with a mutant version made by PCR. The H355S mutation was marked with an AvrII site. BJ-SPT10(H416S)-HA was constructed using p402, in which the 731-bp BstEII-MscI fragment of SPT10 in p355 was substituted with a mutant version made by PCR. The H416S mutation was marked with a ClaI site. Plasmid sequences were verified. The required strains were identified by Southern blot analysis; the presence of the mutation was confirmed using the marker restriction site. For the overexpression study, BJ-SPT10-HA and BJ-SPT10(C388S)-HA were transformed with plasmids based on pRS425 (a 2-μm vector carrying LEU2 as a selection marker). pRS425-SPT10-HA (p438) was made by transferring the 2559-bp HindIII-NotI fragment carrying the SPT10-HA gene from p375 (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell.

Purification of Spt10 Proteins—Baculoviral recombinant Spt10p with three HA and three FLAG tags at its C terminus was purified as described (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B.

Recombinant Spt10p(C388S) was prepared similarly from Hi5 cells, except that the multiplicity of infection was 10, and the cells were harvested 48 h post-infection. The C388S baculovirus was constructed using p452, which is based on pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). p452 was constructed by substituting the 742-bp BstEII-ClaI SPT10 fragment in p439 (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with a version carrying the C388S mutation from p383. Recombinant Spt10p fragments were prepared from Escherichia coli. An expression vector for full-length SPT10 with an N-terminal His6 tag (p342) was constructed by inserting the 2293-bp BamHI fragment from pNEB-SPT10-B (9Shen C.-H. Leblanc B.P. Neal C. Akhavan R. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6406-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) at the BamHI site of pET-28a(+) (Novagen). A single C-terminal FLAG tag was inserted by replacing the 519-bp MscI-XhoI SPT10 fragment in p342 with a FLAG-tagged version made by PCR to obtain p348. Various Spt10p fragments were prepared using expression plasmids based on p348; the NcoI-KpnI SPT10 fragment in p348 was replaced with truncated versions made by PCR. (The NcoI site precedes the N-terminal His6 tag, so this was deleted; the KpnI site marks the beginning of the single C-terminal FLAG tag, which was preserved.) Expression vectors for residues 212–508 (p467), 227–433 (p466), 283–396 (p481), and 326–396 (p485) were constructed. A version of p481 carrying the C388S mutation (p490) was made using p446 as the PCR template. These plasmids were introduced into E. coli Tuner(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) for expression; cells were grown to A600 = 0.5 in Luria broth supplemented with 40 μg/ml kanamycin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mm zinc acetate and induced with 0.05 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h with shaking at room temperature. For p481 and p490, cells from a 500-ml culture were collected and resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer S (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 10 μm pepstatin A, and protease inhibitors lacking EDTA (Roche Applied Science)). The cells were broken by sonication on ice. Debris was removed by sedimentation (Sorvall SA600 rotor) at 16,500 rpm and 4 °C, and the supernatant was syringe-filtered (0.45 μm; Millipore Corp.). For p466, p467, and p485, cells were extracted as described above, except that the buffer used contained 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 10 μm pepstatin A, and protease inhibitors lacking EDTA. For p485, the crude extract was used in gel shift assays. (Other Spt10p fragments bound strongly to DNA in crude extracts (data not shown).) For p466 and p467, the Spt10p fragments were partially purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody as described for baculoviral Spt10p (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); the resulting preparations were ∼10% pure. For p481 and p490, the extracts were diluted to 0.1 m NaCl with Buffer S lacking NaCl and then applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Mono S column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer S and 0.1 m NaCl. The column was washed with 25 ml of the same buffer and eluted using a 10-ml salt gradient (0.1–1.5 m NaCl). Fractions containing Spt10 proteins were identified by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody, pooled, and dialyzed overnight into Buffer S. The Spt10 proteins were purified to homogeneity by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody and by elution with 3X FLAG™ peptide (Sigma) as described (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G.

Small amounts of antibody present in some preparations were removed by incubation with protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C, followed by removal of the protein G-agarose by sedimentation. Gel Shift Assays—These were performed as described previously (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H.

For gel shifts involving the single UAS element from HTA1, the following 34-base oligonucleotides were annealed, resulting in a single base 5′-extension at each end to facilitate end labeling with T4 polynucleotide kinase: 5′-GCCTCACTGTGCGAAGCTATTGGAATGGAGTGTA and 5′-GTACACTCCATTCCAATAGCTTCGCACAGTGAGG. Microarrays—Three independent RNA preparations from BJ-SPT10(C388S)-HA were analyzed at the same time and in the same way as triplicate RNA preparations from wild-type (BJ5459) and null (BJ-spt10Δ) cells as reported previously (19Eriksson P.R.

The data for wild-type and null cells are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus Database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/) with accession number GSE2407 (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—These experiments were carried out using anti-HA antibody as described (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L.

The Binding of Spt10p to the Histone UAS Element Is Zinc-dependent—The goal of this work was to define and characterize the DNA-binding domain of Spt10p. A search for a possible DNA-binding motif in Spt10p uncovered two possible zinc fingers (Fig. 1A). The first is HX3HX29CX2C (residues 351–388), where X is any amino acid, and the second is CX2CX21HX5H (residues 385–416). The latter possibility was first noticed by Natsoulis et al. (15Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who also demonstrated that the C388S mutation has a very slow growth phenotype, similar to that of the null mutant, indicating that this residue is important in vivo (see below). However, Cys388 is common to both possible zinc fingers, and it is therefore unclear which of the two is affected by the C388S mutation. Because they share the same pair of cysteine residues, they are presumably mutually exclusive. Both zinc fingers are quite positively charged, as expected for a DNA-binding domain. We first tested whether zinc is required for specific high affinity binding of Spt10p to the histone UAS elements using the gel shift assay. An end-labeled synthetic double-stranded 60-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to the pair of UAS elements in the HTA1 promoter (one of the two genes in yeast that encode histone H2A) (Fig. 1B) and recombinant Spt10p purified from baculovirus-infected cells were used (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our Spt10p preparations contained EDTA to protect the protein from metalloproteases. Because EDTA is a potent chelator of zinc, our initial studies utilized Spt10p that had been purified further on a Mono S column in the presence of zinc to remove the EDTA, followed by a desalting column to remove zinc from the preparation. However, this Spt10p bound to the HTA1 UAS elements without measurable loss of affinity in the absence of added zinc (data not shown). This indicates that if Spt10p is a zinc-binding protein, it must bind zinc very tightly. To test whether zinc is indeed required for the binding of Spt10p to DNA, it was therefore necessary to add EDTA to the binding reaction to strip Spt10p of zinc and then to add zinc back to determine whether it could restore DNA-binding activity. The concentrations of Spt10p and UAS DNA were fixed at 100 and 2 nm, respectively, and a range of zinc acetate concentrations (0–500 μm) was tested in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA (Fig. 1C). Spt10p bound only very weakly to the UAS elements in the absence of zinc ions, indicating that the EDTA was effective. Addition of zinc resulted in a large increase in the binding of Spt10p to the UAS DNA, eventually reaching a plateau of ∼80% DNA bound at ∼50 μm zinc (Fig. 1D). The plateau corresponded to the fraction of DNA expected to be bound given the dissociation constant (19Eriksson P.R. Mendiratta G. McLaughlin N.B. Wolfsberg T.G. Mariño-Ramírez L. Pompa T.A. Jainerin M. Landsman D. Shen C.-H. Clark D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9127-9137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The small amount of Spt10p binding in the absence of added zinc ions probably reflects incomplete removal of zinc from Spt10p by EDTA. We conclude that the binding of Spt10p to the histone UAS elements is dependent on zinc, consistent with the presence of a zinc finger in the DNA-binding domain. The zinc ion in a zinc finger is coordinated by the thiol groups of cysteine residues and/or the imidazole nitrogens of histidine residues. The side chain of serine differs from that of cysteine only in the substitution of oxygen for sulfur. Nevertheless, serine is a poor substitute for cysteine, and therefore, Cys-to-Ser mutations are often used to inactivate zinc fingers. To address the importance of Cys388 in the binding of Spt10p to DNA in vitro, baculoviral recombinant Spt10p carrying the C388S mutation was prepared. This turned out to be very difficult because the mutant protein was very susceptible to proteolysis, perhaps suggesting that it was partially unfolded. Nevertheless, using high concentrations of the protease inhibitor pepstatin A, it was possible to obtain preparations with some intact protein (Fig. 1E). At high concentrations, the C388S protein aggregated the UAS DNA instead of forming defined complexes, indicating that the C388S protein did not bind to the UAS elements with significant affinity (Fig. 1F). This demonstrates the importance of Cys388 in the recognition of the UAS element and is consistent with a role for Cys388 in zinc binding. The DNA-binding Domain of Spt10p Is Located between Residues 283 and 396—We analyzed the distribution of positively charged residues in the sequence of Spt10p for clues as to the possible extent of the DNA-binding domain, assuming the involvement of one of the two possible zinc fingers (Fig. 2A). This distribution revealed several clusters of basic residues (i.e. lysine and arginine) mostly on the N-terminal side of the two candidate zinc fingers, extending into the putative histone acetyltransferase domain. Accordingly, a series of expression vectors encoding fragments of Spt10p with single C-terminal FLAG tags was constructed for expression in E. coli. Although it was possible to obtain sufficient quantities of soluble protein in each case, the yields were very poor, reflecting the fact that most of the protein was insoluble. Initially, partially purified fragments of Spt10p were screened for DNA binding using the gel shift assay (Fig. 2B). The largest fragment of Spt10p tested encompassed residues 212–508, extending from within the presumptive border of the histone acetyltransferase domain (residues 113–245 as defined by homology (7Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar)) to the border of the C-terminal deletion defined previously by others (15Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, deletion of residues 509–640 is associated with transcription defects, but growth is normal (15Natsoulis G. Winston F. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1994; 136: 93-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This fragment of Spt10p bound specifically and tightly to the histone UAS elements, yielding two complexes, presumably corresponding to the binding of Spt10p-(212–508) to each of the two UAS elements in the DNA probe. This is discussed in more detail below. To narrow down the DNA-binding domain further, a protein corresponding to residues 227–433 was tested; although several basic residues were eliminated at each end relative to the larger protein, this protein fragment also bound tightly to the histone UAS elements, indicating that the DNA-binding domain was located within this region of Spt10p. A smaller fragment corresponding to residues 283–396 also bound to the UAS elements with high affinity. Because the C-terminal candidate zinc finger (residues 385–416) was not present in this protein, it is apparent that it is not involved in DNA binding. In contrast, the N-terminal zinc finger (residues 351–388) was entirely included in this fragment. Because it has already been shown that Cys388 is necessary for DNA binding (Fig. 1F), the C terminus of the DNA-binding domain must lie between residues 388 and 396. To narrow down the N-terminal border of the DNA-binding domain, two more proteins were prepared, corresponding to residues 326–396 (Fig. 2B) and 340–396 (data not shown). However, neither of these had any DNA-binding activity, indicating that the N terminus of the DNA-binding domain lies between residues 283 and 326. We also investigated whether the zinc finger alone is sufficient for DNA binding by testing a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 347–393, but the peptide did not bind to DNA under any conditions tested (data not shown). We conclude that the DNA-binding domain of Spt10p is located between residues 283 and 396. Although it includes and requires the zinc finger defined by residues 351–388, this zinc finger is not sufficient for specific DNA binding. The DNA-binding Domain Binds with High Affinity to Single Histone UAS Elements, Unlike the Full-length Protein—The wild-type and C388S versions of the DNA-binding domain of Spt10p (residues 283–396) were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 3A). Their affinities for the HTA1 oligonucleotide containing two UAS elements (as in Figs. 1 and 2) were measured using the gel shift assay (Fig. 3B). The KD of the wild-type DNA-binding domain was 32 ± 18 nm (n = 3), which is very similar to that of the full-length protein on the same DNA (45 ± 16 nm, n = 11). Although the DNA-binding domain carrying the C388S mutation did bind to DNA, its KD was only 249 ± 6 nm (n = 3) (Fig. 3B); it bound ∼8-fold more weakly than the wild-type DNA-binding domain. This experiment was performed in the presence of 100 μm zinc. However, at a zinc concentration of 10 μm, the KD of the C388S DNA-binding domain for the UAS was 400 nm,"

In this system, the N-terminal fragments of scSpt23p and scMga2p control the expression of scOLE1 as transcription co-activators following their release from the endoplasmic reticulum by a mechanism that involves the ubiquitination of the membrane-bound precursor followed by a selective proteolytic cleavage by the 26 S proteosome (7Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The activation and regulation of scOLE1 expression appears to be the only essential function of scSpt23p and scMga2p and disruption of both genes produces a synthetic fatty acid auxotrophy that can be repaired by including cis-unsaturated acids in the growth medium or by expression of the scOle1p desaturase gene under the control of a heterologous promoter (4Zhang S. Skalsky Y. Garfinkel D.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 473-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most fungi, however, including the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, express multiple fatty acid desaturases including Δ9, Δ12, and Δ15 enzymes that can sequentially form the monounsaturated species 9Z-16:1 and 9Z-18:1, and the polyunsaturated species 9Z,12Z-18:2 and 9Z,12Z,15Z-18:3 (8Tocher D.R. Leaver M.J. Hodgson P.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 73-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In some fungi Δ5, Δ6, and ω-3 desaturases have also been identified that are used in the formation of γ-linolenic acid 6Z,9Z,12Z-18:3, docosatetraenoic (arachidonic) acid 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-20:4, and eicosapentaenoic acid 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-20:5 (9Michaelson L.V.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An analysis of the Candida albicans genome identified only one homologue of the Saccharomyces scSPT23/scMGA2 genes. Given the highly specific and essential regulatory role of the scSpt23p/scMga2p proteins in regulating unsaturated fatty acid formation, we examined the hypothesis that caSpt23p exerts a similar control over the expression of the Δ9 enzyme and possibly other desaturases. This study shows that when caSpt23p is expressed in Saccharomyces it can repair the loss of scOLE1 transcription in an scspt23Δ;scmga2Δ strain. We further show that repression of caSPT23 in Candida albicans blocks the expression of the caOLE1 desaturase, producing growth defects and loss of viability that can be repaired by a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids. Metabolic labeling studies also indicate that, under conditions that repress caSpt23, the synthesis of both monoenoic and dienoic acids are repressed, suggesting that it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. Strains and Growth Media—C. albicans and S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Saccharomyces strains were grown at 30 °C on synthetic dextrose) or SG (synthetic galactose) drop out medium as previously described (12Vemula M. Kandasamy P. Oh C.S. Chellappa R. Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45269-45279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Candida yeast phase cells were also grown at 30 °C in synthetic dextrose or synthetic maltose drop-out medium with the addition of 80 μm uridine (13Wilson R.B. Davis D. Mitchell A.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments employing fatty acid supplements, the growth medium used in liquid cultures contained 0.1% Tergitol/Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) to disperse the fatty acids. Tergitol/Nonidet P-40 is not derived from fatty acids or fatty alcohols and is apparently not metabolized by Candida. Fatty acids were obtained from NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN). Escherichia coli NovaBlue Singles® competent cells were obtained from Novagen. Growth tests were performed by monitoring A600 of the cultures or by hemocytometer counting. For viability assays, cells were subjected to brief sonication (2 × 3 s) to disperse clumped cells before plating on the appropriate agar medium.TABLE 1Strains used in this studyStrainDescriptionSourceS. cerevisiae strainsDTY 11Aleu2-3,leu2-112,can1-100,ura-3-1,ade2-1,trp1-1, MGA,;SPT23This studymΔsΔleu2-3,leu2-112,can1-100,ura-3-1,ade2-1,trp1-1(HIS3+), (G418 sulfate+), mga2Δ::kanMAX4;spt23Δ::kanMAX4This studyC. albicans strainsBWP17ura3/ura3, his1::hisG/his1::hisG, arg4::hisG/arg4::hisGA.

First, one of the caSPT23 alleles was disrupted using the linear DNA fragments containing the caHIS1 gene flanked by caSPT23 upstream and downstream gene sequences. A linear DNA cassette containing the C. albicans caARG4 gene and sequences derived from the promoter of the caMAL2 gene was then inserted before the start codon of the caSPT23 gene on the homologous chromosome. All DNA fragments used for the gene disruption and modification procedures were constructed by PCR methods from the native caSPT23 gene sequences using the oligonucleotide primers shown in Table 3. The native caSPT23 gene used in these manipulations was isolated from C. albicans strain BWP17 by PCR cloning of genomic DNA. Strain BWP17 was transformed with the disrupted or modified forms of DNA fragments encoding the caSPT23 gene using the BD Biosciences Yeastmaker® Transformation System 2 method.TABLE 3PCR primers used in this studyPrimerDescriptionSPT-5DR5′-GTTTCTATAAATCTTTTATTTTGTTGTTTTGTTTTGTTTTTTGAAAGGAAACTATAGCGCTTAGTACCCCTAATCTACACAATCGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTT-3′SPT-3DR5′-GCATATATACTAAAAACTGACCATGAAGTGAAAAAAAAAAATCATATTATATTATCCTGCAATAGGTTTTTATTAATATGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGATA3′SPT-BamHI-ATG5′-CTAGGATCCATGACAGATCCATTAACATTCTTG-3′SPT-R25′-CGAAGATGGTGAAACAGGAGATGGAG-3′SPT-F25′-GACAACCCACTACCACCCGCCTAC-3′HIS-F5′-GGTGGTATTTTTGTGCGGAGCG-3′HIS-R5′-CCTTCGCTGTCTTCTTCCTCTGATG-3′SPT-R5′-CTGAGGAAGGCGAAGATGGTG-3′S1-F5′-CATGTTCAGGAAAGCTTAATTGTGATTG-3′BamHI-SPT-R5′-CGAGGATCCGATTGTGTAGATTAGGGGTAC-3′SPTdet-F5′-GTGAAACTAAAAGCTAACTCTGATTTACTCCAC-3′ARG-R5′-CCTTCAATCCTTCATTCTGTTTATTTGAG-3′ARG-5det5′-GGATCTCTAGTTTGTTTCCAAATTTTTCTAGCTTCA-3′SPT-R35′-CAAGTCTTGTGCTGTTTGTCCAAGATG-3′SPT-NR5′-GGCACTTCAATAGATTTTGGTGTTGC-3′S2-Prom MAL25′-TGCAAAAGTATCATTATCTTCTGGGAAATAAAAGAATTCTTAAACTCATCCAAGAATGTTAATGGATCTGTCATTGTAGTTGATTATTAGTTAAACCAC-3′HA-SPT-R5′-TGGTGCAAAAGTATCATTATCTTCTGGGAAATAAAAGAATTCATTAAACTCATCCAAGAATGTTAATGGATCTGTCACTAGAGCGTAATCTGGTACGTCG-3′SpeI-HA-F5′/5Phos-CTAGTTACCCATACGACGTACCAGATTACGCTTACCCATACGACGTACCAGATTACGCTTACCCATACGACGTACCAGATTACGCT-3′SpeI-HA-R5′/5Phos-CTAGAGCGTAATCTGGTACGTCGTATGGGTAAGCGTAATCTGGTACGTCGTATGGGTAAGCGTAATCTGGTACGTCGTATGGGTAA-3′HA-F5′-TACCCATACGACGTACCAGATTACGC-3′OLE1-F5′-GGATCCATGACTACAGTTGAACAACTTG-3′OLE1-R5′-CTAAGATTGCTTTTCCTTCTCCATCATTTG-3′OLE2-F5′-GGATCCATGTCTAAGCATTCAGAAGATC-3′OLE2-R5′-CTATGCTGCTTCAGCAGTGTGATGG-3′ACT1-F5′-ATGGACGGTGAAGAAGTTGCTGC-3′ACT1-R5′-TTAGAAACATTTGTGGTGAACAATGG-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of caspt23ΔHIS1 Cassette—The caSPT23 gene was isolated using the PCR primer pair SPT-BamHI-ATG and SPT-R2, which amplified a fragment containing the open reading frame and 538 bp of 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the chromosomal gene. The amplified fragments were ligated into vector pSTBlue-1 (Novagen) yielding pSTBlue-SPT23. The caHIS1 gene was amplified from plasmid pGEM-HIS1 (14Wilson R.B. Davis D. Enloe B.M. Mitchell A.P. Yeast. 2000; 16: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with primer pair SPT-5DR and SPT-3DR, which contained 79 bp of 5′ and 3′ flanking sequence of the SPT23 open reading frame. The amplified fragments were cloned into vector pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) to create pBlue-spt23ΔHIS1. To make the final pSTBlue-caspt23ΔHIS1 mod plasmid (psH), an EcoNI-NotI fragment of pSTBlue-SPT23 was subcloned into EcoNI/NotI cut pBlue-spt23ΔHIS1. The caspt23ΔHIS1 disruption cassette was liberated from the plasmid, psH, by digestion with HindIII and ScaI and transformed into BWP17 to make BWP17-spt23Δ::HIS1 (sΔH). Construction of the caARG4/caMAL2p/SPT23 Cassette—The 5′-UTR of caSPT23 was amplified with PCR primer pair S1-F and BamHI-SPT-R, which amplifies a 1040-bp fragment of the 5′-UTR of the chromosomal gene. Amplified fragments were cloned into vector pSTBlue-1 to create pSTBlue-SPT23(5′UTR). A BamHI fragment of this plasmid was inserted into BamHI cut and dephosphorylated plasmid pFA-ARG4-MAL2p (15Gola S. Martin R. Walther A. Dunkler A. Wendland J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 1339-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) to create pFA-SPT23(5′UTR)-ARG4-MAL2p (pSAM). The SPT23/ARG4/MAL2p/caSPT23 cassette was amplified with PCR primer pair S1-F and S2-Prom MAL2. The PCR product was transformed into sΔH to make BWP17-caspt23Δ::HIS1;ARG4/MAL2p/SPT23 (sΔH-M2pS). Construction of the ARG4/MAL2p/3xHA/SPT23 Cassette—A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the triple HA epitope tag primers, SpeI-HA-F and SpeI-HA-R, was ligated into the dephosphorylated SpeI site of plasmid pSAM to make pFA-SPT23(5′UTR)-ARG4-MAL2p-3xHA (pSAMHA). The SPT23/ARG4/MAL2p/3xHA/SPT23 cassette was then amplified with the PCR primer pair S1-F and HA-SPT-R and the resulting PCR product was transformed into Candida strain sΔH to make strain BWP17-spt23Δ::HIS1;ARG4/MAL2p/3xHA/SPT23 (sΔH-M2pHAS). Heterologous Expression of the C. albicans caSPT23 Gene in Saccharomyces—The protein coding sequences of the caSPT23 gene were subcloned into a BamHI-XhoI site of vector pESC-TRP (Stratagene) to make vector pEGS (pESC-GAL1-caSPT23-TRP1). This plasmid, which contains the caSPT23 gene under control of the scGAL1 promoter, was transformed into S. cerevisiae strain mΔsΔ (mga2::kanMAX4;spt23::kanMAX4), which contains disrupted alleles of the scSPT23 and scMGA2 genes. Expression assays of this strain were performed on tryptophan dropout synthetic glucose agar medium with 1% Tergitol/Nonidet P-40 with no fatty acids or 0.5 mm 16:1 + 0.5 mm 18:1. Preparation of Radiolabeled Probes—The entire open reading frames of the caOLE1, caOLE2, and caACT1 genes were isolated using PCR primer pairs (Table 3) and cloned into plasmid pSTBlue-1 to make plasmids pSTBlue-OLE1, pSTBlue-OLE2, and pSTBlue-ACT1 (Table 2). The resulting plasmids were opened with restriction enzymes, NcoI (for pSTBlue-OLE1), ScaI (for pSTBlue-OLE2), and NdeI (for pSTBlue-ACT1), and the linearized plasmid DNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris acetate-EDTA buffer and purified by the GENECLEAN® Kit (Q-Biogene). Radiolabeled RNA probes from the linearized plasmids were synthesized in vitro with [α-32P]dUTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by SP6 polymerase using the Strip-EZ® RNA kit from Ambion. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the samples using a MicroSpin® G-25 column (GE Healthcare). The specific activities of the labeled probes were determined by liquid scintillation counting. β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase reporter gene assays were performed as previously described (16Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the modification that cells were disrupted prior to the assay by three cycles of freezing and thawing at –80 and 30 °C. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—The Candida strain, sΔH-M2pS, was cultured in His/Arg dropout synthetic dextrose medium at 30 °C overnight and the cells were washed with and transferred to His/Arg dropout synthetic maltose medium for induction of the caSPT23 gene. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C with shaking and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was washed with cold water twice and 2 volumes of RNAlater® (Ambion) was added to the pellet prior to freezing at –80 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the RiboPure® YeastKit from Ambion. The amount of RNA was measured in a 96-well microplate with the Quanti-iT® RNA Assay Kit (Molecular Probes) and the fluorescence signal was quantified by fluorescence imaging with a STORM 860 (GE Healthcare) using the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences). For Northern blot analysis equal amounts of heat-denatured total RNA were fractionated on 1% formaldehyde gels (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar) and the separated RNA was transferred to Hybond®-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) in 10× SSC for 90 min at 7 inches of mercury using a Vacuum Blotter (model 785), according to instructions from the manufacturer. The membrane was pre-hybridized at 65 °C for 2 h in 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 7% SDS and hybridized at 65 °C overnight with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled RNA probe. After incubation the membrane was washed twice at 65 °C for 30 min with 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 5% SDS. This was followed by two 30-min wash cycles at 65 °C with 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, and 1% SDS. Northern blot radioactivity was quantified by phosphorimaging. Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis—Candida strain sΔH-M2pS was grown at 30 °C in supplemented minimal media to a 1 × 107 cells/ml and lysis of cells for immunoblotting was performed as described (18Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in 300 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) + protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) and disrupted with 300 μl of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) in a BioSpec bead beater at full speed 3 times for 1 min. Cells were allowed to cool on ice for 1 min between cycles to avoid overheating the sample. Glass beads were removed from the total lysate by centrifugation for 10 s and the supernatant was mixed with 2× urea sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8) with incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. The liquid lysate was then clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. The amount of protein in the final lysate was quantified with the Quanti-iT Protein Assay Kit (Molecular Probes). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE using a Mini-PROTEAN® 3 electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad) as described (19Laemmli U.K. Molbert E. Showe M. Kellenberger E. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 49: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of heat-denatured total lysate in urea sample buffer were applied onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels and separated by electrophoresis at a constant 100 V for 1.2 h or until the bromphenol blue dye was just passed through the gel. Proteins were then electroblotted to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blotted membrane was placed in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% ECL® Blocking Agent (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with either a 1/10,000 dilution of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) or a 1/500 dilution of monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) in TBST (with 5% ECL Blocking Agent) at 4 °C overnight or for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed with TBST and reacted with a 1/10,000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega) in TBST (with 5% ECL Blocking Agent) for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody-treated membrane was washed with TBST and developed with ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). The chemifluorescence signal was detected by a STORM 860 imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified with the ImageQuant program (Amersham Biosciences). Fatty Acid Analysis and Labeling Studies—Fatty acid composition of C. albicans cultures were determined by HCl methanolysis of cells harvested by centrifugation and washed two times with ice-cold distilled water as previously described for Saccharomyces cultures (20McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gas chromatography as previously described (21Toke D.A. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For fatty acid radiolabeling studies, overnight cultures of strain sΔH-M2pS were harvested by centrifugation, washed with an equal volume of synthetic medium with no carbon source, and inoculated at a density of 2.5 × 106 in 15 ml of synthetic maltose medium or 5 × 106/ml in 15 ml of SG medium. After incubation at 30 °C for 4 h, 10 μCi of 1-14C-labeled 16:0 or 18:1 were added to each culture flask. After a 4-h incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed two times in cold 0.7% NaCl. Washed cell pellets were then frozen at –80 °C overnight. Cell pellets were transferred to Tefloncapped glass tubes in 2 × 1.0-ml aliquots of methanol and the lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer procedure as previously described (22Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (43126) Google Scholar). The lipid fraction was washed two times according to the Folch procedure (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), evaporated under nitrogen, and transesterified by HCl methanolysis as previously described (20McDonough V.M. Stukey J.E. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5931-5936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl ester fractions were concentrated under nitrogen prior to thin layer chromatography analysis. Argentation TLC analysis was performed using a 70:30 (v/v) hexane:ethyl ether solvent system on Silica Gel G plates presoaked in a solution of methanolic 4% AgNO3 in methanol:H2O (9:1, v/v) and activated for 30 min at 110 °C in the dark. A comparison of the Candida caSPT23 gene with its Saccharomyces scSPT23 and scMGA2 homologues reveals significant conservation within their protein domains despite the divergence of these two species over 700 million years (Fig. 2A). Although the length of the Candida protein is about 75% of the Saccharomyces homologues, all three proteins show regions of high sequence identity in the N-terminal transcription activation domains, a highly homologous protein-protein interaction domain and near-perfect identities in regions that contain the predicted nuclear export signal and the transmembrane domains. These regions of high homology are located at identical positions on all three proteins (Fig. 2B). Unlike the Saccharomyces homologues, however, the Candida protein lacks the ankyrin repeat sequences located at a C-terminal position to the protein-protein interaction domain. To test whether the Candida protein can activate scOLE1 transcription in Saccharomyces, a plasmid containing the caSpt23p protein coding sequence under the control of the yeast scGAL1 promoter was introduced into the scspt23Δ;scmga2Δ strain. Fig. 3A shows that the expression of the Candida gene in medium containing galactose relieves the fatty acid auxotrophy of the strain, indicating that it can function in activating the expression of the scOLE1 gene. Fig. 3B shows that a β-galactosidase reporter gene fused to the full-length Saccharomyces OLE1 promoter is activated in the Saccharomyces spt23Δ;mga2Δ cells by caSpt23 and can be repressed ∼4.5-fold by exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. This attenuation of reporter gene activity requires a longer time of exposure to unsaturated fatty acids than that observed in wild type cells containing functional copies of the native scSPT23 and scMGA2 genes. Genetic and Biochemical Characterization of Strains Containing Glucose Repressible Forms of caSPT23—Because C. albicans is diploid, tests of the function of the gene requires the inactivation of both alleles. To examine the functions of the caSpt23 gene, we constructed integrating plasmids that placed the native and an N-terminal HA epitope-tagged form of its protein coding sequence under control of the maltose-inducible and glucose-repressible caMAL2 promoter. These were integrated into the remaining caSPT23 locus of a strain that contains a deletion of one of the caSPT23 alleles. The caMAL2 gene encodes a maltase that is the homologue of the Saccharomyces MAL62 gene. Previous studies have shown that the caMAL2 mRNA is undetectable by Northern blotting in C. albicans cells grown on glucose or glycerol, but is induced when cells are grown on maltose (24Backen A.C. Broadbent I.D. Fetherston R.W. Rosamond J.D. Schnell N.F. Stark M.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that a green fluorescent protein (25Cormack B.P. Bertram G. Egerton M. Gow N.A. Falkow S. Brown A.J. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and the caURA3 gene (26Geber A. Williamson P.R. Rex J.H. Sweeney E.C. Bennett J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6992-6996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are expressed when cells are grown on maltose but not on glucose when they are placed under the control of the caMAL2 promoter. Although it cannot be ruled out that a very low level of caMAL2-driven expression occurs in glucose-grown cells, studies of the caURA3 gene under control of caMAL2 promoter in cells grown under glucose is not sufficient to confer 5-fluoroorotic acid sensitivity on the strain, which is a sensitive indicator of weak basal gene activity (24Backen A.C. Broadbent I.D. Fetherston R.W. Rosamond J.D. Schnell N.F. Stark M.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of caSPT23 Blocks Growth and Viability of Strains That Express Native and Epitope-tagged Forms of the Protein—Tests of strains that only express the caMAL2-controlled forms of either the wild type or the HA epitope-tagged caSPT23 genes show that after transfer from maltose to glucose medium there is a brief growth period and then cell division is strongly repressed. Fig. 4A shows the results of a representative set of experiments in which cells grown on maltose medium were washed and transferred to glucose containing medium at an inoculum of 2 × 106 cells/ml. The cells that were exposed to glucose grew at the same rate as those transferred to fresh maltose carbon source for ∼4–6 h (corresponding to about 3.5 generations). At that time, growth of the glucose-repressed cells slows dramatically and progresses into a stationary phase. By 6 h, the glucose-treated cell population begins to exhibit significant clumping and the formation of elongated cells. By 10 h, very few cells with buds are observed and by 24 h a significant fraction of the clumped cells have formed pseudohyphal structures (Fig. 5, A–C). The timing of the initial growth phase, growth arrest, and pseudohyphal formation is consistent over a wide range of inoculum densities ranging from 2 × 104 to 5 × 106 cells/ml. Viability is also dramatically reduced in the glucose-repressed cultures, resulting in ∼12% viable cells at 6 h, 5% at 10 h, and 3% after 24 h of growth (Fig. 4C). By contrast, cells containing either the native or HA-tagged genes that were maintained on maltose retained 60–90% viability during the same period and remained as yeast phase cells as they p"
https://openalex.org/W2037801695,"Dictyostelium discoideum MyoB is a single-headed class I myosin. Analysis of purified MyoB by SDS-PAGE indicated the presence of an ∼9-kDa light chain. A tryptic digest of MyoB yielded a partial sequence for the light chain that exactly matched a sequence in a 73-amino acid, 8,296-Da protein (dictyBase number DDB0188713). This protein, termed MlcB, contains two EF-hand motifs and shares ∼30% sequence identity with the N- and C-terminal lobes of calmodulin. FLAG-MlcB expressed in Dictyostelium co-immunoprecipitated with MyoB but not with the related class myosins and MyoD. Recombinant MlcB bound Ca2+ with a Kd value of 0.2 μm and underwent a Ca2+-induced change in conformation that increased α-helical content and surface hydrophobicity. Mutational analysis showed that the first EF-hand was responsible for Ca2+ binding. In the presence and absence of Ca2+ MlcB was a monomer in solution and bound to a MyoB IQ motif peptide with a Kd value of ∼0.5 μm. A MyoB head-neck construct with a Ser to Glu mutation at the TEDS site bound MlcB and displayed an actin-activated Mg2+ ATPase activity that was insensitive to Ca2+. We conclude that MlcB represents a novel type of small myosin light chain that binds to IQ motifs in a manner comparable with a single lobe of a typical four-EF-hand protein.

We conclude that MlcB represents a novel type of small myosin light chain that binds to IQ motifs in a manner comparable with a single lobe of a typical four-EF-hand protein. The class I myosins are ubiquitously expressed, single-headed, nonfilament forming myosins composed of a heavy chain and one or more light chains (1Osherov N. May G.S. Cell Motil.

Myosin I heavy chains consist of three domains: an N-terminal motor domain that drives movement along actin filaments, an α-helical neck region to which the light chains bind and a C-terminal tail. Seven different myosin heavy chain genes (myoA–F and myoK) are present in the genome of the highly motile social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum (4De La Roche M.A. Côté G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1525: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MyoA, MyoE, and MyoF have relatively short tails that consist solely of a tail homology 1 (TH1) 3The abbreviations used are: TH1 and TH2, tail homology 1 and 2; MlcD, MyoD light chain; ELC, essential light chain; RLC, regulatory light chain; MlcB, MyoB light chain; CaM, calmodulin; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid; AMIB and AMIC, Acanthamoeba myosin IB and IC; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation.3The abbreviations used are: TH1 and TH2, tail homology 1 and 2; MlcD, MyoD light chain; ELC, essential light chain; RLC, regulatory light chain; MlcB, MyoB light chain; CaM, calmodulin; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid; AMIB and AMIC, Acanthamoeba myosin IB and IC; MBP, maltose-binding protein; HSQC, heteronuclear single-quantum correlation. domain that binds membranes. MyoB, MyoC, and MyoD have longer tails that consist of a TH1 domain, a TH2 domain that binds actin filaments in a nucleotide-independent manner and an SH3 domain. MyoK is an atypical myosin I (MyoK) that has no tail but that contains a TH2 domain-like insert in the motor domain. The Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes localize to dynamic, actin-rich cortical regions of the cell, including macropinocytic cups and the leading edge of migrating cells (5Fukui Y. Lynch T.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Disruption of one or more myosin I heavy chain genes can produce defects in cortical tension, the uptake of fluids and particles, endosome recycling, and pseudopod retraction (7Neuhaus E.M.

Although there is a substantial degree of overlap in the functions of the myosin isozymes, individual isozymes apparently carry out unique tasks. MyoB, for example, plays a role in cellular translocation, the suppression of lateral pseudopod formation, and rapid intracellular particle motility, all of which are not functionally substituted for by other myosin I isozymes (13Wessels D. Murray J. Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. Soll D.R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 20: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although the cellular functions of the Dictyostelium myosin I isozymes have the subject of extensive investigation, only the 16-kDa light chain associated with MyoD, termed MlcD, has been identified (14De La Roche M.A. Lee S.F. Cote G.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 697-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the myosin II essential and regulatory light chains (ELC and RLCs, respectively) and calmodulin (CaM), which acts as the light chain for many types of unconventional myosins, MlcD consists of four helix-loop-helix EF-hand Ca2+ -binding motifs. In contrast to CaM, but similar to most ELCs and RLCs, MlcD has lost the ability to bind Ca2+ with high affinity due to mutations and deletions within the EF-hand motifs (14De La Roche M.A. Lee S.F. Cote G.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 697-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we report the identification of a novel light chain associated with Dictyostelium MyoB. The MyoB light chain, which we have termed MlcB, has a molecular mass of 8 kDa and consists of two EF-hands. MlcB is thus half the size of previously described myosin light chains. MlcB is shown to be a monomer in solution and to contain a single functional EF-hand that binds Ca2+ with submicromolar affinity. MlcB represents the first example of a two-EF-hand protein that functions as a myosin light chain. Sequence Analysis of the MyoB Light Chain—MyoB and MyoD were purified from Dictyostelium AX3 cells as described previously (15Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MyoB (170 μg) was digested overnight with a 1:50 (w/w) ratio of trypsin at room temperature in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The digest was lyophilized, resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and applied to a high performance liquid chromatography Superpac Pep-S 5-mm reverse phase column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a gradient to 50% acetonitrile. Selected peptides were sequenced at the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Canada). Cloning of MlcB and MyoB—DNA sequences encoding MlcB and the head-neck region of MyoB (amino acids 1–731) were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using as a template poly(A) mRNA extracted from growth-phase AX3 cells using the GeneElute Direct mRNA miniprep kit (Sigma). PCR products were ligated into the pCR2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen). MlcB with alanine in place of Asp-16 (MlcB-D16A) and MyoB with the serine at the TEDS site changed to glutamic acid (MyoB-S332E) were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The fidelity of all constructs was verified by sequencing. Bacterial Expression of MlcB—The MlcB and MlcB-D16A coding sequences were cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) to add an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6)-tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. Constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacteria were grown in LB to an A600 of 0.6, and expression was then induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 8 h at 37°C, cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h. MlcB was recovered in the supernatant and purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind column (Novagen). Fractions containing MlcB were pooled, diluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a DEAE anion exchange column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. The column was washed with Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and eluted stepwise with 175, 200, and 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing MlcB were pooled and chromatographed over a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Typical yields of MlcB and MlcB-D16A were 7–10 mg per liter of cell culture. Removal of the His-tag was carried out in buffer containing 500 mm NaCl by addition of 10 units of thrombin (Sigma) per mg of MlcB. After 16 h at room temperature, samples were passed over a column of benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to remove thrombin and re-chromatographed over a Sephacryl S-100 column. MlcB uniformly labeled with 15N or 13C/15N was prepared from bacteria grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 10 ml/liter 15N-BioExpress-1000 medium or 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, 2 g/liter [13C]glucose, and 10 ml/liter of 13C/15N-BioExpress-1000 medium, respectively (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). A bicistronic MlcB construct was created as follows. DNA encoding MlcB, with a stop codon, was inserted into the BamHI/XhoI site of pGEX-4T3 to generate pGEX-4T3-MlcB. A second copy of MlcB with a 5′-ribosome-binding site and an N-terminal Myc epitope tag was generated by PCR and cloned into the XhoI site of pGEX-4T3-MlcB to generate a vector that expresses both GST-MlcB and Myc-MlcB. Following expression in BL21(DE3) cells as described above, cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The supernatant obtained by a 1-h centrifugation at 15,000 × g was passed over a column of glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Co-purification of Myc-MlcB with the GST-MlcB was visualized by immunoblot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of MlcB and MyoB-S332E-ΔTail in Dictyostelium—N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged versions of MlcB and MyoB-S332E-ΔTail were produced by cloning into the pTX-FLAG plasmid (16Levi S. Polyakov M. Egelhoff T.T. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The pBsrH vector, which contains a blasticidin resistance cassette, was used to create a vector expressing MlcB fused at the N terminus to maltose-binding protein (MBP) (17Fischer M. Haase I. Simmeth E. Gerisch G. Muller-Taubenberger A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 577: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The MBP coding sequence was obtained from the pMAL-C2X vector (New England Biolabs). AX3 cells were transformed by electroporation and selected for growth in HL5 medium containing 20 μg/ml G-418 and/or 10 μg/ml blasticidin. Clonal cell lines were obtained by plating at limiting dilution and checked for protein expression by immunoblot analysis with the anti-FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma) and/or a monoclonal anti-MBP antibody (New England Biolabs). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in 0.3% Triton, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, and 1 × protease inhibitor mixture containing either 5 mm EGTA or 5 mm CaCl2 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the supernatant, incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a rocking platform, and collected by centrifugation. The beads were washed 5 × with lysis buffer and eluted with 2 × SDS sample buffer (12% sucrose, 2% SDS) or 200 μg/ml of FLAG peptide. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-FLAG M5 antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to MyoB, MyoD (15Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and MyoC (a gift from Dr. John Hammer III, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (6Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed using a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument. All ITC experiments were carried out using MlcB and MlcB-D16A from which the His-tag had been removed. For Ca2+ titration experiments, proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA and then extensively dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl in the presence of Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad). Titrations were performed at 30 °C with 2 ml of 50 μm MlcB or MlcB-D16A in the calorimetric cell and a 500 μm solution of CaCl2 in the injection syringe. Typical experiments involved 29 injections of 10 μl, with a reference power of 15 μcal/s. ITC was also used to monitor the binding of MlcB and MlcD to a 24-residue peptide (Ac-KDFDCTAKIQKAFRNWKAKKHSLE-NH2) corresponding to the IQ motif sequence in the MyoB neck. Recombinant MlcD used in these studies was purified from E. coli as described previously (14De La Roche M.A. Lee S.F. Cote G.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 697-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MlcB, MlcD, and the MyoB IQ motif peptide were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl containing either 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2. Titrations were performed as described above, using a 50 μm solution of MlcB or MlcD in the calorimetric cell and injection of 10 μl of a 625 μm solution of the MyoB IQ motif peptide. The time-dependent differential power signal was integrated to obtain the total heat evolved after each injection of ligand and corrected for the heat of dilution of the ligand alone. Data analysis and curve fitting were performed using the MicroCal ORIGIN software package. CD and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Far- and near-UV CD spectra were taken from 180 to 250 nm and from 250 to 320 nm, respectively, on an Olis RSM 1000 spectrophotometer. Far-UV spectra were collected using 150 μm MlcB and a 0.1-mm path length cuvette, with a step size of 0.2 nm, a scan speed of 100 nm/min, a response time of 2.0 s, and a bandwidth of 2 nm. Near-UV spectra were collected in 1.0-cm cells using 500 μm MlcB and the same scanning parameters. The far- and near-UV spectra reported represent the average of 15 and 32 scans, respectively, with background signal from the buffer subtracted. Secondary structure prediction based on the far-UV CD spectra was performed using the CDNN 2.1 neural network program (18Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Fluorescence experiments with 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonic acid (ANS; Sigma) were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrometer at room temperature using 30 μm MlcB and 70 μm ANS. Excitation was at 388 nm, and fluorescence emission was monitored between 400 and 600 nm. Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms of MlcB were prepared for CD experiments by dialysis against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing either 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2. For the fluorescence experiments the buffers contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl and either 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA or 2mm CaCl2. NMR Spectroscopy—1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of 0.37 mm uniformly N-labeled MlcB were recorded on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a pulse field gradient triple resonance cryoprobe at 25 °C. The experiments used the enhanced sensitivity pulsed-field gradient approach (19Kay L.E. Keiffer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2408) Google Scholar) and comprised a 1024 × 128 real data matrix, which were zero-filled once in each dimension. The proton chemical shifts were referenced to 0.0 ppm using the trimethylsilyl resonance of the DSS signal in the one-dimensional spectrum. Initial buffer conditions were 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm NaCl, 90% H2O/10% D2O. Incremental additions of a 500 mm CaCl2 stock solution were made to a final calcium concentration of 3.7 mm. Spectra were collected after each addition and processed and analyzed using NMRPipe (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11280) Google Scholar) and NMRview (21Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-1 instrument equipped with an AN 60-Ti rotor. Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound MlcB were prepared by dialysis against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl containing either 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at MlcB concentration of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/ml and at rotor speeds of 22,000, 25,000, and 28,000 rpm. Data were collected at 280 nm and molecular masses calculated using the Beckman XL-1 data analysis software. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at MlcB concentrations of 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 mg/ml and a rotor speed of 55,000 rpm. Between 200 and 250 scans were taken for each experiment. Data were analyzed using the SEDFIT program. Actin-activated Mg2+ -ATPase Assays—To purify MyoB-S332E-ΔTail, cells were lysed in 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1.5 h to induce formation of an actin-myosin rigor complex (22Manstein D.J. Hunt D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The cytoskeleton was collected by centrifugation and washed twice. ATP (10 mm) was then added to release the MyoB-S332E-ΔTail. Following centrifugation the supernatant was loaded onto an anti-FLAG M2 agarose affinity column and MyoB-S332E-ΔTail eluted using 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. ATPase activities were measured by the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described (23Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11776-11782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Actin prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (24Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the assays at a concentration of 30 μm. Reactions were supplemented with recombinant MlcB to ensure that the MyoB necks were fully occupied by the light chain. SDS-PAGE Analysis of MyoB—MyoB and MyoD were purified from Dictyostelium using established methods and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown previously, MyoD consists of a 125-kDa heavy chain and a 16-kDa light chain (Fig. 1A) (14De La Roche M.A. Lee S.F. Cote G.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 697-705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no band with a molecular mass in the range corresponding to that of known myosin light chains (16–30 kDa) was detected in preparations of MyoB (Fig. 1, B and C). MyoB was not denatured or inactive, since it displayed good levels of K+EDTA ATPase activity and bound to actin filaments in an ATP-dependent manner (15Lee S.-F. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20923-20929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On closer examination the MyoB preparations were seen to contain a weakly staining band that electrophoresed ahead of the dye front on an 8% SDS gel and close to the 9-kDa molecular size marker on a 20% SDS gel (Fig. 1, B and C). These results raised the possibility that MyoB contains a low molecular mass light chain. Identification of a Putative MyoB Light Chain by Sequence Analysis of Tryptic Peptides—In an attempt to obtain sequence information for the putative MyoB light chain, MyoB was digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Eight peptides that appeared to be well resolved from neighboring peptides were chosen for automated Edman sequence analysis (Fig. 2). Five peptides yielded amino acid sequences from the MyoB heavy chain, two peptides provided ambiguous sequences, and one peptide (number 8) yielded an amino acid sequence (DGLPMTEAEITEFFEAADPNNTGF) that was not present in the MyoB heavy chain. The initial yield of peptide number 8 was 140 pmol, which was within the range of initial yields (70–520 pmol) obtained for the five peptides that were derived from the MyoB heavy chain. Peptide number 8 is therefore not derived from a minor protein contaminant of the MyoB preparation but must originate from a protein that is present in molar amounts roughly equivalent to the MyoB heavy chain. A search of the Dictyostelium sequence data base (www.dictybase.org) with the sequence of peptide number 8 revealed an exact match to a single protein (DDB0188713) that is 73 amino acids in length and has a calculated molecular mass of 8,296 Da (Fig. 3A). The size of this protein is consistent with the presence of a small light chain associated with MyoB. We have named this previously uncharacterized protein MlcB, for myosin light chain B. The sequence of MlcB was confirmed by analysis of reverse transcription PCR products prepared using RNA isolated from growth-phase Dictyostelium as a template. The Dictyostelium genome sequence shows that the mlcB gene is located on chromosome 5 and is interrupted by two introns. Exon 1 encodes the N-terminal methionine, exon 2 encodes residues 2–42, and exon 3 encodes the remainder of the protein. MlcB Contains Two Putative EF-hand Motifs—MlcB is a highly acidic protein (pI = 3.53) containing 17 aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues and only 4 arginine and lysine residues. Analysis of the MlcB sequence shows the presence of two putative helix-loop-helix EF-hand motifs (Fig. 3A). The classical EF-hand motif is a linear sequence of about 36 amino acids composed of two α-helices surrounding a 12-residue Ca2+-binding loop. Within the 12-residue loop segment the residues at positions 1, 3, and 5 coordinate Ca2+ directly by side chain carboxylate oxygen atoms, the residue at position 7 coordinates Ca2+ via its backbone carbonyl oxygen atom, the residue at position 9 hydrogen bonds to a water molecule that provides a Ca2+ ligand, and the residue at position 12, which is almost always glutamic acid, ligates Ca2+ via both side-chain carboxylate oxygens (25Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 26Marsden B.J. Shaw G.S. Sykes B.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The loop region of the N-terminal EF-hand of MlcB has a sequence that conforms exactly to the consensus Ca2+-binding sequence, whereas the second EF-hand has an alanine residue (Ala-62) at the 12 position (Fig. 3A). The substitution of alanine for glutamic acid at this critical Ca2+-ligating position puts the functionality of the second EF-hand into question. BLAST searches show that MlcB shares a considerable degree of amino acid sequence similarity to members of the CaM branch of the EF-hand protein superfamily (Fig. 3B). MlcB exhibits ∼30% sequence identity with the N-terminal half of the Dictyostelium myosin II ELC, the C-terminal half of MlcD, and both the N- and C-terminal halves of Dictyostelium CaM. However, the two proteins with the most sequence identity to MlcB both have two EF-hands: a 76-residue-long Entamoeba histolytica protein (GenBank™ accession number EAL49262) (44% sequence identity) and an 80-residue-long Dictyostelium protein (dictyBase number DDB0219456) (37% sequence identity). Neither of these small proteins has been characterized or has a known function. Human calbrain, another small two-EF-hand protein, exhibits ∼30% sequence identity to MlcB (27Yamaguchi K. Yamaguchi F. Miyamoto O. Sugimoto K. Konishi R. Hatase O. Tokuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3610-3616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MlcB shares only a small degree of sequence identity (10–14%) with small, two-EF-hand proteins that do not belong to the CaM family, such as S100A2 and calbindin D(9k). The close relationship between MlcB and the subgroup of EF-hand proteins that function as myosin light chains further supports the view that MlcB is a MyoB light chain. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-MlcB with MyoB—To obtain additional evidence for the association of MlcB with MyoB, a construct encoding MlcB with an N-terminal FLAG tag was transfected into Dictyostelium. Cells were selected for growth in the presence of G418 and examined for the expression of FLAG-MlcB by immunoblot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody. A single band with a size close to that expected for FLAG-MlcB (∼8 kDa) was detected using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4A). The overexpression of FLAG-MlcB did not have a noticeable effect on the growth rates of cells in suspension or on surfaces, the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, or multicellular development (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-MlcB using anti-FLAG M2 antibody beads resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of the MyoB heavy chain but not the MyoC or MyoD heavy chains (Fig. 4B). This result confirms that MlcB is bound to MyoB and further reveals that MlcB is not a light chain for the closely related long tailed myosin I isoforms MyoC or MyoD. Purification and Ca2+-binding Properties of Recombinant MlcB— MlcB was purified from E. coli as a His-tagged protein. His-MlcB is 93 residues in length, has a calculated mass of 10.4 kDa, and electrophoresed on a 20% SDS gel with an apparent size of ∼9 kDa (Fig. 5A). For some studies, the N-terminal His-tag was removed from MlcB by thrombin cleavage, yielding a 76-residue-long protein with a calculated mass of 8.6 kDa (Fig. 5B). After removal of the His-tag, recombinant MlcB exhibited a mobility on SDS gels very similar to that of the light chain observed in preparations of MyoB (compare Figs. 5B and 1C). MlcB electrophoresed as a fairly diffuse band on 20% SDS gels, which in part may explain the difficulty in detecting the light chain in preparations of MyoB. ITC experiments showed that MlcB bound Ca2+ in an exothermic reaction, with an enthalpy change (ΔH) of –7.7 kcal/mol of injectant (Fig. 5C). A one-site model yielded an excellent fit to the Ca2+ binding data with a Kd of 0.2 ± 0.06 μm. To test whether Ca2+ binding is mediated by the first EF-hand, the aspartic acid at position 1 of the first EF-hand (Asp-16) was mutated to alanine (Fig. 5A). ITC experiments showed that MlcB-D16A was unable to bind Ca2+ (Fig. 5C). These results show that a functional N-terminal EF-hand is essential for MlcB to bind Ca2+ with high affinity. MlcB Undergoes a Conformational Change upon Binding Ca2+—The effect of Ca2+ on the secondary structure of MlcB was investigated using far-UV CD spectroscopy. In the absence of Ca2+ the far-UV CD spectrum of MlcB exhibited a large positive peak of ellipticity at 196 nm and large negative peaks of ellipticity near 208 and 222 nm, typical of proteins that have a significant amount of α-helical secondary structure (Fig. 6A). In the presence of Ca2+ the intensity of each of the 196, 208, and 222 nm bands increased, suggesting the formation of additional α-helical structure. Analysis of the spectra using the neural net program CDNN showed that upon addition of Ca2+ the α-helical content of MlcB increased from 29 to 42% and the random coil content decreased from 36 to 27%. MlcB contains no tryptophan residues but has 8 phenylalanine and 4 tyrosine residues. The CD spectrum in the 250–270 nm and 270–290 nm range can provide information on the chirality of the phenylalanine and tyrosine side chains, respectively. The near-UV CD signal of MlcB in the absence of Ca2+ shows a strong positive signal from 275 to 290 nm that is converted in the presence of Ca2+ to a broad slightly negative signal (Fig. 6B). This result shows that the packing around the tyrosine side chains is disrupted in the presence of Ca2+, which may indicate that the tyrosine residues adopt a more surface-exposed, flexi"

Their primary function is to degrade hyaluronan and certain other glycosaminoglycans and facilitate the spread of disease. Among hyaluronate lyases, the bacteriophage-associated enzymes are unique as they have the lowest molecular mass, very low amino acid sequence homology with bacterial hyaluronate lyases, and exhibit absolute specificity for one type of glycosaminoglycan, i.e. hyaluronan. Despite such unique characteristics significant details on structural features of these lyases are not available. The Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage 10403 contains a gene, hylP2, which encodes for hyaluronate lyase (HylP2) in this organism. HylP2 was cloned, overexpressed, and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant HylP2 exists as a homotrimer of molecular mass about 110 kDa, under physiological conditions. Limited proteolysis and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies demonstrated that the N-terminal region of the protein is flexible, whereas the C-terminal portion has a compact conformation. The enzyme shows sequential unfolding, with the N-terminal unfolding first followed by the simultaneous unfolding and dissociation of the stabilized trimeric C-terminal domain. We isolated a functionally active C-terminal fragment (Ser128–Lys337) of the protein that was stabilized in a trimeric configuration. Comparative functional studies with full-length protein, N:C complex, and isolated C-terminal domain demonstrated that the active site of HylP2 is present in the C-terminal portion of the enzyme, and the N-terminal portion modulates the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of the C-terminal domain.

Many pathogenic bacteria produce extracellular products that have tissue-damaging effects. Some of these products serve as virulent factors in the pathogenesis of disease by facilitating the spread of bacteria or toxins through tissues. They are commonly known as “spreading factors.” Hyaluronidase has long been proposed as a virulence factor, in particular a spreading factor. Hyaluronate lyase (EC 4.2.2.1 or EC 4.2.99.1) are hyaluronidases produced by bacteria, which are capable of degrading glycan structures, mainly polymeric hyaluronan (HA) 3The abbreviations used are: HA, polymeric hyaluronan; SpnHL, Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase; SagHL, Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; CS, chondroitin sulfate; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride.

There are two possible functions of the degradation of HA by hyaluronate lyase in the biology of the organism in which it is present. First being the enhancement of invasion and spread of organism during infection by destruction of the extracellular matrix. Apart from degradation of HA, hyaluronate lyases have been demonstrated to possess a nutritional role in group A streptococci, where they permit the organism to utilize host HA as an energy source (3Lui G.Y. Nizet V. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Linhardt R.J. Galliher P.M. Cooney C.L. Appl. Biochem.

Both of these functions are important during pathogenesis of different diseases caused by the organism. Hyaluronate lyases show different specificities for the polysaccharide substrate. The Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronate lyase specifically cleaves HA endolytically, producing un-saturated hexa- and tetrasaccharides. Whereas, the hyaluronate lyase isolated from group A streptococci or group B streptococci besides cleaving HA also show weak but significant activities toward chondroitin and/or chondroitin 4/6-sulfate. Among the hyaluronate lyases, the most studied ones are those secreted by strains of group B streptococci and belong to the class of glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes (3Lui G.Y. Nizet V. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1794-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The group B streptococci hyaluronate lyases do not exhibit absolute specificity for one kind of glycosaminoglycan as both HA and certain chondroitin sulfates (CS) are cleaved by these enzymes. Structurally, the group B streptococci hyaluronate lyases are monomeric enzymes with their N-terminal domain being the catalytic domain. The group A streptococci produce a number of different hyaluronidases that include a chromosomally encoded hyaluronate lyase (6Hynes W.L. Hancock L. Ferretti J.J. Infect.

Among the hyaluronidases of group A streptococci, most of the available information is on the phage-specific hyaluronidases (6Hynes W.L. Hancock L. Ferretti J.J. Infect.

Unlike most bacterial hyaluronidases, which act nonspecifically on both HA and CS, the phage enzyme specifically cleaves HA (13Baker J.R. Dong S. Pritchard D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A wide variation is observed in the molecular mass of the hyaluronate lyases from different strains of bacteria. Whereas the molecular mass of bacterial hyaluronate lyase ranges between 90 and 120 kDa; the streptococcal bacteriophage hyaluronate lyases have the smallest molecular mass, ranging from 36 to 40 kDa (6Hynes W.L. Hancock L. Ferretti J.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3015-3020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure and functional details of several bacterial hyaluronate lyases are available (15Ponnuraj K. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Songlin L. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36678-36688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), however, structure and functional information of only one bacteriophage, HylP1, has very recently been reported (18Smith N.L. Taylor E.J. Lindsay A.M. Charnock S.J. Turkenburg J.P. Dondson E.J. Davies G.J. Black G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17652-17657Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The bacterial hyaluronidases are monomeric molecules containing two relatively large sized structural domains (about 40 kDa or more), whereas the bacteriophage hyaluronate lyases are oligomeric. It will be interesting to study the detailed structural and functional properties of the bacteriophage-associated enzyme, which corresponds to only half the molecular mass (i.e. about one structural domain) of the bacterial hyaluronate lyases. Bacteriophages from two species of streptococci, Streptococcus pyogenes (6Hynes W.L. Hancock L. Ferretti J.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3015-3020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Marciel A.M. Kapur V. Musser J.M. Microb. Pathog. 1997; 22: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Streptococcus equi (19Harrington D.J. Sutcliffe I.C. Chanter N. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), encode for hyaluronidase. The bacteriophage hyaluronidases have been shown to be hyaluronate lyase, like the chromosomally encoded enzyme (13Baker J.R. Dong S. Pritchard D.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Absence of an N-terminal signal peptide in the bacteriophage hyaluronidase genes indicates that the bacterial cell (6Hynes W.L. Hancock L. Ferretti J.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3015-3020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hynes W.L. Ferretti J.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 57: 533-539Crossref Google Scholar) does not actively secrete these gene products. Hence, their likely function could be to degrade HA of the streptococcal capsule and allow the phage access to the cell surface, so that it can infect the encapsulated cells (20Maxted W.R. Nature. 1952; 170: 1020-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Kjems E. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1958; 42: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hyaluronate lyase genes found in the bacteriophage genomes show a high degree of similarity to each other with one major difference being the deletion (or addition) of a 102-bp fragment that consists of a region that encodes a collagen-like motif, Gly-X-Y repeating units (6Hynes W.L. Hancock L. Ferretti J.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3015-3020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Maxted W.R. Nature. 1952; 170: 1020-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on this difference, they have been grouped into two types: the hylP-type, which contains a collagen-like repeat sequence and the hylP2-type, which lacks this repeat sequence. Based on the presence of collagen-like domain, it has been speculated that the HylP-type proteins might be stabilized as a triple helical structure (23Stern M. Stern R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 1179-1180PubMed Google Scholar). Recently reported three-dimensional structural hyaluronate lyase, hylP1, obtained from S. pyogenes revealed an unusual triple-stranded β-helical structure for this protein (18Smith N.L. Taylor E.J. Lindsay A.M. Charnock S.J. Turkenburg J.P. Dondson E.J. Davies G.J. Black G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17652-17657Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For hylP2-type hyaluronidases, no other report except for the gene sequence is available. For gaining insight into the structural properties of the bacteriophage-associated hyaluronate lyases, we carried out cloning and overexpression of the hylP2 gene from S. pyogenes bacteriophage 10403. The overexpressed protein was purified to homogeneity and its structural and functional properties were studied in detail. For understanding the role of the structural domains in modulating the functional activity and in stabilization of the oligomeric structure of the protein, studies on the isolated C-terminal domain of HylP2 were also carried out. Strains and Plasmids—Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used during the cloning of the gene. pET21d(+) vector (Novagen) and BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were used for expression of the HylP2 protein. Cloning of HylP2—Plasmid pUC18 containing the hylP2 gene (1.030 kb) was used as template. An internal gene fragment of S. pyogenes bacteriophage 10403 encoding functional hylP2 (GenBank® accession number U28144) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. PCR was performed with primers (forward, 5′-CTAGCTAGCATGACTGAAAATATACCATTAAGAGTCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTTTTTTAGTAGGAGTTTTTTTAACTCAGA-3′) with the C-terminal His6 tag hylP2 and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTATTTTTTTAGTATGAGTTTTTTTAAC-3′ without histidine-tagged hylP2, with NheI and XhoI sites (as underlined). PCR conditions used were: 1 time at 94 °C for 5 min; 30 times at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min; and 1 time at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified fragments were cloned in pET21d(+) vector (Novagen) between NheI and XhoI sites. DNA sequencing confirmed the homogeneity of the sequence. The resultant constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for checking the expression. Overexpression of HylP2—A single colony from the BL21(DE3) plate was inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth (Hi-media) having ampicillin at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and allowed to grow overnight at 30 °C. It was then subcultured in 400 ml of LB broth containing a similar ampicillin concentration and allowed to grow at 30 °C until A600 of 0.6 was achieved. The culture was then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated further at 20 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested at 8000 × g for 10 min and the resultant pellet was then stored at –70 °C until further use. Purification of HylP2—The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.0), disrupted using a probe-type ultrasonicator, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The supernatant was loaded onto a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was initially washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer and subsequently with the same buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 200–500 mm NaCl and fractions obtained were tested for the required protein by enzymatic assay and SDS-PAGE. The purity of the enzyme as checked by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS was found to be about 95%. Histidine-tagged HylP2 was purified by resuspending the cell pellet in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 300 mm sodium chloride, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.5). Cells were disrupted using a probe-type ultrasonicator. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant obtained was applied on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was initially washed with lysis buffer and subsequently with the same buffer containing 50 and 100 mm imidazole, respectively. The protein was eluted using 300 mm imidazole in the lysis buffer. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and finally purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 column on AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 150 mm sodium sulfate, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.0). The eluted protein was tested for purity by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS and was found to be about 95% pure. A similar enzymatic activity and proteolytic pattern with α-chymotrypsin was observed for both the histidine-tagged and nonhistidine-tagged protein. Hence, because of ease in purification and advantage of characterizing the C-terminal domain of the protein, histidine-tagged protein was used for studies dealing with the isolated C-terminal domain. Size-exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—Gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 column (manufacturer's exclusion limit 600 kDa) with AKTA fast performance liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The column was calibrated with various molecular weight standard markers (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated and run with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm sodium sulfate (pH 7.0). For GdnHCl-treated protein samples the column was equilibrated and run with the above mentioned buffer containing the desired concentration of GdnHCl. 200 μl of the sample was loaded on the column and run at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, with detection at 280 nm. Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorimeter in a 5-mm path length quartz cell at 25 °C. Excitation wavelength of 290 nm was used and the spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. Protein concentration of 1 μm was used for the studies. Circular Dichroism Measurements—CD measurements were made with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter calibrated with ammonium (+)-10-camphorsulfonate. The results are expressed as mean residual ellipticity [θ], which is defined as [θ] = 100 × θobs/(lc), where θobs is the observed ellipticity in degree, c is the concentration in moles of residue/liter, and l is the length of the light path in centimeters. The values obtained were normalized by subtracting the baseline recorded for the buffer having the same concentration of the denaturant under similar conditions. 3 μm protein was used for the studies. Limited Proteolysis— 0.2 mg/ml protein was subjected to limited proteolysis with α-chymotrypsin, at a protease to protein ratio of 1:500 and 1:1 (w/w), for 1 and 5 h, respectively, at 30 °C. The protease reaction was stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm in the reaction mixture, and the samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE. Cross-linking Using Glutaraldehyde—The native protein or the C-terminal domain, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, was used for cross-linking studies. The cross-linking of protein samples was carried out with 1% glutaraldehyde as described earlier (24Chaturvedi S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40793-40805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the cross-linked products were determined by 10% SDS-PAGE. Assay of Enzymatic Activity—The activity of the enzyme was determined by measuring its ability to breakdown HA or CS to unsaturated disaccharide units (25Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25509-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In 1 ml of solution of 0.3 mg/ml HA (or mentioned otherwise), 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 15 mm CaCl2 (pH 6.0), and 1.5 or 3 μg of enzyme sample (diluted just before taking measurement) were added. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min during which the measurements were carried out by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm at 25 °C. For kinetic measurements, varying concentrations of HA/CS between 0.012 and 0.5 mg/ml were used. Protein concentrations of 1.5 and 3 μg for full-length protein and protease-treated protein samples, respectively, were taken. The kinetic parameters were calculated using extinction coefficient of 5.5 × 10–3 m–1 for the disaccharide products. ESI-MS—The mass spectra were recorded on a MICRO-MASS QUATTRO II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altricem, United Kingdom) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source as described earlier (26Ali V. Prakash K. Kulkarni S. Ahmed A. Madhusudan K.P. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13635-13642Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification—The expression of recombinant HylP2 was good and the expressed protein was present predominantly (>90%) in the soluble fraction. The protein present in the soluble fraction was purified by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” The yield of the purified recombinant HylP2 was in the range of 8–10 mg/liter. The purified protein was homogeneous as indicated by a single protein band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and a single peak in ESI-MS (data not shown). Molecular Weight and Subunit Structure—The molecular mass of the purified recombinant HylP2 was determined under non-dissociating conditions by SEC (27Andrews P. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 569-606Crossref Scopus (2430) Google Scholar). Gel filtration of the recombinant protein on the Superdex S-200 column calibrated with the various molecular weight standards showed a single peak with a retention volume of 13.07 ml (Fig. 1B). When the elution volumes of the marker proteins were plotted as a function of log of molecular mass, HylP2 was found to have a molecular mass of about 110 kDa. Similar molecular mass was also obtained from the SDS-PAGE analysis of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked HylP2 at pH 7.0 (Fig. 1, B and C). The calculated molecular mass (from primary amino acid sequence) of 37.2 kDa for the HylP2 corroborated well with the molecular mass of about 36.0 and 36.9 kDa observed from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A) and ESI-MS experiments (data not shown), respectively. The results of the subunit mass (as determined by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS) along with SEC and glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies demonstrate that HylP2 of the S. pyogenes bacteriophage exists as a homotrimer under physiological conditions. Structural Features of HylP2—Studies on the model polypeptides and proteins revealed that the α-helical and β-sheet proteins show characteristic far-UV CD spectra. The α-helical proteins have two minima at 222 and 208 nm and the β-sheet proteins have a single minimum at 216 nm (28Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). For HylP2 protein, the far-UV CD spectrum characteristic of a protein having both α-helix and β-sheet secondary structures was observed (Fig. 2A). Hence, HylP2 is a αβ-protein. The fluorescence spectrum of HylP2 is shown in Fig. 2B. The emission wavelength maximum of the tryptophan fluorescence for the recombinant protein was observed at about 326 nm. The buried tryptophan residues in the folded protein show fluorescence emission maxima at 330–335 nm (29Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, in the HylP2 protein the tryptophan molecule is buried in the hydrophobic environment. According to the primary amino acid sequence, HylP2 has a single tryptophan residue at position 19 (23Stern M. Stern R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 1179-1180PubMed Google Scholar). So the presence of the buried tryptophan residue in native protein suggests that the N-terminal region of HylP2 be in folded conformation. The HylP2 Undergoes Sequential Unfolding—The unfolding characteristic of HylP2 was studied by monitoring the GdnHCl-induced changes in the structural properties of HylP2. Time-dependent changes in the structural parameters of HylP2 at increasing GdnHCl concentrations (0.5, 1, and 4 m) were monitored to standardize the incubation time required to achieve equilibrium under these conditions. Under all the conditions studied, the changes occurred within a maximum of 3 h with no further alterations in the values obtained up to 12 h (data not shown). These observations suggested that a minimum time of about 3 h is sufficient for achieving equilibrium under any of the denaturing conditions studied. To study the GdnHCl-induced changes in the secondary structure of the HylP2 protein, far-UV CD studies were carried out. Fig. 3A summarizes the effect of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl on the CD ellipticity at 216 nm of the HylP2 protein. A biphasic loss of CD signal was observed between 0.25 and 4 m GdnHCl. An initial sharp decrease of about 55% in the CD signal was observed between 0.25 and 1.0 m GdnHCl. This was followed by a further gradual sigmoidal decrease in CD signal from about 55 to 0% between 1.25 and 4 m GdnHCl. A similar unfolding profile was observed when the changes in CD ellipticity at 222 nm were monitored. The above presented results suggested that GdnHCl-induced unfolding of the HylP2 protein is non-cooperative and occurs in two steps. Fig. 3B summarizes the changes in tryptophan emission wavelength maxima of the HylP2 protein on incubation with increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. On increasing the GdnHCl concentration between 0.20 and 1.0 m GdnHCl, a sigmoidal shift in emission wavelength maxima from 326 to 353 nm was observed (Fig. 3B), indicating the GdnHCl-induced unfolding of protein at about 1 m GdnHCl. Interestingly, the GdnHCl-induced unfolding observed by monitoring of the tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3B) coincides with the first transition (between 0.20 and 1.0 m GdnHCl) as observed from far-UV CD studies (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that it corresponds to only the partial unfolding; probably the unfolding of the N-terminal portion of the protein molecule. The second transition observed in far-UV CD studies at higher GdnHCl concentrations corresponds primarily to the unfolding of the C-terminal domain (discussed in detail later). To study the effect of unfolding of the N-terminal region on the quaternary structure of the protein, SEC and glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies were carried out on the 1.0 m GdnHCl-stabilized partially folded intermediate of HylP2 (Fig. 3C). A retention volume of 12.4 ml was observed for 1.0 m GdnHCl-treated HylP2, which is slightly less than the retention volume of 13.07 ml as observed for the native protein. This indicated that perhaps the GdnHCl-stabilized intermediate of HylP2 is in a trimeric configuration but with slightly larger hydrodynamic radii than the native protein. This can be attributed to the fact that the N-terminal portion of enzyme is unfolded under these conditions. The trimeric configuration of the 1.0 m GdnHCl-stabilized partially folded intermediate of HylP2 was confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies. Fig. 3C, inset, shows the comparative SDS-PAGE profile of the glutaraldehyde cross-linked native protein and the 1.0 m GdnHCl-treated HylP2. For both samples, molecular mass of about 110 kDa was observed, thus confirming that both the native protein and the 1.0 m GdnHCl-treated HylP2 are stabilized as trimers. Identification, Purification, and Characterization of a Compact C-terminal Domain of HylP2—The factors determining the vulnerability of a protein for proteolysis by protease depends on the conformational parameters such as accessibility, segmental motion, and protrusions. For this reason limited proteolysis has been effectively used to monitor structural domains in proteins, ligand-induced conformational changes, and protein folding/unfolding (30Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 summarizes the SDS-PAGE profile of the protein fragments obtained on limited proteolysis of the recombinant HylP2 with α-chymotrypsin. Two different patterns of proteolysis, depending on the protein to protease ratio used, were observed (Fig. 4, A and B). At a protein to protease ratio of 500:1, two protein fragments, namely Fragment I and II, corresponding to molecular mass of about 24 and 14 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4A), were obtained. However, when the proteolysis was carried out at a protein to protease ratio of 1:1, only a single protein band corresponding to the molecular mass of about 24 kDa was obtained (Fig. 4B). The Fragment I, obtained at low and high protease concentrations (Fig. 4, A and B), showed affinity for the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose matrix and anti-His antibody on Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, A and B, inset) demonstrating that this fragment contains the C-terminal His6 moieties. Because, in the recombinant HylP2 protein, the histidine tag was present at the C terminus so these fragments correspond to the C-terminal portion of the protein. Furthermore, both fragments showed the N-terminal sequence SSSTG and molecular mass of 23.2 kDa (by ESI-MS), suggesting that they correspond to the same protein sequence of HylP2. The N-terminal sequence of SSSTG along with the presence of the C-terminal His6 moiety in Fragment I suggests that α-chymotrypsin cleaves HylP2 between amino acids Tyr126 and Ser127 during limited proteolysis. This results in release of a C-terminal domain corresponding to the amino acid sequence Ser127–Lys337 (calculated molecular mass of about 23.15 kDa) of native HylP2. Fragment II showed N-terminal sequence similar to that observed for the native protein and no affinity for the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose matrix and anti-His antibody on Western blot analysis demonstrating that this fragment contains the same N-terminal as the native protein and does not contain C-terminal His6 moieties. Hence, Fragment II corresponds to the N-terminal domain of HylP2. There are about 20 cleavage sites for α-chymotrypsin that are spread throughout the length of HylP2. However, on limited proteolysis, only a single large fragment corresponding to the C-terminal of the proteins was obtained. This suggests that the C-terminal domain of the protein is in a compact folded conformation because several of the proteolytic sites present in this domain are not accessible to protease for cleavage. As an intact C-terminal domain HylP2 was obtained on limited proteolysis of protein with α-chymotrypsin we tried to purify this fragment and study its quaternary structure. Fig. 5, A and B, shows the column profile of the proteolysed samples on the S-200 column. For the protein sample proteolysed at a protein:protease ratio of 500:1, no significant difference in the retention volume (about 13.2 ml) as compared with the native protein (13.03 ml) was observed. However, the SDS-PAGE analysis of the sample under the peak showed the presence of both Fragments I and II in the proteolysed samples (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the two fragments obtained on proteolysis under these conditions have a tendency to associate and as a result they elute as a single protein species in SEC but get separated in the SDS-PAGE. Hence, a single protein fragment of HylP2 could not be isolated from the protein sample proteolysed at a protein:protease ratio of 500:1. For the protein sample proteolysed at a protein:protease ratio of 1:1, only a single protein fragment, the C-terminal domain (as discussed above), was obtained. Interestingly, this isolated C-terminal domain showed a retention volume similar to the native protein trimer on SEC, suggesting that the two proteins have similar hydrodynamic radii. Such a high hydrodynamic radius for the C-terminal domain of molecular mass of about 24 kDa is possible only when it exists as a trimer. This was confirmed by the glutaraldehyde cross-linking studies where a molecular mass of about 70 kDa corresponding to the trimer of this truncated part of the full-length protein (Fig. 5C) was observed. These results demonstrate that the isolated C-terminal domain (Ser128–Lys337) of HylP2 is stabilized as a homotrimer under physiological conditions. GdnHCl-induced unfolding of the isolated C-terminal domain was performed to study whether it exists in a folded conformation or not. Fig. 3A shows the effect of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl on the CD ellipticity at 216 nm for the C-terminal domain of HylP2. A sigmoidal loss of CD signal was observed on increasing the GdnHCl concentration from 1 to 4 m. Comparison of the GdnHCl-induced unfolding of the C-terminal domain with that of the full-length protein shows that it corresponds mainly to the second transition observed at higher GdnHCl concentrations during unfolding of the full-length protein. These observations demonstrate that the isolated C-terminal domain exists in a folded conformation and is more stable than the N-terminal domain. The Active Site Is Present in the C-terminal Portion of HylP2—Hyaluronate lyases degrade HA and CS by cleaving the β1,4-glycosidic linkage between the glycan units of these substrates. The mechanism of this degradation process is based on the β-elimination and involves selective residues of a well defined catalytic site of these enzymes (31Shimada E. Matsumura G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The analysis of the x-ray structure of the co-crystals of HA with Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL) and Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase (SagHL) shows that the catalytic residues Asn, His, and Tyr are placed in a highly specific manner in the amino acid sequence of these proteins. There are 50 amino acid residues between Asn and His, whereas the His and Tyr residues are nine amino acid residues apart (Asn349 to Tyr408 and Asn429 to Tyr488 of SpnHL and SagHL, respectively, in the primary amino acid sequence). In the amino acid sequence of HylP2, a similar definite placement of these residues having 39 amino acid residues between Asn206 and His316 and 8 amino acid residues between His316 and Tyr322 is observed. The CLUSTALW alignment of several proteins show high homology with HylP2 on BLAST and also show that hyaluronidase activity was carried out. The interesting observation from the multiple sequence alignment was that placement of the above mentioned probable catalytic residues are conserved in the amino acid sequence of all these proteins (supplementary Fig. 1). This further supports the contention that these may be the catalytic residues in these proteins. The presence of the probable catalytic residues in the C-terminal portion of HylP2 authenticates the view that probably the C-terminal domain is the catalytic domain of the protein. Furthermore, as the isolated C-terminal domain of HylP2 is stabilized as trimer like the full-length protein we thought it worthwhile to see whether this domain does possess functional activity or not. Different hyaluronate lyases have different specificity for their polysaccharide substrates. The phage H4489A and S. hyalurolyticus hyaluronate lyases have strict specificity for HA, not cleaving chondroitins of any kind (29Lackowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar, 30Hubbard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), whereas SpnHL and SagHL not only processes HA but certain CS also (33Rigden D.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50596-50606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To study the kinetic properties of enzymatic reaction as well as substrate specificity, a comparative analysis of the kinetic properties of the full-length protein, the N:C complex, and the isolated C-terminal domain using HA and CS as substrates were carried out and summarized in Fig. 6. Native HylP2 and the N:C complex obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 6, A and B) with Km values as for degradation of the HA substrate, calculated from the curve, being 0.31 ± 0.02 and 0.23 ± 0.02 mg/ml for the native HylP2 protein and the N:C complex, respectively. However, both proteins showed no activity with CS (Fig. 6, A and B). Studies on the kinetic properties of the isolated C-terminal domain with HA showed interesting results (Fig. 6C). The C-terminal domain at the low substrate concentration, up to 0.012 mg/ml, followed a profile similar to that of the native protein and N:C complex, however, on increasing the substrate concentration further, a drop in velocity was observed, indicating that the protein shows the property of “high substrate inhibition.” Furthermore, unlike the full-length protein and the N:C complex that exhibited absolute specificity for only one type of glucosaminoglycan, i.e. HA, the C-terminal domain showed a similar kinetic profile with both HA and CS. A possible explanation for the loss of substrate specificity observed for the isolated C-terminal domain is that the removal of the N-terminal domain probably results in stabilization of a conformation of protein having an enlarged substrate binding pocket. This large binding pocket besides accommodating the smaller substrate HA can also take in a bulkier substrate, like CS, which otherwise is unable to fit into the smaller binding pocket present in the full-length protein or the N:C complex of HylP2 and hence cannot be processed. Comparison of the enzymatic activity taking the HA concentration of 0.3 mg/ml for the full-length protein and the N:C complex and 0.012 mg/ml for the isolated C-terminal domain showed that the N:C complex and the isolated C-terminal domain have about 15% activity compared with the full-length protein. Calcium ions have been reported to activate hyaluronate lyase (34Pritchard D.G. Trent J.O. Zhang P. Egan M.L. Baker J.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effect of calcium ions on enzyme activity can be because of a direct effect either on the enzyme, on the HA substrate, or both. Fig. 7, A and B, summarizes the results of the effect of increasing calcium chloride concentrations on HA lyase activity of HylP2 and the isolated C-terminal domain. A maximum activation of about 2- and 1.7-fold was observed at about 15 and 20 mm CaCl2 concentration for native HylP2 and the isolated C-terminal domain, respectively. A similar activation of both the full-length protein and the isolated C-terminal domain of HylP2 was observed with magnesium ions also (Fig. 7, A and B). The dependence of pH on the enzymatic activity of the HylP2 protein and the isolated C-terminal domain was also studied between the pH range 2 and 10 and is summarized in Fig. 7C. For both samples, a bell-shaped curve centered at about pH 6 was observed suggesting that the native enzyme as well as the C-terminal domain works with maximum efficiency at about pH 6.0. At pH below 4 and above 10, a complete loss of activity was observed. The pH-dependent curves for both the native protein and isolated C-terminal domains were not absolutely symmetrical, which suggests that probably the substrate HA also undergoes pH-dependent structural change. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of HylP2 is the catalytic domain and can carry out the catalytic function on its own. However, specific interactions between N- and C-terminal domains seem to be required for achieving maximum activity and generating substrate specificity for the enzyme.

Therapeutic agents targeting the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP signaling pathway have successfully treated patients with ED; however, the efficacies of these treatments are significantly lower in specific populations such as patients with diabetes. The goal of this study was to discover and identify new endothelium-derived relaxing factors involved in the regulation of erectile function, providing alternative therapeutic targets for treatment of ED. Immunoblotting results showed that protein expressions of epoxygenases from cytochrome P450 (CYP)2B, 2C and 2J subfamilies, as well as NADPH CYP reductase were present in rat corpora cavernosa, which was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore, CYP2C was localized in cavernosal endothelial cells using double immunolabeling. CYP epoxygenase activity was analyzed by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography; and the results showed that 11,12- epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) was the major product metabolized by CYP epoxygenases in rat corpora cavernosa. Inhibition of EETs function by injection of an EETs antagonist into rat penis significantly decreased intracavernosal pressure-induced by electrical stimulation of the major pelvic ganglion in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggest that EETs, produced by CYP epoxygenases, in penile endothelial cells serve as vasodilators. Inhibition of this pathway attenuated erectile function, suggesting that EETs are required for normal erection."
