https://openalex.org/W2168180694,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase, controls cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors and is frequently deregulated in cancer. Here we report co-crystal structures of a complex of truncated mTOR and mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8) with an ATP transition state mimic and with ATP-site inhibitors. The structures reveal an intrinsically active kinase conformation, with catalytic residues and a catalytic mechanism remarkably similar to canonical protein kinases. The active site is highly recessed owing to the FKBP12–rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain and an inhibitory helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR-activating mutations map to the structural framework that holds these elements in place, indicating that the kinase is controlled by restricted access. In vitro biochemistry shows that the FRB domain acts as a gatekeeper, with its rapamycin-binding site interacting with substrates to grant them access to the restricted active site. Rapamycin–FKBP12 inhibits the kinase by directly blocking substrate recruitment and by further restricting active-site access. The structures also reveal active-site residues and conformational changes that underlie inhibitor potency and specificity. Co-crystal structures of a number of complexes involving truncated mammalian target of rapamycin, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase, reveal an intrinsically active kinase conformation and show how rapamycin–FKBP12 directly blocks substrate recruitment to the kinase domain. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway is a central regulator of cell growth in response to environmental signals such as energy, nutrients and growth factors, and is misregulated in cancer and metabolic diseases. Here the first crystal structures of the mTOR kinase are presented. The 3.2 Å crystal structures of the enzyme bound to a positive regulator and to small-molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors reveal an intrinsically active kinase, and explain how the rapamycin–FKBP12 complex blocks recruitment of substrates to the kinase domain."
https://openalex.org/W2098009444,"Ageing is a result of gradual and overall functional deteriorations across the body; however, it is unknown whether an individual tissue primarily works to mediate the ageing progress and control lifespan. Here we show that the hypothalamus is important for the development of whole-body ageing in mice, and that the underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated by IκB kinase-β (IKK-β), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and related microglia-neuron immune crosstalk. Several interventional models were developed showing that ageing retardation and lifespan extension are achieved in mice by preventing ageing-related hypothalamic or brain IKK-β and NF-κB activation. Mechanistic studies further revealed that IKK-β and NF-κB inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to mediate ageing-related hypothalamic GnRH decline, and GnRH treatment amends ageing-impaired neurogenesis and decelerates ageing. In conclusion, the hypothalamus has a programmatic role in ageing development via immune-neuroendocrine integration, and immune inhibition or GnRH restoration in the hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies for optimizing lifespan and combating ageing-related health problems."
https://openalex.org/W2036833206,"The smoothened (SMO) receptor, a key signal transducer in the hedgehog signalling pathway, is responsible for the maintenance of normal embryonic development and is implicated in carcinogenesis. It is classified as a class frizzled (class F) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), although the canonical hedgehog signalling pathway involves the GLI transcription factors and the sequence similarity with class A GPCRs is less than 10%. Here we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane domain of the human SMO receptor bound to the small-molecule antagonist LY2940680 at 2.5 Å resolution. Although the SMO receptor shares the seven-transmembrane helical fold, most of the conserved motifs for class A GPCRs are absent, and the structure reveals an unusually complex arrangement of long extracellular loops stabilized by four disulphide bonds. The ligand binds at the extracellular end of the seven-transmembrane-helix bundle and forms extensive contacts with the loops."
https://openalex.org/W2037894162,"There is a pressing need to develop alternatives to annual influenza vaccines and antiviral agents licensed for mitigating influenza infection. Previous studies reported that acute lung injury caused by chemical or microbial insults is secondary to the generation of host-derived, oxidized phospholipid that potently stimulates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent inflammation. Subsequently, we reported that Tlr4(-/-) mice are highly refractory to influenza-induced lethality, and proposed that therapeutic antagonism of TLR4 signalling would protect against influenza-induced acute lung injury. Here we report that therapeutic administration of Eritoran (also known as E5564)-a potent, well-tolerated, synthetic TLR4 antagonist-blocks influenza-induced lethality in mice, as well as lung pathology, clinical symptoms, cytokine and oxidized phospholipid expression, and decreases viral titres. CD14 and TLR2 are also required for Eritoran-mediated protection, and CD14 directly binds Eritoran and inhibits ligand binding to MD2. Thus, Eritoran blockade of TLR signalling represents a novel therapeutic approach for inflammation associated with influenza, and possibly other infections."
https://openalex.org/W2137084098,"Epidermal growth factor receptor, the product of a human oncogene, suppresses the maturation of specific tumour-suppressor-like microRNAs in response to hypoxic stress through phosphorylation of argonaute 2. MicroRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression occurs during response to stresses such as hypoxia, a condition found in the centre of a solid tumour. Mien-Chie Hung and colleagues show that the oncogene product EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) phosphorylates argonaute 2 (AGO2), a critical factor in the biogenesis of microRNAs, and that this process is enhanced by hypoxia. This modification of AGO2 impairs microRNA processing, but promotes cell survival and invasiveness. Breast cancer patients with higher phospho-AGO2 content show a poorer outcome. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are generated by two-step processing to yield small RNAs that negatively regulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level1. Deregulation of miRNAs has been linked to diverse pathological processes, including cancer2,3. Recent studies have also implicated miRNAs in the regulation of cellular response to a spectrum of stresses4, such as hypoxia, which is frequently encountered in the poorly angiogenic core of a solid tumour5. However, the upstream regulators of miRNA biogenesis machineries remain obscure, raising the question of how tumour cells efficiently coordinate and impose specificity on miRNA expression and function in response to stresses. Here we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is the product of a well-characterized oncogene in human cancers, suppresses the maturation of specific tumour-suppressor-like miRNAs in response to hypoxic stress through phosphorylation of argonaute 2 (AGO2) at Tyr 393. The association between EGFR and AGO2 is enhanced by hypoxia, leading to elevated AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation, which in turn reduces the binding of Dicer to AGO2 and inhibits miRNA processing from precursor miRNAs to mature miRNAs. We also identify a long-loop structure in precursor miRNAs as a critical regulatory element in phospho-Y393-AGO2-mediated miRNA maturation. Furthermore, AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation mediates EGFR-enhanced cell survival and invasiveness under hypoxia, and correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of EGFR in miRNA maturation and demonstrates how EGFR is likely to function as a regulator of AGO2 through novel post-translational modification. These findings suggest that modulation of miRNA biogenesis is important for stress response in tumour cells and has potential clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2051781198,"In an auditory frequency discrimination task in rats, channelrhodopsin-2-mediated stimulation of corticostriatal neurons biases decisions in the direction predicted by the frequency tuning of the stimulated neurons, whereas archaerhodopsin-3-mediated inactivation biases decisions in the opposite direction. Many studies have established how sounds are represented in the auditory cortex, but the processes by which that coded information is transformed into action are less well understood. Petr Znamenskiy and Anthony Zador study one output of auditory cortex — the projections to the striatum — and explore the consequences of changing the activity of these neurons on rats' perceptions in an auditory task. Optogenetically manipulating neuronal activity biased decisions in a manner consistent with the properties of the stimulated neurons, implicating corticostriatal activity in sensorimotor transformations. As cortical areas corresponding to all sensory modalities project to the striatum, this work also has implications beyond the auditory system. The neural pathways by which information about the acoustic world reaches the auditory cortex are well characterized, but how auditory representations are transformed into motor commands is not known. Here we use a perceptual decision-making task in rats to study this transformation. We demonstrate the role of corticostriatal projection neurons in auditory decisions by manipulating the activity of these neurons in rats performing an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Targeted channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)1,2-mediated stimulation of corticostriatal neurons during the task biased decisions in the direction predicted by the frequency tuning of the stimulated neurons, whereas archaerhodopsin-3 (Arch)3-mediated inactivation biased decisions in the opposite direction. Striatal projections are widespread in cortex and may provide a general mechanism for the control of motor decisions by sensory cortex."

https://openalex.org/W2165941008,"In Arabidopsis, RNA-directed DNA methylation is a poorly understood gene silencing pathway in which small interfering RNAs generated by RNA polymerase IV (Pol-IV) target a DNA methyltransferase to its sites of action; here structural and genomic analyses demonstrate that SHH binds chromatin via repressive histone modifications and recruits Pol-IV to enable siRNA production. In Arabidopsis, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a poorly understood gene-silencing pathway in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated by an RNA polymerase, Pol-IV, target a DNA methyltransferase to its sites of action. Here, Steven Jacobsen and colleagues report that the homeodomain protein SHH1 binds chromatin via repressive histone modifications and recruits Pol-IV to promote siRNA production. SHH1 has a novel chromatin-binding module that functions as a dual lysine reader for both K4 and K9 of the histone H3 tail. This work identifies an early targeting step that may be a critical control point in epigenetic modification through DNA methylation. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that has critical roles in gene silencing, development and genome integrity. In Arabidopsis, DNA methylation is established by DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) and targeted by 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) through a pathway termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)1. This pathway requires two plant-specific RNA polymerases: Pol-IV, which functions to initiate siRNA biogenesis, and Pol-V, which functions to generate scaffold transcripts that recruit downstream RdDM factors1,2. To understand the mechanisms controlling Pol-IV targeting we investigated the function of SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1)3,4, a Pol-IV-interacting protein3. Here we show that SHH1 acts upstream in the RdDM pathway to enable siRNA production from a large subset of the most active RdDM targets, and that SHH1 is required for Pol-IV occupancy at these same loci. We also show that the SHH1 SAWADEE domain is a novel chromatin-binding module that adopts a unique tandem Tudor-like fold and functions as a dual lysine reader, probing for both unmethylated K4 and methylated K9 modifications on the histone 3 (H3) tail. Finally, we show that key residues within both lysine-binding pockets of SHH1 are required in vivo to maintain siRNA and DNA methylation levels as well as Pol-IV occupancy at RdDM targets, demonstrating a central role for methylated H3K9 binding in SHH1 function and providing the first insights into the mechanism of Pol-IV targeting. Given the parallels between methylation systems in plants and mammals1,5, a further understanding of this early targeting step may aid our ability to control the expression of endogenous and newly introduced genes, which has broad implications for agriculture and gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2078378216,"α-synuclein dysregulation is a critical aspect of Parkinson's disease pathology. Recent studies have observed that α-synuclein aggregates are cytotoxic to cells in culture and that this toxicity can be spread between cells. However, the molecular mechanisms governing this cytotoxicity and spread are poorly characterized. Recent studies of viruses and bacteria, which achieve their cytoplasmic entry by rupturing intracellular vesicles, have utilized the redistribution of galectin proteins as a tool to measure vesicle rupture by these organisms. Using this approach, we demonstrate that α-synuclein aggregates can induce the rupture of lysosomes following their endocytosis in neuronal cell lines. This rupture can be induced by the addition of α-synuclein aggregates directly into cells as well as by cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein. We also observe that lysosomal rupture by α-synuclein induces a cathepsin B dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in target cells. Finally, we observe that α-synuclein aggregates can induce inflammasome activation in THP-1 cells. Lysosomal rupture is known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, both of which are well established aspects of Parkinson's disease, thus connecting these aspects of Parkinson's disease to the propagation of α-synuclein pathology in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2019845283,"Genetic perturbation screens have the potential to dissect a wide range of cellular phenotypes. Such screens have historically been difficult in diploid mammalian cells. The recent derivation of haploid embryonic stem cells provides an opportunity to cause loss of function mutants with a random mutagen in a mammalian cell with a normal genetic background. We describe an approach to genetic screens that exploits the highly active piggyBac transposon in haploid mammalian cells. As an example of haploid transposon (HTP) screening, we apply this approach to identifying determinants of cancer drug toxicity and resistance. In a screen for 6-thioguanine resistance we recovered components of the DNA mismatch repair pathway, a known requirement for toxicity. In a further screen for resistance to the clinical poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib we recovered multiple Parp1 mutants. Our results show that olaparib toxicity to normal cells is mediated predominantly via Parp1, and suggest that the clinical side effects of olaparib may be on target. The transposon mutant libraries are stable and can be readily reused to screen other drugs. The screening protocol described has several advantages over other methods such as RNA interference: it is rapid and low cost, and mutations can be easily reverted to establish causality."
https://openalex.org/W1993588147,"Inflammation and infection of bovine mammary glands, commonly known as mastitis, imposes significant losses each year in the dairy industry worldwide. While several different bacterial species have been identified as causative agents of mastitis, many clinical mastitis cases remain culture negative, even after enrichment for bacterial growth. To understand the basis for this increasingly common phenomenon, the composition of bacterial communities from milk samples was analyzed using culture independent pyrosequencing of amplicons of 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rDNA). Comparisons were made of the microbial community composition of culture negative milk samples from mastitic quarters with that of non-mastitic quarters from the same animals. Genomic DNA from culture-negative clinical and healthy quarter sample pairs was isolated, and amplicon libraries were prepared using indexed primers specific to the V1–V2 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and sequenced using the Roche 454 GS FLX with titanium chemistry. Evaluation of the taxonomic composition of these samples revealed significant differences in the microbiota in milk from mastitic and healthy quarters. Statistical analysis identified seven bacterial genera that may be mainly responsible for the observed microbial community differences between mastitic and healthy quarters. Collectively, these results provide evidence that cases of culture negative mastitis can be associated with bacterial species that may be present below culture detection thresholds used here. The application of culture-independent bacterial community profiling represents a powerful approach to understand long-standing questions in animal health and disease."

This research was conducted in a facility approved by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and all experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch. Male Sprague-Dawley (Charles Rivers, Wilmington, MA) rats (400–500 grams) were anesthetized (4% isoflurane), incubated, mechanically ventilated with 1.5% isoflurane in O2:air (20:80) using a volume ventilator (NEMI Scientific, New England Medical Instruments, Medway, MA), and prepared for moderate or sham parasagittal fluid percussion injury as described previously (36Hawkins B.E.

Rectal and temporalis muscle temperatures were monitored using telethermometers (Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ), and temperatures were maintained within a range of 37.5 ± 0.5 °C using an overhead lamp and a thermostatically controlled water blanket (Gaymar, Orchard Park, NY). Rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, a midline incision of the skin was performed, and the skull was exposed. With the use of a Michele trephine, a craniotomy was performed 1 mm lateral (right) to the sagittal suture, midway between the lambda and bregma. The bone chip was removed, leaving the dura intact. A modified 20-gauge needle hub was secured in place over the exposed dura with cyanoacrylic adhesive and cemented into place with hygienic dental acrylic. TBI was administered by means of an fluid percussion injury device (38Dixon C.E. Lyeth B.G. Povlishock J.T. Findling R.L. Hamm R.J. Marmarou A. Young H.F. Hayes R.L. A fluid percussion model of experimental brain injury in the rat.J. Neurosurg. 1987; 67: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) consisting of a fluid-filled Plexiglas cylinder 60-cm-long and 4.5 cm in diameter, one end of which was connected to a hollow metal cylinder housing a pressure transducer (Statham PA856-100, Data Instruments, Acton, MA), with the other end closed by a Plexiglas piston mounted on O rings. The transducer housing was connected to the rat by a plenum tube at the craniotomy site. Each TBI was induced by dropping a 4.8-kg steel pendulum that struck the piston. The height of the pendulum determined the intensity of the injury. The fluid pressure pulse was recorded on an oscilloscope triggered photoelectrically by the descent of the pendulum. Four or 24 h after TBI or sham injury (n = 6 at each time point), rats were reanesthetized and transcardially perfused with chilled saline to remove blood, and then brains were collected and immediately frozen. For ELISA, plates were coated with 10 μl of the brain extract using 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, as coating buffer, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C, washing three times with Tris-buffered saline with low Tween (TBST; 0.01%), then blocked for 3 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The plates were then washed with TBST. Antibodies used include anti-Tau oligomer antibody T22 (1:500), Tau1 (clone PC1C6/MAB3420 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), GAPDH (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) AT8, and AT180 (1:1000; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST and were added and allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed three times with TBST and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000; GE Healthcare) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, plates were washed three times with TBST and developed with 3,3′,5,5′,-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB-1 component substrate) from DAKO (Carpinteria, CA). The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and samples were read at 450 nm using a POLARstar OMEGA plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Melbourne, Australia). Tissue samples were homogenized in 5% ice-cold protease inhibitor. 16 μl of each of the brain extracts were mixed with 4 μl of 4× sample buffer (without boiling) and were run on 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking overnight at 4 °C with 10% nonfat milk, membranes were probed for 1 h at room temperature with T22 antibody (1:200), Tau-1 (1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA), GAPDH antibody (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), AT8, or AT180 antibodies (1:1000; Thermo Scientific) diluted in 5% nonfat dried milk. For detection, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG (1:3000; GE Healthcare) and ECL plus (GE Healthcare) were used. Analysis was performed using Labworks software (version 4.5, UVP, Inc., Upland, CA). For protein quantification, the densitometry of each band in the Western blot was normalized with GAPDH. All densitometry results represent the mean and S.D. (n = 6). Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (21Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Castillo-Carranza D.L. Sengupta U.

Briefly, tosyl-activated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech, Lafayette Hill, PA) were coated with 20 μg of T22 antibody (1.0 mg/ml) diluted in 0.1 m borate, pH 9.5, overnight at 37 °C. Beads were washed (0.2 m Tris, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.5) and then incubated with either the 24-h TBI or sham brain homogenate with rotation at room temperature for 1 h. Beads were then washed three times with PBS and eluted using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8. The pH of each eluted fraction was adjusted using 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Fractions were pooled and concentrated 5× using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter units with 30-kDa cut-off (Millipore) (21Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Castillo-Carranza D.L. Sengupta U. Sarmiento J.

The approximate molecular weight of the peaks was estimated using gel filtration standard (Bio-Rad) was used for calibrations (21Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Castillo-Carranza D.L. Sengupta U. Sarmiento J.

Frozen sections were fixed with chilled acetone for 10 min at room temperature. After blocking in normal goat serum for 1 h, sections were incubated overnight with T22 (1:300). The next day, the sections were washed in PBS three times for 10 min each and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 (1:350; Invitrogen) for 1 h. The sections were then washed three times for 10 min each in PBS before incubation overnight with mouse Tau-1 (1:200; Millipore). The next day, the sections were washed in PBS three times for 10 min each prior to incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:350; Invitrogen) for 1 h. The sections were then washed three times for 10 min with PBS. Sections were incubated with DAPI (1:3000 in PBS) for 5 min, washed, and mounted in Fluoromount-G mounting medium (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). The sections were examined using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a CoolSnap-FX monochrome CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) using standard Nikon FITC, Texas Red, and DAPI filters set for Alexa Fluor 488 and 568, and DAPI, respectively. Peroxidase immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen sections. In brief, sections (5 μm) were fixed with chilled acetone for 10 min at room temperature and blocked for 1 h with 5% horse serum in PBS. The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: T22 (1:300) and mouse AT8 and AT180 (1:100; Thermo Scientific). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C and detected with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Vectastin ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vectastin ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) and visualized using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories) for nuclear staining. Brightfield images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200 color CCD camera (Nikon Instruments, Inc., Melville, NY). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparisons using GraphPad Prism software (version 5) and OriginPro software (version 8.0). Data in the text and figures are represented as mean ± S.D. Tau abnormalities in TBI have been investigated extensively, but whether Tau oligomers form in non-transgenic animals in response to TBI is unknown. We investigated the presence of Tau oligomers in the rat brains 4 and 24 h post-injury. First, using a novel anti-Tau oligomer antibody, T22 (21Lasagna-Reeves C.A. Castillo-Carranza D.L. Sengupta U. Sarmiento J. Troncoso J. Jackson G.R. Kayed R. Identification of oligomers at early stages of tau aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.FASEB J. 2012; 26: 1946-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), we observed that Tau oligomers were significantly increased (p < 0.001 TBI versus sham) 4 and 24 h after moderate parasagittal fluid percussion injury injury (Fig. 1A). We were able to detect large amounts of total Tau protein using Tau-1 in both the sham-operated and TBI samples at both time points by ELISA (Fig. 1B), indicative of Tau oligomerization after TBI rather than overproduction of Tau. To determine the conformation and aggregation state of Tau proteins following TBI, we performed Western blots using a variety of Tau antibodies (Fig. 1C). Using Western blotting, we detected a pattern of Tau protein following TBI that was similar to that obtained using ELISA, confirming that Tau oligomers were significantly increased after TBI at both 4 and 24 h after injury. There were no significant differences in the quantities of total Tau (Tau-1) detected in any of the groups tested (Fig. 1D). Because hyperphosphorylation of Tau plays a major role in NFT formation (41Augustinack J.C. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.M. Hyman B.T. Specific tau phosphorylation sites correlate with severity of neuronal cytopathology in Alzheimer's disease.Acta Neuropathol. 2002; 103: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), we used two different phosphorylated Tau antibodies (Fig. 1C).

https://openalex.org/W1982061990,"The non-Fermi-liquid regime that emerges in MnSi under high pressures displays a Hall signal that can be traced to topologically non-trivial spin configurations at low pressures — a well-understood skyrmion lattice — empirically suggesting a route towards a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure metals. Fermi liquid theory, which describes the behaviour of conduction electrons, is one of the most successful theories in condensed matter physics as it explains a wide range of phenomena, including superconductivity and ferromagnetism. Cases where Fermi liquid theory breaks down are of fundamental interest, and an intriguing question has been how a currently popular class of ordering phenomena, topologically protected spin configurations, results in non-Fermi liquid behaviour. The authors study such a topological spin texture, so-called skyrmions, in manganese silicide (MnSi) using electronic transport measurements under increasing pressure. They find that the skyrmions are remarkably stable, driving a breakdown of Fermi liquid behaviour. Fermi liquid theory provides a remarkably powerful framework for the description of the conduction electrons in metals and their ordering phenomena, such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and spin- and charge-density-wave order. A different class of ordering phenomena of great interest concerns spin configurations that are topologically protected, that is, their topology can be destroyed only by forcing the average magnetization locally to zero1. Examples of such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either pointing inwards or outwards) and vortices. A central question concerns the nature of the metallic state in the presence of such topologically distinct spin textures. Here we report a high-pressure study of the metallic state at the border of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi, which represents a new form of magnetic order composed of topologically non-trivial vortices2. When long-range magnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the skyrmion lattice—that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent magnetic flux associated with the topological winding—is unaffected in sign or magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The regime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic field coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced non-Fermi-liquid resistivity3,30. The observation of this topological Hall signal in the regime of the NFL resistivity suggests empirically that spin correlations with non-trivial topological character may drive a breakdown of Fermi liquid theory in pure metals."
https://openalex.org/W2072366385,"Social networks with positive and negative links often split into two antagonistic factions. Examples of such a split abound: revolutionaries versus an old regime, Republicans versus Democrats, Axis versus Allies during the second world war, or the Western versus the Eastern bloc during the Cold War. Although this structure, known as social balance, is well understood, it is not clear how such factions emerge. An earlier model could explain the formation of such factions if reputations were assumed to be symmetric. We show this is not the case for non-symmetric reputations, and propose an alternative model which (almost) always leads to social balance, thereby explaining the tendency of social networks to split into two factions. In addition, the alternative model may lead to cooperation when faced with defectors, contrary to the earlier model. The difference between the two models may be understood in terms of the underlying gossiping mechanism: whereas the earlier model assumed that an individual adjusts his opinion about somebody by gossiping about that person with everybody in the network, we assume instead that the individual gossips with that person about everybody. It turns out that the alternative model is able to lead to cooperative behaviour, unlike the previous model."

We investigated the contribution of IL-33 and IL1RL1 polymorphisms to IBD risk, and possible correlations with phenotype in an Italian cohort of adult and pediatric patients.We evaluated the association of six SNPs in IL-33 and IL1RL1 genes, in 805 Crohn's disease (CD), 816 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 752 controls, using Taqman. IL-33 and IL1RL1 mRNA expression was also analyzed.Significant allele and genotype associations with IL-33 rs3939286 were found in CD (P = 0.004; P = 0.035) and UC patients (P = 0.002; P = 0.038). After stratifying the cohort for age at diagnosis, the differences remained significant only in the IBD adult-onset. Significant associations were also obtained in CD patients with two IL1RL1 polymorphisms (rs13015714 and rs2058660, P<0.015). By combining homo- and heterozygous carriers of the rs13015714 risk allele, differences were still significant for both CD adult- and pediatric-onset. Upon genotype-phenotype evaluation, an increased frequency of extensive colitis in adult UC (P = 0.019) and in steroid-responsive pediatric patients (P = 0.024) carrying the IL-33 rs3939286 risk genotype, was observed. mRNA expression of IL-33 and IL1RL1 in inflamed IBD biopsy samples was significantly increased.Common IL-33 and IL1RL1 polymorphisms contribute to the risk of IBD in an Italian cohort of adult and pediatric patients, with some influence on sub-phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1988192101,"Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that mediates pro-inflammatory responses required for host control of many microbial pathogens; on the other hand, NFκB has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other inflammatory and infectious diseases. Mice with genetic disruption of the p50 subunit of NFκB are more likely to succumb to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). However, the role of NFκB in host defense in humans is not fully understood. We sought to examine the role of NFκB activation in the immune response of human macrophages to MTB. Targeted pharmacologic inhibition of NFκB activation using BAY 11-7082 (BAY, an inhibitor of IκBα kinase) or an adenovirus construct with a dominant-negative IκBα significantly decreased the number of viable intracellular mycobacteria recovered from THP-1 macrophages four and eight days after infection. The results with BAY were confirmed in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages. NFκB inhibition was associated with increased macrophage apoptosis and autophagy, which are well-established killing mechanisms of intracellular MTB. Inhibition of the executioner protease caspase-3 or of the autophagic pathway significantly abrogated the effects of BAY. We conclude that NFκB inhibition decreases viability of intracellular MTB in human macrophages via induction of apoptosis and autophagy."

Antibody-based targeting has become an established paradigm of biologic drug development. High affinity, excellent specificity, generally good stability, and Fc-associated effector functions all make antibodies the molecules of choice for many diagnostic and therapeutic applications. At the same time, novel non-antibody scaffolds are constantly being sought by industry to allow for development of new therapeutic agents offering advantages over classical antibody platforms (1Binz H.K.

In particular, smaller size for better tissue penetration, reduced complexity for easier production, and enhanced biological and biophysical stability are some of the properties desired for the new generation of biologics. Multiple formats and optimization strategies that try to incorporate these properties have been described.

The variable domains of these antibodies can be linked in tandem to provide multispecificity and increase the size and thus the in vivo half-life of the molecules.

In both cases, the key to such recognition is the structural organization of the CDR loops, in particular CDR3, which is often long (15–18 residues) and protruding from the V-NAR or VHH surface. V-NARs are distinct from typical Ig VH and VL domains as well as camelid VHH domains, sharing higher structural homology to immunoglobulin VL and T-cell receptor V domains than with immunoglobulin VH. The most unique feature of V-NARs is the absence of a CDR2 loop and of two β-strands, C′ and C″, associated with it. Instead, a distinct “belt” is formed around the middle of the β-sandwich structure (10Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Verdino P. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Maturation of shark single-domain (IgNAR) antibodies: evidence for induced-fit binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Crystal structure of a shark single-domain antibody V region in complex with lysozyme.Science. 2004; 305: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This region shows an elevated rate of somatic mutations and has thus been termed hypervariable region 2 (HV2) (16Dooley H. Stanfield R.L. Brady R.A. Flajnik M.F. First molecular and biochemical analysis of in vivo affinity maturation in an ectothermic vertebrate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1846-1851Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Another region of increased mutation frequency is located between HV2 and CDR3, comprising a loop that links β-strands D and E similar to that in T-cell receptor V chains; thus, this region was termed HV4. Structurally, HV2 is most proximal to CDR3, whereas HV4 is in proximity to CDR1. Several structural types of IgNAR variable domains have been classified based on the number and position of extra cysteine residues in CDRs and frameworks (FWs) in addition to the canonical cysteine pair (Cys23/Cys88 for VL; Kabat nomenclature) of the Ig fold (5Barelle C. Gill D.S. Charlton K. Shark novel antigen receptors—the next generation of biologic therapeutics?.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2009; 655: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Type I V-NAR, found in nurse sharks, has 2 cysteines in CDR3 and 2 more cysteines in frameworks (FW2 and FW4). The more common type II has one extra cysteine pair, which links CDR1 and CDR3. Type III, detected primarily in neonatal shark development, is similar to type II but has a conserved Trp residue in CDR1 and limited CDR3 diversity. Another structural type of V-NAR, which we have termed type IV, has only two canonical cysteine residues. So far, this type has been found primarily in dogfish sharks (Ref. 17Liu J.L. Anderson G.P. Delehanty J.B. Baumann R. Hayhurst A. Goldman E.R. Selection of cholera toxin specific IgNAR single-domain antibodies from a naive shark library.Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and this study) and was also isolated from semisynthetic V-NAR libraries derived from wobbegong sharks (18Streltsov V.A. Varghese J.N. Carmichael J.A. Irving R.A. Hudson P.J. Nuttall S.D. Structural evidence for evolution of shark Ig new antigen receptor variable domain antibodies from a cell-surface receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 12444-12449Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The single domain nature and the lack of CDR2 in V-NARs heighten the requirement for CDR1 and CDR3 to provide specific and high affinity binding to prospective antigens. CDR3, which is more variable in terms of sequence, length, and conformation, plays the key role in antigen recognition. The placing of cysteine residues in different V-NAR types is important for determining the conformation of CDRs. For example, CDR3 is long and extended (and tethered to CDR1) in PBLA8, a type II V-NAR, which enables it to access the active site cavity of its target, hen egg white lysozyme (HEL; Ref. 10Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Verdino P. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Maturation of shark single-domain (IgNAR) antibodies: evidence for induced-fit binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, 5A7, a type I V-NAR also directed against lysozyme and targeting a similar surface epitope, has a long CDR3 that adopts a bent conformation and forms a rather flat binding surface that does not enter deep into the HEL active site (10Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Verdino P. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Maturation of shark single-domain (IgNAR) antibodies: evidence for induced-fit binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Crystal structure of a shark single-domain antibody V region in complex with lysozyme.Science. 2004; 305: 1770-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both HEL binders form comparable buried surface area with their target (∼700 Å2) and bind with low nanomolar affinity. The extent of the surface area is similar to values observed for the complexes of heavy chains of classical antibodies with their targets (19Janin J. Chothia C. The structure of protein-protein recognition sites.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. The atomic structure of protein-protein recognition sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). Besides CDR1 and CDR3, a few other elements are involved in the HEL interaction by PBLA8 and 5A7. Of note is the residue Arg61 in the HV4 loop of PBLA8 that forms a hydrogen bond with Asp101 in HEL (10Stanfield R.L. Dooley H. Verdino P. Flajnik M.F. Wilson I.A. Maturation of shark single-domain (IgNAR) antibodies: evidence for induced-fit binding.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 358-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Detailed mutational analysis of 5A7 by Fennell et al. (21Fennell B.J. Darmanin-Sheehan A. Hufton S.E. Calabro V. Wu L. Müller M.R. Cao W. Gill D. Cunningham O. Finlay W.J. Dissection of the IgNAR V domain: molecular scanning and orthologue database mining define novel IgNAR hallmarks and affinity maturation mechanisms.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) revealed a high degree of mutational plasticity within the V-NAR domain and suggested that residues outside of the CDR1 and CDR3 loops may form additional contacts with the antigen. For example, mutation of Ser61 to Arg in HV4 of 5A7 increases HEL binding ∼5-fold likely due to the formation of a contact with Asp101 similar to Arg61 in PBLA8. Likewise, mutation of Ala1 to Asp in 5A7 results in increased HEL binding due to a putative ionic interaction (21Fennell B.J. Darmanin-Sheehan A. Hufton S.E. Calabro V. Wu L. Müller M.R. Cao W. Gill D. Cunningham O. Finlay W.J. Dissection of the IgNAR V domain: molecular scanning and orthologue database mining define novel IgNAR hallmarks and affinity maturation mechanisms.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast to typical antibodies, the structure described in this study utilizes CDR1 only minimally for antigen binding. An atypical “sideways” binding mode is observed that relies heavily on framework residues to achieve antigen binding in addition to CDR3. This binding mode has been described previously for other single domain antibodies (14Desmyter A. Spinelli S. Payan F. Lauwereys M. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Cambillau C. Three camelid VHH domains in complex with porcine pancreatic α-amylase. Inhibition and versatility of binding topology.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23645-23650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) but has not been seen previously in V-NARs. It is assumed that to be useful in therapeutic applications all novel non-human scaffolds, such as V-NARs or camelid VHH single domains, need to be humanized to reduce immunogenicity and/or improve thermodynamic stability, folding, and expression properties. Considerable expertise has been accumulated in this subject area, particularly with rodent mAbs (22Ewert S. Honegger A. Plückthun A. Stability improvement of antibodies for extracellular and intracellular applications: CDR grafting to stable frameworks and structure-based framework engineering.Methods. 2004; 34: 184-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Hwang W.Y. Almagro J.C. Buss T.N. Tan P. Foote J. Use of human germline genes in a CDR homology-based approach to antibody humanization.Methods. 2005; 36: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar24Tsurushita N. Hinton P.R. Kumar S. Design of humanized antibodies: from anti-Tac to Zenapax.Methods. 2005; 36: 69-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Typically, CDRs of a murine antibody of interest are grafted onto an appropriate human germ line framework (selected for sequence similarity, expression properties, or both), and then back-mutations are introduced at key positions responsible for particular CDR conformation and thus antigen binding. This approach has yielded many humanized antibodies with a number of them making it into the clinic. With camelid VHH domains, humanization has been relatively straightforward because of the overall structural similarity and high sequence homology (∼80%) between human and camel or llama sequences. In most instances, only ∼10 mutations of “non-human” surface residues toward the human germ line of the closest VH3 type need to be introduced into VHH scaffolds; in addition, two of four VHH hallmark residues in FW2 (positions 42, 49, 50, and 52) can be changed (25Conrath K. Vincke C. Stijlemans B. Schymkowitz J. Decanniere K. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Loris R. Antigen binding and solubility effects upon the veneering of a camel VHH in framework-2 to mimic a VH.J. Mol.

Chem. 2009; 284: 3273-3284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). All those changes can result in biophysically stable, well expressed, and biologically active VHH domains with nearly 100% framework identity to human germ line sequences. Shark V-NARs represent an obvious challenge for humanization because of the structural differences (e.g. lack of CDR2) and low overall sequence identity (generally ∼30%) to human VH/VL sequences. However, available crystal structures of V-NAR domains demonstrate organization of key framework regions similar to that of human Ig variable domains, thus making an attempt at humanization possible. In this study, we describe the generation of humanized versions of type I and type IV V-NARs based on the human germ line VL scaffold, DPK9. We also provide detailed structural analysis of the type IV V-NAR clone, E06, in complex with its target, human serum albumin. Our analysis provides the foundation for further improvement and humanization of shark V-NARs. The sequences encoding humanized E06 variants were codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells and synthesized by GeneArt AG (Germany). The sequences were cloned into a mammalian expression vector under the control of a murine CMV promoter. A signal peptide for extracellular secretion was added at the N terminus. C-terminal tags included His6, AAA-His6, or human IgG1 Fc (hFc). For hFc fusions, a Gly4-Ser-Gly4 linker was incorporated between the V-NAR and Fc. V-NAR-hFc fusion proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. Cells were transfected using TransIT reagent (Mirus) following the manufacturer's recommendations, and serum-free conditioned medium (CM) was typically collected at days 3 and 7 post-transfection. hFc fusion proteins were purified on HiTrap protein A columns (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 16/60 column run in PBS, pH 7.2. Monomeric V-NARs tagged with AAA-His6 were similarly expressed in COS-1 cells and purified by chromatography on a HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). CM was loaded onto a column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and after extensive washing with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear 10-column volume gradient to 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing V-NAR proteins were dialyzed against PBS. Protein concentration was determined by A280 nm. To obtain E06-His6 and huE06 v1.1-His6 proteins for crystallography, transient expression in HEK293-EBNA cells was performed in 1-liter spinners. Cells grown in serum-free FreeStyle293 expression medium (GE Healthcare) were transfected using polyethylenimine and harvested 120 h later. The expression of His6-tagged proteins in CM was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-His4 antibody (Qiagen). Clarified CM containing parental or humanized E06 with C-terminal His6 tag was applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen). Following capture, the column was rigorously washed in PBS supplemented with 20 mm imidazole and subsequently eluted in PBS supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. E06 was dialyzed against PBS to remove excess imidazole in preparation for complex formation. To remove oligomeric species from commercial human serum albumin, lipid-free HSA (Sigma, catalog number A3782) was dissolved in PBS at 50 mg/ml and applied to a Superdex 200 16/60 size exclusion column. Fractions corresponding to the monomeric species were pooled and incubated at a 1:2 molar ratio with E06. After incubation for 1 h, the complex was concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 16/60 column pre-equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline to remove excess E06. Consistent with complex formation, HSA and E06 co-eluted from the column at earlier elution volumes than both free species alone. Appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization. Serum albumin proteins used for binding experiments were from Sigma. For direct ELISA to detect V-NAR binding to antigens, Costar assay plates were coated with 1 μg/ml antigen in PBS and then blocked with 1% nonfat milk in PBS. V-NAR-hFc proteins were diluted in assay buffer (0.5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) and incubated with antigen for 1 h followed by incubation with goat anti-hFc-HRP for 1 h. For sandwich ELISA, plates were coated with goat anti-hFc polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 2 μg/ml in PBS. V-NAR-hFc proteins were titrated starting from 1 μg/ml in assay buffer and incubated in the plate for 1 h followed by addition of 1 μg/ml antigen (e.g. HSA) in assay buffer for 1 h. Bound HSA was detected using goat anti-HSA-HRP conjugate (Bethyl Laboratories). Concentrations of expressed hFc fusion proteins in CM were determined by sandwich ELISA using goat anti-hFc polyclonal antibody for capture and HRP-conjugated goat anti-hFc polyclonal antibody for detection. E06-HSA crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C in drops containing 1.0 μl of protein stock solution (11.0 mg/ml protein complex, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) mixed with 1.0 μl of well solution (16% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6) and equilibrated against 0.5 ml of well solution. Chunky crystals grew in approximately 1 week, measuring ∼50 μm across. huE06 v1.1-HSA crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C in drops containing 1.0 μl of protein stock solution (10.7 mg/ml protein complex, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) mixed with 1.0 μl of well solution (25% PEG 2000 monomethyl ether, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6) and 0.2 μl of the additive 30% 1,6-hexanediol and equilibrated against 0.5 ml of well solution. Diamond-shaped crystals appeared overnight and grew in approximately 1 week, measuring ∼50 μm in the longest dimension. E06 complex crystals belong to the space group P3221 (Number 154) with unit cell parameters 127.98 × 127.98 × 151.76 Å3 and contain two molecules of E06 and two molecules of HSA in the asymmetric unit, implying a solvent content of 54.2%. Crystals were drawn through a solution of 20% DMSO and 80% well solution and cooled rapidly in liquid nitrogen.

https://openalex.org/W2045674920,"Biofilms are surface-associated groups of microbial cells that are embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is a network of biopolymers, mainly polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. ECM proteins serve a variety of structural roles and often form amyloid-like fibers. Despite the extensive study of the formation of amyloid fibers from their constituent subunits in humans, much less is known about the assembly of bacterial functional amyloid-like precursors into fibers. Using dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and infrared spectroscopy, we show that our unique purification method of a Bacillus subtilis major matrix protein component results in stable oligomers that retain their native α-helical structure. The stability of these oligomers enabled us to control the external conditions that triggered their aggregation. In particular, we show that stretched fibers are formed on a hydrophobic surface, whereas plaque-like aggregates are formed in solution under acidic pH conditions. TasA is also shown to change conformation upon aggregation and gain some β-sheet structure. Our studies of the aggregation of a bacterial matrix protein from its subunits shed new light on assembly processes of the ECM within bacterial biofilms."
https://openalex.org/W2109356079,"Genes involved in sex determination and differentiation have been identified in mice, humans, chickens, reptiles, amphibians and teleost fishes. However, little is known of their functional conservation, and it is unclear whether there is a common set of genes shared by all vertebrates. Coelacanths, basal Sarcopterygians and unique “living fossils”, could help establish an inventory of the ancestral genes involved in these important developmental processes and provide insights into their components. In this study 33 genes from the genome of Latimeria chalumnae and from the liver and testis transcriptomes of Latimeria menadoensis, implicated in sex determination and differentiation, were identified and characterized and their expression levels measured. Interesting findings were obtained for GSDF, previously identified only in teleosts and now characterized for the first time in the sarcopterygian lineage; FGF9, which is not found in teleosts; and DMRT1, whose expression in adult gonads has recently been related to maintenance of sexual identity. The gene repertoire and testis-specific gene expression documented in coelacanths demonstrate a greater similarity to modern fishes and point to unexpected changes in the gene regulatory network governing sexual development."

https://openalex.org/W2054517686,"Matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP-8) is a tumor-suppressive protease that cleaves numerous substrates, including matrix proteins and chemokines. In particular, MMP-8 proteolytically activates IL-8 and, thereby, regulates neutrophil chemotaxis in vivo. We explored the effects of expression of either a WT or catalytically inactive (E198A) mutant version of MMP-8 in human breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of serum-free conditioned media from three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231) expressing WT MMP-8 revealed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-8. This increase was mirrored at the mRNA level and was dependent on MMP-8 catalytic activity. However, sustained expression of WT MMP-8 by breast cancer cells was non-permissive for long-term growth, as shown by reduced colony formation compared with cells expressing either control vector or E198A mutant MMP-8. In long-term culture of transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, expression of WT but not E198A mutant MMP-8 was lost, with IL-6 and IL-8 levels returning to base line. Rare clonal isolates of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing WT MMP-8 were generated, and these showed constitutively high levels of IL-6 and IL-8, although production of the interleukins was no longer dependent upon MMP-8 activity.

Matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP-8) is a tumor-suppressive protease that cleaves numerous substrates, including matrix proteins and chemokines. In particular, MMP-8 proteolytically activates IL-8 and, thereby, regulates neutrophil chemotaxis in vivo. We explored the effects of expression of either a WT or catalytically inactive (E198A) mutant version of MMP-8 in human breast cancer cell lines. Analysis of serum-free conditioned media from three breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-231) expressing WT MMP-8 revealed elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-8. This increase was mirrored at the mRNA level and was dependent on MMP-8 catalytic activity. However, sustained expression of WT MMP-8 by breast cancer cells was non-permissive for long-term growth, as shown by reduced colony formation compared with cells expressing either control vector or E198A mutant MMP-8. In long-term culture of transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, expression of WT but not E198A mutant MMP-8 was lost, with IL-6 and IL-8 levels returning to base line. Rare clonal isolates of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing WT MMP-8 were generated, and these showed constitutively high levels of IL-6 and IL-8, although production of the interleukins was no longer dependent upon MMP-8 activity.

Using a set of model and cellular proteins carrying an N-terminal signal anchor sequence of controlled hydrophobicity and yeast mutant strains defective in SRP or Sec62 function, the hydrophobicity-dependent targeting efficiency and targeting pathway preference were systematically evaluated. Our results suggest that an SRP-dependent co-translational and an SRP-independent post-translational translocation are not mutually exclusive for signal anchor proteins and that moderately hydrophobic ones require both SRP and Sec62 for proper targeting and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum. Further, defect in Sec62 selectively reduced signal sequences inserted in an N(in)-C(out) (type II) membrane topology, implying an undiscovered role of Sec62 in regulating the orientation of the signal sequence in an early stage of translocation."

We compared HIV/STI prevalence and risk factors between two non-probability samples of MSM, one passively enrolled from an STI clinic and the other actively enrolled from community venues surrounding the clinic in Lima, Peru. Methods A total of 560 self-identified MSM were enrolled between May-December, 2007. 438 subjects enrolled from a municipal STI clinic and 122 subjects enrolled during community outreach visits. All participants underwent screening for HIV, syphilis, HSV-2, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia and completed a survey assessing their history of HIV/STIs, prior HIV testing, and sexual behavior. Results HIV prevalence was significantly higher among MSM enrolled from the clinic, with previously undiagnosed HIV identified in 9.1% compared with 2.6% of community participants. 15.4 % of all MSM screened were infected with ≥1 curable STI, 7.4% with early syphilis (RPR≥1∶16) and 5.5% with urethral gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia. No significant differences between populations were reported in prevalence of STIs, number of male sex partners, history of unprotected anal intercourse, or alcohol and/or drug use prior to sex. Exchange of sex for money or goods was reported by 33.5% of MSM enrolled from the clinic and 21.2% of MSM from the community (p = 0.01). Conclusions Our data demonstrate that the prevalence of HIV and STIs, including syphilis, gonorrhoea, and chlamydia are extremely high among MSM enrolled from both clinic and community venues in urban Peru. New strategies are needed to address differences in HIV/STI epidemiology between clinic- and community-enrolled samples of MSM."
https://openalex.org/W1968710895,"Signal transduction modulates expression and activity of cholesterol transporters. We recently demonstrated that the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade regulates protein stability of Scavenger Receptor BI (SR-BI) through Proliferator Activator Receptor (PPARα) -dependent degradation pathways. In addition, MAPK (Mek/Erk 1/2) inhibition has been shown to influence liver X receptor (LXR) -inducible ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter ABCA1 expression in macrophages. Here we investigated if Ras/MAPK signaling could alter expression and activity of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in steroidogenic and hepatic cell lines. We demonstrate that in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and human hepatic HuH7 cells, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) inhibition reduces PPARα-inducible ABCA1 protein levels, while ectopic expression of constitutively active H-Ras, K-Ras and MAPK/Erk kinase 1 (Mek1) increases ABCA1 protein expression, respectively. Furthermore, Mek1/2 inhibitors reduce ABCG1 protein levels in ABCG1 overexpressing CHO cells (CHO-ABCG1) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells treated with LXR agonist. This correlates with Mek1/2 inhibition reducing ABCG1 cell surface expression and decreasing cholesterol efflux onto High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). Real Time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein turnover studies reveal that Mek1/2 inhibitors do not target transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1, but promote ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein degradation in HuH7 and CHO cells, respectively. In line with published data from mouse macrophages, blocking Mek1/2 activity upregulates ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels in human THP1 macrophages, indicating opposite roles for the Ras/MAPK pathway in the regulation of ABC transporter activity in macrophages compared to steroidogenic and hepatic cell types. In summary, this study suggests that Ras/MAPK signaling modulates PPARα- and LXR-dependent protein degradation pathways in a cell-specific manner to regulate the expression levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2043950823,"Opisthorchis felineus or Siberian liver fluke is a trematode parasite (Opisthorchiidae) that infects the hepato-biliary system of humans and other mammals. Despite its public health significance, this wide-spread Eurasian species is one of the most poorly studied human liver flukes and nothing is known about its population genetic structure and demographic history. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap for the first time and to explore the genetic diversity in O. felineus populations from Eastern Europe (Ukraine, European part of Russia), Northern Asia (Siberia) and Central Asia (Northern Kazakhstan). Analysis of marker DNA fragments from O. felineus mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and 3 (cox1, cox3) and nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences revealed that genetic diversity is very low across the large geographic range of this species. Microevolutionary processes in populations of trematodes may well be influenced by their peculiar biology. Nevertheless, we suggest that lack of population genetics structure observed in O. felineus can be primarily explained by the Pleistocene glacial events and subsequent sudden population growth from a very limited group of founders. Rapid range expansion of O. felineus through Asian and European territories after severe bottleneck points to a high dispersal potential of this trematode species."

In order to test the spread of SV40 infection in children, an immunologic assay employing specific SV40 synthetic peptides corresponding to its viral protein (VP) antigens was employed to estimate the seroprevalence of this polyomavirus in Italian infants and adolescents. Serum samples from 328 children and adolescents, up to 17 years, were investigated. Serum antibodies against SV40 VPs were detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The seroprevalence of this polyomavirus was calculated after stratifying the subjects by age. Anti-viral capsid protein 1-2-3 SV40 IgG antibodies were detected in 16% of the study participants. The prevalence of antibodies against SV40 VPs tended to increase with age in children, up to 10 year old (21%). Then, in the cohort of individuals aged 11-17 years, the prevalence decreased (16%). A higher prevalence rate (23%) of SV40 VP antibodies was detected in the cohorts of 1-3 year and 7-10 year old children, than in children and adolescents of the other age groups. This age corresponds to children starting nursery and primary school, respectively, in Italy. IgM antibodies against SV40 VP mimotopes were detected in 6-8 month old children suggesting that SV40 seroconversion can occur early in life. SV40 VP antibodies are present at low prevalence in Italian children (16%), suggesting that SV40 infection, although acquired early in life, probably through different routes, is not widespread. The low SV40 seroprevalence suggests that SV40 is less transmissible than other common polyomaviruses, such as BKV and JCV. Alternatively, our immunologic data could be due to another, as yet undiscovered, human polyomavirus closely related to SV40."

Objective In a cohort of TB patients, to ascertain the proportion of patients who fulfil the criteria for presumptive MDR-TB, assess whether they underwent investigation for MDR-TB, and the results of the culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). Methods A cross sectional record review of TB patients registered for treatment between July-December 2011. Results Of 19,236 TB patients registered, 409 (2%) fulfilled the criteria of presumptive MDR-TB; of these, 187 (46%) were examined for culture. This proportion was higher among relapse, failure, return after default (RAD) and non-converters at 3 months of new smear positive TB patients (>60%) as compared to non-converters at 2 months of new TB cases (<20%). Nearly two thirds (n = 113) of the samples were culture positive; of these, three-fourth (n = 85) grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBc) and one-fourth (n = 28) grew non-tuberculous Mycobacteria. DST results were available for 96% of the MTBc isolates. Overall, 21 patients were diagnosed as MDR-TB (all diagnosed among retreatment TB cases and none from non-converters) and all of them were initiated on MDR-TB treatment. Conclusion There is a need to strengthen mechanisms for linking patients with presumptive MDR-TB to culture centers. The policy of testing non-converters for culture and DST needs to be reviewed."

https://openalex.org/W2000506862,"Caveolae are cell membrane invaginations that are highly abundant in adipose tissue, endothelial cells and the lung. The formation of caveolae is dependent on the expression of various structural proteins that serve as scaffolding for these membrane invaginations. Cavin1 is a newly identified structural protein whose deficiency in mice leads to loss of caveolae formation and to development of a lipodystrophic phenotype. In this study, we sought to investigate the functional role of Cavin1 in the lung. Cavin1 deficient mice possessed dramatically altered distal lung morphology and exhibited significant physiological alterations, notably, increased lung elastance. The changes in distal lung architecture were associated with hypercellularity and the accumulation of lung macrophages. The increases in lung macrophages occurred without changes to circulating numbers of mononuclear cells and without evidence for increased proliferation. However, the increases in lung macrophages were associated with higher levels of macrophage chemotactic factors CXCL2 and CCL2 in BAL fluid from Cavin1-/- mice suggesting a possible mechanism by which these cells accumulate. In addition, lung macrophages from Cavin1-/- mice were larger and displayed measurable differences in gene expression when compared to macrophages from wild-type mice. Interestingly, macrophages were also increased in adipose tissue but not in liver, kidney or skeletal muscle from Cavin1-/- mice, and similar tissue specificity for macrophage accumulation was observed in lungs and adipose tissue from Caveolin1-/- mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an important role for Cavin1 in lung homeostasis and suggests that caveolae structural proteins are necessary for regulating macrophage number and phenotype in the lung."

The most common type of partition ATPase, generally called ParA, is represented by the P1 plasmid ParA protein.

The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between AID expression and the clinical classification of oral cancer tissues.The current study investigated the correlation between AID expression and the clinical classification of oral cancer tissues from 27 patients who underwent surgical resection using immunohistochemistry. Specific AID expression and its induction by cytokine stimulation were investigated in cultured HSC oral cancer cell lines by reverse transcriptase PCR.AID expression was detected in 10 of 27 specimens (37.0%). AID expression was more frequently detected in early-stage cancer, especially in early stage T, than in late-stage cancer (T1/T2 vs. T3/4; P = 0.0493, N0 vs. N1/2/3; P = 0.0793). HSC-2, a nonmetastatic oral cancer cell line, abundantly expressed endogenous AID, whereas no such expression was observed in HSC-3, a metastatic oral cancer cell line. Moreover, AID expression was substantially induced in HSC-2 cells by stimulation of an inflammation-related cytokine, TNF-α.Aberrant AID expression in the oral epithelium would contribute to the initiation of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Avoiding persistent AID inducible condition such as frequent cleaning of oral cavity would play an important role for the prevention of developing oral cancer."

Materials and Methods The expression of PNCK mRNA was determined in 24 paired samples of ccRCCs and adjacent normal tissues using real-time RT-PCR. The expression of PNCK was determined in 248 samples of ccRCCs and 92 paired samples of adjacent normal tissues by immunohistochemical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed to define the relationship between PNCK expression and the clinical features of ccRCC. Results The mRNA level of PNCK was significantly higher in tumorous tissues than in the adjacent non-tumorous tissues (p<0.001). An immunohistochemical analysis of 92 paired tissue specimens showed that PNCK expression was higher in tumorous tissues than in the adjacent non-tumorous tissues (p<0.001). Moreover, there was a significant correlation between the PNCK expression and various clinicopathological parameters such as Fuhrman grade (p = 0.011), tumor size (p<0.001), T stage (p<0.001) and N stage (p = 0.015). Patients with higher PNCK expression had shorter overall survival time than those with lower PNCK expression (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that PNCK expression was an independent predictor for poor survival of ccRCC patients. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study that determines the relationship between PNCK and prognosis in ccRCC. We found that increased PNCK expression is associated with poor prognosis in ccRCC. PNCK may represent a novel prognostic marker for ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W1977419134,"One of the goals in neuroscience is to obtain tractable laboratory cultures that closely recapitulate in vivo systems while still providing ease of use in the lab. Because neurons can exist in the body over a lifetime, long-term culture systems are necessary so as to closely mimic the physiological conditions under laboratory culture conditions. Ideally, such a neuronal organoid culture would contain multiple cell types, be highly differentiated, and have a high density of interconnected cells. However, before these types of cultures can be created, certain problems associated with long-term neuronal culturing must be addressed. We sought to develop a new protocol which may further prolong the duration and integrity of E18 rat hippocampal cultures. We have developed a protocol that allows for culturing of E18 hippocampal neurons at high densities for more than 120 days. These cultured hippocampal neurons are (i) well differentiated with high numbers of synapses, (ii) anchored securely to their substrate, (iii) have high levels of functional connectivity, and (iv) form dense multi-layered cellular networks. We propose that our culture methodology is likely to be effective for multiple neuronal subtypes–particularly those that can be grown in Neurobasal/B27 media. This methodology presents new avenues for long-term functional studies in neurons."

Immune cells play an important role in shaping tumor microenvironments; however, there is limited understanding of how natural killer (NK) cells can enhance radiation effects. This study aimed to assess the mechanism of reciprocal complementation of radiation and NK cells on tumor killing. Various tumor cell lines were co-cultured with human primary NK cells or NK cell line (NK-92) for short periods and then exposed to irradiation. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and transwell assays were performed to assess apoptotic efficacy and cell viability. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation methods were used to determine XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) expression and interaction in tumor cells. Co-culture did not induce apoptosis in tumor cells, but a time- and dose-dependent enhancing effect was found when co-cultured cells were irradiated. A key role for caspase activation via perforin/granzyme B (Grz B) after cell-cell contact was determined, as the primary radiation enhancing effect. The efficacy of NK cell killing was attenuated by upregulation of XIAP to bind caspase-3 in tumor cells to escape apoptosis. Knockdown of XIAP effectively potentiated NK cell-mediated apoptosis. Radiation induced Smac released from mitochondria and neutralized XIAP and therefore increased the NK killing. Our findings suggest NK cells in tumor microenvironment have direct radiosensitization effect through Grz B injection while radiation enhances NK cytotoxicity through triggering Smac release."

Pigmentation is strictly regulated and high pigment production was observed during the late stationary growth phase in a minimal medium and at growth temperatures lower than the optimum. Only a subpopulation of stationary phase cells produced the pigment, indicating that the stationary culture contains a heterogeneous cell population and that pigment synthesis is a bimodal phenomenon. The fraction of cells producing the pigment varied in the different growth conditions and occurred only in cells not devoted to sporulation. Only some of the pigmented cells were also able to produce a matrix. Pigment and matrix production in SF214 appear then as two developmental fates both alternative to sporulation. Since the pigment had an essential role in the cell resistance to oxidative stress conditions, we propose that within the heterogeneous population different survival strategies can be followed by the different cells."

Oligopeptidases consist of a half-sphere-shaped hydrolase region containing the active site and a cylindrical propeller domain, which caps it, burying the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad in a well protected inner hole with dimensions comparable with the size limitations imposed by the enzyme. The structure, however, raised the question of substrate access and, through it, how enzyme effectiveness and selectivity are simultaneously maintained in the case of such a decidedly buried active site. It was initially proposed that substrates must reach the active site through the narrow channel bisecting the propeller domain. Alternatively, substrate access routes must target the domain interface, either through a transient opening between the propeller and the hydrolase domains or through a permanent hole between the two.

This suggests that an open/closed dynamic equilibrium, fine-tuned by the amino acid composition of the interacting domain surfaces, might describe the resting state of the enzyme, where both forms coexist. This notion recently gained support by the determination of the crystal structure of another oligopeptidase, AAP from Aeropyrum pernix (ApAAP), which contains both the open and closed forms of the unligated enzyme within the same crystal lattice, in the form of 1:1 open/closed mixed dimers (8Harmat V.

In this work, we present an even more complex example of the latter: that of acylaminoacyl peptidase from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhAAP), which we found active in the hexameric form (13Szeltner Z. Kiss A.L. Domokos K. Harmat V. Náray-Szabó G. Polgár L. Characterization of a novel acylaminoacyl peptidase with hexameric structure and endopeptidase activity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 1204-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Three crystal structures were determined, which demonstrates that hexamerization results in self-compartmentalizing, a self-assembled double-gated channel system that may effectively screen the substrates of the six individual monomers, all possessing a permanent entry at the domain interface. Although hexameric arrangement is unique among classical serine proteases, it is reminiscent of other self-compartmentalizing intracellular proteases, such as Gal6/bleomycin hydrolase (14Joshua-Tor L.

Thus, the PhAAP structure provides a unique possibility of comparison among oligopeptidases sharing common domain structure but applying different substrate selection strategy and among self-compartmentalizing proteases of different monomeric structure but of similar selection strategy. This comparison allowed us to propose that the flexibility of the loop holding the catalytic His residue, the accessibility of a sticky β-strand anchoring the His-loop, and unobtrusive insertions or terminal extensions determine the substrate selection strategy and self-assembly in the oligopeptidase family. Structure determination of PhAAP and understanding of the structural requirements and consequences of multimerization also takes us one step closer to the physiologically relevant mammalian enzyme, which is active as a tetramer. AAP functions as an exopeptidase in mammals, removing N-terminally blocked amino acids from peptides, although other orthologs have endopeptidase activity too (13Szeltner Z. Kiss A.L. Domokos K.

The active site mutation was introduced in PhAAP (S466A) by the two-step PCR method as described for ApAAP (17Kiss A.L. Hornung B. Rádi K. Gengeliczki Z. Sztáray B. Juhász T. Szeltner Z. Harmat V.

Preparing the covalent complex of PhAAP with the inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-glycyl-glycyl-phenylalanyl-chloromethyl ketone (CMK) was carried out by adding the inhibitor in 2.4-fold excess to the protein solution. The PhAAP structure was determined from crystals grown at 20 °C by the hanging drop method. Crystal quality was improved by microseeding. The crystals were flash-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. For the native crystal, drops were prepared by mixing 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution (3.0 m 1,6-hexanediol, 0.20 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5). The protein solutions contained 10.5–13.0 mg/ml PhAAP in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Phase information was obtained using the following three derivatives. A crystal was soaked in 4.5 μl of reservoir solution (same as for the native crystal) mixed with 1.5 μl of 0.05 m UO2(NO3)2 solution for 1 h prior to flash cooling. A crystal was soaked in 2 μl of reservoir solution mixed with 2 μl of 0.02 m K2PtCl4 solution for 2 h prior to flash cooling. After mixing 2 μl of 0.2 m KI solution in the crystallization drop, a crystal was quick soaked in it. The orthorhombic crystal form was obtained by a co-crystallizing trial of the S466A mutant form of PhAAP and its substrate (13Szeltner Z. Kiss A.L. Domokos K. Harmat V. Náray-Szabó G. Polgár L.

The substrate was dissolved in the protein solutions (9.2 mg/ml protein in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0) at a 10-fold excess. The drops contained 2 μl of protein solution and 2 μl of reservoir solution (3.0 m 1,6-hexanediol, 0.30 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0). The structure, however, does not contain any fragment of the substrate, possibly because 1,6-hexanediol competes for and occupies the S1 site. For studying binding of a substrate fragment, we prepared crystals with a covalent inhibitor, CMK. The crystal of the PhAAP-CMK complex was grown in a hanging drop of 4 μl of the PhAAP-CMK solution (9.7 mg/ml covalent protein-inhibitor complex in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0) and 4 μl of reservoir solution (2.5 m 1,6-hexanediol, 0.20 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5). Data collection was carried out on a Rigaku diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, wavelength 1.5418 Å) for the native, UO2(NO3)2, and KI derivative crystals (graphite monochromator, R-AXIS IIc detector) as well as the CMK complex (blue optics, R-AXIS IV++ detector). Data sets of the K2PtCl4 derivative crystal were collected at synchrotron sources at wavelengths 0.8162 and 1.0715 Å, at the EMBL beamline X11 of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and at beamline BM14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), respectively. The data set of a crystal of the orthorhombic crystal form was collected at beamline BM14 of ESRF (wavelength 1.0715 Å). All data were collected at 100 K. Data processing was carried out using the XDS and XSCALE programs (24Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar) for all data sets. All but one crystal were isostructural with the hexamers of AAP formed by space group symmetry H32 from the single monomer of the asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit of the crystal in the orthorhombic crystal form contains two hexamers of PhAAP (for this data set, reflections for Rfree calculation were selected in thin shells). Data sets of the native, UO2(NO3)2 and KI and K2PtCl4 derivatives were used for solving the phase problem using multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. The initial set of sites was located by the SHELX package (25Sheldrick G.M. A short history of SHELX.Acta Crystallogr. A. 2008; 64: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (80563) Google Scholar). Phases were refined with the program MLPHARE (26.Otwinowski, Z., (1991) in Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend (Wolf, W., Evans, P. R., Leslie, A. G.

Average geometries and B-factors were calculated using the last 10 ns of the trajectories. Figures were created using PyMOL (v0.99, DeLano Scientific, 2006) and Maestro version 9.2 (Schrodinger, LLC, New York). Crystal structure of the PhAAP hexamer was determined in two crystal forms. Two sets of data originate from crystals bearing R32 space group symmetry, where the six monomers of the hexamer are crystallographically equivalent. One of these shows the substrate-free form of the enzyme, whereas the other contains a chloromethyl ketone inhibitor (CMK) covalently bound to the active site serine and histidine residues, serving as an analog of the intermediate of the substrate hydrolysis reaction. The second crystal form is orthorhombic, containing two substrate-free hexamers in the asymmetric unit, with no crystallographic restrictions for the symmetry and topology of the monomers within the hexamer (Table 1). The monomer units within each hexamer and in between monomers of the different structures are strikingly similar (after fitting to the native unligated structure, root mean square deviation of Cα atoms is 0.23 Å for the CMK complex structure, and it is between 0.25 and 0.41 Å for the 12 molecules of the orthorhombic structure, respectively). Furthermore, the overall hexameric form is also quite similar in all of the three structures, indicating that the hexamer is a symmetric object with a well defined structure. The enzyme monomer consists of a dome-shaped, seven-bladed β-propeller domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain of α/β-hydrolase fold. Each blade of the β-propeller domain contains four antiparallel β-strands. There is a large cavity with overall diameter of about 22 Å between the two domains, which contains the active site (Fig. 1, A and B). A side opening of this cavity (12 × 16 Å) is created under blade 2, gated by blades 1 and 3 (Fig. 1B). Blade 2 is both shortened and shifted upward by 6–8 Å as compared with the corresponding blades of other family members, such as POP, OPB, or ApAAP, but similar to that of DPP-IV with an even greater interdomain opening of 15 × 22 Å formed by shortening and shift of its blades 1–3 (9Engel M.

https://openalex.org/W2014305717,"P450cam (CYP101A1) is a bacterial monooxygenase that is known to catalyze the oxidation of camphor, the first committed step in camphor degradation, with simultaneous reduction of oxygen (O2). We report that P450cam catalysis is controlled by oxygen levels: at high O2 concentration, P450cam catalyzes the known oxidation reaction, whereas at low O2 concentration the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of camphor to borneol. We confirmed, using 17O and 2H NMR, that the hydrogen atom added to camphor comes from water, which is oxidized to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). This is the first time a cytochrome P450 has been observed to catalyze oxidation of water to H2O2, a difficult reaction to catalyze due to its high barrier. The reduction of camphor and simultaneous oxidation of water are likely catalyzed by the iron-oxo intermediate of P450cam, and we present a plausible mechanism that accounts for the 1∶1 borneol:H2O2 stoichiometry we observed. This reaction has an adaptive value to bacteria that express this camphor catabolism pathway, which requires O2, for two reasons: 1) the borneol and H2O2 mixture generated is toxic to other bacteria and 2) borneol down-regulates the expression of P450cam and its electron transfer partners. Since the reaction described here only occurs under low O2 conditions, the down-regulation only occurs when O2 is scarce."
https://openalex.org/W2022694434,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) controls the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells in most eukaryotes with a role in the fate of stem cells. Its inactivation by mutation or oncogenic viruses is required for cellular transformation and eventually carcinogenesis. The high conservation of the Rb cyclin fold prompted us to investigate the link between conformational stability and ligand binding properties of the RbAB pocket domain. RbAB unfolding presents a three-state transition involving cooperative secondary and tertiary structure changes and a partially folded intermediate that can oligomerize. The first transition corresponds to unfolding of the metastable B subdomain containing the binding site for the LXCXE motif present in cellular and viral targets, and the second transition corresponds to the stable A subdomain. The low thermodynamic stability of RbAB translates into a propensity to rapidly oligomerize and aggregate at 37 °C (T50 = 28 min) that is suppressed by human papillomavirus E7 and E2F peptide ligands, suggesting that Rb is likely stabilized in vivo through binding to target proteins. We propose that marginal stability and associated oligomerization may be conserved for function as a “hub” protein, allowing the formation of multiprotein complexes, which could constitute a robust mechanism to retain its cell cycle regulatory role throughout evolution. Decreased stability and oligomerization are shared with the p53 tumor suppressor, suggesting a link between folding and function in these two essential cell regulators that are inactivated in most cancers and operate within multitarget signaling pathways.Background: Conformational stability and folding of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor are unknown to date.Results: The metastable RbAB domain undergoes oligomerization and aggregation, which are suppressed by natural ligands.Conclusion: RbAB requires binding to ligands or is prone to inactivation.Significance: Despite a different sequence and fold, Rb shares tumor suppression and multiligand binding with p53 where marginal stability and oligomerization may lead to inactivation.

The low thermodynamic stability of RbAB translates into a propensity to rapidly oligomerize and aggregate at 37 °C (T50 = 28 min) that is suppressed by human papillomavirus E7 and E2F peptide ligands, suggesting that Rb is likely stabilized in vivo through binding to target proteins. We propose that marginal stability and associated oligomerization may be conserved for function as a “hub” protein, allowing the formation of multiprotein complexes, which could constitute a robust mechanism to retain its cell cycle regulatory role throughout evolution. Decreased stability and oligomerization are shared with the p53 tumor suppressor, suggesting a link between folding and function in these two essential cell regulators that are inactivated in most cancers and operate within multitarget signaling pathways. Background: Conformational stability and folding of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor are unknown to date. Results: The metastable RbAB domain undergoes oligomerization and aggregation, which are suppressed by natural ligands. Conclusion: RbAB requires binding to ligands or is prone to inactivation. Significance: Despite a different sequence and fold, Rb shares tumor suppression and multiligand binding with p53 where marginal stability and oligomerization may lead to inactivation. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) 5The abbreviations used are:Rb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor; HPV, human papillomavirus; TF, transcription factor; E2F-TD, E2F transactivation domain; p53CD, p53 core domain; DLS, dynamic light scattering; GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; ANS, 1-anilinonaphtalene 8-sulfonate; ThT, thioflavin T; CSM, center of spectral mass; N, native monomer; I, partially folded intermediate; U, unfolded monomer; A, aggregate; M, non-native monomer. is a central regulator of cell cycle progression, development, and differentiation that modulates the activity of E2F proteins and other transcription factors (1van den Heuvel S.

RB, the conductor that orchestrates life, death and differentiation.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5210-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rb also interacts with chromatin-remodeling enzymes, leading to control of chromatin state and expression of specific target genes (3Macaluso M. Montanari M. Giordano A. Rb family proteins as modulators of gene expression and new aspects regarding the interaction with chromatin remodeling enzymes.Oncogene. 2006; 25: 5263-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and has recently been shown to play a role in stem cell biology (4Sage J. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and stem cell biology.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite extensive divergence among its components, the signaling network regulating the cell cycle is conserved throughout evolution of eukaryotes from yeasts to mammals (5Cross F.R. Buchler N.E. Skotheim J.M. Evolution of networks and sequences in eukaryotic cell cycle control.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2011; 366: 3532-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Rb/E2F regulatory node is strikingly conserved in organisms as divergent as unicellular algae, plants, worms, and mammals, pointing to the central role of this ancient regulatory module (6Gutzat R.

Rb is considered as a “hub” protein of the cell cycle interaction network because of its ability to bind to and regulate the activity of multiple proteins involved in cell cycle control (8DeGregori J. The Rb network.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3411-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Rb was the first tumor suppressor to be identified in the pediatric tumor retinoblastoma and is further inactivated in glioblastoma; melanoma; and lung, breast, and liver cancers among others (9Burkhart D.L. Sage J. Cellular mechanisms of tumour suppression by the retinoblastoma gene.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Rb is also targeted by several DNA and RNA viruses such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis C virus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus, which are linked to the development of cervical, liver, and Merkel cell carcinoma, respectively (10zur Hausen H. Papillomaviruses in the causation of human cancers—a brief historical account.Virology. 2009; 384: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 11McGivern D.R. Lemon S.M.

Merkel cell carcinoma revisited: a new example of viro-induced human tumour.Pathol. Biol. 2011; 59: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Most mutations of the RB1 gene correspond to small insertions or deletions and to early termination with a smaller proportion of missense mutations (13Lohmann D.R. RB1 gene mutations in retinoblastoma.Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Valverde J.R. Alonso J. Palacios I. Pestaña A. RB1 gene mutation up-date, a meta-analysis based on 932 reported mutations available in a searchable database.BMC Genet. 2005; 6: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rb cooperates with p53 in tumor suppression, and loss of function of both p53 and Rb is thought to be a virtually universal feature of tumorigenesis (15Sherr C.J. McCormick F. The RB and p53 pathways in cancer.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). However, the consequences of Rb loss on cancer initiation and progression are only beginning to be uncovered. Based on its inactivation in tumors, Rb has been recently proposed as a potential target for anticancer strategies, and it has been suggested that Rb levels could be considered for guiding cancer treatments (16Knudsen E.S. Knudsen K.E. Tailoring to RB: tumour suppressor status and therapeutic response.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Human Rb is a 105-kDa protein composed of structured RbN (17Hassler M. Singh S. Yue W.W. Luczynski M. Lakbir R. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Bader T. Pearl L.H. Mittnacht S.

Structure of the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor pocket domain bound to a peptide from HPV E7.Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) domains followed by a disordered RbC domain that becomes ordered upon binding to E2F (19Rubin S.M. Gall A.L. Zheng N. Pavletich N.P.

The RbN and RbAB domains are linked by a flexible stretch (20Burke J.R. Hura G.L. Rubin S.M. Structures of inactive retinoblastoma protein reveal multiple mechanisms for cell cycle control.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The RbAB domain, termed “small pocket” or “pocket domain,” is the primary site for molecular interactions between Rb and its binding partners (21Dick F.A. Structure-function analysis of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein—is the whole a sum of its parts?.Cell Div. 2007; 2: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and together with RbC forms the “large pocket,” which is sufficient for cell cycle arrest and transcriptional repression functions. The RbAB domain is also the site of most tumorigenic missense mutations (14Valverde J.R. Alonso J. Palacios I. Pestaña A. RB1 gene mutation up-date, a meta-analysis based on 932 reported mutations available in a searchable database.BMC Genet. 2005; 6: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and presents the double cyclin fold topology (see Fig. 1), a highly conserved structural motif found in a nuclear regulatory protein superfamily that includes cyclins, the basal transcription factor TFIIB, and “pocket” family members p107, p130, and Rb, all of which function as protein recognition modules (22Noble M.E.

Evidence for a protein domain superfamily shared by the cyclins, TFIIB and RB/p107.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 946-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The double cyclin fold is formed by two five-helix structural cores with additional helices in each family (18Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P.

In RbAB, the A and B cyclin folds present five and three additional helices, respectively, and are connected by a 60-residue flexible linker (20Burke J.R. Hura G.L. Rubin S.M. Structures of inactive retinoblastoma protein reveal multiple mechanisms for cell cycle control.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both subdomains associate through an extensive 2013-Å2 interface formed by a compact hydrophobic core (18Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P. Structure of the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor pocket domain bound to a peptide from HPV E7.Nature. 1998; 391: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The RbAB domain contains two highly conserved protein interaction surfaces, the LXCXE and E2F clefts. Cellular factors containing the LXCXE motif such as SWI/SNF complexes, DNMT1, Rbp2, and HDAC1/2 mediate transcriptional repression and chromatin regulation (21Dick F.A.

An Rb knock-in allele carrying a mutation that prevents binding to the LXCXE cleft promotes tumor formation and chromosome instability in p53-deficient mice (25Coschi C.H. Martens A.L. Ritchie K.

The E2F cleft, located at the A/B interface, binds to a helical motif from the E2F transactivation domain (E2F-TD) (18Lee J.O. Russo A.A. Pavletich N.P.

Dyson N.J. Conserved functions of the pRB and E2F families.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 713-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Both the LXCXE and E2F clefts are targeted by viral proteins, among them the small DNA tumor virus proteins HPV E7, adenovirus E1A, and polyomavirus T antigen, highlighting their importance for virus-mediated control of the host cell cycle (27de Souza R.F. Iyer L.M. Aravind L. Diversity and evolution of chromatin proteins encoded by DNA viruses.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Protein conformational stability and dynamics are closely linked to their function and mechanisms of inactivation (28Cremades N. Sancho J. Freire E. The native-state ensemble of proteins provides clues for folding, misfolding and function.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 494-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as low thermodynamic stabilities can cause native states to be highly sensitive to destabilizing mutations, and aggregation-prone forms of proteins may be involved in disease (29Gidalevitz T.

Moreover, unstable or highly dynamic proteins may also be more sensitive to proteolysis in vivo (31Khoo K.H. Mayer S. Fersht A.R. Effects of stability on the biological function of p53.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30974-30980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies have provided insights into the mechanisms of inactivation of the p53 and p16INKA tumor suppressors (32Tang K.S. Guralnick B.J. Wang W.K. Fersht A.R. Itzhaki L.S.

Structural biology of the tumor suppressor p53.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 557-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Mutation of the multifunctional p53 protein in over 50% of human cancers leads to either loss of function or dominant negative oncogenic gain of function phenotypes (33Joerger A.C. Fersht A.R.

Mutant p53: one name, many proteins.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1268-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), whereas loss of function or overexpression of the CDK4/6 inhibitor p16INKA is also a hallmark of multiple types of cancer (34Freed-Pastor W.A. Prives C. Mutant p53: one name, many proteins.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1268-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 35Witkiewicz A.K. Knudsen K.E. Dicker A.P. Knudsen E.S.

Tumorigenic mutations in the marginally stable p53 core domain (p53CD) and in p16INK4A yield unstable proteins that are unfolded and prone to aggregation under physiological conditions (32Tang K.S.

Despite their central importance in gene regulatory and protein interaction networks, current knowledge of the structure-function relationships and conformational stability of cyclin fold proteins is very scarce (21Dick F.A. Structure-function analysis of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein—is the whole a sum of its parts?.Cell Div. 2007; 2: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although a few studies from TFIIB and Cyclin A suggest that these proteins have low stability and a high plasticity (38Wang X. Ren J. Qu X.

However, the conformational stability and dynamics of Rb or its domains have not been studied to date. This type of work is fundamental for developing effective therapeutic approaches targeting Rb and for understanding its role as a hub in a large protein signaling network. Biophysical studies of multidomain proteins such as Rb are challenging because they frequently present low levels of recombinant expression, have disordered regions, and are prone to aggregation, making them difficult to handle in vitro. In these cases, the domain fragmentation approach presents a valuable starting point that provides information on the properties of individual domains, setting the basis for studies of larger fragments or the full-length protein, as exemplified by its success in the study of the p53 tumor suppressor (33Joerger A.C. Fersht A.R. Structural biology of the tumor suppressor p53.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 557-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Although the behavior of individual domains may be modified by domain interactions in vivo, the properties of major domains within multidomain proteins frequently have a strong impact on the full-length protein. For example, the stability and levels of folded p53 in vivo are dictated by the p53CD (43Ang H.C. Joerger A.C. Mayer S. Fersht A.R.

Biol. 2011; 409: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this work, we present the first report on the conformational stability and folding of the RbAB pocket domain, which presents the main interaction sites with both cellular and viral proteins and is the site of most tumorigenic point mutations. We show that RbAB is marginally stable and presents multiple conformations in solution including a folding intermediate in which the LXCXE and E2F binding sites are disrupted. Based on our results, we discuss the possibility that, similar to other clinically relevant tumor suppressors, RbAB marginal stability may underlie its inactivation in cancer. These properties may be an evolutionarily conserved feature of cyclin fold superfamily proteins that allows the multiple interactions involved in cell signaling regulatory networks. The human RbAB domain (residues 372–787) was expressed and purified as described previously (47Chemes L.B. Sánchez I.E. Smal C. de Prat-Gay G. Targeting mechanism of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by a prototypical viral oncoprotein. Structural modularity, intrinsic disorder and phosphorylation of human papillomavirus E7.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sample was stored in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT. Protein purity was >95% as judged by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). The purified domain was homogeneous and monomeric as indicated by static light scattering measurements (see below), which yielded a molecular mass of 49 kDa. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method or by UV spectroscopy using a molar extinction coefficient for RbAB (ϵ280 nm = 43,350 m−1·cm−1) (48Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. How to measure and predict the molar absorption coefficient of a protein.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3434) Google Scholar). The E7 peptides used in this work have been described previously in detail (47Chemes L.B. Sánchez I.E. Smal C. de Prat-Gay G.

Structural modularity, intrinsic disorder and phosphorylation of human papillomavirus E7.FEBS J. 2010; 277: 973-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry (W. M. Keck Facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Peptides were quantified by UV absorbance at 276 nm, and peptides lacking tyrosine residues were quantified by absorbance at 220 nm. Unless stated otherwise, measurements were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT at 20 ± 0.1 °C using analytical grade chemical reagents (Sigma-Aldrich or ICN). The average molecular weight of RbAB was determined on a Precision Detectors PD2010 light scattering instrument connected in tandem to a high performance liquid chromatography system and an LKB 2142 differential refractometer. We used a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (24-ml) gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and injected 150 μl of a 1 mg/ml (∼20 μm) protein sample at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The buffer was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The 90° light scattering and refractive index signals of the eluting material were recorded on a PC computer and analyzed with the Discovery32 software supplied by Precision Detectors. Measurements were performed on a Zetasizer Nano S DLS device from Malvern Instruments. 10 μm RbAB samples in different solvent conditions were prepared and filtered prior to measurement with Ultrafree-MC microcentrifuge filters (0.22 μm; Millipore). The average hydrodynamic radius and standard deviation were calculated by Gaussian fitting of the particle size distribution curves using the instrument software. The average number of monomers (n) in the oligomeric RbAB samples was calculated from the average volume (v) and hydrodynamic radius of the ensemble (RS) where the Rmon is the radius of a native RbAB monomer (Rmon = 3.85 nm) and 1.2 is the average relationship between the hydrodynamic radii of partially folded and native monomers (49Uversky V.N.

Near-UV CD measurements were performed in the 250–360 nm range using the same equipment parameters at high sensitivity and 50–90 μm RbAB concentration.

https://openalex.org/W1984610576,"The formate dehydrogenases (Fdh) Fdh-O, Fdh-N, and Fdh-H, are the only proteins in Escherichia coli that incorporate selenocysteine at a specific position by decoding a UGA codon. However, an excess of selenium can lead to toxicity through misincorporation of selenocysteine into proteins. To determine whether selenocysteine substitutes for cysteine, we grew Escherichia coli in the presence of excess sodium selenite. The respiratory Fdh-N and Fdh-O enzymes, along with nitrate reductase (Nar) were co-purified from wild type strain MC4100 after anaerobic growth with nitrate and either 2 µM or 100 µM selenite. Mass spectrometric analysis of the catalytic subunits of both Fdhs identified the UGA-specified selenocysteine residue and revealed incorporation of additional, ‘non-specific’ selenocysteinyl residues, which always replaced particular cysteinyl residues. Although variable, their incorporation was not random and was independent of the selenite concentration used. Notably, these cysteines are likely to be non-essential for catalysis and they do not coordinate the iron-sulfur cluster. The remaining cysteinyl residues that could be identified were never substituted by selenocysteine. Selenomethionine was never observed in our analyses. Non-random substitution of particular cysteinyl residues was also noted in the electron-transferring subunit of both Fdhs as well as in the subunits of the Nar enzyme. Nar isolated from an E. coli selC mutant also showed a similar selenocysteine incorporation pattern to the wild-type indicating that non-specific selenocysteine incorporation was independent of the specific selenocysteine pathway. Thus, selenide replaces sulfide in the biosynthesis of cysteine and misacylated selenocysteyl-tRNACys decodes either UGU or UGC codons, which usually specify cysteine. Nevertheless, not every UGU or UGC codon was decoded as selenocysteine. Together, our results suggest that a degree of misincorporation of selenocysteine into enzymes through replacement of particular, non-essential cysteines, is tolerated and this might act as a buffering system to cope with excessive intracellular selenium."
https://openalex.org/W1977601088,"The testis zinc finger protein (Tzfp), also known as Repressor of GATA, belongs to the BTB/POZ zinc finger family of transcription factors and is thought to play a role in spermatogenesis due to its remarkably high expression in testis. Despite many attempts to find the in vivo role of the protein, the molecular function is still largely unknown. Here, we address this issue using a novel mouse model with a disrupted Tzfp gene. Homozygous Tzfp null mice are born at reduced frequency but appear viable and fertile. Sertoli cells in testes lacking Tzfp display an increase in Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling, and several genes in the testis, including Gata1, Aie1 and Fanc, show increased expression. Our results indicate that Tzfp function as a transcriptional regulator and that loss of the protein leads to alterations in AR signaling and reduced number of apoptotic cells in the testicular tubules."
https://openalex.org/W2011713193,"Molecular typing is an important tool in the investigation of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) outbreaks and in following the evolution of MRSA. The staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) contains a hypervariable region with a variable number of 40 bp repeats named direct repeat units (dru). The dru region has been suggested as a supplementary typing method for MRSA and an international nomenclature exists. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diversity and variability of the dru region in a diverse collection of MRSA. We studied 302 MRSA isolates harbouring SCCmec types I to VI. The isolates represented a broad genetic background based on Staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and included 68 isolates (68 patients) from an outbreak with t024-ST8-IVa and 26 isolates from the same patient. Sequencing identified 53 dru types (dt) in 283 isolates, while eighteen isolates contained no dru repeats and one isolate resisted sequencing. The most common dru type, dt10a, was present in 53% of the sequenced isolates and was found in all SCCmec types, except type II. Seven (10%) of the 68 epidemiologically related patients had isolates with dru type variants indicating that dru typing is not useful as a first line epidemiological typing tool. However, MRSA isolates cultured from a single patient over a three year period exhibited a single dru type. The finding of dt10a in most SCCmec types suggests that dru and mecA originate from the same Staphylococcus species."
https://openalex.org/W2025712860,"Ryanodine receptor channels (RyR) are key components of striated muscle excitation-contraction coupling, and alterations in their function underlie both inherited and acquired disease. A full understanding of the disease process will require a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms and structures involved in RyR function. Unfortunately, high-resolution structural data, such as exist for K(+)-selective channels, are not available for RyR. In the absence of these data, we have used modeling to identify similarities in the structural elements of K(+) channel pore-forming regions and postulated equivalent regions of RyR. This has identified a sequence of residues in the cytosolic cavity-lining transmembrane helix of RyR (G(4864)LIIDA(4869) in RyR2) analogous to the glycine hinge motif present in many K(+) channels. Gating in these K(+) channels can be disrupted by substitution of residues for the hinge glycine. We investigated the involvement of glycine 4864 in RyR2 gating by monitoring properties of recombinant human RyR2 channels in which this glycine is replaced by residues that alter gating in K(+) channels. Our data demonstrate that introducing alanine at position 4864 produces no significant change in RyR2 function. In contrast, function is altered when glycine 4864 is replaced by either valine or proline, the former preventing channel opening and the latter modifying both ion translocation and gating. Our studies reveal novel information on the structural basis of RyR gating, identifying both similarities with, and differences from, K(+) channels. Glycine 4864 is not absolutely required for channel gating, but some flexibility at this point in the cavity-lining transmembrane helix is necessary for normal RyR function."
https://openalex.org/W2016931262,"MARCKS (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate) is a peripheral membrane protein, especially abundant in the nervous system, and functionally related to actin organization and Ca-calmodulin regulation depending on its phosphorylation by PKC. However, MARCKS is susceptible to be phosphorylated by several different kinases and the possible interactions between these phosphorylations have not been fully studied in intact cells. In differentiating neuroblasts, as well as some neurons, there is at least one cell-type specific phosphorylation site: serine 25 (S25) in the chick. We demonstrate here that S25 is included in a highly conserved protein sequence which is a Cdk phosphorylatable region, located far away from the PKC phosphorylation domain. S25 phosphorylation was inhibited by olomoucine and roscovitine in neuroblasts undergoing various states of cell differentiation in vitro. These results, considered in the known context of Cdks activity in neuroblasts, suggest that Cdk5 is the enzyme responsible for this phosphorylation. We find that the phosphorylation by PKC at the effector domain does not occur in the same molecules that are phosphorylated at serine 25. The in situ analysis of the subcellular distribution of these two phosphorylated MARCKS variants revealed that they are also segregated in different protein clusters. In addition, we find that a sustained stimulation of PKC by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) provokes the progressive disappearance of phosphorylation at serine 25. Cells treated with PMA, but in the presence of several Ser/Thr phosphatase (PP1, PP2A and PP2B) inhibitors indicated that this dephosphorylation is achieved via a phosphatase 2A (PP2A) form. These results provide new evidence regarding the existence of a novel consequence of PKC stimulation upon the phosphorylated state of MARCKS in neural cells, and propose a link between PKC and PP2A activity on MARCKS."
https://openalex.org/W2021508031,A key step for the survival of the malaria parasite is the release from and subsequent invasion of erythrocytes by the merozoite. Differences in the efficiency of these two linked processes have a direct impact on overall parasite burden in the host and thereby virulence. A number of parasite proteases have recently been shown to play important roles during both merozoite egress as well as merozoite invasion. The rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii has been extensively used to investigate the mechanisms of parasite virulence in vivo and a number of important proteins have been identified as being key contributors to pathology. Here we have utilized transcriptional comparisons to identify two protease-like SERAs as playing a potential role in virulence. We show that both SERAs are non-essential for blood stage development of the parasite though they provide a subtle but important growth advantage in vivo. In particular SERA2 appears to be an important factor in enabling the parasite to fully utilize the whole age repertoire of circulating erythrocytes. This work for the first time demonstrates the subtle contributions different protease-like SERAs make to provide the parasite with a maximal capacity to successfully maintain an infection in the host.
https://openalex.org/W2084322179,"Legionella pneumophila infects humans to produce legionellosis and Pontiac fever only from environmental sources. In order to establish control measures and study the sources of outbreaks it is essential to know extent and distribution of strain variants of this bacterium in the environment. Sporadic and outbreak-related cases of legionellosis have been historically frequent in the Comunidad Valenciana region (CV, Spain), with a high prevalence in its Southeastern-most part (BV). Environmental investigations for the detection of Legionella pneumophila are performed in this area routinely. We present a population genetics study of 87 L. pneumophila strains isolated in 13 different localities of the BV area irrigated from the same watershed and compare them to a dataset of 46 strains isolated in different points of the whole CV. Our goal was to compare environmental genetic variation at two different geographic scales, at county and regional levels. Genetic diversity, recombination and population structure were analyzed with Sequence-Based Typing data and three intergenic regions. The results obtained reveal a low, but detectable, level of genetic differentiation between both datasets, mainly, but not only, attributed to the occurrence of unusual variants of the neuA locus present in the BV populations. This differentiation is still detectable when the 10 loci considered are analyzed independently, despite the relatively high incidence of the most common genetic variant in this species, sequence type 1 (ST-1). However, when the genetic data are considered without their associated geographic information, four major groups could be inferred at the genetic level which did not show any correlation with sampling locations. The overall results indicate that the population structure of these environmental samples results from the joint action of a global, widespread ST-1 along with genetic differentiation at shorter geographic distances, which in this case are related to the common watershed for the BV localities."
https://openalex.org/W2109140221,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease. Beta-amyloid peptides (Aβ) are responsible for neuronal death both in vitro and in vivo. Previously, L17 and F19 residues were identified as playing key roles in the stabilization of the Aβ40 conformation and in the reduction of its neurotoxicity. In this study, the effects of L17A/F19A mutations on the neurotoxicity of Aβ genetic mutant Arctic-type Aβ40(E22G) were tested. The results showed that compared to Aβ40(E22G), Aβ40(L17A/F19A/E22G) reduced the rate of conformation conversion, aggregation, and cytotoxicity, suggesting that L17 and F19 are critical residues responsible for conformational changes which may trigger the neurotoxic cascade of Aβ. Aβ40(L17A/F19A/E22G) also had decreased damage due to reactive oxygen species. The results are consistent with the discordant helix hypothesis, and confirm that residues 17-25 are in the discordant helix region. Compared to Aβ40(L17A/F19A), reduction in aggregation of Aβ40(L17A/F19A/E22G) was less significantly decreased. This observation provides an explanation based on the discordant helix hypothesis that the mutation of E22 to G22 of Aβ40(E22G) alters the propensity of the discordant helix. Arctic-type Aβ40(E22G) aggregates more severely than wild-type Aβ40, with a consequential increase in toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2114611989,"Background Studies examining the impact of organised acute stroke care interventions on survival in subgroups of stroke patients remain limited. Aims This study examined the effects of a range of evidence-based interventions of acute stroke care on one year survival post-stroke and determined the size of the effect across different socio-demographic and clinical subgroups of patients. Methods Data on 4026 patients with a first-ever stroke recruited to the population-based South London Stroke Register between 1995 and 2010 were used. In uni-variable analyses, one year cumulative survival rates in socio-demographic groups and by care received was determined. Survival functions were compared using Log-rank tests. Multivariable Cox models were used to test for interactions between components of care and age group, sex, ethnic group, social class, stroke subtype and level of consciousness. Results 1949 (56.4%) patients were admitted to a stroke unit. Patients managed on a stroke unit, those with deficits receiving specific rehabilitation therapies and those with ischaemic stroke subtype receiving aspirin in the acute phase had better one year survival compared to those who did not receive these interventions. The greatest reduction in the hazards of death among patients treated on a stroke unit were in the youngest patients aged <65 years, (HR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.25–0.62), and those with reduced levels of consciousness, GCS <9, (HR: 0.44; CI: 0.33–0.58). Conclusions There was evidence of better one year survival in patients receiving specific acute interventions after stroke with a significantly greater effect in stroke subgroups, suggesting the possibility of re-organising stroke services to ensure that the most appropriate care is made accessible to patients likely to derive the most benefits from such interventions."
