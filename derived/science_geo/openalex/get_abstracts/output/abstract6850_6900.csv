https://openalex.org/W1486602990,"The proenzyme of a Ca2+-dependent protease-activated protein kinase previously obtained from mammalian tissues (Inoue, M., Kishimoto, A., Takai, Y., and Nishizuka, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7610-7616) was enzymatically fully active without limited proteolysis when Ca2+ and a membrane-associated factor were simultaneously present in the reaction mixture. The activation process was reversed by removing Ca2+ with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. An apparent Ka value for Ca2+ was less than 5 x 10(-5) M. Other divalent cations were inactive except for Sr2+, which was 5% as active as Ca2+. The factor was almost exclusively localized in membrane fractions of various tissues including brain, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, blood cells, and adipose tissue. It was easily extractable with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and was recovered in the phospholipid fraction. In fact, this membrane factor could be replaced by chromatographically pure phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, or diphosphatidylglycerol. Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin were far less effective under the comparable conditions. Ca2+-dependent modulator protein was unable to support enzymatic activity. The enzyme thus activated showed an ability to phosphorylate five histone fractions and muscle phosphorylase kinase, and appeared to possess multifunctional catalytic activities."

Under simulated physiological conditions, hydrolysis of emulsified fat droplets by human pancreatic lipase in the presence of colipase and bile salt micelles proceeds with the sequential formation of two visible product phases. A lamellar liquid crystalline or crystalline phase containing calcium and ionized fatty acid forms first; this is followed by the production of a ""viscous isotropic"" phase composed predominantly of monoglycerides and protonated fatty acids."

Most of the accumulated drug appeared to be intracellular and bound to dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme blocked by methotrexate in its role as an antineoplastic agent."

These results demonstrate a difference in function between morphologically similar cells obtained from the same tissue. Such findings represent an important consideration in the study of cell aging in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1594682500,"The chemical structure of Band 3 glycopeptide prepared from erythrocytes of normal adult (blood group OI), umbilical cord vessels (Oi), and an i adult variant who fails to develop I antigen (Oi), has been compared. Band 3 glycopeptide of cord erythrocytes gave, on permethylation analysis, predominantly 2,4,6-tri-O-methylgalactose and 3,6-di-O-methyl-2-N-methylacetamido-2-deoxyglucose, whereas the same glycopeptide of normal adult erythrocytes gave much higher amounts of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methylgalactose and 2,4-di-O-methylgalactose as compared with that of cord erythrocytes. Band 3 glycopeptide from i adult showed the same methylation pattern as cord-Band 3 glycopeptide. In accordance with these results, Band 3 glycopeptide of cord and i adult erythrocytes were hydrolyzed to mostly small oligosaccharides by endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii, whereas that of normal adult produced a number of oligosaccharides with various sizes which was caused by branched structures. Based on these results and structures of released oligosaccharides, the major developmental change of carbohydrate structure in the erythrocyte membrane is the conversion of linear repeating Galbeta1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta1 leads to 3Gal to a branched Galbeta 1 leads to 4GlcNAcbeta 1 leads to 3 (R leads to 6) Gal structure. i individual may result from the lack of the branching enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2054724103,"The intraventricular injection of D-alanine-methionine-enkephalinamide (D-Ala2-Met-enkephalinamide), a synthetic analog of Met-enkephalin that is resistant to enzymatic degradation, inhibits copulatory behavior in sexually vigorous male rats in doses which do not influence motor activity or feeding behavior. This effect is prevented by naloxone, a specific inhibitor of opioid receptors. In addition, injections of naloxone induce copulatory behavior in sexually inactive male rats. These results suggest that endorphins play an important role in the regulation of sexual behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2020824119,"The time for the long-term clearance of dust from human lungs was measured. Three heavy cigarette smokers and nine nonsmokers inhaled a harmless trace amount of magnetic dust, Fe3O4. From periodic measurements with a sensitive magnetic detector of the amount of this dust remaining in the lungs, a clearance curve was determined for each subject. This magnetic tracer method allows clearance to be safely followed for a much longer time than with radioactive tracer methods. The dust clearance in the smokers is considerably slower than in the nonsmokers. After about a year, 50 percent of the dust originally deposited remained in the lungs of the smokers whereas only 10 percent remained in the lungs of the nonsmokers. The smokers therefore retained five times more dust than the nonsmokers. This impaired clearance of Fe3O4 suggests impaired clearance in smokers of other dusts, such as toxic occupational and urban dusts. The higher retention of these dusts may contribute to the higher incidence of lung diseases in smokers."
https://openalex.org/W1519675396,"The effect of the transmembrane potential (delta psi) and the proton concentration gradient (delta pH) across the chromaffin granule membrane upon the rate and extent of catecholamine accumulation was studied in isolated bovine chromaffin granules. Freshly isolated chromaffin granules had an intragranular pH of 5.5 as measured by [14C]methylamine distribution. The addition of ATP to a suspension of granules resulted in the generation of a membrane potential, positive inside, as measured by [14C]thiocyanate (SCN-) distribution. The addition of carboxyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a proton translocator, resulted in a reversal of the potential to negative values (measured by [3H]tetramethylphenylphosphonium (TPMP+)) approaching -90 mV. Changing the external pH of a granular suspension incubated with FCCP produced a linear perturbation in the measured potential from positive to negative values, which can be explained by the distribution of protons according to their electrochemical gradient. When ammonia (1 to 50 mM) was added to highly buffered suspensions of chromaffin granules there was a dose-dependent decrease in the transmembrane proton gradient (delta pH) and an increase in the membrane potential (delta psi). On the other hand, thiocyanate or FCCP, at varying concentration, produced a dose-related collapse of the membrane potential and had no effect upon the transmembrane proton gradient. The addition of larger concentrations of catecholamines caused a decrease in the transmembrane proton gradient and an increase in the membrane potential. Time-resolved influx of catecholamines into the granules was studied radiochemically using low external catecholamine concentrations. The accumulation of epinephrine or norepinephrine was over one order of magnitude greater in the presence of ATP than in its absence. The rate and extent of amine accumulation was found to be related to the magnitude of the membrane potential at fixed transmembrane proton concentration (delta pH) values. Likewise, the accumulation was related to the magnitude of the delta pH at fixed membrane potential values. These results suggest that the existence of both a transmembrane proton gradient and a membrane potential are required for optimal catecholamine accumulation to occur."
https://openalex.org/W1971827912,Melatonin fulfills many of the criteria for classification as a hormone. Until recently it was considered to be elaborated exclusively by pineal organs. Melatonin synthesis by other tissues has been indicated but not demonstrated unequivocally. Trout retinas in a whole-organ culture system in vitro synthesized tritiated melatonin from a substrate containing tritiated serotonin. This raises the possibility that the trout retina is an endocrine organ.
https://openalex.org/W2083149991,"Of the proteins in mechanically disrupted chicken gizzard fibers (no functional sarcolemma) only the 20,000-dalton light chains of myosin underwent large Ca2+-and Sr2+-dependent changes in phosphorylation. Phosphorylation closely corresponded with the Ca2+- and Sr2+-activated tensions. Adenosine 5'-O (3'-thiotriphosphate) only in the presence of Ca2+ induced irreversible Ca2+-insensitive activation of tension and thiophosphorylation of the 20,000-dalton light chains, and blocked incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]adenosine triphosphate into the myosin light chains."
https://openalex.org/W2050677366,"Mathematical analysis and computer and network simulations of the cochlea show that, given appropriate values of specific physical constants, radial shear motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina may provide the sharpening of frequency analysis observed in cochlear nerve fibers in comparison with the mechanical amplitude distribution on the basilar membrane. According to the analysis, the sharpening occurs through an interaction of the longitudinal mechanical propagation constant of the tectorial membrane with the wavelength on the basilar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1965963335,A method for measuring hydroxylase cofactor activity in human cerebrospinal fluid is described. The hydroxylase cofactor content of cerebrospinal fluid from Parkinsonian patients is approximately 50 percent that of normal subjects. A significant correlation between hydroxylase cofactor and the concentration of homovanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid was observed.

To investigate the effects of glucocorticoids on metallothionein synthesis we adapted HeLa cells to growth in a defined medium lacking hydrocortisone. In this defined medium, containing 1.5 × 10-6M Zn2+, dexamethasone (10-6M) caused a five- to sixfold increase in the synthesis of metallothionein. Progesterone (10-5M), a known antagonist of glucocorticoids, inhibited this response by 50 percent."

Displacements occur at the cement lines and are responsible for part or all of the long-term deformation. The absence of an asymptotic creep strain is consistent with an interpretation of the cement line as a viscous interface.

We compared the effect of TCDD toxicity in iron-deficient mice with that in mice receiving a normal diet. Porphyria did not develop in the iron-deficient animals, and these animals were also protected from hepatocellular damage and certain other toxic effects of TCDD."

https://openalex.org/W2081293666,"2-Deoxy-[14C]glucose metabolism was examined in brains of hypoxic, normotensive rats by autoradiography, which revealed alternating cortical columns of high and low metabolism. Activity in white matter was increased severalfold over that in adjacent gray matter. The columns were anatomically related to penetrating cortical arteries with areas between arteries demonstrating higher rates of metabolism. The results suggest the presence of interarterial tissue oxygen gradients that influence regional glucose metabolism. The relatively greater sensitivity of white matter metabolism to hypoxia may lead to an understanding of white matter damage in postanoxic leukoencephalopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1984236880,"The caudal neurosecretory peptide urotensin II rapidly inhibits by 30 percent the short-circuit current across the isolated skin of a marine teleost. The effect appears to be specific and cannot be attributed to actions of epinephrine, urotensin I, or arginine vasotocin. The results strongly suggest that urotensin II may act directly on ion-transporting cells involved in teleostean hypoosmoregulation."

https://openalex.org/W1986587060,"Estradiol-binding proteins with the properties of putative estrogen receptors are present in cytosol extracts of embryonic mouse hypothalamus and other brain regions. These embryonic estrogen receptors are adultlike in their high affinity and limited capacity for estradiol, sensitivity to diethylstilbestrol, ability to adhere to DNA, and behavior during DNA-cellulose affinity chromatography. As early as 4 days before birth, mouse hypothalamus has approximately 40 percent of the adult concentration of hypothalamic estrogen receptors with these properties. These observations raise the possibility that embryonic rodent brain has the biochemical potential to respond to sex hormones and that the critical period of brain sexual differentiation could be initiated prenatally."
https://openalex.org/W1530164759,"An improved procedure for the isolation of interferons produced by mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells infected with Newcastle disease virus provides interferons of three size classes (33,000, 26,000, and 20,000 daltons) with specific activities between 2 and 3 x 10(9) units/mg of protein and a yield of 11 to 20%. The tryptic peptide maps of the two larger species are very similar; that of the smallest species is different, at least in part. The amino acid compositions of the three species are very close. Their NH2-terminal amino acids are identical and so are the amino acids released by carboxypeptidase A treatment. These data are consistent with the possibility that the differences in size between the three species may be due, at least in part, to unequal glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1995967376,"Acetyl ethyl tetramethyl tetralin (AETT), a component of soaps, deodorants, and cosmetics, produces hyperirritability and limb weakness in rats repeatedly exposed to the compound. Brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are discolored blue, show progressive neuronal ceroid degeneration, and develop spectacular myelin bubbling. These neurotoxic properties of AETT provide the basis for industry's decision to withdraw the compound from consumer products. In addition, AETT offers the experimentalist a new probe to explore the etiology and pathogeneses of human ceroid and myelin diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2011967537,The vascular smooth muscle of cerebral blood vessels is relatively insensitive to sympathomimetic stimulation compared with muscle from systemic vessels. The transition in the vertebral artery occurs just rostral to the emergence of that artery from the foramen of the lateral process of the atlas and in the internal carotid artery just before it enters the carotid canal. These sites in the adult correspond to embryological junctions between segments of the vertebral and internal carotid arteries derived from the primitive dorsal aortas and their branches with vessels originating locally from the bilateral longitudinal neural arteries. Topographic patterns of vascular properties may in some cases be explained by the different sites of origin of their primordial mesodermal cells.
https://openalex.org/W1544893308,"Concentrations of trypsin that bring about aggregation of hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells also release from the cell surface an Mr = 55,000 glycopeptide fragment. This glycopeptide fragment also accumulates in the medium, including serum-free medium, as a normal consequence of membrane protein turnover. The trypsin-released glycopeptide is labeled when cells are grown in the presence of fucose or leucine before treatment of the cells with the protease. Similarly, the glycopeptide fragment can be labeled by reacting cells in situ by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed radioiodination or by tritiated borohydride reduction of cells treated first with neuraminidase and galactose oxidase. The tryptic glycopeptide fragment was purified by concanavalin A-Sepharose chromatography, and hydroxyapatite chromatography in the presence of dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid and carbohydrate composition was determined, as was the sensitivity of the purified glycopeptide to a variety of endo- and exoglycosidases. The purified glycopeptide contains an average of 17 sialic acid residues and hence, shows charge heterogeneity after electrophoresis in isoelectric focusing gels. The charge heterogeneity can be eliminated completely by treatment with neuraminidase. The glycopeptide after this treatment is homogeneous. The trypsin-sensitive membrane glycoprotein which is the source of the Mr = 55,000 glycopeptide was identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of labeled cells, treated or not treated with trypsin. This glycoprotein, which has an apparent molecular weight of 85,000 and forms a homodimer in the presence of calcium ions, was purified and its identity as the parent of the Mr = 55,000 glycopeptide was confirmed by showing that the same Mr = 55,000 fragment was released by trypsin from the purified glycoprotein as was released from the intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1979006365,"Microspectrophotometric investigations of visual pigments in the teleost family Cichlidae determined that morphological ""twin cones"" need not be ""pigment twins"" as well. In each species there were two pigments that could be found in these cells; a ""longwave"" and a ""shortwave"" type whose precise spectral location varies for each species, making the terms red and green inadequate to describe them. Studies of the receptor mosaic with the nitro-blue tetrazolium chloride reduction technique permitted the sampling of larger receptor populations and confirmed that twin cones in several cichlid species could be either longwave-longwave, longwave-shortwave, or shortwave-shortwave pairs, and that the relative proportions of these twin cone types vary in different parts of the retinas. Nonuniform distribution of pigment types was also evident in the eyes of several other species from a variety of piscine taxa."
https://openalex.org/W1972849306,"Single cell activity and local field potentials in parastriate cortex of cats and rabbits were studied during a Pavlovian discrimination procedure. Cell activity was selectively modified; conditioned changes occurred in response either to the reinforced stimulus or to the unreinforced one, but not to both.

Afterdischarges initiated in either the ventral or dorsal hippocampal formation, without activation of the ventral subicular cortex, increased glucose utilization in the lateral septum. In contrast, afterdischarges initiated by direct activation of the ventral subicular cortex increased glucose utilization in extensive areas of the ipsilateral amygdala, claustrum, hypothalamus, preoptic region, and basal forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W2150885250,Evidence is presented that the GTP initially bound in ternary complex (Met-tRNAf.GTP.eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2)) is the same GTP that is hydrolyzed to allow joining of a 40 S preinitiation complex with 60 S subunits. This evidence was obtained by two quite dissimilar techniques. The first was a kinetic analysis of AUG-directed methionyl-puromycin synthesis using either eIF-2 of eIF-2A to direct the binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S subunits. The second technique was the isolation of 40 S preinitiation complexes by Sepharose 6B chromatography and subsequent quantitation of GTP hydrolysis and methionyl-puromycin synthesis under conditions where 80 S complex formation is permitted.

https://openalex.org/W2055145748,"In siamese cats, each side of the brain receives a retinal input serving part of the ipsilateral visual field as well as the normal contralateral field representation. Both corticothalamic and cortico-cortical projections are systematically rearranged, but while one is retinotopically appropriate, the other fails to make a distinction between ipsilateral and contralateral fields. Different rules appear to govern the development of these two sets of connections."
https://openalex.org/W1570492172,"A combined stopped flow-laser photolysis apparatus was used to measure the quantum efficiency for removal of carbon monoxide bound to human hemoglobin as a function of fractional CO saturation. This flow-flash technique allows the properties of partially liganded hemoglobin molecules, which are sparsely populated under equilibrium conditions, to be conveniently studied. Experiments performed at pH 7 and 20 degrees C both in the presence and absence of phosphates gave a similar dependence of quantum efficiency on fractional saturation. The observed quantum efficiency was 0.90 +/- 0.06 at 10% saturation and decreased to 0.47 +/- 0.02 as full saturation was approached. An allosteric model in which Hb(CO)1 has a quantum efficiency of 0.99 while other liganded species have quantum efficiencies of 0.47 was used to produce a good simulation of the results."
https://openalex.org/W1595024935,"Receptor-chromatin complexes were recovered from prostatic chromatin digested with micrococcal nuclease. The fragments of chromatin were separated on linear 7.6 to 76% (v/v) glycerol density gradients. With extensive digestion of DNA, receptor labeled with [1,2-3H]dihydrotestosterone was released from the chromatin. After 5% digestion of DNA to acid-soluble products, only a trace amount of labeled receptor was detected in the unbound form. In the latter instance, most of the labeled receptor was recovered from the gradients in association with five A260 peaks representing oligomeric and monomeric nucleosomes with a repeat length of 182 +/- 14 (mean +/- S.D.) base pairs. The concentration of receptors was highest in the A260 peaks, which contained large oligomers of nucleosomes, and lowest in fractions containing primarily monomer structures. Hence, the extent to which receptors remained bound to chromatin was dependent on the relative amount of intact, linker DNA present."
https://openalex.org/W2091721541,"By using 4.45-angstrom radiation generated by Cl+15 ions in a laser plasma and nanosecond exposures, low-angle x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained from dried rat spinal nerves and a powder of cholesterol. Three to four 400-picosecond, 45-joule pulses were required for the exposure. This new technique should have wide application in structural kinetic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2068474267,"Occluding junctions have been found between the lateral cell borders at the base of the rectum of Periplaneta americana. They appear as punctate membrane appositions in thin sections, and after incubation in physiological solutions containing lanthanum before fixation the inward penetration of tracer is impeded in this same basal area. Moreover, freeze-fracture studies of this region reveal simple linear ridges on fracture face P and grooves on fracture face E, which are similar to the less complex vertebrate tight junctions. The luminal clefts, which permit free inward diffusion of tracers, present no tight junctions, but do have septate junctions. These results support the contention that, contrary to earlier speculation, arthropods do possess tight junctions; these, rather than septate junctions, appear to form the morphological basis of at least some of the permeability barriers observed in invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1551656147,"Previous studies have shown that platelet membranes bind radiolabeled ADP and have nucleoside diphosphokinase activity which transforms added ADP to ATP. In order to further characterize these reactions, the ADP-binding and nucleoside diphosphokinase activity of purified platelet membranes were solubilized by freeze-thaw injury followed by extraction with isotonic buffered saline. Up to 80% of membrane ADP-binding activity was solubilized along with 20% of the total membrane protein, a 4-fold purification. A Millipore filter binding assay was developed to detect the soluble binding protein using [3H]ADP as radioligand. Binding of [3H]ADP was rapid, reversible, saturable, and was destroyed by heat, trypsin digestion, and 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide. By Scatchard analysis, there was a single class of binding sites with a Kd of 3.8 x 10(-7) M. Unlabeled nucleotides competed with [3H]ADP with the following potency series: ATP = ADP greater than AMP greater than adenosine. The solubilized nucleoside diphosphokinase activity could be separated from ADP-binding activity by ultracentrifugation on 5 to 20% sucrose density gradients containing 0.6 M KCl suggesting that the activities reside on separate molecules. Hydrodynamic parameters were calculated for the binding protein by gel filtration and ultracentrifugation. The s20,w was 4.1, Stoke's radius 35 x 10(-8)cm, axial ratio (f/fo) 1.09, and the Mr = 61,000. The studies suggest that this platelet ADP-binding protein may act as the receptor for initiating ADP-induced aggregation and release."
https://openalex.org/W1608716905,"Bovine pituitary RNA was translated in heterologous cell-free systems derived from wheat germ and reticulocyte lysate. Analyses of the cell-free products by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed three major proteins, exhibiting apparent molecular weights of 25,000, 24,000, and 14,000. The two larger products were identified as preprolactin and pregrowth hormone by immunoprecipitation and thus demonstrated the fidelity of pituitary RNA translation. The 14,000-dalton product was shown to be immuno-precipitable with specific bovine lutropin (LH)alpha antisera. Since this protein is 3000 to 4000 daltons larger than the apoprotein form of the alpha subunits, it suggests that the subunit is synthesized in precursor form. The immunological specificity was further demonstrated by the successful competition with unlabeled alpha subunit plus the failure to immunoprecipitate this product using specific antisera to other pituitary hormones. Although specific antisera to bTSH(thyrotropin)beta and bLH(lutropin)beta failed to immunoprecipitate the 14,000-dalton product, LHbeta antisera precipitated a product with a molecular weight of approximately 18,000. Since the alpha and beta antisera specifically precipitated different products, and since a larger immunoprecipitable product was not detected, the results suggest that the two subunits are synthesized separately."

https://openalex.org/W2165841586,"Abstract Lipid content of purified fatty acid synthetase preparations from the Dipterous Ceratitis capitata correlated with the enzyme activity. Delipidation of the enzyme by extracting with a series of organic solvents rendered a protein without any residual activity and the treatment with phospholipase A2 for 30 min reduced the activity to 10%. Addition of lipid classes to either the native enzyme or the phospholipase-treated preparation enhanced the activity in a different manner, phosphatidylethanolamine being the most effective lipid. The role of the lipids in the lipoprotein structure of the complex was studied by circular dichroism spectra of the native enzyme and in the presence of a concentration range of urea, guanidinium chloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium cholate, and sodium chloride. 3 M urea and 1.5 M guanidinium chloride induced a conformational transition of the lipoprotein that lost its alpha-helical structure at higher concentrations of both reagents. Sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium cholate had little effect on the alpha-helical structure, although both reagents induced the loss of enzyme activity. Cholate had essentially the same effect as phospholipids on the maintenance of the native structure but it was unable to support the enzyme activity."

https://openalex.org/W2071273644,"A study was made of the function of the intervening sequences in the ovalbumin gene, Radioactively labeled DNA probes for the intervening sequences were prepared and RNA's were isolated from whole cells, nuclei, and polysomes of estrogen-stimulated chick oviducts. The concentrations of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts from ovalbumin structural sequences (mRNAov) and transcripts corresponding to intervening sequences were then estimated by hybridization to cloned DNA probes. Oviduct tissue contains approximately 58,000 molecules of mRNAov sequences per tubular gland cell and most of these sequences are present in the cytoplasm. In contrast, there are 200 to 300 molecules of RNA per cell which are transcribed from the intervening sequences of the natural ovalbumin gene and almost all of these are found in the nucleus. The difference in distribution of structural and intervening sequence transcripts suggests that, unlike mature mRNA, the intervening sequences are not preferentially transported to cytoplasmic polysomes."
https://openalex.org/W1590071765,"A binding protein with apparent specificity for beta-glucuronidase has been partially purified from a Triton X-100 extract of rat liver microsomes by affinity chromatography on glucuronidase-Sepharose 2B. It appears that once removed from the membrane, this binding protein self-aggregates to form large macromolecular complexes. With the use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation assays to monitor the conversion of glucuronidase tetramer to a very high molecular weight complex, it was shown that the binding activity is heatlabile and protease-sensitive. However, binding activity is not influenced by salts, carbohydrates, other proteins or glycoproteins, or by extensive periodate oxidation of beta-glucuronidase, nor does binding occur with any other protein tested. The binding protein does not discriminate against any form of beta-glucuronidase from any rat organ tested. However, the binding protein does show organ localization, being present in the liver and kidney but not the spleen. The possible relationship of this binding protein to egasyn, a membrane protein which stabilizes beta-glucuronidase in mouse liver endoplasmic reticulum, is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1484432968,"The reaction of apohemoglobin with carbonmonoxy heme and with carbonmonoxy heme dimethyl ester was investigated in the presence and absence of inositol hexaphosphate. The binding stoichiometry of both heme derivatives to apohemoglobin was not affected by the presence of the polyphosphate, while, in both cases, the overall rate of recombination was substantially decreased. The absence of the negatively charged carboxyl groups in the dimethyl ester derivative of the heme indicated that the effect of inositol hexaphosphate on the reaction of apohemoglobin with heme was not due to electrostatic repulsions and resulted from conformational changes occurring upon the interaction of apohemoglobin with inositol hexaphosphate. Qualitative treatment of the kinetic data suggests that these conformational changes destabilize the intermediates of the reaction by increasing their redissociation into the original components. Also, benzenehexacarboxylate produced conformational changes in apohemoglobin and decreased its rate of reaction with carbonmonoxy heme, proving the aspecificity of the interaction of apohemoglobin with polyanions."

The minor activity fraction contained an electron donor for the reduction of cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoate to trans-11-octadecenoate. After oxidation, the electron donor could be reduced by the dithionite, thereby accounting for the previously observed capacity of cell-free extracts of the bacterium to carry out the biohydrogenation of the conjugated dienoic fatty acid."

These compounds are N-octanoyl-D-threo-p-nitrophenylaminopropanediol (Compound I), N-(2,3-epoxydecanoyl)-norephedrine (Compound II), and N-decyl-N'-glucosylthiourea (Compound III). In the presence of up to 0.5 mM Compound I, only the hydroxyceramide fromation increased, while the synthesis of the other three lipids decreased. Compound II strongly inhibited the formation of all four lipids at all concentrations tested (0.1 to 1 mM). Compound III increased the synthesis of both ceramides approximately 2-fold at 1 mM, but the conversion of lignoceric acid to both cerebrosides remained relatively unchanged. Several significant conclusions from these observations are discussed."
