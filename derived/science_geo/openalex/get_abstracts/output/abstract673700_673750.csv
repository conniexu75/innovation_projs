https://openalex.org/W3160990818,"Abstract Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a major public health problem for which currently available treatments are modestly effective. We report the findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03537014) to test the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for the treatment of patients with severe PTSD, including those with common comorbidities such as dissociation, depression, a history of alcohol and substance use disorders, and childhood trauma. After psychiatric medication washout, participants ( n = 90) were randomized 1:1 to receive manualized therapy with MDMA or with placebo, combined with three preparatory and nine integrative therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms, measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5, the primary endpoint), and functional impairment, measured with the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS, the secondary endpoint) were assessed at baseline and at 2 months after the last experimental session. Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study. MDMA was found to induce significant and robust attenuation in CAPS-5 score compared with placebo ( P &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.91) and to significantly decrease the SDS total score ( P = 0.0116, d = 0.43). The mean change in CAPS-5 scores in participants completing treatment was −24.4 (s.d. 11.6) in the MDMA group and −13.9 (s.d. 11.5) in the placebo group. MDMA did not induce adverse events of abuse potential, suicidality or QT prolongation. These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3160568774,"As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads through human populations, the unprecedented accumulation of viral genome sequences is ushering in a new era of 'genomic contact tracing'-that is, using viral genomes to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because the viral phylogeny is already so large-and will undoubtedly grow many fold-placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a barrier to real-time genomic contact tracing. Here, we resolve this challenge by building an efficient tree-based data structure encoding the inferred evolutionary history of the virus. We demonstrate that our approach greatly improves the speed of phylogenetic placement of new samples and data visualization, making it possible to complete the placements under the constraints of real-time contact tracing. Thus, our method addresses an important need for maintaining a fully updated reference phylogeny. We make these tools available to the research community through the University of California Santa Cruz SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser to enable rapid cross-referencing of information in new virus sequences with an ever-expanding array of molecular and structural biology data. The methods described here will empower research and genomic contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2 specifically for laboratories worldwide."

We generated LRS data from 3,622 Icelanders and identified a median of 22,636 SVs per individual (a median of 13,353 insertions and 9,474 deletions). We discovered a set of 133,886 reliably genotyped SV alleles and imputed them into 166,281 individuals to explore their effects on diseases and other traits. We discovered an association of a rare deletion in PCSK9 with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, compared to the population average. We also discovered an association of a multiallelic SV in ACAN with height; we found 11 alleles that differed in the number of a 57-bp-motif repeat and observed a linear relationship between the number of repeats carried and height. These results show that SVs can be accurately characterized at the population scale using LRS data in a genome-wide non-targeted approach and demonstrate how SVs impact phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3162303048,"COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening respiratory failure, with increased inflammatory mediators and viral load. Here, we perform single-cell RNA-sequencing to establish a high-resolution map of blood antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in 15 patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia, at day 1 and day 4 post admission to intensive care unit or pulmonology department, as well as in 4 healthy donors. We generated a unique dataset of 81,643 APCs, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multi-process defects in antiviral immune defence in specific APCs from patients with severe disease: (1) increased pro-apoptotic pathways in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, key effectors of antiviral immunity), (2) a decrease of the innate sensors TLR9 and DHX36 in pDCs and CLEC9a+ DCs, respectively, (3) downregulation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in monocyte subsets and (4) a decrease of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-related genes and MHC class II transactivator activity in cDC1c+ DCs, suggesting viral inhibition of antigen presentation. These novel mechanisms may explain patient aggravation and suggest strategies to restore the defective immune defence. Saichi et al. performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 and uncovered defects in antiviral immune response in specific APC subsets."
https://openalex.org/W3161909955,"Advanced technologies for controlled delivery of light to targeted locations in biological tissues are essential to neuroscience research that applies optogenetics in animal models. Fully implantable, miniaturized devices with wireless control and power-harvesting strategies offer an appealing set of attributes in this context, particularly for studies that are incompatible with conventional fiber-optic approaches or battery-powered head stages. Limited programmable control and narrow options in illumination profiles constrain the use of existing devices. The results reported here overcome these drawbacks via two platforms, both with real-time user programmability over multiple independent light sources, in head-mounted and back-mounted designs. Engineering studies of the optoelectronic and thermal properties of these systems define their capabilities and key design considerations. Neuroscience applications demonstrate that induction of interbrain neuronal synchrony in the medial prefrontal cortex shapes social interaction within groups of mice, highlighting the power of real-time subject-specific programmability of the wireless optogenetic platforms introduced here."
https://openalex.org/W3160556312,"Background Most patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics despite the fact that bacterial co-infections are rare. This can lead to increased complications, including antibacterial resistance. We aim to analyze risk factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription in these patients and describe possible complications arising from their use. Methods The SEMI-COVID-19 Registry is a multicenter, retrospective patient cohort. Patients with antibiotic were divided into two groups according to appropriate or inappropriate prescription, depending on whether the patient fulfill any criteria for its use. Comparison was made by means of multilevel logistic regression analysis. Possible complications of antibiotic use were also identified. Results Out of 13,932 patients, 3047 (21.6%) were prescribed no antibiotics, 6116 (43.9%) were appropriately prescribed antibiotics, and 4769 (34.2%) were inappropriately prescribed antibiotics. The following were independent factors of inappropriate prescription: February-March 2020 admission (OR 1.54, 95%CI 1.18–2.00), age (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.97–0.99), absence of comorbidity (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.05–1.94), dry cough (OR 2.51, 95%CI 1.94–3.26), fever (OR 1.33, 95%CI 1.13–1.56), dyspnea (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.04–1.69), flu-like symptoms (OR 2.70, 95%CI 1.75–4.17), and elevated C-reactive protein levels (OR 1.01 for each mg/L increase, 95% CI 1.00–1.01). Adverse drug reactions were more frequent in patients who received ANTIBIOTIC (4.9% vs 2.7%, p &lt; .001). Conclusion The inappropriate use of antibiotics was very frequent in COVID-19 patients and entailed an increased risk of adverse reactions. It is crucial to define criteria for their use in these patients. Knowledge of the factors associated with inappropriate prescribing can be helpful."

https://openalex.org/W3163558436,"The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1, is exploited in cancer to activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor suppressors. However, despite considerable efforts, Pin1 has remained an elusive drug target. Here, we screened an electrophilic fragment library to identify covalent inhibitors targeting Pin1's active site Cys113, leading to the development of Sulfopin, a nanomolar Pin1 inhibitor. Sulfopin is highly selective, as validated by two independent chemoproteomics methods, achieves potent cellular and in vivo target engagement and phenocopies Pin1 genetic knockout. Pin1 inhibition had only a modest effect on cancer cell line viability. Nevertheless, Sulfopin induced downregulation of c-Myc target genes, reduced tumor progression and conferred survival benefit in murine and zebrafish models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma, and in a murine model of pancreatic cancer. Our results demonstrate that Sulfopin is a chemical probe suitable for assessment of Pin1-dependent pharmacology in cells and in vivo, and that Pin1 warrants further investigation as a potential cancer drug target."

https://openalex.org/W3162545971,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) harbor recurrent chromosome 3q amplifications that target the transcription factor SOX2. Beyond its role as an oncogene in ESCC, SOX2 acts in development of the squamous esophagus and maintenance of adult esophageal precursor cells. To compare Sox2 activity in normal and malignant tissue, we developed engineered murine esophageal organoids spanning normal esophagus to Sox2-induced squamous cell carcinoma and mapped Sox2 binding and the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape with evolution from normal to cancer. While oncogenic Sox2 largely maintains actions observed in normal tissue, Sox2 overexpression with p53 and p16 inactivation promotes chromatin remodeling and evolution of the Sox2 cistrome. With Klf5, oncogenic Sox2 acquires new binding sites and enhances activity of oncogenes such as Stat3. Moreover, oncogenic Sox2 activates endogenous retroviruses, inducing expression of double-stranded RNA and dependence on the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. These data reveal SOX2 functions in ESCC, defining targetable vulnerabilities. The transition from normal esophageal tissue to squamous carcinoma is characterized by an altered SOX2 cistrome. This transcriptional reprogramming activates endogenous retroviruses and double-stranded RNA expression, creating a dependency on the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1."
https://openalex.org/W3163420826,"Functional circuits consist of neurons with diverse axonal projections and gene expression. Understanding the molecular signature of projections requires high-throughput interrogation of both gene expression and projections to multiple targets in the same cells at cellular resolution, which is difficult to achieve using current technology. Here, we introduce BARseq2, a technique that simultaneously maps projections and detects multiplexed gene expression by in situ sequencing. We determined the expression of cadherins and cell-type markers in 29,933 cells and the projections of 3,164 cells in both the mouse motor cortex and auditory cortex. Associating gene expression and projections in 1,349 neurons revealed shared cadherin signatures of homologous projections across the two cortical areas. These cadherins were enriched across multiple branches of the transcriptomic taxonomy. By correlating multigene expression and projections to many targets in single neurons with high throughput, BARseq2 provides a potential path to uncovering the molecular logic underlying neuronal circuits. Sun et al. present BARseq2, a high-throughput method combining in situ sequencing of endogenous mRNAs with barcode-based axonal projection mapping, and apply it to identify cadherins that correlate with similar projections in two cortical areas."

https://openalex.org/W3161977826,"In cancer cells, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal alterations and/or increased deposition of acetylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) can support oncogene expression. However, how the chromatin conformation of enhancer-promoter interactions is affected by these events is unclear. In the present study, by comparing chromatin structure and H3K27ac levels in normal and lymphoma B cells, we show that enhancer-promoter-interacting regions assume different conformations according to the local abundance of H3K27ac. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of H3K27ac decreases the frequency and the spreading of these interactions, altering oncogene expression. Moreover, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocations influences the epigenetic status of the regions flanking the breakpoint, prompting the formation of distinct intrachromosomal interactions in the two homologous chromosomes. These interactions are accompanied by allele-specific gene expression changes. Overall, our work indicates that H3K27ac dynamics modulates interaction frequency between regulatory regions and can lead to allele-specific chromatin configurations to sustain oncogene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3160369250,"Epithelial cells rapidly adapt their behaviour in response to increasing tissue demands. However, the processes that finely control these cell decisions remain largely unknown. The postnatal period covering the transition between early tissue expansion and the establishment of adult homeostasis provides a convenient model with which to explore this question. Here, we demonstrate that the onset of homeostasis in the epithelium of the mouse oesophagus is guided by the progressive build-up of mechanical strain at the organ level. Single-cell RNA sequencing and whole-organ stretching experiments revealed that the mechanical stress experienced by the growing oesophagus triggers the emergence of a bright Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) committed basal population, which balances cell proliferation and marks the transition towards homeostasis in a yes-associated protein (YAP)-dependent manner. Our results point to a simple mechanism whereby mechanical changes experienced at the whole-tissue level are integrated with those sensed at the cellular level to control epithelial cell fate. McGinn et al. show that mechanical stretch in the developing oesophagus promotes the YAP-dependent emergence of a KLF4+ committed basal cell population, revealing how physiological strain triggers the transition to adult homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3161753028,"The diagnosis of COVID-19 is of vital demand. Several studies have been conducted to decide whether the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of patients indicate COVID-19. While these efforts resulted in successful classification systems, the design of a portable and cost-effective COVID-19 diagnosis system has not been addressed yet. The memory requirements of the current state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis systems are not suitable for embedded systems due to the required large memory size of these systems (e.g., hundreds of megabytes). Thus, the current work is motivated to design a similar system with minimal memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis system using a Raspberry Pi Linux embedded system. First, local features are extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm. Second, the global features are extracted from the chest X-ray or CT scans using multi-channel fractional-order Legendre-Fourier moments (MFrLFMs). Finally, the most significant features (local and global) are selected. The proposed system steps are integrated to fit the low computational and memory capacities of the embedded system. The proposed method has the smallest computational and memory resources,less than the state-of-the-art methods by two to three orders of magnitude, among existing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W3160918054,"The objective of this study was to explore the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic on ongoing and upcoming drug clinical trials. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinical trial staff and clinical trial subjects were surveyed by questionnaire in this study. The results of interviews and questionnaire showed that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to many changes in the implementation of drug clinical trials, including: a variety of meetings being held online webinars using various platforms, telemedicine and follow-up by video, A large number of deviations from protocol and losses of follow-up, delivery of clinical trial drugs by express, additional workload caused by screening for coronavirus, and anxiety of subjects. These results suggest that the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has hindered the progress and damaged the quality of clinical trials. The online meeting, remote follow-up, express delivery of drugs and remote monitoring in the epidemic environment can ensure the progress of clinical trials to a certain extent, but they cannot fully guarantee the quality as before."
https://openalex.org/W3161534496,"Physiological need states direct decision-making toward re-establishing homeostasis. Using a two-alternative forced choice task for mice that models elements of human decisions, we found that varying hunger and thirst states caused need-inappropriate choices, such as food seeking when thirsty. These results show limits on interoceptive knowledge of hunger and thirst states to guide decision-making. Instead, need states were identified after food and water consumption by outcome evaluation, which depended on the medial prefrontal cortex. Eiselt et al. report conditions under which mice confuse thirst for hunger, similar to some human decisions that lead to over-eating. Evaluation of physiological need state requires consuming food or water and depends on the prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3127199534,"Single-cell transcriptome analysis has been extensively applied in humans and animal models to uncover gene expression heterogeneity between the different cell types of a tissue or an organ. It demonstrated its capability to discover key regulatory elements that determine cell fate during developmental programs. Single-cell analysis requires the isolation and labeling of the messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from each cell. These challenges were primarily addressed in mammals by developing microfluidic-based approaches. For plant species whose cells contain cell walls, these approaches have generally required the generation of isolated protoplasts. Many plant tissues' secondary cell wall hinders enzymatic digestion required for individual protoplast isolation, resulting in an unequal representation of cell types in a protoplast population. This limitation is especially critical for cell types located in the inner layers of a tissue or the inner tissues of an organ. Consequently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies using microfluidic approaches in plants have mainly been restricted to Arabidopsis roots, for which well-established procedures of protoplast isolation are available. Here we present a simple alternative approach to generating high-quality protoplasts from plant tissue by characterizing the mRNA extracted from individual nuclei instead of whole cells. We developed the protocol using two different plant materials with varying cellular complexity levels and cell wall structure, Populus shoot apices, and more lignified stems. Using the 10× Genomics Chromium technology, we show that this procedure results in intact mRNA isolation and limited leakage, with a broad representation of individual cell transcriptomes."
https://openalex.org/W3161066440,"Coordination of stem cell function by local and niche-derived signals is essential to preserve adult tissue homeostasis and organismal health. The vasculature is a prominent component of multiple stem cell niches. However, its role in adult intestinal homeostasis remains largely understudied. Here we uncover a previously unrecognised crosstalk between adult intestinal stem cells in Drosophila and the vasculature-like tracheal system, which is essential for intestinal regeneration. Following damage to the intestinal epithelium, gut-derived reactive oxygen species activate tracheal HIF-1α and bidirectional FGF/FGFR signalling, leading to reversible remodelling of gut-associated terminal tracheal cells and intestinal stem cell proliferation following damage. Unexpectedly, reactive oxygen species-induced adult tracheal plasticity involves downregulation of the tracheal specification factor trachealess (trh) and upregulation of IGF2 messenger RNA-binding protein (IGF2BP2/Imp). Our results reveal an intestine-vasculature inter-organ communication programme that is essential to adapt the stem cell response to the proliferative demands of the intestinal epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W3162050238,"The Drosophila trachea, as the functional equivalent of mammalian blood vessels, senses hypoxia and oxygenates the body. Here, we show that the adult intestinal tracheae are dynamic and respond to enteric infection, oxidative agents and tumours with increased terminal branching. Increased tracheation is necessary for efficient damage-induced intestinal stem cell (ISC)-mediated regeneration and is sufficient to drive ISC proliferation in undamaged intestines. Gut damage or tumours induce HIF-1α (Sima in Drosophila), which stimulates tracheole branching via the FGF (Branchless (Bnl))-FGFR (Breathless (Btl)) signalling cascade. Bnl-Btl signalling is required in the intestinal epithelium and the trachea for efficient damage-induced tracheal remodelling and ISC proliferation. Chemical or Pseudomonas-generated reactive oxygen species directly affect the trachea and are necessary for branching and intestinal regeneration. Similarly, tracheole branching and the resulting increase in oxygenation are essential for intestinal tumour growth. We have identified a mechanism of tracheal-intestinal tissue communication, whereby damage and tumours induce neo-tracheogenesis in Drosophila, a process reminiscent of cancer-induced neoangiogenesis in mammals."

Type 2 diabetic patients on follow up at Dilchora Referral Hospital who fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study were included. Systematic random sampling was used to select study participants. Data was collected by a face-to-face interview and review of medical records. The primary outcome was the level of blood glucose during three consecutive visits. Poor glycemic control was defined as a blood sugar level of more than 154 mg/dL based on the average of measurements from three consecutive visits. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify determinants of glycemic control.A total of 394 participants responded to the interview and were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of poor glycemic control was 45.2% (95%CI: 40.6%-50.0%). Patients who were on oral anti-diabetic drug plus insulin had more than two times greater chance of poor glycemic control than patients on oral anti-diabetic drug alone: 2.177(95%CI:1.10-4.29). The odds of poor glycemic control in patients who did not understand the pharmacist's instructions was two times higher than patients with good understanding of instructions 1.86(95%CI: 1.10-3.13). Patients who had poor level of practice were found to have poor glycemic control: 1.69(95% CI: 1.13-2.55).The overall prevalence of poor glycemic control was high among type 2 diabetes patients. Oral anti-diabetic drugs in combination with insulin, lack of understanding of pharmacist's advice, and poor practice of diabetic patients were significant factors of poor glycemic control. Pharmacists should reassure the understanding of patients before discharge during counseling. Optimization of the dose of antidiabetic medications and combination of oral hypoglycemic agents should be considered."

The strain with the highest level of antioxidant activity was selected and the fermentation process was further optimized via response surface methodology (RSM). Lactobacillus plantarum BCRC 11697 was chosen because, compared to other lactic acid bacteria, it exhibits increased free radical scavenging ability and can produce more phenolic compounds, DPPH (from 72.6% to 93.2%), and ABTS (from 64.2% to 76.9%). Using RSM, we further optimize the fermentation protocol of BCRC 11697 by adjusting the initial fermentation pH, agitation speed, and temperature to reach the highest level of antioxidant activity (73.5% of DPPH and 93.8% of ABTS). The optimal protocol (pH 5.55, 104 rpm, and 24.4°C) resulted in a significant increase in the amount of phenolic compounds as well as the DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging ability of BCRC 11697 products. The IC 50 of the DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging ability were 0.33 and 2.35 mg/mL, respectively, and both protease and tannase activity increased after RSM. An increase in lower molecular weight (&lt;24 kDa) protein hydrolysates was also observed. Results indicated that djulis fermented by L . plantarum can be a powerful source of natural antioxidants for preventing free radical-initiated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3160001131,"The response of cells to forces is critical for their function and occurs via rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton1. Cytoskeletal remodelling is energetically costly2,3, yet how cells signal for nutrient uptake remains undefined. Here we present evidence that force transmission increases glucose uptake by stimulating glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). GLUT1 recruitment to and retention at sites of force transmission requires non-muscle myosin IIA-mediated contractility and ankyrin G. Ankyrin G forms a bridge between the force-transducing receptors and GLUT1. This bridge is critical for enabling cells under tension to tune glucose uptake to support remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of an epithelial barrier. Collectively, these data reveal an unexpected mechanism for how cells under tension take up nutrients and provide insight into how defects in glucose transport and mechanics might be linked."
https://openalex.org/W3163659804,"In recent years, the trigonometric families of continuous distributions have found a place of choice in the theory and practice of statistics, with the Sin-G family as leader. In this paper, we provide some contributions to the subject by introducing a flexible extension of the Sin-G family, called the transformed Sin-G family. It is constructed from a new polynomial-trigonometric function presenting a desirable “versatile concave/convex” property, among others. The modelling possibilities of the former Sin-G family are thus multiplied. This potential is also highlighted by a complete theoretical work, showing stochastic ordering results, studying the analytical properties of the main functions, deriving several kinds of moments, and discussing the reliability parameter as well. Then, the applied side of the proposed family is investigated, with numerical results and applications on the related models. In particular, the estimation of the unknown model parameters is performed through the use of the maximum likelihood method. Then, two real life data sets are analyzed by a new extended Weibull model derived to the considered trigonometric mechanism. We show that it performs the best among seven comparable models, illustrating the importance of the findings."

One of the major biotic threats to biodiversity in this region is the rapid spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS). Natural forests and grasslands are increasingly getting infested by IAS affecting regeneration of native species and decline in availability of bio-resources. Assessing the current status of IAS and prediction of their future spread would be vital for evolving specific species management interventions. Keeping this in view, we conducted an in-depth study on two IASs, viz., Ageratina adenophora and Lantana camara in the Indian part of Kailash Sacred Landscape (KSL), Western Himalaya. Intensive field surveys were conducted to collect the presence of A . adenophora ( n = 567) and L . camara ( n = 120) along an altitudinal gradient between 300 and 3000 m a.s.l. We performed Principal Component Analysis to nullify the multi-colinearity effects of the environmental predictors following MaxEnt species distribution model in the current and future climatic scenarios for both the species. All current and future model precision (i.e., Area Under the Curve; AUC) for both species was higher than 0.81. It is predicted that under the current rate of climate change and higher emission (i.e., RCP 8.5 pathway), A . adenophora will spread 45.3% more than its current distribution and is likely to reach up to 3029 m a.s.l., whereas, L . camara will spread 29.8% more than its current distribution range and likely to reach up to 3018 m a.s.l.

https://openalex.org/W3126349050,"Single-molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing can easily identify sites of N6-methyladenine and N4-methylcytosine within DNA sequences, but similar identification of 5-methylcytosine sites is not as straightforward. In prokaryotic DNA, methylation typically occurs within specific sequence contexts, or motifs, that are a property of the methyltransferases that “write” these epigenetic marks. We present here a straightforward, cost-effective alternative to both SMRT and bisulfite sequencing for the determination of prokaryotic 5-methylcytosine methylation motifs. The method, called MFRE-Seq, relies on excision and isolation of fully methylated fragments of predictable size using MspJI-Family Restriction Enzymes (MFREs), which depend on the presence of 5-methylcytosine for cleavage. We demonstrate that MFRE-Seq is compatible with both Illumina and Ion Torrent sequencing platforms and requires only a digestion step and simple column purification of size-selected digest fragments prior to standard library preparation procedures. We applied MFRE-Seq to numerous bacterial and archaeal genomic DNA preparations and successfully confirmed known motifs and identified novel ones. This method should be a useful complement to existing methodologies for studying prokaryotic methylomes and characterizing the contributing methyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W3159590018,"Background More than half of women of reproductive age in India have anemia. Over the last decade, India has made some progress towards reducing anemia in pregnant women, but non-pregnant women, who make up the largest sub group of people with anemia, are largely disregarded. Objectives The objective of this paper is to examine intentions to take iron supplements and factors associated with intentions to inform a social norms-based behavioral intervention to increase uptake of iron supplements and reduce anemia in Odisha, India. Methods We collected data from 3,914 randomly sampled non-pregnant women of reproductive age in 81 villages. We conducted a survey and took hemocue (anemia level) readings from each participant. We analyzed data using linear regression models beginning with demographics and social norms and adding other factors such as self-efficacy to take iron supplements, anemia risk perception, and knowledge about anemia in a subsequent model. Results 63% of women in our sample were anemic but less than 5% knew they were anemic. Despite national guidelines that all women of reproductive age should take weekly iron supplements to prevent anemia, less than 3% of women in our sample were currently taking them. While actual use was low, intentions were rather high. On a five point Likert scale where higher numbers meant more intentions to take supplements, average intentions were above the midpoint ( M = 3.48, SD = 1.27) and intentions and iron supplement use were significantly correlated ( r = .10, p &lt; .001). Both injunctive norms and collective norms were associated with intentions to take iron supplements but descriptive norms were not. Other significant factors included age, breastfeeding, knowledge, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations. The final model accounted for 74% of the variance in iron supplement intentions. Conclusions In this context, where the actual behavior is low but intentions to enact the behavior are high, starting an intervention with injunctive norms messaging (expectations around the behavior) and self-efficacy to enact the behavior is the step we recommend based on our results. As an intervention unfolds and iron supplement use increases, descriptive norms messaging (that people are indeed taking iron supplements) may add value."
https://openalex.org/W3161418144,"Chiari Malformation Type 1 (CM-1) is characterized by herniation of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum and the presence of headaches and other neurologic symptoms. Cranial bone constriction is suspected to be the most common biologic mechanism leading to CM-1. However, other mechanisms may also contribute, particularly in the presence of connective tissue disorders (CTDs), such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS). Accumulating data suggest CM-1 with connective tissue disorders (CTD+) may have a different patho-mechanism and different genetic risk factors than CM-1 without CTDs (CTD-). To identify CM-1 genetic risk variants, we performed whole exome sequencing on a single large, multiplex family from Spain and targeted sequencing on a cohort of 186 unrelated adult, Caucasian females with CM-1. Targeted sequencing captured the coding regions of 21 CM-1 and EDS candidate genes, including two genes identified in the Spanish family. Using gene burden analysis, we compared the frequency of rare, functional variants detected in CM-1 cases versus publically available ethnically-matched controls from gnomAD. A secondary analysis compared the presence of rare variants in these genes between CTD+ and CTD- CM-1 cases. In the Spanish family, rare variants co-segregated with CM-1 in COL6A5, ADGRB3 and DST. A variant in COL7A1 was present in affected and unaffected family members. In the targeted sequencing analysis, rare variants in six genes (COL7A1, COL5A2, COL6A5, COL1A2, VEGFB, FLT1) were significantly more frequent in CM-1 cases compared to public controls. In total, 47% of CM-1 cases presented with rare variants in at least one of the four significant collagen genes and 10% of cases harbored variants in multiple significant collagen genes. Moreover, 26% of CM-1 cases presented with rare variants in the COL6A5 gene. We also identified two genes (COL7A1, COL3A1) for which the burden of rare variants differed significantly between CTD+ and CTD- CM-1 cases. A higher percentage of CTD+ patients had variants in COL7A1 compared to CTD+ patients, while CTD+ patients had fewer rare variants in COL3A1 than did CTD- patients. In summary, rare variants in several collagen genes are particularly frequent in CM-1 cases and those in COL6A5 co-segregated with CM-1 in a Spanish multiplex family. COL6A5 has been previously associated with musculoskeletal phenotypes, but this is the first association with CM-1. Our findings underscore the contribution of rare genetic variants in collagen genes to CM-1, and suggest that CM-1 in the presence and absence of CTD symptoms is driven by different genes."
https://openalex.org/W3162989084,"The use of drones for triage in mass-casualty incidents has recently emerged as a promising technology. However, there is no triage system specifically adapted to a remote usage. Our study aimed to develop a remote triage procedure using drones. The research was performed in three stages: literature review, the development of a remote triage algorithm using drones and evaluation of the algorithm by experts. Qualitative synthesis and the calculation of content validity ratios were done to achieve the Aerial Remote Triage System. This algorithm assesses (in this order): major bleeding, walking, consciousness and signs of life; and then classify the injured people into several priority categories: priority 1 (red), priority 2 (yellow), priority 3 (green) and priority * (violet). It includes the possibility to indicate save-living interventions to injured people and bystanders, like the compression of bleeding injuries or the adoption of the recovery position. The Aerial Remote Triage System may be a useful way to perform triage by drone in complex emergencies when it is difficult to access to the scene due to physical, chemical or biological risks."
https://openalex.org/W3162051708,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an independent risk factor for mortality, which affects about 5% of hospitalized coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients and up to 25–29% of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine show in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have been used for the treatment of COVID-19. Both, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The impact of a triple therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) on kidney function in COVID-19 is currently not known. Methods We retrospectively analyzed both non-ICU and ICU patients with COVID-19 receiving triple therapy for the incidence of AKI. Patients receiving standard therapy served as a control group. All patients were hospitalized at the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, between March and April 2020. A matched-pair analysis for the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 was performed to control for the severity of illness among non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Results In non-ICU patients, the incidence of AKI was markedly increased following triple therapy (78.6% vs. 21.4% in controls, p = 0.002), while a high incidence of AKI was observed in both groups of ICU patients (triple therapy: 80.0%, control group: 90.5%). ICU patients treated with triple therapy showed a trend towards more oliguric or anuric kidney injury. We also observed a linear correlation between the duration of the triple therapy and the maximum serum creatinine level (p = 0.004, R 2 = 0.276, R = 0.597). Conclusion Triple therapy is associated with an increase in the incidence of AKI in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. The underlying mechanisms may comprise a CYP3A4 enzyme interaction, and may be relevant for any future therapy combining hydroxychloroquine with antiviral agents."
https://openalex.org/W3140705184,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and is caused by the loss of expression of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). In animal model of FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to an aberrant rate of neuronal protein synthesis, which in turn is believed to be at the origin of defects regarding spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Normalisation of protein synthesis in these models has been associated with a rescue of FXS behavioral and biochemicals phenotype, thus establishing the rate of protein synthesis as one of the most promising monitoring biomarker for FXS. However, rate of protein synthesis alteration in fragile X individuals is not well characterized.We applied a robust radiolabeled assay to measure rate of protein synthesis in freshly extracted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and blood platelets. We ultimately settle on PBMCs to measure and compare rate of protein synthesis in 13 males with fragile X and 14 matched controls individuals.Using this method, we measured a 26.9% decrease (p = 0,0193) in the rate of protein synthesis in fragile X individuals PBMCs. Furthermore, the rate of protein synthesis measurements obtained were highly reproducible, highlighting the robustness of the method.Our work presents the first evidence of a diminution of the rate of protein synthesis in a human peripheral model of fragile X. Our results also support the finding of previous studies using brain PET imaging in Fragile X individuals. Since our assay only requires a simple venous puncture, it could be used in other cases of intellectual disability in order to determine if an aberrant rate of protein synthesis is a common general mechanism leading to impairment in synaptic plasticity and to intellectual disability."
https://openalex.org/W3161321544,"Cells exert traction forces on the extracellular matrix to which they are adhered through the formation of focal adhesions. Spatial-temporal regulation of traction forces is crucial in cell adhesion, migration, cellular division, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. By cultivating cells on polyacrylamide hydrogels of different stiffness we were able to investigate the effects of substrate stiffness on the generation of cellular traction forces by Traction Force Microscopy (TFM), and characterize the molecular dynamics of the focal adhesion protein zyxin by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). As the rigidity of the substrate increases, we observed an increment of both, cellular traction generation and zyxin residence time at the focal adhesions, while its diffusion would not be altered. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between the traction forces exerted by cells and the residence time of zyxin at the substrate elasticities studied. We found that this correlation persists at the subcellular level, even if there is no variation in substrate stiffness, revealing that focal adhesions that exert greater traction present longer residence time for zyxin, i.e., zyxin protein has less probability to dissociate from the focal adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W3162063149,"Antimicrobial use (AMU) is estimated at the national level by using sales data (S-AMU) or insurance claims data (C-AMU). However, these data might be biased by generic drugs that are not sold through wholesalers (direct sales) and therefore not recorded in sales databases, or by claims that are not submitted electronically and therefore not stored in claims databases. We evaluated these effects by comparing S-AMU and C-AMU to ascertain the characteristics and limitations of each kind of data. We also evaluated the interchangeability of these data by assessing their relationship.We calculated monthly defined daily doses per 1,000 inhabitants per day (DID) using sales and claims data from 2013 to 2017. To assess the effects of non-electronic claim submissions on C-AMU, we evaluated trends in the S-AMU/C-AMU ratio (SCR). To assess the effects of direct sales of S-AMU, we divided AMU into generic and branded drugs and evaluated each SCR in terms of oral versus parenteral drugs. To assess the relationship between S-AMU and C-AMU, we created a linear regression and evaluated its coefficient.Median annual SCRs from 2013 to 2017 were 1.046, 0.993, 0.980, 0.987, and 0.967, respectively. SCRs dropped from 2013 to 2015, and then stabilized. Differences in SCRs between branded and generic drugs were significant for oral drugs (0.820 vs 1.079) but not parenteral drugs (1.200 vs 1.165), suggesting that direct sales of oral generic drugs were omitted in S-AMU. Coefficients of DID between S-AMU and C-AMU were high (generic, 0.90; branded, 0.84) in oral drugs but relatively low (generic, 0.32; branded, 0.52) in parenteral drugs.The omission of direct sales information and non-electronically submitted claims have influenced S-AMU and C-AMU information, respectively. However, these data were well-correlated, and it is considered that both kinds of data are useful depending on the situation."
https://openalex.org/W3162827720,"Platelets for transfusion are stored at room temperature (20–24°C) up to 7 days but decline in biochemical and morphological parameters during storage and can support bacterial proliferation. This decline is reduced with p38MAPK inhibitor, VX-702. Storage of platelets in the cold (4–6°C) can reduce bacterial proliferation but platelets get activated and have reduced circulation when transfused. Thermocycling (cold storage with brief periodic warm ups) reduces some of the effects of cold storage. We evaluated in vitro properties and in vivo circulation in SCID mouse model of human platelet transfusion of platelets stored in cold or thermocycled for 14 days with and without VX-702. Apheresis platelet units (N = 15) were each aliquoted into five storage bags and stored under different conditions: room temperature; cold temperature; thermocycled temperature; cold temperature with VX-702; thermocycled temperature with VX-702. Platelet in vitro parameters were evaluated at 1, 7 and 14 days. On day 14, platelets were infused into SCID mice to assess their retention in circulation by flow cytometry. VX-702 reduced negative platelet parameters associated with cold and thermocycled storage such as an increase in expression of activation markers CD62, CD63 and of phosphatidylserine (marker of apoptosis measured by Annexin binding) and lowered the rise in lactate (marker of increase in anaerobic metabolism). However, VX-702 did not inhibit agonist-induced platelet aggregation indicating that it does not interfere with platelet hemostatic function. In vivo, VX-702 improved initial recovery and area under the curve in circulation of human platelets infused into a mouse model that has been previously validated against a human platelet infusion clinical trial. In conclusion, inhibition of p38MAPK during 14-days platelet storage in cold or thermocycling conditions improved in vitro platelet parameters and platelet circulation in the mouse model indicating that VX-702 may improve cell physiology and clinical performance of human platelets stored in cold conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3163477862,"There is evidence that systemic therapy is effective, but there is little evidence about meaningful moments in systemic therapy in general, and none at all in systemic therapy for social anxiety disorders. Meaningful moments are one of the relevant research objects in change process research, as they contribute to a better understanding of therapeutic change. Objective The objective of this study is to characterize and describe meaningful moments in the context of systemic psychotherapy, from the point of view of patients and their therapists, after the end of therapy. The therapy studied is a manualized, monitored systemic therapy for social anxiety disorder. Method Semi-structured follow-up interviews were conducted separately with five patients and their therapists (N = 10). Methodological triangulation was used: Grounded theory was used to code the transcripts as described by Charmaz. Then the passages of the selected code “meaningful moment” were evaluated using thematic comparison, in line with Meuser &amp; Nagel. Findings Three categories involving meaningful moments were identified: (1) meeting other patients in group therapy session, (2) therapeutic resource orientation and (3) recognizing oneself in a diagnosis or pattern of behaviour. These categories emerged as contexts related to the occurrence of meaningful moments from a subjective perspective. Discussion Meaningful moments seem to be consistently related to the therapist input and to specific interventions or settings, both from the perspective of the patients and the therapists. Two tandems each described a coincident moment. One central aspect of all 14 moments is that the patients and therapists described patients being able to acquire another outlook on themselves."
https://openalex.org/W3162816173,"Molecular and cellular characteristics of the relapse-prone subset within triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unclear. Aberrant glycosylation is involved in the malignant behavior of cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to reveal glycan profiles unique to relapsed TNBC patients.Thirty TNBC patients who did not undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy but postoperative standard adjuvant therapy from 2009 through 2016 at Juntendo Hospital were investigated. TNBC cells were resected from primary breast cancer sections of formalin-fixed surgical specimens using laser-assisted microdissection. The binding intensities of the extracted glycoproteins to 45 lectins were quantified using lectin microarray and compared between relapsed and non-relapsed patients. Immunohistochemical staining with TJA-II lectin in specimen sections was performed.Five patients relapsed during the follow-up (range 37-123 months). Lectin microarray analysis revealed that 7 out of 45 lectins showed significant differences in binding intensity between the relapsed and the non-relapsed group. TJA-II, ACA, WFA, and BPL showed stronger binding in the relapsed group. PNGase F treatment of TNBC cell lysates suggested that TJA-II and ACA bind O-glycans. TJA-II staining of tissue sections revealed strong binding to cell surface membranes and to the cytoplasm of TNBC cells, but not to other types of cells. Significantly more TNBC cells were stained in tissue sections from relapsed than non-relapsed patients.TNBC cells from relapsed patients showed a unique lectin reactivity, with higher levels of TJA-II (also WFA and BPL) binding than in non-relapsed patients. The results are potentially useful to develop new prognostic and therapeutic tools."
https://openalex.org/W3161056323,"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic non-essential element, while calcium (Ca) is an essential element with high chemical similarity to Cd. Dietary intake is the major Cd exposure pathway for non-smokers. A multi-concentration dietary intervention experiment was designed to explore the optimum concentration of Ca in diet with obvious protective effects against the toxicity of livers and kidneys induced by Cd in mice. The mice were divided into six groups with different concentrations of Cd and Ca in their food: control-group (no Cd or Ca), Ca-group (100 g/kg Ca, without Cd), Cd-group (2 mg/kg Cd, without Ca), CaL+Cd-group (2 mg/kg Cd, 2 g/kg Ca), CaM+Cd-group (2 mg/kg Cd, 20 g/kg Ca) and CaH+Cd-group (2 mg/kg Cd, 100 g/kg Ca). The organ indexes, oxidative stress biomarkers, lesions and Cd concentrations were detected after a 30-day exposure period. Results showed that serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) level in CaH+Cd-group was significantly lower than that in Cd-group, while close to that in control-group. The contents of Serum Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) in different groups showed the same trend. Concentrations of all oxidative stress biomarkers (GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, GSH and MDA) in CaH+Cd-group were close to the normal levels of control-group while significantly different from those in Cd-group. The only exception was the Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in kidneys. This study suggests that Ca plays a protective role in relieving the Cd-induced toxicity of livers and kidneys and a concentration of 100 g/kg for Ca in diet showed the best protective effects. These findings could provide a clue for further studies concerning human diet intervention for Cd control."
https://openalex.org/W3161258393,"Progress in the manufacture of scaffolds in tissue engineering lies in the successful combination of materials such as bioceramics having properties as porosity, biocompatibility, water retention, protein adsorption, mechanical strength and biomineralization. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a ceramic material with lots of potential in tissue regeneration, however, its structural characteristics need to be improved for better performance. In this study, silica-hydroxyapatite (SiO 2 -HA) non-woven ceramic electrospunned membranes were prepared through the sol-gel method. Infrared spectra, scanning electron microscopy and XRD confirmed the structure and composition of composite. The obtained SiO 2 -HA polymeric fibers had approximately 230±20 nm in diameter and were then sintered at 800°C average diameter decreased to 110±17 nm. Three configurations of the membranes were obtained and tested in vitro, showing that the composite of SiO 2 -HA fibers showed a high percentage of viability on a fibroblast cell line. It is concluded that the fibers of SiO 2 -HA set in a coaxial configuration may be helpful to develop materials for bone regeneration."

There is limited evidence on nutritional status and associated factors among incarcerated people in low- income countries like Ethiopia, including the study area.To assess the magnitude of undernutrition and associated factors among incarcerated people in Mizan prison institute, southwest Ethiopia.An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 340 incarcerated people in Mizan prison institute from April 1 to 27, 2020, using a stratified sampling technique. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The outcome variable (undernutrition) was assessed by measuring body mass index (BMI). Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with undernutrition. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to measure the strength of association and a p-value less than 0.05 was used to declare the level of statistical significance.The magnitude of undernutrition was 18.6% (95%CI: 14.4%, 22.8%). Being in the age category of 18-29 years (AOR = 2.60; 95%CI: 1.22,5.52), history of previous incarceration (AOR = 2.31;95%CI: 1.23,4.34), duration of imprisonment (AOR = 1.19; 95%CI: 1.05,1.34), having depression (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI: 1.10,3.97) and sleeping in group (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.18,4.01) were factors significantly associated with an increased odds of undernutrition. However, the presence of family support significantly decreased (AOR = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.12, 0.69) the odds of undernutrition.The magnitude of undernutrition in the prison was found to be comparable to that of the general population in Ethiopia. The efforts on the ground to tackle undernutrition in the general population shall be extended to incarcerated people, especially by focusing on vulnerable groups such as those who had longer durations of incarceration, history of previous imprisonment, depression and no support."
https://openalex.org/W3163086857,"Background To assess the risk of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The CONCEPTION study was a cohort, multidisciplinary study conducted at Conception University Hospital, in France, from March 17th to May 11th, 2020. Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. Results A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital. All RT-PCR tests were negative and in 12 cases (2.2%), preoperative chest CT scans detected pulmonary lesions consistent with the diagnosis criteria for COVID-19. No scheduled surgery was postponed. One patient (0.2%) developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 days after a renal transplantation. No readmission or COVID-19 -related death within 30 days from surgery was recorded. Conclusions Minor surgery remained safe in the COVID-19 Era, as long as all appropriate protective measures were implemented. These data could be useful to public Health Authorities in order to improve surgical patient flow during a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3160245689,"In recent years, the price of pork in China continues to fluctuate at a high level. The forecast of pork price becomes more important. Single prediction models are often used for this work, but they are not accurate enough. This paper proposes a new method based on Census X12-GM(1,1) combination model.Monthly pork price data from January 2014 to December 2020 were obtained from the State Statistics Bureau(Mainland China). Census X12 model was adopted to get the long-term trend factor, business cycle change factor and seasonal factor of pork price data before September 2020. GM (1,1) model was used to fit and predict the long-term trend factor and business cycle change factor. The fitting and forecasting values of GM(1,1) were multiplied by the seasonal factor and empirical seasonal factor individually to obtain the fitting and forecasting values of the original monthly pork price series.The expression of GM(1,1) model for fitting and forecasting long-term trend factor and and business cycle change factor was X(1)(k) = -1704.80e-0.022(k-1) + 1742.36. Empirical seasonal factor of predicted values was 1.002 Using Census X12-GM(1,1) method, the final forecast values of pork price from July 2020 to December 2020 were 34.75, 33.98, 33.23, 32.50, 31.78 and 31.08 respectively. Compared with ARIMA, GM(1,1) and Holt-Winters models, Root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of Census X12-GM(1,1) method was the lowest on forecasting part.Compared with other single model, Census X12-GM(1,1) method has better prediction accuracy for monthly pork price series. The monthly pork price predicted by Census X12-GM(1,1) method can be used as an important reference for stakeholders."

https://openalex.org/W3161577283,"The demand for high value health care uncovered a steady trend in laboratory tests ordering and inappropriate testing practices. Residents' training in laboratory ordering practice provides an opportunity for quality improvement. We collected information on demographics, the main reason for the appointment, preexisting medical conditions and presence of co-morbidities from first-visit patients to the internal medicine outpatient service of our university general hospital. We also collected information on all laboratory tests ordered by the attending medical residents. At a follow-up visit, we recorded residents' subjective perception on the usefulness of each ordered laboratory test for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, treatment or screening. We observed that 17.3% of all ordered tests had no perceived utility by the attending resident. Tests were usually ordered to exclude differential diagnoses (26.7%) and to help prognosis estimation (19.1%). Age and co-morbidity influenced the chosen category to legitimate usefulness of tests ordering. This study suggests that clinical objectives (diagnosis, prognosis, treatment or prevention) as well as personalization to age and previous health conditions should be considered before test ordering to allow a more appropriate laboratory tests ordering, but further studies are necessary to examine this framework beyond this medical training scenario."
https://openalex.org/W3045826063,"Our computational developments and analyses on experimental images are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of chemical spraying via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Our evaluations are in accord with the two perspectives of color-complexity: color variety within a color system and color distributional geometry on an image. First, by working within RGB and HSV color systems, we develop a new color-identification algorithm relying on highly associative relations among three color-coordinates to lead us to exhaustively identify all targeted color-pixels. A color-dot is then identified as one isolated network of connected color-pixel. All identified color-dots vary in shapes and sizes within each image. Such a pixel-based computing algorithm is shown robustly and efficiently accommodating heterogeneity due to shaded regions and lighting conditions. Secondly, all color-dots with varying sizes are categorized into three categories. Since the number of small color-dot is rather large, we spatially divide the entire image into a 2D lattice of rectangular. As such, each rectangle becomes a collective of color-dots of various sizes and is classified with respect to its color-dots intensity. We progressively construct a series of minimum spanning trees (MST) as multiscale 2D distributional spatial geometries in a decreasing-intensity fashion. We extract the distributions of distances among connected rectangle-nodes in the observed MST and simulated MSTs generated under the spatial uniformness assumption. We devise a new algorithm for testing 2D spatial uniformness based on a Hierarchical clustering tree upon all involving MSTs. This new tree-based p-value evaluation has the capacity to become exact."
https://openalex.org/W3160050056,"While firefighters currently have low smoking rates, rates of smokeless tobacco (SLT) use among this population are remarkably high and substantially greater than similar occupational groups, and the general population. This study explored determinants associated with SLT use, barriers to cessation, and motivators for SLT cessation in the fire service. Key informant interviews were conducted in 23 career firefighters who were current (n = 14) and former (n = 9) SLT users from across the U.S. Discussions were recorded and independently coded according to questions and themes. Major themes that developed among firefighters regarding SLT use determinants included positive perceptions of SLT products, social influences from their peers and family members, acceptability of SLT use in the fire service, and a coping resource for job stress. Firefighters discussed several barriers to SLT cessation, including intrapersonal barriers such as SLT use habits and its dependency, concerns about withdrawal symptoms; and social-environmental barriers including lack of support from health and other services providers, and lack of enforcement of existing tobacco policies regarding SLT use. Firefighters also mentioned both internal and external motivators for cessation. Internal motivators included self-motivation and their health concerns while external motivators included friends and family support, incentives or rewards, and price of SLT products. Findings provide unique perspectives from firefighters on factors that influence SLT use and barriers and motivators to SLT cessation. These are insufficiently assessed and considered by the fire service organizations and their health care providers. Thus, the organizations must understand these issues in order to mitigate barriers and motivate the personnel to quit using SLT. Information gained from firefighters who were current and former SLT users can be used to develop an effective, culturally-tailored intervention that is acceptable to fire service personnel."
https://openalex.org/W3163823859,"Chlamydia trachomatis, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases in developed countries, with around 127 million new cases per year, is mainly responsible for urethritis and cervicitis in women, and urethritis and epididymitis in men. Most C. trachomatis infections remain asymptomatic (>50%) and, hence, untreated, leading to severe reproductive complications in both women and men, like infertility. Therefore, the detection of C. trachomatis as well as the antimicrobial susceptibility testing becomes a priority, and, along the years, several methods have been recommended, like cell culture and direct immunofluorescence (DFA) on cell cultures. Herein, we described the application of In-Cell Western assay (ICW) via Odyssey CLx as a fast, more accessible, and high-throughput platform for the quantification of C. trachomatis and the screening of anti-chlamydial drugs. As a first step, we set up a standard curve by infecting cell monolayers with 2-fold serial dilutions of C. trachomatis Elementary Body (EB) suspension. Then, different unknown C. trachomatis EB suspensions were quantified and the chlamydial susceptibility testing to erythromycin was performed, using the DFA as comparison. Our results showed a very high concordance between these two assays, as evidenced by the enumeration of chlamydial IFUs as well as the determination of erythromycin Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). In conclusion, the ICW assay may be a promising candidate as an accurate and accessible methodology for C. trachomatis antimicrobial susceptibility testing."
