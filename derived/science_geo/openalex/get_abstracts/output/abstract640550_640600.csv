https://openalex.org/W2979146632,"Bacterial dysbiosis accompanies carcinogenesis in malignancies such as colon and liver cancer, and has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA)1. However, the mycobiome has not been clearly implicated in tumorigenesis. Here we show that fungi migrate from the gut lumen to the pancreas, and that this is implicated in the pathogenesis of PDA. PDA tumours in humans and mouse models of this cancer displayed an increase in fungi of about 3,000-fold compared to normal pancreatic tissue. The composition of the mycobiome of PDA tumours was distinct from that of the gut or normal pancreas on the basis of alpha- and beta-diversity indices. Specifically, the fungal community that infiltrated PDA tumours was markedly enriched for Malassezia spp. in both mice and humans. Ablation of the mycobiome was protective against tumour growth in slowly progressive and invasive models of PDA, and repopulation with a Malassezia species-but not species in the genera Candida, Saccharomyces or Aspergillus-accelerated oncogenesis. We also discovered that ligation of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which binds to glycans of the fungal wall to activate the complement cascade, was required for oncogenic progression, whereas deletion of MBL or C3 in the extratumoral compartment-or knockdown of C3aR in tumour cells-were both protective against tumour growth. In addition, reprogramming of the mycobiome did not alter the progression of PDA in Mbl- (also known as Mbl2) or C3-deficient mice. Collectively, our work shows that pathogenic fungi promote PDA by driving the complement cascade through the activation of MBL."

https://openalex.org/W2977762340,"A Bose-Einstein condensate is the ground state of a dilute gas of bosons, such as atoms cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero. With much smaller mass, excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) are expected to condense at significantly higher temperatures. Here we study electrically generated interlayer excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 atomic double layers with density up to 10^12 cm-2. The interlayer tunneling current depends only on exciton density, indicative of correlated electron-hole pair tunneling. Strong electroluminescence (EL) arises when a hole tunnels from WSe2 to recombine with electron in MoSe2. We observe a critical threshold dependence of the EL intensity on exciton density, accompanied by a super-Poissonian photon statistics near threshold, and a large EL enhancement peaked narrowly at equal electron-hole densities. The phenomenon persists above 100 K, which is consistent with the predicted critical condensation temperature. Our study provides compelling evidence for interlayer exciton condensation in two-dimensional atomic double layers and opens up exciting opportunities for exploring condensate-based optoelectronics and exciton-mediated high-temperature superconductivity."

We performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of serum urate in 457,690 individuals, identifying 183 loci (147 previously unknown) that improve the prediction of gout in an independent cohort of 334,880 individuals. Serum urate showed significant genetic correlations with many cardiometabolic traits, with genetic causality analyses supporting a substantial role for pleiotropy. Enrichment analysis, fine-mapping of urate-associated loci and colocalization with gene expression in 47 tissues implicated the kidney and liver as the main target organs and prioritized potentially causal genes and variants, including the transcriptional master regulators in the liver and kidney, HNF1A and HNF4A. Experimental validation showed that HNF4A transactivated the promoter of ABCG2, encoding a major urate transporter, in kidney cells, and that HNF4A p.Thr139Ile is a functional variant. Transcriptional coregulation within and across organs may be a general mechanism underlying the observed pleiotropy between urate and cardiometabolic traits."
https://openalex.org/W2977409903,"Liver cancer remains difficult to treat, owing to a paucity of drugs that target critical dependencies1,2; broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib provide only a modest benefit to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma3. The induction of senescence may represent a strategy for the treatment of cancer, especially when combined with a second drug that selectively eliminates senescent cancer cells (senolysis)4,5. Here, using a kinome-focused genetic screen, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the DNA-replication kinase CDC7 induces senescence selectively in liver cancer cells with mutations in TP53. A follow-up chemical screen identified the antidepressant sertraline as an agent that kills hepatocellular carcinoma cells that have been rendered senescent by inhibition of CDC7. Sertraline suppressed mTOR signalling, and selective drugs that target this pathway were highly effective in causing the apoptotic cell death of hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with a CDC7 inhibitor. The feedback reactivation of mTOR signalling after its inhibition6 is blocked in cells that have been treated with a CDC7 inhibitor, which leads to the sustained inhibition of mTOR and cell death. Using multiple in vivo mouse models of liver cancer, we show that treatment with combined inhibition of of CDC7 and mTOR results in a marked reduction of tumour growth. Our data indicate that exploiting an induced vulnerability could be an effective treatment for liver cancer. CDC7 inhibition selectively induces senescence in hepatocellular carcinoma cells with TP53 mutations, which enables the selective apoptotic cell death of these senescent cells using inhibitors of mTOR signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2978479061,"RAF family kinases are RAS-activated switches that initiate signalling through the MAP kinase cascade to control cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival1-3. RAF activity is tightly regulated and inappropriate activation is a frequent cause of cancer4-6; however, the structural basis for RAF regulation is poorly understood at present. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine autoinhibited and active-state structures of full-length BRAF in complexes with MEK1 and a 14-3-3 dimer. The reconstruction reveals an inactive BRAF-MEK1 complex restrained in a cradle formed by the 14-3-3 dimer, which binds the phosphorylated S365 and S729 sites that flank the BRAF kinase domain. The BRAF cysteine-rich domain occupies a central position that stabilizes this assembly, but the adjacent RAS-binding domain is poorly ordered and peripheral. The 14-3-3 cradle maintains autoinhibition by sequestering the membrane-binding cysteine-rich domain and blocking dimerization of the BRAF kinase domain. In the active state, these inhibitory interactions are released and a single 14-3-3 dimer rearranges to bridge the C-terminal pS729 binding sites of two BRAFs, which drives the formation of an active, back-to-back BRAF dimer. Our structural snapshots provide a foundation for understanding normal RAF regulation and its mutational disruption in cancer and developmental syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2977888919,"Over the past two decades efforts to control malaria have halved the number of cases globally, yet burdens remain high in much of Africa and the elimination of malaria has not been achieved even in areas where extreme reductions have been sustained, such as South Africa1,2. Studies seeking to understand the paradoxical persistence of malaria in areas in which surface water is absent for 3-8 months of the year have suggested that some species of Anopheles mosquito use long-distance migration3. Here we confirm this hypothesis through aerial sampling of mosquitoes at 40-290 m above ground level and provide-to our knowledge-the first evidence of windborne migration of African malaria vectors, and consequently of the pathogens that they transmit. Ten species, including the primary malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii, were identified among 235 anopheline mosquitoes that were captured during 617 nocturnal aerial collections in the Sahel of Mali. Notably, females accounted for more than 80% of all of the mosquitoes that we collected. Of these, 90% had taken a blood meal before their migration, which implies that pathogens are probably transported over long distances by migrating females. The likelihood of capturing Anopheles species increased with altitude (the height of the sampling panel above ground level) and during the wet seasons, but variation between years and localities was minimal. Simulated trajectories of mosquito flights indicated that there would be mean nightly displacements of up to 300 km for 9-h flight durations. Annually, the estimated numbers of mosquitoes at altitude that cross a 100-km line perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction included 81,000 Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto, 6 million A. coluzzii and 44 million Anopheles squamosus. These results provide compelling evidence that millions of malaria vectors that have previously fed on blood frequently migrate over hundreds of kilometres, and thus almost certainly spread malaria over these distances. The successful elimination of malaria may therefore depend on whether the sources of migrant vectors can be identified and controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2979169072,"Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are key steps in the control of gene expression and mutations in genes regulating each of these processes are common in leukaemia1,2. Despite the frequent overlap of mutations affecting epigenetic regulation and splicing in leukaemia, how these processes influence one another to promote leukaemogenesis is not understood and, to our knowledge, there is no functional evidence that mutations in RNA splicing factors initiate leukaemia. Here, through analyses of transcriptomes from 982 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, we identified frequent overlap of mutations in IDH2 and SRSF2 that together promote leukaemogenesis through coordinated effects on the epigenome and RNA splicing. Whereas mutations in either IDH2 or SRSF2 imparted distinct splicing changes, co-expression of mutant IDH2 altered the splicing effects of mutant SRSF2 and resulted in more profound splicing changes than either mutation alone. Consistent with this, co-expression of mutant IDH2 and SRSF2 resulted in lethal myelodysplasia with proliferative features in vivo and enhanced self-renewal in a manner not observed with either mutation alone. IDH2 and SRSF2 double-mutant cells exhibited aberrant splicing and reduced expression of INTS3, a member of the integrator complex3, concordant with increased stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Aberrant INTS3 splicing contributed to leukaemogenesis in concert with mutant IDH2 and was dependent on mutant SRSF2 binding to cis elements in INTS3 mRNA and increased DNA methylation of INTS3. These data identify a pathogenic crosstalk between altered epigenetic state and splicing in a subset of leukaemias, provide functional evidence that mutations in splicing factors drive myeloid malignancy development, and identify spliceosomal changes as a mediator of IDH2-mutant leukaemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2977549339,"Identifying the genetic mechanisms of adaptation requires the elucidation of links between the evolution of DNA sequence, phenotype, and fitness1. Convergent evolution can be used as a guide to identify candidate mutations that underlie adaptive traits2-4, and new genome editing technology is facilitating functional validation of these mutations in whole organisms1,5. We combined these approaches to study a classic case of convergence in insects from six orders, including the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), that have independently evolved to colonize plants that produce cardiac glycoside toxins6-11. Many of these insects evolved parallel amino acid substitutions in the α-subunit (ATPα) of the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase)7-11, the physiological target of cardiac glycosides12. Here we describe mutational paths involving three repeatedly changing amino acid sites (111, 119 and 122) in ATPα that are associated with cardiac glycoside specialization13,14. We then performed CRISPR-Cas9 base editing on the native Atpα gene in Drosophila melanogaster flies and retraced the mutational path taken across the monarch lineage11,15. We show in vivo, in vitro and in silico that the path conferred resistance and target-site insensitivity to cardiac glycosides16, culminating in triple mutant 'monarch flies' that were as insensitive to cardiac glycosides as monarch butterflies. 'Monarch flies' retained small amounts of cardiac glycosides through metamorphosis, a trait that has been optimized in monarch butterflies to deter predators17-19. The order in which the substitutions evolved was explained by amelioration of antagonistic pleiotropy through epistasis13,14,20-22. Our study illuminates how the monarch butterfly evolved resistance to a class of plant toxins, eventually becoming unpalatable, and changing the nature of species interactions within ecological communities2,6-11,15,17-19."
https://openalex.org/W2978728166,"In eukaryotes, accurate chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis maintains genome stability and prevents aneuploidy. Kinetochores are large protein complexes that, by assembling onto specialized Cenp-A nucleosomes1,2, function to connect centromeric chromatin to microtubules of the mitotic spindle3,4. Whereas the centromeres of vertebrate chromosomes comprise millions of DNA base pairs and attach to multiple microtubules, the simple point centromeres of budding yeast are connected to individual microtubules5,6. All 16 budding yeast chromosomes assemble complete kinetochores using a single Cenp-A nucleosome (Cenp-ANuc), each of which is perfectly centred on its cognate centromere7-9. The inner and outer kinetochore modules are responsible for interacting with centromeric chromatin and microtubules, respectively. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae inner kinetochore module, the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) complex, assembled onto a Cenp-A nucleosome (CCAN-Cenp-ANuc). The structure explains the interdependency of the constituent subcomplexes of CCAN and shows how the Y-shaped opening of CCAN accommodates Cenp-ANuc to enable specific CCAN subunits to contact the nucleosomal DNA and histone subunits. Interactions with the unwrapped DNA duplex at the two termini of Cenp-ANuc are mediated predominantly by a DNA-binding groove in the Cenp-L-Cenp-N subcomplex. Disruption of these interactions impairs assembly of CCAN onto Cenp-ANuc. Our data indicate a mechanism of Cenp-A nucleosome recognition by CCAN and how CCAN acts as a platform for assembly of the outer kinetochore to link centromeres to the mitotic spindle for chromosome segregation."

Full-Text PDF Open Access Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. A formidable roadblock to the development of effective therapies is our incomplete understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. A major breakthrough was the discovery that scrapie, an infectious neurodegenerative disease, is caused by the cell-to-cell propagation of protein aggregates via “prion” forms of the protein (1Prusiner S.B. Novel proteinaceous infectious particles cause scrapie.Science. 1982; 216 (6801762): 136-14410.1126/science.6801762Crossref PubMed Scopus (4101) Google Scholar). In this process, a prion seed converts healthy, native proteins to adopt an aggregated, prion conformer. More recently, findings from numerous, independent studies support the hypothesis that prion-like propagation also underlies common, noninfectious neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer's diseaseCRISPRiCRISPR interferenceESCRTendosomal sorting complexes required for transportLLOMEleucyl-leucyl-O-methyl estersgRNAsingle guide RNAFTDfrontotemporal lobar dementiaGAL3galectin 3UCOEubiquitous chromatin opening elementqRTquantitative RTYFPyellow fluorescent proteinCFPcyan fluorescent proteinBisTris[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumiPSCinduced pluripotent stem cell.

However, the mechanisms that control aggregate uptake and propagation remain to be fully elucidated, especially in those diseases that involve cytoplasmic proteins.

Of particular interest to us are the mechanisms controlling propagation of aggregated forms of the protein tau. Tau aggregation is one of the hallmarks of AD and the levels of aggregated tau correlate with cognitive deficits and neuronal loss (3Bejanin A. Schonhaut D.R. La Joie R. Kramer J.H. Baker S.L.

Beyond AD, tau aggregation also defines a number of other neurodegenerative diseases, collectively termed tauopathies, some of which are caused by familial point mutations in tau (7Wang Y.

Propagation of tau aggregation can be modeled in cultured HEK293 cells that express fluorescently tagged versions of tau, as first established by the Diamond lab (8Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I.

In this system, addition of aggregated tau seeds to the culture medium causes the fluorescently tagged tau in the cells to convert from a diffuse, soluble form to aggregated puncta.

In those studies, binding of tau to specific cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans was found to mediate cellular uptake.

Although these studies established the mechanism for tau uptake, the downstream cellular pathways controlling propagation of tau aggregation have not been systematically characterized. We hypothesized that tau aggregation in the cytosol would be influenced by multiple cellular pathways, including those controlling trafficking of tau seeds through the endolysosomal pathway, localization of tau seeds to the cytosol, templated aggregation of soluble tau, and clearance of tau aggregates (Fig. 1A). To uncover relevant cellular pathways downstream of tau uptake, we here combine our CRISPR interference-based genetic screening approach (18Gilbert L.A. Horlbeck M.A. Adamson B. Villalta J.E. Chen Y.

Using this approach, we uncover endolysosomal escape of tau seeds as a critical step in the propagation of tau aggregation. Defects in the ESCRT machinery compromise endolysosomal integrity, thereby promoting the escape of tau seeds from endolysosomal compartments and accelerating subsequent templating of tau aggregation in the cytosol. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms of tau trafficking and suggest a source for new potential therapeutic targets.

In this FRET-based strategy, two versions of the tau repeat domain containing disease-associated P301L and V337M mutations are expressed as fusions with either the FRET donor CFP or the FRET acceptor YFP. When exposed to tau fibrils from recombinant or cell/brain-derived lysate sources, the CFP and YFP tags are brought into close proximity, enabling FRET. We generated a reporter line following a similar strategy (Fig. 1B). Instead of the CFP-YFP FRET pair, we used Clover2 and mRuby2, because proteins of this type had been shown to have a very high dynamic range for FRET, with a high Förster radius (21Lam A.J.

We selected a monoclonal line for optimal expression and dynamic range of the FRET signal. In the absence of seeding, these cells showed diffuse intracellular fluorescence without visible aggregates when monitored by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D) and they appeared as a single population when FRET levels are monitored by flow cytometry (Fig. 1E). In contrast, exposure of these cells to extracts from AD patient brains caused the tau reporter constructs to aggregate, as reflected by formation of fluorescent puncta (Fig. 1, C and D). However, seeded aggregation with brain-derived tau required co-incubation with Lipofectamine 2000 (here referred to as Lipofectamine) to achieve modest aggregation (Fig. 1, C and D), consistent with reports from other groups (12Sanders D.W.

Our goal was to eliminate the use of Lipofectamine, because the use of a lipocationic carrier may bypass physiologically relevant uptake or trafficking pathways. Accordingly, we purified monomeric His6-tagged 0N4R human tau from Escherichia coli and induced fibrillization with heparin, which we monitored by an increase in thioflavin T fluorescence (Fig. 1F) and by negative stain EM (Fig. 1G). We found that treatment of our FRET reporter cells with these tau fibrils caused robust formation of aggregates, even in the absence of Lipofectamine. This activity was confirmed using multiple criteria, including formation of puncta by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D), appearance of a FRET-positive population by flow cytometry (Fig. 1E), and biochemical characterization of tau in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1H). Finally, we tested the effects of increasing concentrations of tau fibrils on our FRET-based reporter. We found that His6-tagged fibrils robustly triggered tau aggregation in a dose-dependent manner across nearly 2 orders of magnitude in concentration in the absence of Lipofectamine, as quantified by the percentage of FRET-positive cells (Fig. 1I). Brain lysates also produced an increase in FRET-positive cells, although the magnitude was more modest. Together, these features make our FRET-based model suitable for use in a genetic screen to identify cellular factors that control prion-like propagation of tau aggregation. To identify cellular factors that control propagation of tau aggregation (Fig. 1A), we conducted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based genetic screen (Fig. 2A). First, we transduced the reporter cell line described above with a lentiviral expression construct for a catalytically inactive Cas9-BFP-KRAB (dCas9-BFP-KRAB) fusion protein. dCas9-BFP-KRAB can be directed by small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to silence a gene of interest (22Gilbert L.A.

We then transduced the cells with pooled sgRNA libraries that target protein homeostasis factors, which we designed specifically for this study based on the rationale that protein homeostasis factors were likely to control or modulate tau aggregation and clearance. These libraries target 2,949 genes encoding genes that function in autophagy, protein folding, or the ubiquitin-proteasome system with at least five independent sgRNAs for each gene, plus 750 nontargeting control sgRNAs. Cells transduced with these libraries were exposed to recombinant tau fibrils at concentrations that would yield FRET-positive cells at 50% of the maximum percentage of FRET-positive cells (Fig. 1I), thereby maximizing the dynamic range for detecting cellular factors that either increase or decrease tau aggregation. FRET-negative and FRET-positive cell populations were separated by FACS, collecting sufficient numbers of cells from each population for an average ×1000 representation (cells per sgRNA elements in the library). Genomic DNA was isolated and the locus encoding the sgRNAs was PCR-amplified. Frequencies for each sgRNA in each population were determined by next generation sequencing. We evaluated genes for the effect their knockdown had on the formation of tau aggregates (Table S1) using our previously described bioinformatics pipeline (18Gilbert L.A. Horlbeck M.A. Adamson B.

Two genes stood out for the strong enhancement of tau aggregation by their knockdown: CHMP6 and VPS13D (Fig. 2B). We decided to prioritize these two genes for further characterization, because both are related to genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. CHMP6 is part of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT)-III complex, which is required for numerous cellular processes involving membrane remodeling (26Hurley J.H.

To confirm these screening hits, we cloned 2 individual sgRNAs each targeting CHMP6 and VPS13D, and confirmed target knockdown by qPCR (Table S2). Using these sgRNAs, we validated the effect of CHMP6 and, to a lesser extent, VPS13D knockdown on tau aggregation by flow cytometry (Fig. 2C) and biochemical solubility assay (Fig. 2, D and E). We next investigated the mechanism by which knockdown of CHMP6 and VPS13D might affect tau aggregation. First, we excluded the possibility that knockdown of these genes alters the levels of our tau reporter (Fig. 3A). Since we previously identified factors controlling cellular uptake of tau (16Rauch J.N. Chen J.J. Sorum A.W. Miller G.M. Sharf T. See S.K. Hsieh-Wilson L.C. Kampmann M. Kosik K.S.

Rep. 2018; 8 (29686391): 638210.1038/s41598-018-24904-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we tested whether knockdown of CHMP6 and VPS13D impacted the uptake of tau fibrils. However, we found that knockdown of the genes did not impact tau fibril uptake (Fig. 3B), suggesting that their impact on tau aggregation is mediated downstream of seed uptake. We next sought to evaluate whether knockdown of CHMP6 and VPS13D increased the rate of tau aggregation, or decreased the rate of tau aggregate clearance. To this end, we utilized high-content imaging analysis to track the fibril-induced aggregation of tau over time. As expected from the results in our primary screen, we observed increased levels of aggregates 48 h post-seeding with fibrils when either CHMP6 or VPS13D were knocked down (Fig. 3, C and D). Intriguingly, the timeline of tau aggregate formation was differentially affected by the two gene knockdowns. Although VPS13D knockdown did not cause a"

Moreover, as an in vitro model, human kidney proximal tubular cells (HK2 cells) were treated with cisplatin.

MA aggravated renal damage and increased apoptosis in cisplatin-treated kidneys, phenotypes that were correlated with reduced FTO expression and increased m6A levels. Moreover, MA promoted apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells, which was correlated with the reduced FTO expression and increased m6A in HK2 cells. FTO protein overexpression reduced m6A levels and inhibited apoptosis in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells and also blocked the MA-induced increase in m6A levels and apoptosis rates. In agreement, overexpression of the m6A-generating methyltransferase-like 3 and 14 (METTL3 and METTL14) or siRNA-mediated FTO knockdown promoted apoptosis and enhanced m6A levels in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells.

Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapy agent and is widely used to treat malignant solid tumors. Because 90% cisplatin is excreted through kidney, ∼30% of patients are suffered from renal damages after one high dose of cisplatin treatment, which hampered its clinical application (1Bellomo R.

The apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells occurs several hours after the injection of cisplatin and reaches its highest level during 48–72 h in cisplatin-induced AKI. The p53 protein is an important regulator of apoptosis by regulating the homeostasis of the Caspase and Bcl family.

Recent studies showed that the levels of m6A determine the stability and translation efficiency of mRNA, and thus m6A modification is involved in a large number of biological processes including apoptosis (7Dominissini D.

Meclfemomic acid (MA) is a pharmaceutical compound that has been reported to modify cellular m6A levels by selectively targeting FTO (9Huang Y. Yan J. Li Q. Li J. Gong S. Zhou H. Gan J. Jiang H.

The role of m6A modification in kidney disease is rarely studied in the mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction. The expression of FTO is increased, and ablation of the FTO gene attenuates fibrogenic responses in this model, implying that m6A modification may play a role in renal fibrosis (10Wang C.Y. Shie S.S. Tsai M.L. Yang C.H. Hung K.C. Wang C.C. Hsieh I.C. Wen M.S. FTO modulates fibrogenic responses in obstructive nephropathy.Sci.

In this study, we aimed to explore the role of m6A modification in cisplatin-induced AKI and its downstream working mechanism. A mouse model of AKI was established by intraperitoneal injection of 17 mg/kg cisplatin, and kidneys were collected at day 3. As shown in Fig. 1A, cisplatin treatment significantly decreased FTO expression by 79% in mouse kidneys. The m6A levels were further analyzed in mouse kidneys, and dot-blot analysis showed that the m6A levels were significantly elevated by 14.7-fold in cisplatin-treated mouse kidneys as compared with that in vehicle-treated control kidneys (Fig. 1B). Human proximal tubular epithelial line (HK2 cells) were exposed to 10 μmol/liter cisplatin for 24 h, and Western blotting analysis showed that FTO was significantly down-regulated by 67% in cisplatin-treated cells as compared with that in control cells (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D showed that the m6A levels were increased by 17.5-fold in cisplatin-treated cells. The effect of MA was tested in cisplatin-induced AKI. Treatment with cisplatin increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels by 134% and serum creatinine levels by 57% in mice, which were further elevated by 49 and 25%, respectively, after administration of MA (Fig. 2A). Pathological analysis by hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining revealed a mild histology injury, such as loss of brush border membranes, tubular casts, and cast formation in cisplatin-treated kidneys, and these changes were much more prominent in MA-treated mice (Fig. 2B). Further quantification showed that the kidney injury score was significantly increased in cisplatin-treated kidneys, which was further aggravated by 44% by MA treatment (Fig. 2B). We further examined the effect of MA on apoptosis in cisplatin-treated kidneys. As shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and Cleaved Caspase3 expression were increased by 109 and 147%, respectively, in mouse kidneys during cisplatin injury, which were further enhanced by 82 and 42%, respectively, by MA treatment. Immunofluorescencent staining revealed that TUNEL-positive cells in the cisplatin-treated kidneys were three times more than that in control kidneys, and administration of MA further increased TUNEL-positive signals by 118% in injured kidneys. The effect of MA on FTO expression and m6A levels was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with MA did not inhibit FTO expression in control kidneys but reduced its expression by 80% in cisplatin-treated kidneys. In addition, MA did not increase m6A levels in control kidneys but significantly increased m6A levels in cisplatin-treated kidneys by 72% (Fig. 3B). As an in vitro model, HK2 cells, a human proximal tubular epithelial cell line, were stimulated with normal saline or 10 μmol/liter cisplatin for 24 h with or without the addition of 100 mm MA. As shown in Fig. 4A, cisplatin increased the ratio of Bax and Bcl-2 by 184% and the expression of Cleaved Caspase3 by 331% in HK2 cells, which were further increased by 287 and 52%, respectively, after the addition of 100 mm MA for 24 h. Next, TUNEL staining showed that there was no TUNEL-positive cells in control cells, and there was 4% TUNEL-positive cells upon cisplatin exposure, which were further increased by 64% after the treatment with MA (Fig. 4B). Western blotting showed that the expression of FTO was decreased by 47% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells, and administration of MA further reduced FTO expression by 67% (Fig. 4 C). However, m6A levels were enhanced by 360% upon cisplatin exposure and were further increased by 82% by MA treatment (Fig. 4D). FTO plasmids were transfected 24 h prior to the stimulation of 10 μmol/liter cisplatin and the treatment of 100 mm MA. As shown in Fig. 5A, transfection of the FTO plasmids reduced the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 by 46% and the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 by 40% in cisplatin-treated HK2. MA increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 by 401% and the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 by 344% in cisplatin-treated HK2 when transfected with the empty vector, but it did not increase the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 in cisplatin-treated HK2 when transfected with the FTO plasmid (Fig. 5A). Moreover, TUNEL staining showed that overexpression of FTO significantly reduced apoptosis by 82% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells. MA increased TUNEL-positive cells by 87% in cisplatin-treated HK2 when transfected with the empty vector, but it did not increase TUNEL-positive cells in cisplatin-treated HK2 when transfected with the FTO plasmid (Fig. 5B). Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of FTO was increased in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells by 166-fold without the addition of MA or by 152-fold with the addition of MA when transfected with the FTO plasmid (Fig. 5C). Transfection of the FTO plasmid reduced m6A levels by 95% in cisplatin-treated HK2 (Fig. 5D). MA increased m6A levels by 135% in cisplatin-treated HK2 when transfected with the empty vector, but it did not increase m6A levels in cisplatin-treated HK2 when transfected with the FTO plasmid (Fig. 5D). FTO siRNA (Si-FTO) were transfected 24 h prior to the stimulation of 10 μmol/liter cisplatin, which treated HK2 cells for another 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6A, the expression of FTO protein in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells was significantly reduced by 66% after Si-FTO transfection, and knockdown of FTO expression by siRNA increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 by 167% and the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 by 85% in cisplatin-treated HK2. In addition, TUNEL staining indicated that knockdown of FTO expression significantly promoted apoptosis by 27% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells. Moreover, transfection of the Si-FTO enhanced m6A levels by 34% in cisplatin-treated HK2 (Fig. 6C). As shown in Fig. 7A, cisplatin treatment significantly increased METTL3 expression by 4.7-fold in mouse kidneys. METTL3 plasmid (pMETTL3) were transfected 24 h before the stimulation of 10 μmol/liter cisplatin, and cells were harvested at 24 h after cisplatin treatment. As shown in Fig. 7B, cisplatin treatment increased the expression of METTL3 protein in HK2 by 4.1-fold, and transfection of METTL3 plasmids increased METTL3 expression by 25.1-fold in cisplatin-treated cells. Furthermore, overexpression of METTL3 significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 by 82.7-fold and the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 by 87.9-fold in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells. Moreover, overexpression of METTL3 significantly increased TUNEL-positive cells by 64% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells (Fig. 7C). In addition, transfection of METTL3 plasmids enhanced m6A levels by 138% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells (Fig. 7D). As shown in Fig. 8A, cisplatin treatment significantly increased METTL14 expression by 5.5-fold in mouse kidneys. METTL14 plasmids (pMETTL14) were transfected in HK2 cells for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 μmol/liter cisplatin for another 24 h. As shown in Fig. 8B, cisplatin treatment increased the expression of METTL14 protein in HK2 by 14.8-fold, and transfection of pMETTL14 increased METTL14 expression by 58.9-fold in cisplatin-treated cells. Overexpression of METTL14 significantly increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 by 299% and the expression of Cleaved Caspase-3 by 477% in HK2 cells with cisplatin treatment. Moreover, TUNEL staining revealed that transfection of METTL14 plasmids significantly promoted apoptosis by 81% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells (Fig. 8C). In addition, the m6A levels were increased by 9-fold after transfection of METTL14 plasmids in cisplatin-treated HK2 (Fig. 8D). The mRNA expression of p53 was measured. As shown in Fig. 9A, the expression of p53 mRNA increased by 67% in HK2 cells after cisplatin treatment for 12 h, which were further enhanced by 50% by MA treatment. Transfection of FTO plasmids reduced p53 mRNA by 36% at 12 h. FTO knockdown by siRNA promoted p53 mRNA by 20.4-fold at 24 h after cisplatin administration in HK2 cells (Fig. 9A). In kidney tissues, the expression of p53 mRNA was increased by 90% after cisplatin administration, which were further enhanced by 80% by MA treatment (Fig. 9B). We further analysis the expression of p53 in protein levels. As shown in Fig. 9C, transfection of FTO plasmids reduced p53 expression by 74% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells. Treatment with MA increased the expression of p53 by 58% in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells when transfected with the empty vector, but it did not increase the expression of p53 in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells when transfected with the FTO plasmid (Fig. 9C). Transfection of Si-FTO increased the p53 protein expression by 44% in HK2 cells treated with cisplatin (Fig. 9C). In kidney tissues, the expression of p53 protein increased by 192% after cisplatin administration, which were further enhanced by 60% by MA treatment (Fig. 9D). The role of m6A modification in AKI is unknown. In the current study, we showed that FTO is down-regulated in cisplatin-induced AKI in vivo and in vitro, and METTL3 and METTL14 are up-regulated in cisplatin-induced AKI in vivo and in vitro, which correlates with increased m6A modification. Moreover, inhibition of FTO by MA or FTO siRNA further increased m6A levels and promoted cisplatin-induced AKI. Furthermore, METTL3 and METTL14 overexpression increased m6A levels and promoted cisplatin-induced AKI. Our data suggest that increased m6A modification is detrimental in cisplatin-induced AKI. AKI is characterized by increased apoptosis, and excessive apoptosis in AKI causes the deterioration of renal function (11Havasi A. Borkan S.C.

Overexpression of FTO promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, which was associated with reduced global mRNA m6A levels (12Li Z. Weng H. Su R. Weng X.

In contrast, knockdown of FTO increased m6A levels and promoted apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia cells (12Li Z. Weng H. Su R. Weng X. Zuo Z. Li C. Huang H. Nachtergaele S. Dong L. Hu C. Qin X. Tang L. Wang Y. Hong G.M.

In an animal model of lipopolysaccharide-induced liver injury, dietary curcumin increased the abundance of m6A, which was correlated with increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes (13Lu N. Li X. Yu J. Li Y. Wang C. Zhang L. Wang T. Zhong X. Curcumin attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced hepatic lipid metabolism disorder by modification of m6A RNA methylation in piglets.Lipids. 2018; 53 (29488640): 53-6310.1002/lipd.12023Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that m6A demethylation by FTO in cisplatin-induced kidney injury inhibits apoptosis. Indeed, we showed that increased m6A modification by the FTO inhibitor MA was paralleled with enhanced apoptosis in cisplatin-treated kidneys, which was further confirmed in vitro. We also showed that overexpression of FTO in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells reduced m6A levels and inhibited apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of FTO reversed the enhanced m6A modification by MA and blocked the pro-apoptotic effect of MA. Furthermore, we confirmed the pro-apoptotic effect of m6A in cisplatin-induced AKI by knockdown of FTO or transfection of two methyltransferase METTL3 or METTL14. p53, a central player in several types of programmed cell deaths, influences transcription of genes that are related to classical mitochondria apoptosis and nonclassical apoptosis (14Yamada K. Yoshida K. Mechanical insights into the regulation of programmed cell death by p53 via mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Cell Res. 2019; 1866 (30790591): 839-84810.1016/j.bbamcr.2019.02.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that FTO inhibited apoptosis through p53. We showed that overexpression of FTO inhibited the expression and methylation of p53 mRNA in cisplatin-treated HK2 cells. The FTO inhibitor MA and FTO siRNA increased the expression of p53 in mRNA and protein levels in cisplatin-treated cells and kidneys. Moreover, overexpression of FTO reversed the increased p53 expression by MA treatment in cisplatin-treated cells. In summary, treatment with cisplatin reduced FTO expression and increased the m6A levels in kidneys, which leads to the up-regulation of p53. MA aggravated the renal damages in cisplatin-treated kidneys through p53-mediated apoptosis pathways (the Bax/Bcl-2 and Caspase3 pathways) (Fig. 10). We conclude that FTO is protective in cisplatin-induced AKI through inhibiting m6A RNA methylation. Male c57bl/6 mice were housed in the animal facilities of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and fed a standard diet. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: vehicle + normal saline group, the vehicle + MA group, the cisplatin + normal saline group, and the cisplatin + MA group (n = 8/group). The mouse model of AKI was established by intraperitoneal injection of 17 mg/kg cisplatin (P4394; Sigma). MA (S5517; Selleck) was given intraperitoneally three times: 1 h prior to cisplatin injection and 24 and 48 h after cisplatin injection at the dose of 10 mg/kg. At day 3 after the cisplatin injection, all mice were sacrificed to collect blood and kidney samples. BUN and serum creatinine were assessed by automatic analyzer. The animal protocols were performed in accordance with the guide of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were bought from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (C11330500BT; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10% fetal bovine serum (10270-106; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). To establish in vitro model of AKI, HK2 cells were stimulated with normal saline or 10 μmol/liter cisplatin for 24 h. In some experiments, HK2 cells were treated with normal saline or 100 mm MA. FTO plasmids were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (11668-027; Invitrogen) in HK2 cells according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The FTO plasmids were constructed by subcloning the human FTO coding sequence into mammalian vector GV358. The empty GV358 vector was used as control. The human FTO siRNA sequences were as follows: forward, 5′-GGACAAUGAUGAUGUCUCU-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGAGACAUCAUCAUUGUCC-3′. The METTL3 plasmids were constructed by subcloning the human METTL3 coding sequence into mammalian vector pCMV3. The empty pCMV3 vector was used as control. The METTL14 plasmids were constructed by subcloning the human METTL14 coding sequence into mammalian vector GTP-C-3FLAG. The empty GTP-C-3FLAG vector was used as control. Kidney tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution and then embedded in paraffin. Sliced tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tubular injuries were semiquantitatively scored as described previously (15Oh D.J. Dursun B. He Z. Lu L. Hoke T.S. Ljubanovic D. Faubel S. Edelstein C.L.

In brief, total proteins were extracted from kidney tissues or HK2 cells using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (P0013B; Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies overnight, which was followed by the incubation of the secondary antibody (A0216 or A0208; Beyotime). Primary antibodies for FTO (45980) and Cleaved Caspase-3 (9661) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibodies for Bax (Ab32503) and Bcl-2 (Ab182858) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and the β-actin (60008-1-Ig) antibody was bought from Proteintech. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (15596-026; Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instruction, which was reverse transcribed to cDNA by TaKaRa PrimeScript RT reagent kit (RR0036A; Kyoto, Japan).

After blocking with nonfat milk, the m6A was probed with a specific antibody for m6A (ABE572; Millipore), followed by the second antibody (A0208; Beyotime). The signals were detected using ECL detection reagents (P36599; Millipore). The same membrane was further stained with methylene blue (319112; Sigma) to measure the quantity of RNA in membrane blots. ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify the signals of dot blot. TUNEL kit (12156792910; Roche) and Hoechst (C1011; Beyotime) reagent were used to identify apoptotic cells in kidney sections and cultured cells according the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, deparaffinized tissue sections were hydrated and then digested with proteinase K (P6556; Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. HK2 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, kidney tissue sections or cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with TUNEL reagent for 1 h at 37 °C.

Whole slide images (WSI) and clinical data were retrieved for 395 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ccRCC cases. Pathologist 1 reviewed and selected regions of interests (ROIs). Nuclear segmentation was performed. Quantitative morphological, intensity, and texture features (n = 72) were extracted. Features associated with grade were identified by constructing a Lasso model using data from cases with concordant 2-tiered Fuhrman’s grades between TCGA and Pathologist 1 (training set n = 235; held-out test set n = 42). Discordant cases (n = 118) were additionally reviewed by Pathologist 2. Cox proportional hazard model evaluated the prognostic efficacy of the predicted grades in an extended test set which was created by combining the test set and discordant cases (n = 160). The Lasso model consisted of 26 features and predicted grade with 84.6% sensitivity and 81.3% specificity in the test set. In the extended test set, predicted grade was significantly associated with overall survival after adjusting for age and gender (Hazard Ratio 2.05; 95% CI 1.21–3.47); manual grades were not prognostic. Future work can adapt our computational system to predict WHO/ISUP grades, and validating this system on other ccRCC cohorts."

However, they still display some limitations, being mainly subject to the forecasting methods used for generating the base forecasts and the particularities of the examined series. This paper deals with such limitations by considering three different strategies: (i) combining forecasts of multiple methods, (ii) applying bias adjustments and (iii) selectively implementing temporal hierarchies to avoid seasonal shrinkage. The proposed strategies can be applied either separately or simultaneously, being complements to the method considered for reconciling the base forecasts and completely independent from each other. Their effect is evaluated using the monthly series of the M and M3 competitions. The results are very promising, displaying lots of potential for improving the performance of temporal hierarchies, both in terms of accuracy and bias."
https://openalex.org/W2977596593,"In clinical prediction/diagnostic rules aimed at early detection of critically ill patients, the respiratory rate plays an important role. We investigated the accuracy and interobserver-agreement of respiratory rate measurements by healthcare professionals, and the potential effect of incorrect measurements on the scores of 4 common clinical prediction/diagnostic rules: Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS).Using an online questionnaire, we showed 5 videos with a healthy volunteer, breathing at a fixed (true) rate (13-28 breaths/minute). Respondents measured the respiratory rate, and categorized it as low, normal, or high. We analysed how accurate the measurements were using descriptive statistics, and calculated interobserver-agreement using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and agreement between measurements and categorical judgments using Cohen's Kappa. Finally, we analysed how often incorrect measurements led to under/overestimation in the selected clinical rules.In total, 448 healthcare professionals participated. Median measurements were slightly higher (1-3/min) than the true respiratory rate, and 78.2% of measurements were within 4/min of the true rate. ICC was moderate (0.64, 95% CI 0.39-0.94). When comparing the measured respiratory rates with the categorical judgments, 14.5% were inconsistent. Incorrect measurements influenced the 4 rules in 8.8% (SIRS) to 37.1% (NEWS). Both underestimation (4.5-7.1%) and overestimation (3.9-32.2%) occurred.The accuracy and interobserver-agreement of respiratory rate measurements by healthcare professionals are suboptimal. This leads to both over- and underestimation of scores of four clinical prediction/diagnostic rules. The clinically most important effect could be a delay in diagnosis and treatment of (critically) ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2977390263,"Background The Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) is a principal signal transducer in mucosal responses to xenobiotic stress. It is well-recognized that inflammatory bowel disease is accompanied by xenobiotic stress, but the importance of the PXR in limiting inflammatory responses in inflammatory bowel disease remains obscure at best. Methods We stimulate a total of 106 colonic biopsies from 19 Crohn’s disease patients with active disease, 36 colonic biopsies from 8 control patients, colonic organoids and various cell culture models (either proficient or genetically deficient with respect to PXR) in vitro with the PXR ligand rifampicin or vehicle. Effects on NF-κB activity are assessed by measuring interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) mRNA levels by qPCR and in cell culture models by NF-κB reporter-driven luciferase activity and Western blot for signal transduction elements. Results We observe a strict inverse correlation between colonic epithelial PXR levels and NF-κB target gene expression in colonic biopsies from Crohn’s disease patients. PXR, activated by rifampicin, is rate-limiting for mucosal NF-κB activation in IBD. The correlation between colonic epithelial PXR levels and NF-κB target gene expression was also observed in intestinal organoids system. Furthermore, in preclinical in vitro models of intestinal inflammation, including intestinal organoids, genetic inactivation of PXR unleashes NF-κB-dependent signal transduction whereas conversely NF-κB signaling reduces levels of PXR expression. Conclusions Our data indicate that the PXR is a major and clinically relevant antagonist of NF-κB activity in the intestinal epithelial compartment during inflammatory bowel disease."
https://openalex.org/W2978363899,"Cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor-2 (MIF-2 or D-dopachrome tautomerase) is a recently characterized second member of the MIF cytokine superfamily in mammalian genomes. MIF-2 shares pro-inflammatory and tumorigenic properties with the clinical target MIF (MIF-1), but the precise contribution of MIF-2 to immune physiology or pathology is unclear. Like MIF-1, MIF-2 has intrinsic keto-enol tautomerase activity and mediates biological functions by engaging the cognate, common MIF family receptor CD74. Evidence that the catalytic site of MIF family cytokines has a structural role in receptor binding has prompted exploration of tautomerase inhibitors as potential biological antagonists and therapeutic agents, although few catalytic inhibitors inhibit receptor activation. Here we describe the discovery and biochemical characterization of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of MIF-2. An in silico screen of 1.6 million compounds targeting the MIF-2 tautomerase site yielded several hits for potential catalytic inhibitors of MIF-2 and identified 4-(3-carboxyphenyl)-2,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (4-CPPC) as the most functionally potent compound. We found that 4-CPPC has an enzymatic IC50 of 27 μm and 17-fold selectivity for MIF-2 versus MIF-1. An in vitro binding assay for MIF-1/MIF-2 to the CD74 ectodomain (sCD74) indicated that 4-CPPC inhibits MIF-2–CD74 binding in a dose-dependent manner (0.01–10 μm) without influencing MIF-1–CD74 binding. Notably, 4-CPPC inhibited MIF-2–mediated activation of CD74 and reduced CD74-dependent signal transduction. These results open opportunities for development of more potent and pharmacologically auspicious MIF-2 inhibitors to investigate the distinct functions of this MIF family member in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2977969698,"Climate change is driving shifts in the abundance and distribution of marine fish and invertebrates and is having direct and indirect impacts on seafood catches and fishing communities, exacerbating the already negative effects of unsustainably high fishing pressure that exist for some stocks. Although the majority of fisheries in the world are managed at the national or local scale, most existing approaches to assessing climate impacts on fisheries have been developed on a global scale. It is often difficult to translate from the global to regional and local settings because of limited relevant data. To address the need for fisheries management entities to identify those fisheries with the greatest potential for climate change impacts, we present an approach for estimating expected climate change-driven impacts on the productivity and spatial range of fisheries at the regional scale in a data-poor context. We use a set of representative Mexican fisheries as test cases. To assess the implications of climate impacts, we compare biomass, harvest, and profit outcomes from a bioeconomic model under contrasting management policies and with and without climate change. Overall results show that climate change is estimated to negatively affect nearly every fishery in our study. However, the results indicate that overfishing is a greater threat than climate change for these fisheries, hence fixing current management challenges has a greater upside than the projected future costs of moderate levels of climate change. Additionally, this study provides meaningful first approximations of potential effects of both climate change and management reform in Mexican fisheries. Using the climate impact estimations and model outputs, we identify high priority stocks, fleets, and regions for policy reform in Mexico in the face of climate change. This approach can be applied in other data-poor circumstances to focus future research and policy reform efforts on stocks now subject to additional stress due to climate change. Considering their growing relevance as a critical source of protein and micronutrients to nourish our growing population, it is urgent for regions to develop sound fishery management policies in the short-term as they are the most important intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on marine fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2977526516,"JARID2 is a noncatalytic member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which methylates of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27). In this work, we show that JARID2 and the PRC2 complex regulate the cell cycle in skeletal muscle cells to control proliferation and mitotic exit. We found that the stable depletion of JARID2 leads to increased proliferation and cell accumulation in S phase. The regulation of the cell cycle by JARID2 is mediated by direct repression of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E1, both of which are targets of PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation. Intriguingly, we also find that the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) is a direct target of JARID2 and the PRC2 complex. The depletion of JARID2 is not sufficient to activate RB1. However, the ectopic expression of RB1 can suppress cyclin D1 expression in JARID2-depleted cells. Transient depletion of JARID2 in skeletal muscle cells leads to a transient up-regulation of cyclin D1 that is quickly suppressed with no resulting effect on proliferation, Taken together, we show that JARID2 and the PRC2 complex regulate skeletal muscle proliferation in a precise manner that involves the repression of cyclin D1, thus restraining proliferation and repressing RB1, which is required for mitotic exit and terminal differentiation.

In skeletal muscle, the process is marked by a large number of gene expression changes as cell cycle genes go from highly expressed to permanently silenced while another set of genes that are normally repressed during proliferation are activated during differentiation (1.Shen X. Collier J.M. Hlaing M. Zhang L. Delshad E.H. Bristow J. Bernstein H.S. Genome-wide examination of myoblast cell cycle withdrawal during differentiation.Dev.

Two essential protein families that regulate the cell cycle are cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). 2The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinasesMRFmyogenic regulatory factorscrscrambledNPCN terminus, pocket, and C terminusTBSTTris-buffered saline plus Tween 20. These complexes guide the transition of cells through the different phases of the cell cycle. In the mammalian system, cyclins D and E govern the progress through the G1/S phases whereas the mitotic cyclins A and B promote progression through the S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle (2.Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Bronson R.T. Sicinski P. Deletion of the p27Kip1 gene restores normal development in cyclin D1-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11134518): 194-19910.1073/pnas.98.1.194Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mitogenic signaling stimulates the synthesis and assembly of the short-lived D-type cyclins with CDK4 or CDK6 (3.Hitomi M. Stacey D.W. Cyclin D1 production in cycling cells depends on ras in a cell-cycle-specific manner.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9 (10531005): 1075-108410.1016/S0960-9822(99)80476-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cyclin D/CDK complexes are active as long as mitogenic stimulation continues. Cyclin D/CDK acts directly as a kinase to phosphorylate cellular substrates critical for cell cycle progression. D-type cyclins also act to sequester the CDK inhibitors p27 and p21 in a kinase-independent role (2.Geng Y. Yu Q. Sicinska E. Das M. Bronson R.T. Sicinski P. Deletion of the p27Kip1 gene restores normal development in cyclin D1-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98 (11134518): 194-19910.1073/pnas.98.1.194Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The protein level of cyclin E is maximum at the G1/S transition and is followed by an increase in cyclin A levels during S phase. Both cyclin A and E can form complexes with CDK2, although CDK1 can only form a complex with cyclin A. Rising levels of cyclin B result in the induction of CDK1 at the G2/M phase. Coordinated cell cycle progression is a result of the highly regulated fluctuation in the expression of cyclins and activation of cognate CDKs (reviewed in Ref. 1.Shen X. Collier J.M. Hlaing M. Zhang L. Delshad E.H. Bristow J. Bernstein H.S. Genome-wide examination of myoblast cell cycle withdrawal during differentiation.Dev.

Skeletal muscle determination and differentiation are controlled by four highly related basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors known as the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) which include Myf5 (Myf5), MyoD (Myod), myogenin (Myog), and MRF4 (Myf6) (4.Berkes C.A.

MyoD and Myf5 have been shown to promote the proliferation of muscle progenitor cells whereas myogenin appears to possess the intrinsic activity required to mediate cell cycle exit as the exogenous expression of myogenin in proliferating myoblast causes premature exit of myoblast from the cell cycle (7.Liu Q.C.

MyoD can also promote cell cycle arrest by induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (8.Guo K. Wang J. Andrès V. Smith R.C. Walsh K. MyoD-induced expression of p21 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity upon myocyte terminal differentiation.Mol. Cell.

Roberts J.M. CDK inhibitors: Positive and negative regulators of G1-phase progression.Genes Dev. 1999; 13 (10385618): 1501-151210.1101/gad.13.12.1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5141) Google Scholar). During differentiation, the induction of p21 is followed by the expression of myogenin, which marks a “point of no return” for mitotic exit. High levels of p21 are required for maintenance of the post–mitotic state in differentiated myoblasts and MyoD can also induce RB1 expression (11.Martelli F. Cenciarelli C. Santarelli G. Polikar B. Felsani A. Caruso M. MyoD induces retinoblastoma gene expression during myogenic differentiation.Oncogene. 1994; 9 (7970718): 3579-3590PubMed Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, the retinoblastoma protein (pRB, RB1) has a critical role in negative regulation of cell cycle progression by promoting exit from the cell cycle and maintaining the differentiated state (12.Macaluso M. Montanari M. Giordano A.

RB1 maintains cell cycle arrest, which is required for skeletal muscle differentiation, in part by regulating the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors. Pocket proteins, a family that includes RB1 as well as related p107 and p130 proteins, bind and repress E2F activity (12.Macaluso M. Montanari M. Giordano A. Rb family proteins as modulators of gene expression and new aspects regarding the interaction with chromatin remodeling enzymes.Oncogene. 2006; 25 (16936746): 5263-526710.1038/sj.onc.1209680Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Activation of cyclin D and CDK4/6 proteins by mitogen-rich conditions allows monophosphorylation of pocket proteins which releases bound activator E2F transcription factors from hypophosphorylated RB1 proteins. Thus, cyclin D/CDK expression results in activation of E2F target cell cycle genes including cyclin E. Cyclin E, in complex with CDK2, further hyperphosphorylates RB1 proteins into the hyperphosphorylated inactive form of RB1 which allows cells to progress through the G1/S restriction point (reviewed in Refs. 15.Narasimha A.M. Kaulich M. Shapiro G.S. Choi Y.J. Sicinski P. Dowdy S.F.

Polycomb repressor proteins have an important developmental role and play essential roles in skeletal muscle. The two major polycomb complexes, Polycomb Repressive Complex-1 (PRC1) and Polycomb Repressive Complex-2 (PRC2), are responsible for the ubiquitination of lysine 119 of histone H2A (H2AK119) (17.Cao R.

The methylation of H3K27 by PRC2 requires one of the SET domain–containing enhancer of zeste proteins, EZH1 or EZH2. Promoters and enhancers of many lineage-specific genes contain dimethylated and trimethylated H3K27, and the methylation profile of many of these genes is lost upon differentiation (reviewed in Ref. 21.Conerly M.L.

JARID2, a founding member of Jumonji family of histone demethylases, has no detectable histone demethylase activity and yet is evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human (Ref. 22.Klose R.J.

Recently, it has been shown to be a substoichiometric component of PRC2 which aids in targeting PRC2 and is required for embryonic stem cell differentiation (24.Landeira D. Sauer S. Poot R.

JARID2 mutant mice exhibit various neural tube, cardiac, and hematopoietic defects and die in utero because of cardiac and hematopoietic defects (26.Takahashi M. Kojima M. Nakajima K.

In cardiac cells, JARID2 has been shown to control the cell cycle through regulation of cyclin D1 (25.Nakajima K. Inagawa M. Uchida C. Okada K. Tane S. Kojima M. Kubota M. Noda M. Ogawa S. Shirato H.

However, the role of JARID2 in skeletal muscle development and regeneration is not well-understood. We have recently shown that loss of JARID2 blocks differentiation in C2C12 cells through the modulation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (29.Adhikari A. Davie J. JARID2 and the PRC2 complex regulate skeletal muscle differentiation through regulation of canonical Wnt signaling.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (30119689): 4610.1186/s13072-018-0217-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the effect of JARID2 on the proliferation of skeletal muscle cells. We found that depletion of JARID2 increased the proliferation rate and caused de-repression of positive cell cycle regulators like cyclin D1 and cyclin E1, whereas the negative cell cycle regulators like p21 and RB1 were down-regulated. JARID2 has been shown to recruit the histone methyltransferases G9a and GLP to directly regulate cyclin D1 in cardiomyocytes (30.Shirato H. Ogawa S. Nakajima K. Inagawa M. Kojima M. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Takeuchi T. A jumonji (Jarid2) protein complex represses cyclin D1 expression by methylation of histone H3-K9.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19010785): 733-73910.1074/jbc.M804994200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We show here that JARID2 recruits the PRC2 complex to repress cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 in skeletal muscle and results in H3K27 methylation of target promoters. In a related study, we also have found that the modest depletion or chemical inhibition of EZH2 promotes proliferation through the JARID2-directed regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1. 3A. Adhikari and J. K. Davie, submitted for publication. We also show that Rb1 is a direct target of JARID2 and the PRC2 complex, but loss of repression by PRC2 is not sufficient to de-repress gene expression. The differentiation block with consequential increase in proliferation could be restored by exogenous expression of JARID2. Together, we show that JARID2 regulates the cell cycle in PRC2-dependent manner in skeletal muscle cells. To understand the function of JARID2 in skeletal muscle proliferation, we established cell lines depleted for JARID2 with three independent shRNA constructs in C2C12 cells (29.Adhikari A. Davie J. JARID2 and the PRC2 complex regulate skeletal muscle differentiation through regulation of canonical Wnt signaling.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (30119689): 4610.1186/s13072-018-0217-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), a well-established in vitro differentiation model. mRNA and protein confirmation of one JARID2 depletion line derived from each shRNA construct is shown in Fig. S1. All described experiments were performed in two cell lines depleted with independent shRNA constructs (shJarid2-1 and shJarid2-3), and the results were consistent. For clarity, only the results for one shRNA construct (shJarid2-3) are shown. We assayed for the proliferation rate of these cells, and we found that C2C12 cells depleted for JARID2 proliferated significantly faster than cells with the scrambled control (Fig. 1A). To determine whether increased DNA synthesis was correlated with the enhanced proliferation observed, we performed an EdU incorporation assay for DNA synthesis and found that the number of actively proliferating cells marked by EdU incorporation was significantly higher in JARID2-depleted cells (Fig. 1B). To correlate the enhanced proliferation with changes in the cell cycle, the cell cycle state was assessed by flow cytometry following propidium iodide staining of the cells. We found that JARID2-depleted cells were much more highly enriched in the S phase at the expense of cells in the G1 phase than the cells with a scrambled control, indicating that JARID2 plays a role in regulating the G1/S transition (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). To understand how JARID2 was regulating the G1/S transition, we examined the expression of factors that mediate this transition, including the gene encoding cyclin D1 (Ccnd1). Ccnd1 is methylated at histone H3 lysine 27 in C2C12 cells in a PRC2-dependent manner upon differentiation (13.Blais A. van Oevelen C.J. Margueron R. Acosta-Alvear D. Dynlacht B.D. Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein-dependent methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 is associated with irreversible cell cycle exit.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 (18166651): 1399-141210.1083/jcb.200705051Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We found that Ccnd1 mRNA was up-regulated in cells depleted for JARID2 (Fig. 2A), and this result was confirmed at the protein level as well (Fig. 2B). We next examined cyclin E1 (Ccne1), which functions in concert with cyclin D1 for the cells transition from G1 to S phase. We found that cyclin E1, like cyclin D1, was also up-regulated at the level of mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein (Fig. 2D). CDK4/6 and CDK2 are the CDKs that partner with cyclin D1 and cyclin E1, respectively, to phosphorylate various cellular substrates including the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) to regulate cell cycle progression. Thus, we also examined the expression of CDK2 and CDK4 and found that they were up-regulated at the mRNA level (Fig. 2, E and G) as well as the protein level (Fig. 2F). The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and retinoblastoma proteins (RB1) are known negative regulators of cell cycle progression (G1/S transition) and are key regulators of cell cycle exit. Thus, we assayed for the expression of RB1 (Rb1) and found that Rb1 was severely down-regulated at the level of both mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B). We also examined the expression of p21 (Cdkn1a), which is also required for cell cycle exit. We found that Cdkn1a expression was inhibited at the mRNA level upon JARID2 depletion (Fig. 3C). The protein level was less severely affected, but the results show that Cdkn1a is not up-regulated upon the depletion of JARID2 (Fig. 3D). To confirm the dependence on JARID2, we asked if restoration of JARID2 could rescue the observed effects on the cell cycle regulators. Scr control and JARID2-depleted cells were transfected with an expression construct for JARID2 (pEF-Jarid2) or vector control (pEF). The expression of JARID2 was confirmed by mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4B) analysis. We found that restoration of JARID2 rescued the increased proliferation defect observed on the JARID2 depletion (Fig. 4C). We also found that restoration of JARID2 down-regulated cyclin D1 at the mRNA (Fig. 4D), and protein (Fig. 4E) level, thus confirming that JARID2 controls the expression of cyclin D1 in skeletal muscle cells. Restoration of JARID2 also suppressed the expression of Ccne1 (Fig. 4F). Cdk4 and Cdk2 mRNA expression were restored by JARID2 expression as well (Fig. 4, G and H). This effect could also be observed at the protein level (Fig. 4I). Interestingly, expression of the negative cell cycle regulators, RB1 and p21, were also rescued, resulting in an up-regulation of expression (Fig. 4J). In cardiac cells, JARID2 represses Ccnd1 though alterations in histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation (30.Shirato H. Ogawa S. Nakajima K. Inagawa M. Kojima M. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Takeuchi T. A jumonji (Jarid2) protein complex represses cyclin D1 expression by methylation of histone H3-K9.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19010785): 733-73910.1074/jbc.M804994200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether JARID2 directly repressed Ccnd1 in skeletal muscle, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to probe JARID2 recruitment to the Ccnd1 promoter. We found that JARID2 was present on the Ccnd1 promoter and that depletion of JARID2 reduced this association (Fig. 5A). We next examined the methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me) in cells with or without JARID2 and found no change in the H3K9me profile (Fig. 5B). The antibody used in these experiments was pan-methyl H3K9 that recognizes all three states of H3K9 methylation. We next examined the methylation of H3K27 as JARID2 has been shown to direct the PRC2 complex to target genes (31.Pasini D. Cloos P.A. Walfridsson J. Olsson L. Bukowski J.P. Johansen J.V. Bak M. Tommerup N. Rappsilber J. Helin K. JARID2 regulates binding of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 to target genes in ES cells.Nature. 2010; 464 (20075857): 306-31010.1038/nature08788Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 32.Londhe P. Davie J.K. Interferon-γ resets muscle cell fate by stimulating the sequential recruitment of JARID2 and PRC2 to promoters to repress myogenesis.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6 (24327761): ra10710.1126/scisignal.2004633Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and found that depletion of JARID2 led to a significant depletion of this modification (Fig. 5C). To confirm that this reduction was not because of a loss of total histone 3 (H3) at this promoter, we also examined H3 levels in this region and found that H3 levels were unaltered (Fig. 5C). We also assayed for the presence of the catalytic subunit of the PRC2 complex, EZH2, and we found that EZH2 was associated with the Ccnd1 promoter and that the association was reduced when JARID2 was depleted (Fig. 5D). EZH2 has previously been shown to bind to the Ccnd1 promoter in myotubes (13.Blais A. van Oevelen C.J. Margueron R. Acosta-Alvear D. Dynlacht B.D. Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein-dependent methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 is associated with irreversible cell cycle exit.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 (18166651): 1399-141210.1083/jcb.200705051Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but we show here that this can also be detected in myoblasts and importantly, the recruitment of EZH2 depends on JARID2. As a positive control for these experiments, we also examined the H3K27me3 status of the Hoxb7 promoter, a well-established target of the PRC2 complex (33.Asp P. Blum R. Vethantham V. Parisi F. Micsinai M. Cheng J. Bowman C. Kluger Y. Dynlacht B.D. Genome-wide remodeling of the epigenetic landscape during myogenic differentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21551099): E149-E15810.1073/pnas.1102223108Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). H3K27me3 was highly enriched on the Hoxb7 promoter and the depletion of JARID2 did not significantly disrupt this modification (Fig. 5E). Total H3 levels were also unaltered (Fig. 5E). The percentage input calculation shows that the Hoxb7 promoter is more highly enriched for H3K27me3 than Ccnd1, which may explain how the methylation of the Ccnd1 and Ccne1 promoters could have been overlooked in previous genome-wide studies. As a negative control, we also examined a promoter proximal region of Tnni2 which we have previously shown is not a target of the PRC2 complex in proliferating cells (32.Londhe P. Davie J.K. Interferon-γ resets muscle cell fate by stimulating the sequential recruitment of JARID2 and PRC2 to promoters to repress myogenesis.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6 (24327761): ra10710.1126/scisignal.2004633Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We found that JARID2 and EZH2 were not recruited to this region and H3K27me3 and H3K9me were not altered upon JARID2 depletion (Fig. 5F). Cyclin D1 is an essential cell cycle regulator and is activated by several factors, including β-catenin, the effector of the canonical Wnt pathway. We have recently found that JARID2 directly represses an antagonist of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, Sfrp1, which leads to an inhibition of the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in JARID2-depleted cells (29.Adhikari A. Davie J. JARID2 and the PRC2 complex regulate skeletal muscle differentiation through regulation of canonical Wnt signaling.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (30119689): 4610.1186/s13072-018-0217-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether an alteration in β-catenin recruitment contributed to the activation of cyclin D1, we performed ChIP assays for β-catenin on the Ccnd1 promoter. We found that β-catenin levels were reduced on the Ccnd1 promoter upon JARID2 depletion (Fig. 5G). This result is consistent with our study showing the JARID2-dependent reduction in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin (29.Adhikari A. Davie J. JARID2 and the PRC2 complex regulate skeletal muscle differentiation through regulation of canonical Wnt signaling.Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018; 11 (30119689): 4610.1186/s13072-018-0217-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This result also shows that the up-regulation of cyclin D1 observed is because of the loss of the JARID2/PRC2-dependent H3K27 methylation and not an enhanced recruitment of the activator β-catenin. We next asked if Ccne1 was also a direct target of JARID2 and the PRC2 complex. JARID2 was found to be associated with the Ccne1 promoter, and JARID2 depletion reduced this association (Fig. 5H). Like Ccnd1, we found that H3K9 methylation on the Ccne1 promoter was unchanged upon JARID2 depletion (Fig. 5I). We found that H3K27 methylation at the Ccne1 promoter was reduced upon JARID2 depletion and again, total H3 levels were unaltered (Fig. 5J). The H3K27me3 enrichment in the JARID2-depleted cells was below the IgG control signal; therefore, the va"

Regulation of NEDD4-1 and WWP2 catalytic activities is important for controlling cellular protein homeostasis, and their dysregulation may lead to cancer and other diseases. Previous work has implicated noncatalytic regions, including the C2 domain and/or WW domain linkers in NEDD4-1 and WWP2, in contributing to autoinhibition of the catalytic HECT domains by intramolecular interactions. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of these NEDD4-1 and WWP2 regulatory regions and their interplay with allosteric binding proteins such as Nedd4 family-interacting protein (NDFIP1), engineered ubiquitin variants, and linker phosphomimics. We found that in addition to influencing catalytic activities, the WW domain linker regions in NEDD4-1 and WWP2 can impact product distribution, including the degree of polyubiquitination and Lys-48 versus Lys-63 linkages. We show that allosteric activation by NDFIP1 or engineered ubiquitin variants is largely mediated by relief of WW domain linker autoinhibition. WWP2-mediated ubiquitination of WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and p62 proteins by WWP2 suggests that substrate ubiquitination can also be influenced by WW linker autoinhibition, although to differing extents.

https://openalex.org/W2977892421,"Introduction In addition to their role in facilitating leukocyte-mediated inflammation, platelets can dampen leukocyte pro-inflammatory responses in some contexts. Consequently, platelets are increasingly appreciated as regulators of inflammation. Together, platelets and neutrophils play a role in inflammation through Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, although we do not fully understand how platelets shape neutrophil responses to TLR stimulation. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which platelets can modulate neutrophil function in response to in vitro stimulation with TLR4, TLR2/1, and TLR2/6 agonists. Methods Neutrophils from 10 healthy individuals were cultured alone or with autologous platelets. Neutrophils ± platelets were left unstimulated or were stimulated with 1 or 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a TLR4 agonist), Pam3CSK4 (a TLR2/1 agonist) and fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide (FSL)-1 (a TLR2/6 agonist). Neutrophil activation and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry, and elastase and interleukin-8 secretion were assessed by ELISA. Results The addition of platelets attenuated neutrophil CD66b and CD11b expression in response to various doses of Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1. Furthermore, platelet co-culture was associated with higher CD62L expression (indicating reduced CD62L shedding) in response to these TLR agonists. Platelets also reduced elastase secretion in unstimulated cultures and in response to low-dose TLR stimulation. Conversely, platelet co-culture increased neutrophil phagocytosis in unstimulated cultures and in response to low-dose Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1. Platelets also increased IL-8 secretion in response to low-dose LPS. Conclusion Platelets are complex immunomodulators that can attenuate some, and simultaneously augment other, neutrophil functions. This modulation can occur both in the absence and presence of TLR stimulation."

The mutation is located in the converter domain, a key region of communication between the catalytic motor and lever arm in myosins, and is nearby but not directly in the OM-binding site. We expressed and purified human β-cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (M2β-S1) containing the F764L mutation, and compared it to WT with in vitro motility as well as steady-state and transient kinetics measurements. In the absence of OM we demonstrate that the F764L mutation does not significantly change maximum actin-activated ATPase activity but slows actin sliding velocity (15%) and the actomyosin ADP release rate constant (25%). The transient kinetic analysis without OM demonstrates that F764L has a similar duty ratio as WT in unloaded conditions. OM is known to enhance force generation in cardiac muscle while it inhibits the myosin power stroke and enhances actin-attachment duration. We found that OM has a reduced impact on F764L ATPase and sliding velocity compared with WT. Specifically, the EC50 for OM induced inhibition of in vitro motility was 3-fold weaker in F764L. Also, OM reduces maximum actin-activated ATPase 2-fold in F764L, compared with 4-fold with WT. Overall, our results suggest that F764L attenuates the impact of OM on actin-attachment duration and/or the power stroke.

https://openalex.org/W2977453997,"More than half of spinal cord injury (SCI) cases occur in the cervical region, leading to respiratory dysfunction due to damaged neural circuitry that controls critically important muscles such as the diaphragm. The C3-C5 spinal cord is the location of phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs) that are responsible for diaphragm activation; PhMNs receive bulbospinal excitatory drive predominately from supraspinal neurons of the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG). Cervical SCI results in rVRG axon damage, PhMN denervation, and consequent partial-to-complete paralysis of hemidiaphragm. In a rat model of C2 hemisection SCI, we expressed the axon guidance molecule, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), selectively at the location of PhMNs (ipsilateral to lesion) to promote directed growth of rVRG axons toward PhMN targets by performing intraspinal injections of adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2)-BDNF vector. AAV2-BDNF promoted significant functional diaphragm recovery, as assessed by in vivo electromyography. Within the PhMN pool ipsilateral to injury, AAV2-BDNF robustly increased sprouting of both spared contralateral-originating rVRG axons and serotonergic fibers. Furthermore, AAV2-BDNF significantly increased numbers of putative monosynaptic connections between PhMNs and these sprouting rVRG and serotonergic axons. These findings show that targeting circuit plasticity mechanisms involving the enhancement of synaptic inputs from spared axon populations is a powerful strategy for restoring respiratory function post-SCI.-Charsar, B.

https://openalex.org/W2977941533,"Aims To stipulate a new definition for long-stay patients (LSPs) in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We defined LSPs as the 10% of patients with the longest PICU length-of-stay (LOS) for each age and diagnostic group. To assess whether the thresholds (days of PICU stay) for the definition of LSPs in PICU significantly differ among diagnostic and age categories. To determine whether independent associations exist between patients’ characteristics at admission and LSPs diagnosis in pre-specified diagnostic and age groups. Methods This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including all PICUs in Switzerland. Multivariable regression analysis was used to seek for association between patients’ variables at admission and LSPs Results We included 22,284 patients with a median (IQR) age of 12 (1–84) months. Significantly different thresholds across diagnostic and age subgroups are identified. Readmission to PICU, higher PIM2 and NEMS (a score used to quantify nursing workload at intensive care unit level) at admission were associated with higher likelihood of becoming LSPs. Conclusions Our results showed a significantly different definitions of LSPs for specific diagnoses and age categories. Readmission to PICU and higher acuity at admission are associated with longer PICU length-of-stay in the majority of diagnostic groups. A more personalized definition of LSPs in children based on actual patients’ characteristics should probably be used in an effort to optimize care and reduce costs."
https://openalex.org/W2978401837,"Cognitive impairments are a common consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The hippocampus is a subcortical structure that plays a key role in the formation of declarative memories and is highly vulnerable to TBI. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is highly expressed in the hippocampus and reduced expression and function of this receptor are linked with cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Positive allosteric modulation of α7 nAChRs with AVL-3288 enhances receptor currents and improves cognitive functioning in naïve animals and healthy human subjects. Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting the α7 nAChR with the positive allosteric modulator AVL-3288 would enhance cognitive functioning in the chronic recovery period of TBI. To test this hypothesis, adult male Sprague Dawley rats received moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury or sham surgery. At 3 months after recovery, animals were treated with vehicle or AVL-3288 at 30 min prior to cue and contextual fear conditioning and the water maze task. Treatment of TBI animals with AVL-3288 rescued learning and memory deficits in water maze retention and working memory. AVL-3288 treatment also improved cue and contextual fear memory when tested at 24 hr and 1 month after training, when TBI animals were treated acutely just during fear conditioning at 3 months post-TBI. Hippocampal atrophy but not cortical atrophy was reduced with AVL-3288 treatment in the chronic recovery phase of TBI. AVL-3288 application to acute hippocampal slices from animals at 3 months after TBI rescued basal synaptic transmission deficits and long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1. Our results demonstrate that AVL-3288 improves hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory performance after TBI in the chronic recovery period. Enhancing cholinergic transmission through positive allosteric modulation of the α7 nAChR may be a novel therapeutic to improve cognition after TBI."
https://openalex.org/W2978744409,"Diabetes is the most common comorbidity of necrotizing fasciitis (NF), but the effect of stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) on diabetic patients with NF has never been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess whether SIH, as determined by the glycemic gap between admission glucose levels and A1C-derived average glucose levels, predicts adverse outcomes in diabetic patients hospitalized with NF.We retrospectively reviewed the glycemic gap and clinical outcomes in 252 diabetic patients hospitalized due to NF from 2011 to 2018 in a single medical center in Taiwan. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the optimal cutoff values for predicting adverse outcomes. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to identify significant predictors of adverse outcomes.In total, 194 diabetic NF patients were enrolled. Compared with patients without adverse outcomes, patients with adverse outcomes had significantly higher glycemic gaps, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels; lower albumin and hemoglobin levels; greater incidence of limb loss; and longer hospital and intensive care unit stays. The glycemic gap positively correlates with the laboratory risk indicator for NF scores, APACHE II scores and CRP levels. A glycemic gap of 146 mg/dL was the optimal cutoff value for predicting adverse outcomes using the ROC curve. Compared with patients with glycemic gaps ≤146 mg/dL, those with glycemic gaps >146 mg/dL had higher APACHE II scores and incidence rates of adverse outcomes, especially bacteremia and acute kidney injury. Multivariate analysis revealed that a glycemic gap >146 mg/dL and APACHE II score >15 were independent predictors of adverse outcomes, while the presence of hyperglycemia at admission was not.An elevated glycemic gap was significantly independently associated with adverse outcomes in diabetic NF patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate the role of the glycemic gap in NF patients with diabetes."

Special emphasis is placed on ways to increase engagement and help students feel connected. Educational initiatives, including organic chemistry music videos and various online resources created in partnerships with students, will be discussed. It is hoped that this account will stimulate ideas that transcend scientific disciplines all for the benefit of student education. I grew up in a small town called Fishkill, New York. When I was growing up, I did not have a clue about what I wanted to do in the future. I did not think about becoming a teacher, a researcher, or an organic chemist. Instead, I was mostly looking to have a good time with my friends and make enough money to enjoy my high school days. I was actually a door-to-door knife salesman at one point. Later, I helped conduct the dog census for the town of East Fishkill. Yes, I walked door-to-door asking people how many dogs they had, collecting a modest 75 cents per dog uncovered. Last, I secured a job at Blockbuster Video helping customers select movie rentals. When it came to academics, I naturally gravitated toward the sciences. My older brother was on track to be become a medical doctor, and I was ultimately encouraged to do the same. Thus, when I began my undergraduate studies at NYU, I took pre-medical requirements early on, such as biology, general chemistry, calculus, and physics, with the hope of one day acing the MCAT exam. My first year in college went relatively smoothly, but as I began my second year, I braced myself for the class everyone dreads: organic chemistry. For decades, organic chemistry has been reputed as being a gatekeeper class. Without scoring an A grade in this class, it would supposedly be impossible to secure medical school admission. It is interesting to note that nowhere along the way did anyone explain to me the relevance of organic chemistry, or that it was really just a class about creativity and problem-solving. It was not until my first day of organic chemistry class that I heard this perspective. Rather than diving straight into the material, Professor Yorke Rhodes III spent the entire first lecture giving us a pep talk. “Do not try to memorize and regurgitate information,” and “this class is all about critical thinking” are the messages he conveyed. I remember leaving class thinking that this class would be different from all of the other science classes I had taken so far, and I was excited. Despite how good it all sounded, the pace of the course picked up considerably over the next few weeks. With our first midterm around the corner, I began to panic. Rather than trying to truly understand the course content and use it as a vehicle to solve problems, I resorted to what I had become quite good at: brute-force memorization. I do not remember anything about the exam itself. What I do recall is that I thought I scored better than my close friends in the class, based on our conversations and viewing the exam answer key. I ultimately scored something on the order of 55%, which I thought was awesome, given that the exam average was roughly 25%. Professor Rhodes happened to notice that I was “celebrating” my grade of 55%. With a serious squint, he turned to me and said (paraphrased): “Neil, that's a good score, but you can do better.” My first reaction was to be defensive and wonder why Professor Rhodes would be critical after I had done so much better than the class average. However, I soon began to realize that this common pre-med mentality of just wanting to beat class averages and celebrating a grade of 55% made no sense. I began studying more seriously, both independently and in groups, building a relationship with Professor Rhodes, and working diligently to improve my problem-solving skills. I ultimately mastered the course material and properly earned the A grade I was striving for. Overall, the experience changed my perspective on learning in general, but also set me on a path toward studying and practicing organic chemistry for the long haul. Several important lessons can be gleaned from the aforementioned anecdote. One is the simple reminder that the student path of study is not straightforward. At least 75% of students will change their major at least once during their time in college. The other takeaways, which will be discussed in more detail below, center around topics in education. We should never underestimate the importance of how a subject is taught. For example, whether a class requires brute-force memorization or focuses on critical thinking skills has a profound impact on the student educational experience and what students ultimately learn. In addition, we should be aware of the incredible influence our teachers have. Just a few words of encouragement or inspiration can change the student mentality, as it did when Professor Rhodes changed my life with a single sentence and a facial expression. Exactly 10 years after Professor Rhodes's organic chemistry course, I began my independent career as an Assistant Professor at UCLA (in 2007). Before that, and aside from some minimal time spent serving as a teaching assistant, the bulk of my time was devoted to conducting research studies, both at Caltech (Ph.D. studies with Professor Brian Stoltz) and UC Irvine (postdoctoral studies with Professor Larry Overman). When I began at UCLA, my mentality was to focus on building my research program and earning tenure. The research expectations were daunting. UCLA is a campus with 13 Nobel Prizes awarded between faculty and alumni. Seven of those are from my home department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. I was “spared” from teaching introductory organic chemistry to undergraduates for the first 3 years of my independent academic career. However, in 2010, there was an opening to teach “Chem 14D: Organic Reactions and Pharmaceuticals.” This is the last class in a fast-paced sequence designed for “life science” majors who need to fulfill general chemistry and organic chemistry requirements in order to pursue health-related professions (e.g. medicine, dentistry, physical therapy, optometry, etc.). Whereas most schools would offer such a sequence over the course of two full academic years, the “14 series” allows students to complete chemistry lecture requirements in four academic quarters (or the equivalent of 1 1/3 years). The Chem 14D course typically has high enrollments, approaching 400 students in a given lecture period. It is also worth noting that most students view this class as a final lower-division requirement, rather than an exciting educational opportunity. Based on student surveys, the vast majority of students (>65%) indicate a low interest in organic chemistry at the start of the course each year. Before discussing teaching practices, it is worth commenting on what organic chemistry is and what makes it a challenging course. Simply put, organic chemistry is the chemistry of molecules made of carbon. The applications of organic chemistry are vast, and span medicine, agrochemistry, cosmetics, food science, and cutting-edge technologies, just to name a few areas. Most molecules in our bodies that are responsible for genetics and various physiological events are organic compounds (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.). Regarding the difficulty associated with organic chemistry, a primary challenge is that most students simply do not learn about it until their first introductory organic chemistry course, typically in their second year of college study. However, a new student will quickly have to learn how to decipher shorthand chemical structures, recognize functional groups, visualize two-dimensional structures in three dimensions, and assign stereocenters. As they are just absorbing the basics of chemical structure, they begin to learn about chemical reactions, where students learn how to transform certain functional groups into others. For each reaction, there is a logic associated with how and why the reactions take place. Accordingly, students will learn “arrow-pushing” mechanisms. For each reaction, there is inevitably some memorization regarding reagents, solvents, reaction names, and various acronyms. Last, students will typically learn how to perform chemical synthesis using an intellectual tool called “retrosynthetic analysis.” Here, students are provided with the structure of an organic molecule and must propose a means to synthesize that molecule using much simpler compounds through a series of functional group conversions. To solve such problems requires a command of the course material, creativity, and impeccable critical thinking skills. Although this sounds intimidating, I would offer that our students are highly innovative and generally enjoy solving problems, if they have a good support system in place. There are many things teachers can do to create a positive and impactful experience for our students. Under the broadest terms, I always ask myself if the teaching tools and resources I offer to my students help them feel connected to the course. If students feel connected, they are more likely to attend and participate in class (and office hours), and even to study. Of course, the opposite also holds true. A disengaged student is less likely to participate, study, or succeed. In the worst case, a disconnected student will fail or drop a course. If such problems permeate to more than one class, this may lead to a student withdrawing from a school entirely. There is no “one-size-fits-all” model when it comes to teaching (1Handelsman J. Ebert-May D. Beichner R. Bruns P. Chang A. DeHaan R. Gentile J. Lauffer S. Stewart J. Tilghman S.M. Wood W.B. Education. Scientific teaching.Science. 2004; 304 (15105480): 521-52210.1126/science.1096022Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). I have found it is best to experiment in order to identify those teaching practices that work best for me and for my students. However, I hope it may be helpful to briefly describe some of the “best practices” used in my UCLA Chem 14D course, which were also validated during my recent sabbatical stint as the Robert Foster Cherry Professor at Baylor University. The notions described, albeit in the context of organic chemistry, can be generally applied to other courses. It is important to establish value on the first day of class and continue to do so throughout a course. In the case of organic chemistry, there are several key points I emphasize. 1) Most importantly, the class is ultimately about problem-solving and critical thinking. No student can dispute the value of learning these life-long skills. 2) Success in future coursework, such as biochemistry, will likely require a strong foundation in organic chemistry for a student to be successful. 3) Some professions (and associated education), including medicine, will expect students to understand organic chemistry. 4) Last, it can only help to have students appreciate the relevance of organic chemistry in everyday life. For example, I devote some time on the first day of class to describing biomolecules, such as DNA, organic light-emitted diode (OLED) technology used in modern displays, fabrics and dyes in our clothing, polymers used in movies, like Yoda from Star Wars, and countless human medicines that are made by organic chemistry. In the case of Chem 14D, this is the final course of the general and organic chemistry sequence. Many students have struggled to get this far and are just hoping to withstand the final course, rather than achieve excellence and understanding. As such, I remind students that their prior history in chemistry courses at UCLA has little bearing on how they will perform in my class, as long as they are willing to learn. I help them recall that they are academically well-qualified to excel just based on their admission to the university. Last, I give them something new to look forward to. For example, in many lower-division science classes, exams may involve the regurgitation of information, often done in multiple-choice format. Instead, I foreshadow that the most difficult problems will be more open-ended, with many possible correct answers and ample room for student creativity. I will not extensively detail organic chemistry specifics, but my general strategy centers on the notion that most students do not have a firm organic chemistry vocabulary at the start of the course. This holds true even if students have taken a prior organic chemistry class. Thus, I spend the first 2 weeks of the 10-week course teaching and emphasizing the fundamental vocabulary. This includes the recognition of certain functional groups and the rules or patterns of chemical reactivity (i.e. nucleophiles, electrophiles, arrow-pushing mechanisms, etc.). Rather than focusing on the exceptions, it is important to focus on the generalities. By laying a strong foundation, students become well-equipped to learn new chemical reactions and the mechanisms by which they occur. Last, as students further progress, we introduce reactions they have never seen before and ask them to propose mechanisms. In addition, we show them molecules they have never seen before and ask them to propose a way to make those molecules in a very open-ended way. I generally aim to have at least half of my course be focused on such advanced problems (5–6 weeks), which gives students time to practice and embrace the challenge. One of the prime challenges associated with lecture courses, in general, is finding ways to make the lectures more engaging. Performing in-class demonstrations provides a timeless means to liven up a science classroom. In the case of Chem 14D, perhaps the most well-appreciated demonstration is the classic “breathalyzer” test to check for alcohol consumption. Thanks to the modern age of technology, it is also straightforward to incorporate visual aids into lectures, such as images and videos. In my case, I use such things routinely to complement my more traditional style of writing on a chalk- or whiteboard. Overall, this allows me to teach at a reasonable pace, which, in turn, gives students time to get confused, ask questions, and learn how to draw chemical structures as if doing so was second nature. Last, I am a strong advocate for response polling devices, or “clickers” (2Caldwell J.E. Clickers in the large classroom: current research and best practice tips.CBE Life Sci.

By posing questions in class through a polling system, one keeps students engaged and obtains invaluable real-time feedback on whether or not students are learning. Faculty tend to be very busy people, but for success in undergraduate teaching, it is important that students still see that faculty care and are approachable. After teaching the same course many times, I have heard the same questions from students repeatedly. I will admit it takes some effort to show enthusiasm when answering repeat questions, but I remind myself that the material is completely new to the students. Showing complete care and enthusiasm goes a long way to positively impact students. Likewise, it is important for teachers to take the time to prepare their lectures and put effort into their courses. If the teacher appears not to care, the students will pick up on this and are likely to adopt a similar sentiment. If one is intent on offering a challenging course, it is also important to provide a superb support system. It is crucial to advertise and repeatedly remind students of one's office hours. In addition to offering regular office hours, I will respond to questions daily via an online office-hours type system. I will also meet with students through individual appointments throughout the term. It is critical to recognize students when they are improving, participating, or performing at a very high level. Such recognition can be achieved in many ways, such as offering handshakes, writing supportive notes on exams, or providing a “gift” of some variety. In my class at UCLA, I have given out periodic table beach towels to students who volunteer to solve a difficult problem in front of the class. The students who have received these towels have been seen wearing the towels (e.g. as a cape) in class and even just while walking across the UCLA campus. As an alternative form of recognition, I have treated students to meals on campus, local restaurants, and in my home. Grading with a “curve” is incredibly common in lower division classes. Even the first time I taught Chem 14D, I “curved” the class because it was convenient for me to be vague in my syllabus and I just did not know any better. I later realized, however, that the “curve” created a fierce and undesirable sense of competition, which was counterproductive toward learning and collaboration. The goal should also be for students to learn, and it is best to provide grading transparency whenever possible. As such, I ultimately switched to offering a set grading scale, where we set grading cut-offs. For example, a weighted average of exams and other assignments that exceeds 95% will guarantee a student an A grade. I reserve the right to lower the cut-off to make the grading more generous, but I promise the students that I will never raise the cut-off. By setting high expectations, but making the expectations clear, the students can set personal goals and comfortably study with their peers. At UCLA, the students sign up for “discussion sections” (also known as “recitations”) when taking large lecture classes. These are taught by graduate student teaching assistants and provide a forum for students to meet in groups of 20–30 to clarify concepts and hone student problem-solving skills. In addition, we have several means to allow undergraduate students who have previously done well in the course to help teach discussion sections. Formally, the undergraduates are termed “learning assistants” or “undergraduate assistants,” and they can even earn course credit for studying pedagogy. In a recent offering of Chem 14D, nine undergraduates joined the teaching team to provide the enrolled students with an incredible support system and a stellar active learning environment. Especially when teaching large classes, making an effort to learn student names can have a tremendous impact (4Astin A.W. What Matters in College?: Four Critical Years Revisited. Jossey–Bass, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). If I am teaching a class of 400 students, I learn at least 200 names during the term. The effort alone means the world to students and can help students make a reciprocal effort in the course. It is critical for teachers to accept responsibility for every aspect of their course. Thus, when a student may appear distracted in class, I ask myself what I could do to better engage that student. Likewise, when writing exams, it is my responsibility as the teacher to make sure the content and difficulty level are commensurate with the class materials and the level of support and resources I have provided. Otherwise, exam averages can be low, and this can be extremely disheartening to both the students and the professor. If an exam average turns out to be low in my class, I make it a point to let the students know that I made some judgment errors, as it is highly unlikely that ∼400 students performed poorly on a “fair” exam. Countless times, I have heard faculty describe teaching as being a burden and something that stands in the way of one's research objectives. This mentality is unfortunate, but ultimately a result of the academic system where faculty promotions are generally tied to research publications and funding. Nonetheless, it is important that teachers adopt the mentality that teaching is not a burden. Rather, teaching is an incredible opportunity to educate the future leaders and problem solvers of the world, while sharing one's passions. For the vast majority of academicians, the true legacy we leave behind lies with our students, not our publications or H-index. The creativity displayed by my organic chemistry students has been nothing short of inspiring. I have seen student creativity take many forms, including through an unconventional assignment I first began offering in 2010. More specifically, I offer my students the chance to make organic chemistry music videos, which are parodies of their favorite songs, but with a chemistry theme. This type of assignment has become commonplace, but in 2010, it was new. The students can work on their own or in small groups. They post their final videos on YouTube.com, where they are immediately available for grading and for their peers to enjoy. The teaching assistants and I then grade each of the videos and award extra credit. Despite the amount of extra credit being minimal, students are always eager to complete the assignment. It offers a chance for students to do something unusual and highly creative, enjoy an activity with their friends, and even learn some organic chemistry in the process. More than 1300 of my students have teamed up to make hundreds of music videos. They have collectively been viewed many hundreds of thousands of times around the world, spreading the love for organic chemistry. The best videos are available online in our “Hall of Fame.” Perhaps the most powerful outcome of the music video assignment is that it helps students become more engaged in the course and empowered to succeed. My goal is always for students to do extraordinary things and learn to solve the hardest problems I can offer. On exams, students will be asked to solve the notorious retrosynthesis problems, where they encounter molecules they have never seen before. They must propose a reasonable chemical synthesis of the molecule using much simpler compounds as the starting materials. At the end of my course, over two-thirds of the class can solve these problems. What is also striking is that the students show impeccable creativity in their solutions, often providing reasonable responses that bear no resemblance to what is shown on the answer key (thus, still earning full credit). Bear in mind that the students in my Chem 14D class are never chemistry or biochemistry majors; instead, they are typically second-year life science students who are not likely to further pursue organic chemistry after taking my class. I should also note that I did not learn to solve problems of comparable difficulty until my first year of graduate studies at Caltech. Student surveys about the Chem 14D course and organic chemistry have been overwhelmingly positive. Of note, at the end of the course, more than two-thirds of the students rate their interest in organic chemistry as “high,” whereas only <4% rate their interest in the subject as “low.” This is a dramatic shift from the start of the course, where <10% indicated a “high” rating and >60% rated their interest as “low.” The course has been featured in various UCLA Newsroom stories as “UCLA's Most Beloved Class,” in Buzzfeed as the second “coolest class at UCLA,” ahead of actor James Franco's class on creative writing and screenplay, and in LA Weekly magazine as one of the “Best Classes in LA.” There are two lessons that stand out most to me. The first is that students can learn to love a class as dreaded and as notorious as organic chemistry. This notion applies to thousands of students, even if one only considers the students I have taught at UCLA. The second lesson has to do with the innovation and creativity shown by students. Whether we think about organic chemistry music videos or the unique solutions students devise in solving retrosynthesis problems, it is clear that our students are capable of doing extraordinary things. Educators should be mindful of this and should aspire to draw out a spirit of creativity and innovation from their students when teaching. Inspired by my students, I have enjoyed the opportunity to create educational resources for organic chemistry, including online resources (5Brown P.C. Rodiger 3rd, H.L. McDaniel M.A. Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA2014Crossref Google Scholar, 6Brinkley A. El-Fakahany E. Dessants B. Flamm M. Forcey Jr., C.B.

Managing Technology in Higher Education: Strategies for Transforming Teaching and Learning. Jossey–Bass, San Francisco2011Google Scholar), that are currently being used around the world. Each of the following projects has involved extensive collaboration with students. The Organic Coloring Book is a self-published coloring book, co-authored with my daughters. The book allows students of all ages to appreciate the vast impact of organic chemistry in our world (10Garg E. Garg K. Garg N.K. The Organic Coloring Book. Garg and Family Publishing Company, Los Angeles2017Google Scholar). Biology and Chemistry Online Notes (BACON) is an online website that provides concise written tutorials on organic chemistry (8Shah T.K. Garg N.K. Organic chemistry can sizzle.Nat. Rev. Chem. 2017; 1 (0020)10.1038/s41570-017-0020Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The tutorials connect common topics in organic chemistry with medicine, other aspects of everyday life, and even pop culture. BACON is used all over the world and has been used by nearly 50,000 students to date. Backside Attack is a free iOS smartphone application that teaches organic chemistry in a fun, gaming-type environment. The game focuses on the bimolecular substitution reaction, which proceeds by “backside attack,” and provides a learning tool for many fundamental organic chemistry concepts. QR Chem is a free online teaching resource that ultimately allows students to interact with three-dimensional chemical structures on their own smartphones (9Dang J. Lin B. Yuan J. Schwartz S.T. Shah R.M. Garg N.K. Smart access to 3D structures.Nat. Rev. Chem. 2018; 2: 95-9610.1038/s41570-018-0021-yCrossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). RS Chemistry provides a free online forum for students to learn and practice the skill of assigning stereocenters of organic molecules, but in the context of medicines and other life-impacting molecules. More than 50 brilliant students have been involved in the creation of the above-mentioned resources or other collaborative teaching-related activities. They deserve to be mentioned individually. They are: Sarah Anthony, Emma Baker-Tripp, Joyann Barber, Timothy Boit, Jason Chari, Grace Chiou, Michael Corsello, Jacob Dander, Johnny Dang, Noah Fine Nathel, Adam Goetz, Liana Hie, Alexander Huters, Francesca Ippoliti, Tara Kappel, Vandan Kasara, Andrew Kelleghan, Junyong Kim, Brian Lin, Crystal Lin, Stacy Ma, Ali Mally, Jose Medina, Milauni Mehta, Preeya Mehta, Lucas Morrill, Jesus Moreno, Melinda Nguyen, Lauren Ogata, Karen Anne O'Laco, William Parsons, Krishan Patel, Jonathan Pham, Lee Pham, Stefan Prisacaru, Stephen Ramgren, Melissa Ramirez, Johnny Randhawa, Shawn Schwartz, Nikhil Shah, Rishabh Shah, Emily Siegler, Amanda Silberstein, Bryan Simmons, Ganeev Singh, Ernst Schmid, Tejas Shah, Joel Smith, Justin Soffer, Robert Susick, Evan Styduhar, Nicholas Weires, Julia Yuan, Jimmy Zheng, and Julia Zhu. The other major player in the above-mentioned projects who deserves special attention is Dr. Daniel Caspi (Element TwentySix). Daniel and I were project partners in graduate school. We have enjoyed many opportunities to collaborate on science and educational initiatives in recent years. Daniel has led the computing aspects of all of the projects mentioned, while bringing countless innovative ideas to each initiative. Students want to learn, and we must never lose sight of this fundamental reality. With so much knowledge and information available online, teachers must be careful to ensure the highest standards of intellectual rigor when teaching. However, there is no reason one cannot provide an enriching educational experience that is also fun and relevant, with ample opportunities for students to exercise their creativity and critical thinking skills. It is also important to ensure that our students feel connected to our courses. There are countless opportunities for this. For example, it can only be beneficial to establish relevance. In the case of organic chemistry, many students taking the course are interested in health-related professions and appreciate learning about the critical role organic chemistry plays in the discovery and manufacturing of life-changing drugs. Alternatively, some students will engage with a course on an intellectual basis and may cherish the opportunity to learn how to solve difficult problems. Another opportunity for students to feel connected is through human interactions. Team-based activities, like the music video assignment, provide an opportunity for students to connect with one another, form study groups, and build life-long relationships. Similarly, students may develop a bond with their teaching assistants or the professor. To this day, I stay in touch with several students who took chemistry with me when I was a teaching assistant at NYU ∼20 years ago, and I am actively in touch with many hundreds of my UCLA students. It is likely that the connections I made with these students in the classroom were meaningful at the time but also helped to pave a long-term mentor-mentee relationship. Of note, the burden for creating an engaging classroom environment where students feel connected lies with the teacher, not with the student. So, how did organic chemistry become one of UCLA's most popular classes? The answer is, “It's complicated.” Nonetheless, I hope this personal account provides food for thought for anyone interested in teaching. Most importantly, remember that teaching is all about the students. We must challenge them, support them, make them feel connected to the class, and give them opportunities to do amazing things. •TEDX and Breathalyzer Demonstration, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs95YQLpSj0•Music Video Hall of Fame, https://garg.chem.ucla.edu/music-video-hall-of-fame•Biology and Chemistry Online Notes (BACON), https://learnbacon.com/•Backside Attack smartphone application, https://apps.apple.com/us/app/backside-attack/id1278956096•QR Chem website, https://qrchem.net/•RS Chemistry website, https://rschemistry.com/ •UCLA Newsroom, http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/has-organic-chemistry-become-ucla-s-most-beloved-class•Buzzfeed, https://www.buzzfeed.com/ucla/the-8-coolest-classes-to-take-at-ucla-sw50•LA Weekly Magazine, http://digitalissue.laweekly.com/publication/index.php?i=128971&m=&l=&p=201&pre=#{%22page%22:200,%22issue_id%22:128971} I thank the Trueblood family, UCLA, Dr. Daniel D.

https://openalex.org/W2978389551,"Predation is one of the main barriers that exotic species may face in newly colonized areas and may help stop or control the potential negative impacts of invasive species in the environment. We evaluated if the consumption of an invasive prey (armored catfish: Pterygoplichtys sp.) affects the dietary niche breadth and trophic level of a native predator (Neotropical river otter: Lontra longicaudis) in northern Guatemala. We examined otter scats from three rivers: two where the invasive armored catfish occurred and one without the invasive fish. Samples were collected two and seven years after the first report of the catfish in the area. We performed gross scat analysis and stable isotope analyses of nitrogen and carbon of fecal matter. Where the invasive armored catfish occurred, it was the main prey item for L. longicaudis. Particularly in the river outside of protected areas seven years after the first report of the catfish, where it accounted for 49% of the otter diet. Concordance was found between the two techniques to estimate dietary niche breadth and trophic level. The dietary niche breath of otters was narrower seven years after the invasion in comparison to two years after the invasion in both invaded rivers, but the extent of the reduction was lesser inside the protected area. Finally, the trophic level of otters also showed a reduction related to the occurrence of the armored catfish in their diet."
https://openalex.org/W2978974979,"The impact of different bitter taste compounds on the retronasal perception of coffee aroma was investigated. A sorted napping experiment was carried out on thirteen compounds at iso-intense bitter concentrations. Differences in perceptual bitter sub-qualities among the compounds were reported by Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) analyses. Seven exemplar compounds were further selected to investigate the impact of taste sub-qualities on cross-modal flavor interactions. In general, the different bitter compounds, when paired with a coffee aroma isolate, significantly modified the perception of the retronasal coffee aroma profile. Interestingly, the three bitter compounds endogenous to coffee had the most similar impact on the coffee aroma profile. Further sensory analysis of these sample sets indicated no significant effect of the bitter compounds on the orthonasal perception. Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the volatile composition of the samples headspace also indicated negligible impact of the bitter compounds on aroma release. Altogether evidence of cross-modal interactions occurring at a higher cognitive level were demonstrated in a complex food sample, supporting the importance of multi-modal sensory integration on flavor perception."
https://openalex.org/W2979181761,"Background & aims Previous studies from western countries have reported that active hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was associated with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment failure. We sought to examine this issue in an Asian cohort. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with advanced fibrosis who were treated with DAAs at our hospital between January 2017 and June 2018. Results We treated 1021 HCV-infected patients during this period. A total of 976 of those patients were enrolled in a per-protocol analysis, including 556 (57.2%) who had genotype 1b infections, and 314 (32.3%) who had genotype 2 infections. The mean age of all 976 patients was 65.5 years, and 44.5% were male. 781 of the patients had no HCC, 172 had inactive HCC, and 23 had active HCC. Non-sustained virologic response (SVR) was noted in 10 (1.3%) patients without HCC, 5 (2.9%) patients with inactive HCC, and 4 (13.0%) patients with active HCC. After adjustment for confounders, active HCC (versus inactive HCC and non-HCC) was associated with non-SVR (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 24.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.4–136.9), P<0.001). Next, we excluded the 23 patients with active HCC from the multivariate analysis. After adjustment for confounders, inactive HCC (versus non-HCC) was not associated with non-SVR (AOR = 3.1 (95% CI = 0.94–9.95), P = 0.06). Conclusion Active HCC was associated with non-SVR, while inactive HCC was not. We thus suggest the deferral of DAA treatment until after the complete radiological response of HCCs to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2977399386,"Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, is one of the most severe seed-borne bacterial diseases of rice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Xoc in response to oxidative stress are still unknown. In this study, we performed a time-course RNA-seq analysis on the Xoc in response to H2O2, aiming to reveal its oxidative response network. Overall, our RNA sequence analysis of Xoc revealed a significant global gene expression profile when it was exposed to H2O2. There were 7, 177, and 246 genes that were differentially regulated at the early, middle, and late stages after exposure, respectively. Three genes (xoc_1643, xoc_1946, xoc_3249) showing significantly different expression levels had proven relationships with oxidative stress response and pathogenesis. Moreover, a hypothetical protein (XOC_2868) showed significantly differential expression, and the xoc_2868 mutants clearly displayed a greater H2O2 sensitivity and decreased pathogenicity than those of the wild-type. Gene localization and phylogeny analysis strongly suggests that this gene may have been horizontally transferred from a Burkholderiaceae ancestor. Our study not only provides a first glance of Xoc's global response against oxidative stress, but also reveals the impact of horizontal gene transfer in the evolutionary history of Xoc."
https://openalex.org/W2978439421,"The cochlear nucleus (CN) transforms the spike trains of spiral ganglion cells into a set of sensory representations that are essential for auditory discriminations and perception. These transformations require the coordinated activity of different classes of neurons that are embryologically derived from distinct sets of precursors. Decades of investigation have shown that the neurons of the CN are differentiated by their morphology, neurotransmitter receptors, ion channel expression and intrinsic excitability. In the present study we have used linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to perform an unbiased analysis of measures of the responses of CN neurons to current injections to objectively categorize cells on the basis of both morphology and physiology. Recordings were made from cells in brain slices from CBA/CaJ mice and a transgenic mouse line, NF107, crossed against the Ai32 line. For each cell, responses to current injections were analyzed for spike rate, spike shape, input resistance, resting membrane potential, membrane time constant, hyperpolarization-activated sag and time constant. Cells were filled with dye for morphological classification, and visually classified according to published accounts. The different morphological classes of cells were separated with the LDA. Ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) bushy cells, planar multipolar (T-stellate) cells, and radiate multipolar (D-stellate) cells were in separate clusters and separate from all of the neurons from the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Within the DCN, the pyramidal cells and tuberculoventral cells were largely separated from a distinct cluster of cartwheel cells. principal axes, whereas VCN cells were in 3 clouds approximately orthogonal to this plane. VCN neurons from the two mouse strains overlapped but were slightly separated, indicating either a strain dependence or differences in slice preparation methods. We conclude that cochlear nucleus neurons can be objectively distinguished based on their intrinsic electrical properties, but such distinctions are still best aided by morphological identification."

https://openalex.org/W2977367258,"Pimobendan has gained enormous importance in the treatment of mitral valve disease in dogs. The current consensus statement of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) recommends a treatment for dogs with symptomatic disease and dogs with asymptomatic disease with radiographic and echocardiographic signs of cardiomegaly. To investigate whether these dogs also benefit from a therapy with pimobendan, 21 dogs with mitral valve disease ACVIM B1 underwent a standardized submaximal exercise test on a treadmill. In this double-blinded and randomized study, the animals were divided into two groups, one receiving pimobendan and the other a placebo. At the first visit and at every follow-up appointment (at days 90 and 180), heart rate during the complete exercise test and lactate before and after running were measured. In addition to this, a questionnaire was completed by the dogs’ owners and all dogs were given an echocardiographic examination to detect any changes and to observe if the disease had progressed. Due to the diagnosis of leishmaniosis, one dog in the pimobendan group was retrospectively removed from the study so that 20 dogs were included for statistical analysis. No differences were observed at any time between the pimobendan-group and the placebo-group regarding heart rate. At day 180, the increase in lactate after exercise was significantly lower than in the placebo-group. The increase in the pimobendan-group at day 180 was lower than at day 90. Most of the dog owners from the pimobendan-group declared that their dogs were more active at day 90 (6/10) and at day 180 (8/10), while most dog owners from the placebo-group observed no changes regarding activity at day 90 (8/10) and day 180 (6/10). It can be concluded that the results of this study indicate that some dogs with mitral valve disease ACVIM B1 might benefit from a therapy with pimobendan."
https://openalex.org/W2978284546,"Evaluation of soil redistribution rates and influence on crop yield in agricultural catchments is very important information, which can provide a scientific basis for arrangement of soil and water conservation measures and sustainable crop production. In recent decades, the soil erosion has greatly aggravated in the Mollisol region of Northeast China due to unreasonable land management, which in turn has reduced crop yield. The objectives of this study were to investigate the spatial distribution of soil redistribution and the relationship between crop yield and soil redistribute at a catchment of the Chinese Mollisol region. A total of 176 soil samples were collected based on a 200 m by 200 m grid and 4 yr of corn (Zea mays L.) yields were measured. The 137Cs trace technique and Zhang Xinbao’s mass balance model indicated that the soil redistribution rates ranged from −7122.25 to 5471.70 t km−2 yr−1 and averaged −830.10 t km−2 yr−1. Soil erosion dominated in the research area. The corn yields for four years ranged from 43.24 to 136.19 kg km−2 and averaged 90.42 kg km−2. The spatial distribution of soil redistribution rates and corn yield showed a similar ribbon and plaque characteristics at the catchment. An equation between corn yield and soil redistribution rates was fitted and showed that there was a significant negative correlation between corn yield and soil erosion rates, while there was no relationship between the corn yield and soil deposition rates. Therefore, effective soil and water conservation measures are urgently needed to increase crop yield and realize sustainable land-use management."
https://openalex.org/W2978549679,"Cell compartmentalization is an essential process by which eukaryotic cells separate and control biological processes. Although calmodulins are well-known to regulate catalytic properties of their targets, we show here their involvement in the subcellular location of two plant proteins. Both proteins exhibit a dual location, namely in the cytosol in addition to their association to plastids (where they are known to fulfil their role). One of these proteins, ceQORH, a long-chain fatty acid reductase, was analyzed in more detail, and its calmodulin-binding site was identified by specific mutations. Such a mutated form is predominantly targeted to plastids at the expense of its cytosolic location. The second protein, TIC32, was also shown to be dependent on its calmodulin-binding site for retention in the cytosol. Complementary approaches (bimolecular fluorescence complementation and reverse genetics) demonstrated that the calmodulin isoform CAM5 is specifically involved in the retention of ceQORH in the cytosol. This study identifies a new role for calmodulin and sheds new light on the intriguing CaM-binding properties of hundreds of plastid proteins, despite the fact that no CaM or CaM-like proteins were identified in plastids."

Design, setting and participants Population-based cohort study in New South Wales, Australia of prostate cancer survivors aged <70 years at diagnosis and who returned a 10-year follow-up questionnaire. Methods Validated instruments assessed patient’s HRQOL and psychological well-being. Poisson regression was used to estimate adjusted relative proportions (RRs) of prostate cancer survivor groups who were currently eating differently (‘using diet’) or exercise differently (‘using exercise’) to help with their prostate cancer. Results 996 (61.0% of 1634) participants completed the 10-year questionnaire of whom 118 (11.8%; 95%CI[9.8–13.9]) were using diet and 78 (7.8%; 95%CI[6.2–9.5]) were using exercise to help with their prostate cancer. Men were more likely to use diet or use exercise for prostate cancer if they were younger (p-trend = 0.020 for diet, p-trend = 0.045 for exercise), more educated (p-trend<0.001, p-trend = 0.011), support group participants (p-nominal<0.001, p-nominal = 0.005), had higher Gleason score at diagnosis (p-trend<0.001, p-trend = 0.002) and had knowledge of cancer spread (p-nominal = 0.002, p-nominal = 0.001). Use of diet was also associated with receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (RR = 1.59; 95%CI[1.04–2.45]), a greater fear of cancer recurrence (p-trend = 0.010), cognitive avoidance (p-trend = 0.025) and greater perceived control of cancer course (p-trend = 0.014). Use of exercise was also associated with receipt of prostatectomy (RR = 2.02; 95%CI[1.12–3.63]), receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (RR = 2.20; 95%CI[1.34–3.61]) and less satisfaction with medical treatments (p-trend = 0.044). Conclusions Few long-term prostate cancer survivors use diet or exercise to help with their prostate cancer. Survivors may benefit from counselling on the scientific evidence supporting healthy eating and regular exercise for improving quality-of-life and cancer-related outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2977273445,"Given constrained funding for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) programs across Sub-Saharan Africa, delivering services efficiently is paramount. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a key intervention that can substantially reduce heterosexual transmission-the primary mode of transmission across the continent. There is limited research, however, on what factors may contribute to the efficient and high-quality execution of such programs.We analyzed a multi-country, multi-stage random sample of 108 health facilities providing VMMC services in sub-Saharan Africa in 2012 and 2013. The survey collected information on inputs, outputs, process quality and management practices from facilities providing VMMC services. We analyzed the relationship between management practices, quality (measured through provider vignettes) and efficiency (estimated through data envelopment analysis) using Generalized Linear Models and Mixed-effects Models. Applying multivariate regression models, we assessed the relationship between management indices and efficiency and quality of VMMC services.Across countries, both efficiency and quality varied widely. After adjusting for type of facility, country and scale, performance-base funding was negatively correlated with efficiency -0.156 (p < 0.05). In our analysis, we did not find any significant relationships between quality and management practices.No significant relationship was found between process quality and management practices across 108 VMMC facilities. This study is the first to analyze the potential relationships between management and service quality and efficiency among a sample of VMMC health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa and can potentially inform policy-relevant hypotheses to later test through prospective experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2978684983,"Classical crop models have been developed to predict crop yield and quality, and they are based on physiological and environmental inputs. After molecular discoveries, models should integrate genetic variation to allow predictions that are more genotype-dependent. An interesting approach, Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL)-based ecophysiological modeling, has shown promising results for the design of ideotypes that are adapted to biotic and abiotic stresses, but there are still limitations to attaining a fully integrated model. The aim of this case study is to clarify the impact of choosing different model equations (closely related and with different numbers of parameters) and optimization methods on the detection of QTLs controlling the parameters of crop growth. Different growth equations were parameterized based on a genetic population by following different approaches. The correlations between parameters were analyzed, and two different strategies were adopted to address the correlation issue. QTL analysis was performed on the optimized values of the parameters of the growth equations and on the observed dry mass (DM) data to validate the QTLs detected. Overall, models and strategies resulted in different QTLs being detected. Similar LOD profiles but with peaks of different heights were observed, some of which were significant, resulting in different numbers of QTLs. In some cases, peaks had slightly different positions or were absent. Even closely related growth models led to the detection of different QTLs. The goodness of fit and complexity of the growth models were found to be insufficient to select the best model. Calculating parameters independently of observed data may not be a good strategy, whereas setting parameters independent of the genotype is recommended. Given the large-scale global optimization problem and the strong correlations between parameters, the two algorithms tested showed poor performance. Currently, the lack of effective algorithms is the main obstacle to answering the question posed. The authors therefore suggest testing different model formulations and comparing the QTLs detected before choosing the best formulation to use in an ecophysiological modeling approach based on QTLs."

While the spliceosome pairs exons with a high degree of accuracy, the rates of rare aberrant and non-canonical pre-mRNA splicing have not been evaluated at the nucleotide level to determine the quantity and identity of these events across splice junctions. Using ultra-deep sequencing the frequency of aberrant and non-canonical splicing events for three splice junctions flanking exon 7 of SMN1 were determined at single nucleotide resolution. After correction for background noise introduced by PCR amplification and sequencing steps, pre-mRNA splicing was shown to maintain a low overall rate of aberrant and non-canonically spliced events. Several previously unannotated splicing events across 3 exon|intron junctions in SMN1 were identified. Mutations within SMN exon 7 were shown to affect splicing fidelity by modulating RNA secondary structures, by altering the binding site of regulatory proteins and by changing the 5’ splice site strength. Mutations also create a truncated SMN1 exon 7 through the introduction of a de novo non-canonical 5’ splice site. The results from the ultra-deep sequencing approach highlight the impressive fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing and demonstrate that the immediate sequence context around splice sites is the main driving force behind non-canonical splice site pairing."
https://openalex.org/W2978388935,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) provide insight on transcription regulation and illuminate the molecular basis of phenotypic outcomes. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming a popular technique to measure gene expression abundance. Traditional eQTL mapping methods for microarray expression data often assume the expression data follow a normal distribution. As a result, for RNA-seq data, total read count measurements can be normalized by normal quantile transformation in order to fit the data using a linear regression. Other approaches model the total read counts using a negative binomial regression. While these methods work well for common variants (minor allele frequencies > 5% or 1%), an extension of existing methodology is needed to accommodate a collection of rare variants in RNA-seq data. Here, we examine 2 approaches that are direct applications of existing methodology and apply these approaches to RNAseq studies: 1) collapsing the rare variants in the region and using either negative binomial regression or Poisson regression and 2) using the normalized read counts with the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT), the burden test for SKAT (SKAT-Burden), or an optimal combination of these two tests (SKAT-O). We evaluated these approaches via simulation studies under numerous scenarios and applied these approaches to the 1,000 Genomes Project."
https://openalex.org/W2979170499,"Introduction Data on engagement in HIV care from population-based samples in sub-Saharan Africa are limited. The objective of this study was to use double-sampling methods to estimate linkage to HIV care, ART initiation, and mortality among all adults diagnosed with HIV by a comprehensive home-based counseling and testing (HBCT) program in western Kenya. Methods HBCT was conducted door-to-door from December 2009 to April 2011 in three sub-counties of western Kenya by AMPATH (Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare). For those identified as HIV-positive, data were merged with electronic medical records to determine engagement with HIV care. A randomly-drawn follow-up sample of 120 adults identified via HBCT who had not linked to care as of June 2015 in Bunyala sub-county were visited by trained fieldworkers to ascertain HIV care engagement and vital status. Double-sampled data were used to generate, via multinomial regression, predicted probabilities of engagement in care and mortality among those whose status could not be ascertained by matching with the electronic medical records in the three catchments. Results Incorporating information from the double-sampling yielded estimates of prospective linkage to HIV care that ranged from 40–45%. Mortality estimates of those who did not engage in care following HBCT ranged from 12–16%. Among those who linked to care following HBCT, between 72–81% initiated ART. Discussion In settings without universal national identifiers, rates of linkage to care from community-based programs may be subject to substantial underestimation. Follow-up samples of those with missing information can be used to partially correct this bias, as has been demonstrated previously for mortality among those who were lost-to-care programs. There is a need for harmonized data systems across health systems and programs."
