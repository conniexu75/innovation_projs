https://openalex.org/W2131798870,"We previously identified the angiogenesis inhibitor angiostatin. Using a similar strategy, we have identified endostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor produced by hemangioendothelioma. Endostatin is a 20 kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII. Endostatin specifically inhibits endothelial proliferation and potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth. By a novel method of sustained release, E. coli-derived endostatin was administered as a nonrefolded suspension. Primary tumors were regressed to dormant microscopic lesions. Immunohistochemistry revealed blocked angiogenesis accompanied by high proliferation balanced by apoptosis in tumor cells. There was no toxicity. Together with angiostatin data, these findings validate a strategy for identifying endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, suggest a theme of fragments of proteins as angiogenesis inhibitors, and demonstrate dormancy therapy."

The two proteins were found to colocalize in vivo and to coimmunoprecipitate. BRCA1 residues 758–1064 alone formed Rad51-containing complexes in vitro. Rad51 is also specifically associated with developing synaptonemal complexes in meiotic cells, and BRCA1 and Rad51 were both detected on asynapsed (axial) elements of human synaptonemal complexes. These findings suggest a functional interaction between BRCA1 and Rad51 in the meiotic and mitotic cell cycles, which, in turn, suggests a role for BRCA1 in the control of recombination and of genome integrity."

https://openalex.org/W1976822357,"We show that the HSV-1 structural protein VP22 has the remarkable property of intercellular transport, which is so efficient that following expression in a subpopulation the protein spreads to every cell in a monolayer, where it concentrates in the nucleus and binds chromatin. VP22 movement was observed both after delivery of DNA by transfection or microinjection and during virus infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that VP22 trafficking occurs via a nonclassical Golgi-independent mechanism. Sensitivity to cytochalasin D treatment suggests that VP22 utilizes a novel trafficking pathway that involves the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we demonstrate intercellular transport of a VP22 fusion protein after endogenous synthesis or exogenous application, indicating that VP22 may have potential in the field of protein delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4213265720,"We have analyzed the set of genes expressed from the yeast genome, herein called the transcriptome, using serial analysis of gene expression. Analysis of 60,633 transcripts revealed 4,665 genes, with expression levels ranging from 0.3 to over 200 transcripts per cell. Of these genes, 1981 had known functions, while 2684 were previously uncharacterized. The integration of positional information with gene expression data allowed for the generation of chromosomal expression maps identifying physical regions of transcriptional activity and identified genes that had not been predicted by sequence information alone. These studies provide insight into global patterns of gene expression in yeast and demonstrate the feasibility of genome-wide expression studies in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2104324075,"Both NF-κB and c-Jun are activated by cytokines such as TNF-α and by stresses such as UV irradiation. A key step in the activation of NF-κB is the phosphorylation of its inhibitor, IκBα, by a ubiquitination-inducible multiprotein kinase complex (IκBα kinase). A central kinase in the c-Jun activation pathway is mito- gen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase-1 (MEKK1). Here, we show that MEKK1 induces the site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα in vivo and, most strikingly, can directly activate the IκBα kinase complex in vitro. Thus, MEKK1 is a critical component of both the c-Jun and NF-κB stress response pathways. Since the IκBα kinase complex can be independently activated by ubiquitination or MEKK1-dependent phosphorylation, it may be an integrator of multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2038901745,"The adult mammalian cortex is characterized by a distinct laminar structure generated through a well- defined pattern of neuronal migration. Successively generated neurons are layered in an “inside-out” manner to produce six cortical laminae. We demonstrate here that p35, the neuronal-specific activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5, plays a key role in proper neuronal migration. Mice lacking p35, and thus p35/cdk5 kinase activity, display severe cortical lamination defects and suffer from sporadic adult lethality and seizures. Histological examination reveals that the mutant mice lack the characteristic laminated structure of the cortex. Neuronal birth-dating experiments indicate a reversed packing order of cortical neurons such that earlier born neurons reside in superficial layers and later generated neurons occupy deep layers. The phenotype of p35 mutant mice thus demonstrates that the formation of cortical laminar structure depends on the action of the p35/cdk5 kinase."

https://openalex.org/W2061701210,"Deregulation of signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is common in human malignancy progression. One mutant EGFR (variously named ΔEGFR, de2-7 EGFR, or EGFRvIII), which occurs frequently in human cancers, lacks a portion of the extracellular ligand-binding domain due to genomic deletions that eliminate exons 2 to 7 and confers a dramatic enhancement of brain tumor cell tumorigenicity in vivo. In order to dissect the molecular mechanisms of this activity, we analyzed location, autophosphorylation, and attenuation of the mutant receptors. The mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface and constitutively autophosphorylated at a significantly decreased level compared with wild-type EGFR activated by ligand treatment. Unlike wild-type EGFR, the constitutively active ΔEGFR were not down-regulated, suggesting that the altered conformation of the mutant did not result in exposure of receptor sequence motifs required for endocytosis and lysosomal sorting. Mutational analysis showed that the enhanced tumorigenicity was dependent on intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and was mediated through the carboxyl terminus. In contrast with wild-type receptor, mutation of any major tyrosine autophosphorylation site abolished these activities suggesting that the biological functions of ΔEGFR are due to low constitutive activation with mitogenic effects amplified by failure to attenuate signaling by receptor down-regulation.

Ligand binding to wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (wt EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: wtwild typeEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterBSAbovine serum albumin. results in receptor dimerization, kinase activation, and autophosphorylation that provides both docking sites for proteins involved in signal transduction and exposure of endocytic and lysosomal targeting sequence codes required for receptor internalization and down-regulation (1Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Marks F. Protein Phosphorylation. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany1996: 265-284Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The biochemical and biological roles of each autophosphorylation site in wt EGFR have been explored by mutational analysis, and mutation of any single autophosphorylation site does not significantly abrogate binding of the activated receptor to specific SH2-containing proteins associated with distinct signaling pathways (2Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, such single mutations are generally incapable of reducing the biological functions of the receptor in in vitro models (3Helin K. Velu T. Martin P. Vass W.C. Allevato G. Lowy D.R.

Correspondingly, the mitogenic and transforming activities of wild-type receptor were diminished only when combinations of favorable autophosphorylation sites (i.e. Tyr-1068, Tyr-1148, and Tyr-1173) were mutated (3Helin K. Velu T. Martin P. Vass W.C. Allevato G. Lowy D.R. Beguinot L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 825-832PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the autophosphorylation sites of wt EGFR may have less specificity for signaling proteins and can compensate for each other. Sites of tyrosine phosphorylation may be provided via heterodimerization with other members of the erb B family of receptors (5Qian X.L. Decker S.J. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence suggests that autophosphorylation of EGFR results in a more open conformation (11Cadena D.L. Chan C. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 260-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to expose the otherwise cryptic internalization/lysosomal targeting motifs to the receptor trafficking machinery, thereby triggering receptor down-regulation processes. Receptors lacking internalization sequences can lead to cell transformation (12Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.-P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

Mutations of the EGFR gene occur in many types of human tumors where growth deregulation is pervasive (13Xu Y.H. Richert N. Ito S. Merlino G.T. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In glial tumors of the central nervous system, abnormalities of the EGFR are restricted to grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma) and especially grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme) disease (16Wong A.J.

Cancer. 1994; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several clinical and histopathological studies have shown that such abnormalities are related to a shorter interval to relapse and decreased survival rates, suggesting that they play an important role in glioma malignancy progression (18Schlegel J.

Nearly 50% of grade IV tumors have significantly amplified EGFR genes, and of these, the majority also show rearrangements of the gene so that these gliomas express both wt EGFR and the mutant forms (16Wong A.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4309-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The most common of the rearrangements are genomic alterations that eliminate a DNA fragment containing exons 2-7 of the gene and generate a mutant receptor (variously called ΔEGFR, de2-7 EGFR, or EGFRvIII) with an in-frame deletion of 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain (21Ekstrand A.J.

Biegel J.A. Hayes R.L. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5536-5539PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies we found that expression of ΔEGFR in glioblastoma cells markedly enhanced tumor cell growth in nude mice (26Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.-J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanisms of the enhanced tumorigenicity have not been elucidated. Two defects have been described for the ΔEGFR, lack of EGF binding and constitutive autophosphorylation that was unaffected by ligand but whose extent was low compared with that of ligand-activated wt EGFR in the same cell. The importance of autophosphorylation as a marker of constitutive kinase activation of ΔEGFR to tumor growth was thus unclear. Here we report that ΔEGFR are expressed on the cell surface but are defective in down-regulation due to low rates of receptor endocytosis. Both the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and each of the major sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation located in the regulatory carboxyl terminus are essential for the enhanced tumorigenesis characteristic of ΔEGFR. Unlike wt EGFR, a single point mutation in any of the major autophosphorylation sites is sufficient to abrogate the in vivo growth advantage conferred by ΔEGFR. Thus deletion of exons 2-7 abolished ligand binding but created a constitutively active EGFR that was strictly dependent for biological activity on intact autophosphorylation. Defective attenuation due to failure to down-regulate activated receptors appears to be the major mechanism that enhances tumorigenicity of these weakly phosphorylated EGFR mutants. Thus deletion of exons 2-7 results in a partially active EGFR that couples to mitogenic signal transduction but not to vesicular trafficking pathways. Anti-EGFR antibodies included mouse monoclonals 528 and 225 (27Kawamoto T. Sato J.D. Le A. Polikoff J. Sato G.H. Mendelsohn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kyte, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, Ca), and mouse monoclonal C13 directed against residues 991-1018 in the carboxyl terminus. The monoclonal antibodies specific for ΔEGFR, D806, D1133, and D124, were generated against the fusion junction in the ectodomain of the mutant receptor. 2H.-J. S. Huang, E. Stockert, and L. J.

The monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY20 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and the rabbit polyclonal antiphosphotyrosine sera were prepared as described (29Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1988; 2: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar). All mutant EGFR cDNAs were first constructed in pBluescript SK(-) vector (Stratagene) and then transferred to a retrovirus-based vector, pLRNL (30Xu L. Yee J.K. Wolff J.A. Friedmann T. Virology. 1989; 171: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The DK cDNA was generated by replacing the 769-base pair EcoRI fragment (nucleotides 2317-3085) (31Ullrich A. Coussens L. Hayflick J.S. Dull T.J. Gray A. Tam A.W. Lee J. Yarden Y. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Downward J. Mayes E.L.V. Whittle N. Waterfield M.D. Seeburg P.H.

U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) with the corresponding fragment from the kinase-inactive EGF receptor cDNA, K721M (8Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1987; 328: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). DY1, DY2, and DY3 represent the ΔEGFR with point mutation(s) which replace tyrosine with phenylalanine at residue 1173, residues 1068 and 1173, and residues 1068, 1148, and 1173, respectively. DY1, DY2, and DY3 were constructed by replacing the 1.2-kilobase pair BglII/HindIII fragment (nucleotides 2951 to the carboxyl-terminal end) of pSKΔEGFR with the corresponding DNA fragments from pX-TF1, pX-TF2, and pX-TF3 (32Bertics P.J.

DY5 was created by a double recombinant polymerase chain reaction (34Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar) which generated an additional two point mutations in the DY3 cDNA template. Primers used in this construction were as follows: (a) 5′-TGTACCATCGATGTCTA-3′ (sense, nucleotides 3001-3017); (b) 5′-TGTGGGATGAGGAACTCGTCGGCAT-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 3221-3245); (c) 5′-ATGCCGACGAGTTCCTCATCCCACA-3, (sense, nucleotides 3221-3245); (d) 5′-TCGTCTATGCTGTCCTC-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 3421-3437); (e) 5′-GAGGACAGCATAGACGA-3′ (sense, nucleotides 3421-3437); (f) 5′-GGCTGATTGTGAAAGACAGGATTCT-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 3503-3527); (g) 5′-AGAATCCTGTCTTTCACAATCAGCC-3′ (sense, nucleotides 3503-3527); and (h) 5′-TTGCCCACTGCAGTGCT-3′ (antisense, nucleotides 3574-3590). Briefly, two DNA fragments, A and B, were produced by using two pairs of primers, a + b and c + d, respectively in polymerase chain reaction mixtures containing DY3 cDNA. The other two DNA fragments, C and D, were generated by the same method using the other two sets of primers, e + f and g + h. Equimolar amounts of fragments A and B were used with primers a and d to generate recombinant fragment E. Fragments C and D were mixed to produce recombinant fragment F by the same method using primers e and h. Finally, fragments E and F were used to generate recombinant fragment G by using primers a and h. Fragment G, after digestion with ClaI and PstI, was used to replace the corresponding region (nucleotides 3007-3582) in the DY3 cDNA. DY4 is the ΔEGFR with four point mutations which changed codons 992, 1068, 1086, and 1148 from tyrosine to phenylalanine. DY4 was constructed by replacing the 0.25-kilobase pair PvuII/XhoI fragment (nucleotides 3762 to the carboxyl-terminal end) in the DY5 cDNA with the equivalent region of ΔEGFR. Amphotropic viruses which carried the mutant EGFR were generated as described (26Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.-J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The human glioblastoma cell line U87MG (ATCC) was infected with mutant EGFR viruses and selected in a medium containing 400 μg of G418 per ml (26Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.-J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stained cells were analyzed with a FACSort (Becton Dickinson). For cell sorting, sodium azide was omitted from the staining buffer, and the brightest 5% of the stained cells were selected with a FACStar (Becton Dickinson). The sorted cells were cultured and reanalyzed. The number of DK and DY mutant receptors on the cell surface was estimated by comparing the fluorescence intensity of these cells with that of U87MG.ΔEGFR cells which expressed 2 x 106ΔEGFR per cell (26Nishikawa R. Ji X.-D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.-J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Cells (4 x 105 cells per well in a 12-well plate or 2.5 x 106 cells per 100-mm dish) were cultured overnight in medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml EGF (Collaborative Biomedical Products) for 5 min at 37°C. For Western blotting, cells were washed with PBS, lysed in a PBS buffer containing 0.06 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1.3% SDS, 12.8% (v/v) glycerol, 1.3% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.25% bromophenol blue, and then boiled. The lysates were electrophoresed through SDS, 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and the proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation/Western blotting, cells were lysed in a PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% sodium azide, 0.04% sodium fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. EGFR were immunoisolated using a ΔEGFR-specific monoclonal antibody, D1133, or anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, 528, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20, and the proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). The blots were stripped and reprobed with the C13 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody in the enhanced chemiluminescence system. EGFR concentration and phosphorylation were determined by scanning the autoradiograms with a densitometer. Multiple exposures were obtained to ensure linearity of response, and relative phosphorylation was calculated under these conditions. The level of EGFR phosphorylation was normalized to the protein concentration. The enhanced chemiluminescence was employed to minimize the possibilities of residual signal when stripping blots probed with 125I-protein A. For additional quantitation of phosphotyrosine content, confluent monolayers of U87MG or U87MG.ΔEGFR cells on 100-mm dishes were untreated or treated with EGF or 225 IgG (27Kawamoto T. Sato J.D.

A. 1983; 80: 1337-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), rinsed with PBS, and extracted with 500 μl of boiling SDS sample buffer (5% SDS, 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM Na3VO4). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 5-15% gradient gels, transferred to nitrocellulose in the presence of 0.1 mM Na3VO4, and blocked with 2.5% BSA, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, and 0.005% Tween 20. Tyrosine phosphate was detected using 5 μg/ml affinity purified antiphosphotyrosine polyclonal antibodies in conjunction with 50 ng/ml 125I-Protein A for 30 min. Dried blots were exposed to storage phosphor plates followed by imaging using a Bio-Rad G250 Molecular Imager. Profiles from the appropriate lanes were used to determine the difference between the phosphotyrosine pattern of either control or U87MG cells expressing ΔEGFR using the Molecular Analyst software package. Cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips 48 h prior to the experiment and were either untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 h and then fixed for 10 min at room temperature with freshly prepared 3.6% paraformaldehyde, 0.024% saponin, 1 mM Na3VO4 in PBS. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 0.1% NaBH4 for 10 min, and nonspecific sites were blocked with 1% BSA. To detect total EGFR, a mixture of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies was used (528, 13A9, 225; 10 μg/ml each). To detect ΔEGFR, D1133 monoclonal antibody was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. All antibody and rinse solutions contained 1% BSA, 0.012% saponin, and 1 mM Na3VO4. Coverslips were incubated with antireceptor antibodies together with 10 μg/ml affinity purified rabbit antiphosphotyrosine antibodies for 1 h followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse and Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:100; Cappel Laboratories) for 45 min. The coverslips were mounted in ProLong antifade medium (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and viewed with a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope with a 40 x oil immersion objective. A multi-dye filter set was used in which excitation filters of 485 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and 575 nm (Texas Red) were selected from a computer-controlled filter wheel in conjunction with a multi-wavelength emitter and dichroic filter set (460, 525, and 640 nm; XF56 set from Omega Optical). Fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red images were acquired separately using a Photometrics cooled CCD camera and a Macintosh workstation running OncorImage software. Images were scaled to 256 gray levels using Adobe Photoshop 3.0 on the Macintosh and transferred to TMAX-100 film using an AFGA film recorder. The specific internalization rates of wild-type EGFR (wt EGFR) and ΔEGFR were determined by measuring endocytosis of 125I-labeled 13A9 monoclonal antibody. The antibody binds equally well to both the wt EGFR and ΔEGFR and does not affect the binding of EGF to the wt EGFR. This allowed evaluation of receptor endocytosis in both the empty and occupied state. 13A9 antibody was iodinated with 125I (Amersham Corp.) to a specific activity of 1500 cpm/fmol as described previously (35Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluency on fibronectin-coated plates were incubated at 0°C for 90 min with 4 nM125I-labeled 13A9 in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml EGF. The cells were rapidly warmed to 37°C by the addition of prewarmed medium. The relative amount of internalized versus surface-associated antibody was determined at 2-min intervals by acid stripping as described (9Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stripping efficiency was approximately 93%. The data were converted to internalization plots as described previously (9Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and normalized to total surface binding of 13A9 (36Welsh J.B. Worthylake R. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild-type and mutant EGFR were washed in PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 2 mM EGTA before being solubilized and homogenized at 4°C in buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4°C. Mutant receptor supernatants were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of monoclonal antibody D124, and wt EGFR supernatant was incubated with 1:100 dilution of monoclonal antibody, 13A9, at 4°C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose was then added for 30 min at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in buffer containing 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 300 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 mM benzamidine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoisolated wt EGFR was treated with 200 ng/ml EGF for 10 min at 22°C prior to start of the kinase assay. Kinase reaction mixtures contained 12.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2, 50 μM Na3VO4, 10 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1.0-2.8 x 104 cpm/pmol), immunoprecipitated EGFR, and 100 μM 1173 peptide (RRKGSTAENAEYLRV). Phosphorylation reactions proceeded for 10 min at 22°C and were terminated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 6.1%). BSA (100 μg) was added to facilitate the precipitation of EGFR, and the reactions were incubated at 4°C for 10 min. Precipitated receptors were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 x g, and phosphate incorporation was determined by spotting the supernatant on phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81, 2.4-cm circle). The phosphocellulose was washed four times in 500 ml of 75 mM phosphoric acid for 15 min at 4°C, rinsed in acetone, and dried. The amount of retained radioactivity on the phosphocellulose was then measured. Protein concentrations were determined by separating receptors and protein standards on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferring to Immobilon, probing with the anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody, Ksm, followed by an alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-rabbit antibody, and scanning the blots with a densitometer. For subcutaneous inoculation, U87MG cells (1 x 106) and U87MG cells expressing mutant EGFR (1 x 106 or 2 x 105) were suspended in 0.1 ml of PBS and injected simultaneously into the left or right flanks, respectively, of 4- to 5-wk-old female nude mice of BALB/c background. The growing tumors were measured twice a week with a caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated using width (a) and length (b) measurements (a2b/2, where a < b) (37Houchens D.P. Ovejera A.A.

For intracerebral stereotactic implantation, 1 x 105-5 x 105 cells in 5 μl of PBS were inoculated into the corpus striatum in the right hemisphere of the nude mouse brain (38Slotnick B.M.

Brains were removed 12 days postimplantation, embedded in OCT compound (Miles), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. Thin cryostat sections (5-6 μm) were stained with 528 antibody and counter-stained with hematoxylin. Tumors were microscopically measured, and the volumes of tumors were calculated as described above. The autophosphorylation of wt EGFR induced by ligand binding results in a conformational change proposed to expose cryptic endocytic and lysosomal targeting codes required for induced internalization and down-regulation (11Cadena D.L.

https://openalex.org/W2070067221,"<h2>Abstract</h2> FtsZ is a soluble, tubulin-like GTPase that forms a membrane-associated ring at the division site of bacterial cells. While this ring is thought to drive cell constriction, it is not well understood how it is assembled or how it affects cell wall invagination. Here we report that FtsZ binds directly to a novel integral inner-membrane protein in E. coli that we call ZipA. We present genetic and morphological evidence indicating that this interaction is required for cell division, and show that a fluorescent ZipA-Gfp fusion protein is located in a ring structure at the division site, both before and during cell wall invagination. ZipA is an essential component of the division machinery, and, by binding to both FtsZ and the cytoplasmic membrane, is likely to be directly involved in the assembly and/or function of the FtsZ ring."
https://openalex.org/W2133759762,"The embryonic cerebral cortex contains a population of stem-like founder cells capable of generating large, mixed clones of neurons and glia in vitro. We report that the default state of early cortical stem cells is neuronal, and that stem cells are heterogeneous in the number of neurons that they generate. In low fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) concentrations, most maintain this specification, generating solely neuronal progeny. Oligodendroglial production within these clones is stimulated by a higher, threshold level of FGF2, and astrocyte production requires additional environmental factors. Because most cortical neurons are born before glia in vivo, these data support a model in which the scheduled production of cortical cells involves an intrinsic neuronal program in the early stem cells and exposure to environmental, glia-inducing signals."

https://openalex.org/W1976329033,"Two proteolipid proteins, PLP and DM20, are the major membrane components of central nervous system (CNS) myelin. Mutations of the X-linked PLP/DM20 gene cause dysmyelination in mouse and man and result in significant mortality. Here we show that mutant mice that lack expression of a targeted PLP gene fail to exhibit the known dysmyelinated phenotype. Unable to encode PLP/DM20 or PLP-related polypeptides, oligodendrocytes are still competent to myelinate CNS axons of all calibers and to assemble compacted myelin sheaths. Ultrastructurally, however, the electron-dense 'intraperiod' lines in myelin remain condensed, correlating with its reduced physical stability. This suggests that after myelin compaction, PLP forms a stabilizing membrane junction, similar to a ""zipper."" Dysmyelination and oligodendrocyte death emerge as an epiphenomenon of other PLP mutations and have been uncoupled in the PLP null allele from the risk of premature myelin breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W2038529419,"Mutations in the S. cerevisiae RAD27 (also called RTH1 or YKL510) gene result in a strong mutator phenotype. In this study we show that the majority of the resulting mutations have a structure in which sequences ranging from 5–108 bp flanked by direct repeats of 3–12 bp are duplicated. Such mutations have not been previously detected at high frequency in the mutation spectra of mutator strains. Epistasis analysis indicates that RAD27 does not play a major role in MSH2-dependent mismatch repair. Mutations in RAD27 cause increased rates of mitotic crossing over and are lethal in combination with mutations in RAD51 and RAD52. These observations suggest that the majority of replication errors that accumulate in rad27 strains are processed by double-strand break repair, while a smaller percentage are processed by a mutagenic repair pathway. The duplication mutations seen in rad27 mutants occur both in human tumors and as germline mutations in inherited human diseases."

Conserved residues on one face of the barrel and adjacent loops form the putative RNA-binding site. The structure of the S1 domain is very similar to that of cold shock protein, suggesting that they are both derived from an ancient nucleic acid–binding protein.

In cells, v-Abl tyrosine kinase binds and strongly phosphorylates p62dok, which then binds rasGAP. A monoclonal antibody, 2C4, to the rasGAP-associated p62 reacts with p62dok.

https://openalex.org/W2076807689,"Engagement of CD95 or tumor necrosis factor 1 receptor (TNFR-1) by ligand or agonist antibodies is capable of activating the cell death program, the effector arm of which is composed of mammalian interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE)-like cysteine proteases (designated caspases) that are related to the Caenorhabditis elegans death gene, CED-3. Caspases, unlike other mammalian cysteine proteases, cleave their substrates following aspartate residues. Furthermore, proteases belonging to this family exist as zymogens that in turn require cleavage at internal aspartate residues to generate the two-subunit active enzyme. As such, family members are capable of activating each other. Remarkably, both CD95 and TNFR-1 death receptors initiate apoptosis by recruiting a novel ICE/CED-3 family member, designated FLICE/MACH, to the receptor signaling complex. Therefore, FLICE/MACH represents the apical triggering protease in the cascade. Consistent with this, recombinant FLICE was found capable of proteolytically activating downstream caspases. Furthermore, CrmA, a pox virus-encoded serpin that inhibits Fas and tumor necrosis factor-induced cell death attenuates the ability of FLICE to activate downstream caspases."

To elucidate their function, we devised a genome-wide screen to identify genes that encode SRP substrates. Inhibition of the SRP pathway sharply blocked the membrane insertion of several polytopic inner membrane proteins (IMPs) that were predicted to be SRP substrates, but had a smaller effect on the insertion of other IMPs and no significant effect on preprotein translocation. Our results suggest that whereas most E. coli preproteins and some IMPs can utilize SRP-independent targeting pathways effectively, the structural features of a subset of IMPs have required the conservation of an SRP-based targeting machinery."

https://openalex.org/W2038789827,"Most of the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of an adult animal are innervated individually by a single climbing fiber (CF) that forms strong excitatory synapses with the PCs. This one-to-one relationship between a PC and a CF is a consequence of a developmentally regulated regression of the innervation of PCs by CFs. We found that, in mice deficient in the type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1), the regression of supernumerary CFs ceases by the end of the second postnatal week, which is about one week earlier than in normal mice. Consequently, about one third of PCs in the mGluR1 mutant mice are innervated by multiple CFs in adulthood. We conclude that the regression of CFs normally occurs in two developmental phases and that mGluR1 plays a crucial role in the second phase."

Whether stable associations of multiple chaperones with secretory proteins occur during their folding and assembly in the ER is a question of considerable interest. Furthermore, it is unknown whether particular sets of chaperones work together on certain classes of proteins or whether the case for each protein is different. endoplasmic reticulum immunoglobulin-binding protein glucose-regulated protein endoplasmic reticulum protein FK506-binding protein dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) phosphate-buffered saline dithiothreitol thyroglobulin tunicamycin thrombospondin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a previous study, we reported that several unrelated unfolded protein substrates bind to the same set of resident ER proteins on affinity columns (5Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Yu. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These ER proteins, which all exhibited characteristics of molecular chaperones (such as binding to denatured substrates and elution from them in an ATP-dependent manner), included BiP, grp94, ERp72, protein disulfide isomerase, and calreticulin. One of the substrates used in the study was thyroglobulin (Tg), a protein precursor of thyroid hormones produced by thyroid epithelial cells. In support of these in vitro findings, we subsequently demonstrated by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation that BiP, grp94, and ERp72 also associate with Tg in intact thyroid cells (6Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar associations between Tg and these chaperones were observed in a cell culture model for epithelial ischemia when ATP levels declined to less than 10% of control (18Kuznetsov G. Bush K.T. Zhang P.L. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8584-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it remained unclear whether these associations exist in the absence of cross-linking or severe ATP depletion. Coordinate binding to substrates and coelution of a set of ER molecular chaperones (5Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Yu. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as their coordinate induction under conditions that perturb the internal environment of the ER (13Bush K.T. Hendrickson B.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), prompted us to hypothesize the existence of large macromolecular chaperone-containing complexes that are involved in maturation of certain classes of secretory and membrane proteins. The association of multiple resident ER proteins with Tg by cross-linking is consistent with this hypothesis. In the present study we investigated the involvement of multiple ER molecular chaperones in the maturation of large oligomeric secreted glycoproteins under conditions of misfolding in the ER. Thyroglobulin (19Wagar G. Acta Endocrinol. 1974; 77: 64-70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) typifies this class of proteins, made by many specialized secretory cells. Like immunoglobulin chains (20Haas I.G. Curr. Topics Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 71-82PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hendershot L.M. Ting J. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 4250-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and thrombospondin (22Adams J. Lawler J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 188-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is a large oligomeric glycoprotein with multiple disulfide bonds. The size (Tg is a ∼660-kDa homodimer consisting of two subunits of ∼330 kDa) and apparent complexity (extensive glycosylation, disulfide bonding, and other posttranslational modifications) of Tg suggest that its folding and assembly may involve many reactions catalyzed by multiple ER chaperones. Indeed, it appears as though Tg does, at least transiently, associate with BiP, grp94, ERp72, and calnexin during its maturation (6Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kim P.S. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); however, with the exception of BiP (6Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), stable associations with Tg have not been observed. Since such associations seemed more likely to occur when the ER transit time of Tg was prolonged, we examined conditions that perturb the internal environment of the ER and lead to accumulation of immature proteins in the ER lumen. Here, we report that following treatment of cells with tunicamycin, an agent that inhibits N-linked glycosylation in the ER, the same set of four ER molecular chaperones (BiP, grp94, ERp72, and grp170) stably complexes with two secreted proteins that exhibit strikingly similar structural characteristics. We therefore propose that this set of four ER chaperones is involved in a dynamic “folding complex” for many large oligomeric glycoproteins.

The following materials were purchased from Sigma: thyroid-stimulating hormone, insulin, hydrocortisone, transferrin, somatostatin, glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine acetate, leupeptin, pepstatin A, antipain, and tunicamycin. DSP was obtained from Pierce. A23187 and thapsigargin were from Calbiochem. Three rat thyroid epithelial cell lines were used in this study: FRTL-5 and PCCl3 (both Tg-producing) and PCE1A (lacking the ability to synthesize Tg). FRTL-5 cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). PCCl3 and PCE1A thyroid cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. T. Berlingieri (Universita degli studi di Napoli, Italy). Thyroglobulin-producing cells, FRTL-5 (26Ambesi-Impiobato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in Coon's modified Ham's F12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and a six-hormone mixture consisting of thyroid-stimulating hormone (1 mIU/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (10 nM), transferrin (5 μg/ml), somatostatin (10 ng/ml), and glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine acetate (10 ng/ml) (28Grollman E.F. Saji M. Shimura Y. Lau J.T.Y. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3604-3609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCE1A cells (lacking thyroglobulin) were grown in the same culture medium but without the six-hormone supplement (27Berlingieri M.T. Santoro M. Battaglia C. Grieco M. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were metabolically labeled for either 18-20 h in their respective growth media or for 30 min in the serum-, methionine-, and cysteine-free medium in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine (200 μCi/ml, Expre35S35S labeling mix, DuPont NEN). Cell monolayers were washed twice with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and suspended in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM EGTA (6Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with the cross-linking agent, DSP (100 μg/ml), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, final concentration of 1%) for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by incubation with 100 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, for 15 min. Cells were then lysed on ice by addition of 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, and antipain). Prior to immunoprecipitation, samples were incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to remove any material that binds nonspecifically to protein A. Samples were incubated with various antisera for 16 h at 4°C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. The pellets were washed in PBS, suspended in sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 50 mM dithiothreitol, heated to 100°C for 10 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein-associated radioactivity was analyzed on a PhosphorImager using the Image-Quant software package (Molecular Dynamics). Images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop™ software and printed with the Fujix Pictography 3000 color printer. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.) by electroblotting at 30 V for 18 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with various primary antisera followed by incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-immunoglobulin antisera as described (5Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.Yu. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Corp). The proteins were detected using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Corp). The exposed film was scanned using the HP Scan Jet IIcx, and the images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop software and printed with the Fujix Pictography 3000 color printer. Cell lysates were layered on top of linear 5-20% sucrose gradients prepared in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM EGTA (6Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradients were centrifuged at 32,000 rpm for 24 h at 4°C using a Beckman SW40TI ultracentrifuge rotor. 15 fractions (0.8 ml) were collected using a Buhler Instruments Auto Densi-Flow IIC gradient fractionator. Trichloroacetic acid was added to fractions at a final concentration of 10% to precipitate proteins. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were washed once with ice-cold acetone, dissolved in sample buffer containing 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), heated to 100°C for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western Immunoblotting with anti-Tg of anti-BiP antisera. FRTL-5 cells grown on coverslips were fixed in methanol (-20°C, 5 min), washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Tg antiserum for 1 h at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Cells were then washed in PBS three times and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antiserum. Coverslips were mounted onto a glass slide in glycerol-gelatin medium (Sigma). Staining was examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 410 (Zeiss, Germany). The images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop software and printed with the Fujix Pictography 3000 color printer. Under conditions which perturb the folding and secretion of Tg, existing interactions of this large dimeric secretory protein with ER molecular chaperones would be expected to be prolonged and more stable, and therefore easier to detect without the use of cross-linking reagents. Inhibitors of glycosylation and agents that perturb ER Ca2+ stores create such conditions, and we have employed both types of agents to study the involvement of ER chaperones in Tg maturation. The nucleoside antibiotic tunicamycin inhibits N-linked glycosylation in the ER by blocking the formation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor through specific inhibition of the transfer of GlcNAc-1-phosphate from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichyl phosphate (30Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After tunicamycin treatment, misglycosylated proteins accumulate in the ER (31Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which is accompanied by the increased synthesis of ER molecular chaperones (13Bush K.T. Hendrickson B.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 36Lee A.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (394) Google Scholar), including BiP, grp94, and ERp72. Thus, since mature Tg is extensively glycosylated, tunicamycin treatment would be expected to severely affect its conformation and stability and to facilitate detection of interactions of Tg with molecular chaperones of the ER without the use of cross-linking agents. Two rat thyroid epithelial call lines that synthesize and secrete Tg were used in our study: FRTL-5 and PCCl3. Our findings in both cell lines were virtually identical; therefore, below we present results obtained with only one type of cells. A relatively low dose of tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) was chosen. A recently published study (24Kim P.S. Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) reported that as little as 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin results in a complete inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of Tg. At the same time, a number of studies in recent years have shown that concentrations of tunicamycin similar to the one we have chosen result in virtually complete inhibition of N-linked glycosylation without a significant effect on overall protein synthesis (32Doss R.C. Kramarcy N.R. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 507-516PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4704-4707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When FRTL-5 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin, Tg was found intracellularly in a lower molecular weight (unglycosylated) form that could be clearly distinguished by SDS-PAGE from its glycosylated counterpart (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 and 12). Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of Tg persisted for up to 5 h after the removal of tunicamycin from the culture medium (Fig. 1A, lane 11). Secretion of unglycosylated Tg was almost completely (>95%) blocked in tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 6, and 9) as well as in cells pretreated with tunicamycin for 16 h and then transferred to tunicamycin-free medium for up to 5 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 5, and 8). Thus, under the conditions used in our study, tunicamycin induces complete inhibition of N-linked glycosylation of Tg and completely blocks its secretion, and these two effects are not reversed during the time periods employed in the experiments described below. By immunofluorescence, the unglycosylated Tg localized largely to the ER (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, both Tg and BiP appeared to associate into larger macromolecular complexes when analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1C). In control cells, Tg sedimented largely in fractions 8-12 with a small amount of the protein present in fractions 13-15 and in fraction P. Fraction P represents material pelleted at the bottom of the gradient as a result of transient association of Tg into large complexes in the course of its normal maturation (34Kim P.S. Kim K.-R. Arvan P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C704-C711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of intracellular BiP in untreated cells was found in fractions 3-8, with a small amount present in heavier fractions (fractions 9-12 and the pellet fraction, P). Following treatment of cells with tunicamycin, both Tg and BiP have shifted to heavier fractions of the gradient, and there was a marked increase in the amounts of both proteins found in the pellet fraction of the gradient. Together, these data suggested that tunicamycin treatment led to formation of large macromolecular complexes containing unglycosylated Tg and possibly ER molecular chaperones that were retained in the ER. To ensure that the formation of Tg-containing macromolecular complexes in tunicamycin-treated cells does not represent nonspecific protein aggregation resulting from cell injury, we measured cell viability and overall cellular secretory activity in both treated and untreated cells. To assess cell viability, a trypan blue exclusion assay was performed following treatment of FRTL-5 cells with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin for 16 h. In both the untreated and tunicamycin-treated cell preparations, less than 1% of cells were non-viable (have incorporated the dye). The assay was performed in triplicate (data not shown). To estimate the effect of tunicamycin on the overall cellular secretory activity, FRTL-5 cells were pretreated without or with tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) for 16 h, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and chased in the presence or absence of tunicamycin for 4 h (Fig. 2). Aliquots of media were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (Fig. 2A). Amounts of radioactivity associated with Tg secreted into the culture medium as well as with various other secretory products of FRTL-5 cells were quantified (Fig. 2, B and C). As shown in Fig. 2A, Tg represents the major, although not the sole secretory protein product of untreated thyroid cells (lane 1). Additional polypeptide bands were present on the SDS gel, although by far the Tg band (∼300 kDa) was the most prominent. In control cells, the 300-kDa band represented approximately 75% of total labeled material secreted (Fig. 2B). Treatment of cells with tunicamycin reduced secretion of all polypeptides, but to various degrees (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). Secretion of three other secretory products of FRTL-5 cells (denoted by arrows designated p1, p2, and p3) was compared to that of Tg. In tunicamycin-treated cells, the amount of Tg present in culture medium was reduced by almost 200-fold (Fig. 2C). In contrast to Tg, secretion of polypeptides p1 (∼112 kDa), p2 (∼100 kDa), and p3 (∼80 kDa) was reduced by only 1.7-2.5 fold (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2B, the secretory profile of tunicamycin-treated cells is significantly different from that of control preparations. Following treatment with tunicamycin, Tg becomes a minor secretory product, representing only ∼5% of total secreted protein, while other polypeptides (like bands p1, p2, and p3) represent a substantial portion of total secretory material. Thus, different secretory proteins of thyroid cells exhibit vastly different sensitivities to tunicamycin treatment. These findings indicate that the inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin results in selective inhibition of secretion rather than in a nonspecific alteration of cellular function. Together with the lack of toxicity of tunicamycin (as estimated by the trypan blue exclusion assay), these findings suggest that the action of tunicamycin on thyroid cells is specific and also support the validity of using tunicamycin as a tool to induce stable associations of Tg with the ER molecular chaperones. The proteins associated with the unglycosylated Tg intermediate retained in the ER of tunicamycin-treated cells were then analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Tg antibodies in the absence and presence of a thiol-cleavable chemical cross-linking agent (DSP). For initial identification of likely proteins associated with Tg in control and tunicamycin-treated cells, coimmunoprecipitation of Tg from metabolically labeled cells was performed. For subsequent positive identification of the coimmunoprecipitated polypeptides, Tg was immunoprecipitated from unlabeled cells, and the polypeptide bands were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Fig. 3 and 4, respectively, show coimmunoprecipitations from metabolically labeled FRTL-5 cells and Western immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates. In the absence of tunicamycin, the association of BiP, grp94, and ERp72 with Tg was seen after chemical cross-linking (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 5, and 9; Fig. 4, lanes 7, 11, and 15), as previously reported (6Kuznetsov G. Chen L.B. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22990-22995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to note that, apart from these bands, no others were consistently immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg antiserum, suggesting that the associations we observed are highly specific and authentic. Furthermore, to eliminate the possibility that coprecipitation of BiP with anti-Tg results from binding of BiP (otherwise known as immunoglobulin binding protein) to immunoglobulins added during immunoprecipitation, we have conducted immunoprecipitation of Tg in the thyroid cells that lack the ability to synthesize and secrete Tg (Fig. 6, lanes 1-4) but contain normal amounts of BiP. In these cells, neither Tg nor any other molecular chaperones could be immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg antibodies. In Tg-containing cells, following tunicamycin treatment, BiP, grp94, and ERp72 could be seen even without cross-linkers (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 8, and 12; Fig. 4, lanes 8, 12, and 16), although the associations were further enhanced by cross-linking (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 7, and 11; Fig. 4, lanes 9, 13, and 17). In addition, a band of approximately 150 kDa was coimmunoprecipitated with Tg in tunicamycin-treated cells in the absence and presence of cross-linkers (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). This band was identified as the putative ER chaperone grp170 (Fig. 4B), a member of the glucose-regulated stress protein family that is thought to participate in folding and/or assembly of immunoglobulin chains (35Lin H. Masso-Welch P. Di Y. Cai J. Shen J. Subjeck J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the large aggregates of unglycosylated Tg in the"

We show that the homeobox containing gene floating head (flh) is required for neurogenesis to proceed in the epiphysis. In flh- embryos, the first few epiphysial neurons are generated, but beyond the 18 somite stage, neuronal production ceases. In contrast, in masterblind- (mbl-) embryos, epiphysial neurons are generated throughout the dorsal forebrain. We show that mbl is required to prevent the expression of flh in dorsal forebrain cells rostral to the epiphysis. Furthermore, epiphysial neurons are not ectopically induced in mbl-/flh- embryos, demonstrating that the epiphysial phenotype of mbl- embryos is mediated by ectopic Flh activity. We propose a role for Flh in linking the signaling pathways that regulate regional patterning to the signaling pathways that regulate neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2055919690,"Chronic elevation in glucose has pleiotropic effects on the pancreatic β-cell including a high rate of insulin secretion at low glucose, β-cell hypertrophy, and hyperplasia. These actions of glucose are expected to be associated with the modulation of the expression of a number of glucose-regulated genes that need to be identified. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms implicated in these adaptation processes to hyperglycemia, we have studied the regulation of genes encoding key glycolytic enzymes in the glucose-responsive β-cell line INS-1. Glucose (from 5 to 25 mM) induced phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) isoform C, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (4-fold), and L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) (7-fold) mRNAs. In contrast the expression level of the glucokinase (Gk) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase transcripts remained unchanged. Following a 3-day exposure to elevated glucose, a similar induction was observed at the protein level for PFK-1 (isoforms C, M, and L), GAPDH, and L-PK, whereas M-PK expression only increased slightly. The study of the mechanism of GAPDH induction indicated that glucose increased the transcriptional rate of the GAPDH gene but that both transcriptional and post transcriptional effects contributed to GAPDH mRNA accumulation. 2-Deoxyglucose did not mimic the inductive effect of glucose, suggesting that increased glucose metabolism is involved in GAPDH gene induction. These changes in glycolytic enzyme expression were associated with a 2-3-fold increase in insulin secretion at low (2-5 mM) glucose. The metabolic activity of the cells was also elevated, as indicated by the reduction of the artificial electron acceptor 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium. A marked deposition of glycogen, which was readily mobilized upon lowering of the ambient glucose, and increased DNA replication were also observed in cells exposed to elevated glucose. The results suggest that a coordinated induction of key glycolytic enzymes as well as massive glycogen deposition are implicated in the adaptation process of the β-cell to hyperglycemia to allow for chronically elevated glucose metabolism, which, in this particular fuel-sensitive cell, is linked to metabolic coupling factor production and cell activation. Chronic elevation in glucose has pleiotropic effects on the pancreatic β-cell including a high rate of insulin secretion at low glucose, β-cell hypertrophy, and hyperplasia. These actions of glucose are expected to be associated with the modulation of the expression of a number of glucose-regulated genes that need to be identified.

The metabolic activity of the cells was also elevated, as indicated by the reduction of the artificial electron acceptor 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium. A marked deposition of glycogen, which was readily mobilized upon lowering of the ambient glucose, and increased DNA replication were also observed in cells exposed to elevated glucose. The results suggest that a coordinated induction of key glycolytic enzymes as well as massive glycogen deposition are implicated in the adaptation process of the β-cell to hyperglycemia to allow for chronically elevated glucose metabolism, which, in this particular fuel-sensitive cell, is linked to metabolic coupling factor production and cell activation."

Enhancer activity of the element and mutated versions correlated completely with their ability to form a DNA-protein complex in gel shifts. Antibody supershift, oligonucleotide competition, and Southwestern studies indicated that the CTC-binding factor is the transcriptional activator Sp1. Sp1 binds the CTC repeat with an affinity, KD = 0.37 nM, at least as high as the consensus GC box. Similar CTC repeats are found in promoters of other growth-related genes. Because Sp1 is important for WT1 expression, we examined Sp1 immunohistochemistry in fetal and adult kidney. In a pattern that precedes that of WT1 message, Sp1 immunostaining was highest in uninduced mesenchyme, early tubules, developing podocytes, and mature glomeruli, but was minimal in mature proximal tubules. This work suggests abundant Sp1 may be a prerequisite for WT1 expression, and that Sp1 may have a wider role in nephrogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2055774593,"Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is essential for maintenance of biophysical properties and physiological function of pulmonary surfactant. SP-B mRNA expression is restricted to alveolar type II epithelial cells and bronchiolar epithelial cells (Clara cells) of adult lung. We previously (Margana, R. K., and Boggaram, V. (1996) Am. J. Physiol. 270, L601-L612) found that a minimal promoter region (-236 to +39) of rabbit SP-B gene is sufficient for high level expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in NCI-H441 cells, a cell line with characteristics of Clara cells. In the present study we used mutational analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and DNase I footprinting to identify cis-DNA regulatory elements and trans-acting protein factors required for lung cell-specific expression of SP-B gene. We found that in addition to thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3a (HNF-3a) binding sites, two spatially separate DNA sequences that bind Sp1 and Sp3 factors are necessary for the maintenance of SP-B promoter activity. Mutation of any one of the transcription factor binding sites caused a significant reduction in SP-B promoter activity suggesting that Sp1, Sp3, and TTF-1 and HNF-3a interact cooperatively with SP-B promoter to activate gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2077428330,"Actin-binding protein (ABP-280) is a component of the submembranous cytoskeleton and interacts with the glycoprotein (GP) Iba subunit of the GP Ib-IX complex in platelets. In the present studies, we have identified the binding site for GP Iba in ABP-280. A melanoma cell line lacking ABP-280 was stably transfected with the cDNAs coding for GP Ib-IX, then transiently transfected with cDNA coding for various carboxyl-truncates of ABP-280. Immunocapture assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments from detergent-lysed cells showed that deletion of the carboxyl-terminal repeats 20-24 of ABP-280 had no effect on GP Ib-IX binding, but deletion of residues 2099 through 2136 within repeat 19 abolished binding. In the yeast two-hybrid system, an ABP-280 fragment comprising repeats 17-19 bound GP Iba. Deletion from either end abolished binding. Individual or multiple repeats of ABP-280 were expressed as fusion protein in bacteria and purified; structural folding was evaluated, and binding to GP Ib-IX was assessed. Binding depended on the presence of repeats 17-19. None of the individual repeats were able to bind to GP Ib-IX. These findings demonstrate that residues 1850-2136 comprising repeats 17-19 contain the binding site for GP Ib-IX."
https://openalex.org/W2045887263,"Oligomeric proteins usually have to assemble into their final quartenary structure to be secreted. However, most immunoglobulin (Ig) light (L) chains can be exported as free chains, whereas only a few Ig L chains, here referred to as export-incompetent, have to assemble with Ig heavy (H) chains into antibody molecules to be secreted. In the absence of Ig H chain expression, these export-incompetent Ig L chains remain bound to BiP as partially folded monomers with only one of the two internal disulfide bonds being formed. To understand the apparent discrepancy in Ig L chain export, we performed assembly studies with chimeric Ig chains and found that the variable (V) domain of the export-incompetent NS1 κ chain cannot mediate homodimer formation. Conversely, the V domain of the export-competent J558L λ1 chain supports homodimer formation and, concordantly, these Ig L chains are secreted as noncovalently or covalently linked homodimers. We show that the export-incompetent mutant λ1 FS62 chain forms disulfide bonds in both domains only upon pairing with Ig H chain and is secreted as part of an antibody. Therefore, Ig L chain assembly seems to be a prerequisite for complete folding, indicating that Ig L chain secretion generally depends on either homo- or heterodimer formation.

Attributes such as conformation, structure of attached carbohydrates, and oligomeric state not only control the functional properties of a protein but are also critical for intracellular transport. Newly synthesized polypeptides are hampered in exiting the ER as long as they have not acquired a so-called export-competent conformation (for reviews, see Refs. 1Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin.

In other cases, export is not dependent on complete assembly. While the heptameric T-cell receptor complex only reaches the cell surface when completely assembled, in the absence of ζ chain homodimer association, pentamers leave the ER and are subsequently transported to lysosomes instead. Other assembly intermediates or isolated subunits are retained in the ER (7Klausner R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Bonifacino J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 403-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The export of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens usually depends on the noncovalent assembly of a transmembrane heavy chain, the soluble β2-microglobulin, and peptide (8Ploegh H.L. Orr H.T. Strominger J.L. Cell. 1981; 24: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), but soluble β2-microglobulin can be secreted as free chains (9Arce-Gomez B. Jones E.A. Barnstable C.J. Solomon E. Bodmer W.F. Tissue Antigens. 1978; 11: 96-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, free immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) chains are not exported (10Burrows P. LeJeune M. Kearney J.F. Nature. 1979; 280: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Morrison S.L.

Using immunoglobulins as a model to study the requirements of ER export, Sitia and colleagues have uncovered a quality control mechanism that acts on polypeptides to expose unpaired cysteine residues (17Sitia R.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Immunoglobulin L chains possess five cysteine residues, four of which are involved in two disulfide bonds that stabilize the variable (V) and constant (C) domain, respectively, and a carboxyl-terminal cysteine that is responsible for the intermolecular disulfide bond to Ig H chain. The thiol group of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine of unassembled Ig L chains causes a delay in secretion because it forms reversible disulfide bonds with the protein matrix of the ER (21Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, secreted Ig L chains no longer possess unpaired cysteines since the two internal disulfide bonds have already formed (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and the carboxyl-terminal cysteine is either covalently linked to a second Ig L chain (or to Ig H chain) or paired with a free cysteine (21Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Milstein C. Nature. 1965; 205: 1171-1173Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Export-incompetent Ig L chains, which are not secreted in the absence of Ig H chains may also covalently interact with ER matrix proteins. However, the major cause of retention is probably the noncovalent binding to BiP, an ER-resident molecular chaperone (24Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It seems that only one of the domains can fold in vivo because such Ig L chains occur as partially oxidized BiP-bound monomers until they are degraded (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Cremer A. Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. Wieland F. Reutter W. Glyco- and Cellbiology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1994: 171-184Google Scholar). Complete oxidation of the Ig L chain reflecting disulfide bond formation in the second domain is only observed upon in vitro dissociation from BiP (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As protein export is thought to be restricted to completely folded molecules, we reasoned that oligomerization might be a prerequisite for Ig L chain folding because Ig H chain association is sufficient to restore export competence to otherwise partially folded molecules. The experiments reported here were designed to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying Ig L chain maturation and export. We have established an experimental system that allows us to investigate the capacity of particular V domains to pair with each other and found that not all support Ig chain assembly. Furthermore, we analyzed the in vivo folding state of unassembled and assembled Ig L chains. We will discuss our results with respect to the possible folding pathway of Ig L chains as well as to the general mechanism of quality control in the ER.

When indicated, wash and lysis buffer contained 20 mM NEM to prevent oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups. Immunprecipitation of Ig chains was performed with subunit-specific antibodies and/or protein A-Sepharose. Size fractionation of proteins was achieved by using a column (diameter, 1 cm; length, 40 cm) containing Sephacryl S-200HR (Pharmacia LKB, Freiburg, Germany). Proteins were separated by native or SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose filters by semidry blotting for Western blotting or visualized by autoradiograpy (24Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Post-nuclear supernatant (10 μl; 4 × 107 cells/ml of NET lysis buffer) was mixed with sample buffer (30 μl; 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 8.7% glycerol, 10-3% bromphenol blue) and applied onto a 6% nondenaturing slab gel. The separating gel was prepared by diluting 6 ml of a mixture containing 30% acrylamide and 0.44% bisacrylamide in 24 ml of 0.1 M glycine/NaOH, pH 9.8. The stacking gel contained 1 ml of the same acrylamide mixture, 2.5 ml of 0.5 M Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and 6.3 ml of H2O. Electrophoresis in 0.1 M glycine/NaOH, pH 9.8, at 4°C was done at 10 mA for 30 min until the blue dye reached the separating gel and thereafter at 20 mA for 7 h. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose sheets and the Western blots developed as described below. All antisera were purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Affinity-purified goat anti-mouse antibody subunit-specific antisera bound to protein A-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose alone were used for immunoprecipitations. Antibodies bearing the B1.8 idiotype react with the hapten NP (4-hydroxy-3-nitro-phenyl)acetyl (34Reth M. Hammerling G.J. Rajewsky K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and could be isolated with NP-caproate coupled to Sepharose (NP-Sepharose). Western blots were developed with biotinylated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse λ1 or ³3 chain antisera, followed by a staining reaction catalyzed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. Alternatively, streptavidin-horseradish conjugate was used for detection with the BM chemiluminiscence blotting substrate (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). The κ chain expressed by NS1 cells is a well known example of an export-incompetent Ig L chain. Free NS1 κ chain is disulfide-bonded in one domain only and bound to BiP as a monomer (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas the same IgL chain is secreted when associated with Ig H chain (15KÖhler G. Howe S.C. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1976; 6: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that oligomerization might be the prerequisite for secretion of Ig L chains. This model would predict that, in the absence of Ig H chain expression, export-competent Ig L chains differ from export-incompetent Ig L chains in their capability to form homodimers. As both export-competent and -incompetent Ig L chains may bear the same C domain (24Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Dul J.L. Burrone O.R. Argon Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1927-1933PubMed Google Scholar), the export competence of a free Ig L chain must be determined by its V region. That is, the V domain of the Ig L chain should determine whether or not homodimer formation is possible. To investigate this prediction, we used chimeric Ig chains in which the V regions of Ig H and L chains have been swapped. Such chimeric chains are assembled into antibodies as well as wild type chains (27Simon T. Rajewsky K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As the mode of Ig chain pairing does not seem to depend on the intramolecular V-C conjunction of the individual subunits, we can study the impact of specific V domains on chain pairing by investigating antibody formation in cells that expressed chimeric Ig chains. Using this system, we assayed the assembly of Ig H and L chains bearing identical V domains derived from either an export-competent Ig L chain (the λ1 chain of J558L), or an export-incompetent Ig L chain (the κ chain of NS1). Hybrid genes (VλC³3 and VκC³3) were constructed and stable transfectants of J558L (expressing λ1 chains) or NS1 (expressing NS1 κ chains) cells established (Fig. 1; J558L.VλC³3 and NS1.VκC³3, respectively). In order to verify that chimeric chains can, in principle, form antibodies, we made other transfectants expressing Ig H and L chains with complementary V domains. As summarized Fig. 1 (and Table I), these include NS1.³3 (endogenous κ and wild type ³3 chains), II4c.MEV (VHCκ and VκC³3 chains with mutually exchanged V domains), and J558L.³3 (endogenous λ1 and wild type ³3 chains). To analyze the assembly state of the Ig chains, cellular proteins were biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine and material containing Ig H chains was isolated with protein A-Sepharose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2). In the control cell line, NS1.³3 (NS1 κ chains and wild type ³3 chains), most of the Ig H chains migrated as H2L2 molecules. In addition, all covalent assembly intermediates as well as some free Ig H chains (H2 and H) were detected (Fig. 2a, lane 1). Only 40-50% of the labeled Ig L chains were associated with Ig H chains, as quantified by densitometry of the fluorograph (data not shown) seen in Fig. 2b (lanes 1 and 2), i.e. Ig L chain seems to be in a molar excess over Ig H chain. Ig chains expressed by II4c.MEV cells (VHCκ and VκC³3) differ from those of the NS1.³3 cell line only by a mutual exchange of the Vκ and VH domains. Although most intracellular II4c.MEV Ig H chains migrated as monomers under non-reducing conditions, Ig molecules were also isolated as H2L2 tetramers, H2L, HL, and H2 assembly intermediates (Fig. 2a, lane 2) in agreement with the data of Simon and Rajewsky (27Simon T. Rajewsky K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We assume that the low levels of Ig L chains synthesized by the II4c.MEV cells limited antibody formation, since all of the intracellular Ig L chains coprecipitated with the Ig H chains (Fig. 2b, compare lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, no covalently associated Ig molecules were detected in NS1.VκC³3 cells, which express Ig H and L chains each bearing the V domain of the NS1 κ chain (Fig. 2a, lane 3). In this cell line, Ig L chain is not limiting; high levels of endogenous κ chain were produced (Fig. 2b, lane 5). Only traces of labeled κ chain (<0.5%, as determined by densitometry) were co-isolated with Ig H chain (Fig. 2b, lane 6). Thus, it seems clear that NS1 κ chains assemble with Ig H chains bearing the VH domain but not the Vκ domain of NS1. In contrast, export-competent J558L λ1 chains assemble well with Ig H chains bearing either the VH domain or the Vλ domain. For example, most Ig H chains in both transfectants assembled into H2L2 tetramers and covalently linked H2L and HL intermediates (Fig. 2a, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Only part of the total intracellular Ig L chains of both J558L.³3 and J558L.VλC³3 coprecipitated with the Ig H chains (Fig. 2b, compare lanes 7 and 9 with lanes 8 and 10, respectively), i.e. endogenous Ig L chains were in molar excess over the vector-encoded Ig H chains. In summary, no association is observed when both Ig H and L chains carry the V domain of the NS1 κ chain, indicating that the V domain of the export-incompetent Ig L chain is not capable of forming the homodomain dimers required to support Ig chain assembly. However, the individual chains are, in principle, able to assemble into antibody molecules because they assemble with partner chains that carry the V domain of the Ig H chain. Covalent assembly of Ig H and L chains also takes place when both Ig chains bear the V domain of the export-competent J558L λ1 chain, a result indicating that these V domains are capable of homodomain pairing. Our results indicated that the V domain of the export-competent J558L λ1 chains could support Ig L chain homodimer formation. Indeed, J558L λ1 chains migrate as a single species when total cellular proteins were separated under native conditions that ought to have preserved all native complexes (Fig. 3). Together with the fact that a fraction of the J558L λ1 chains migrate as covalently linked dimers in non-reducing SDS-gels (24Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), the finding of a single band in the native gel suggests that most intracellular Ig L chains are in the same assembly state, i.e. dimers. To verify this assumption, we analyzed total cellular proteins as well as proteins from the culture supernatant of J558L cells by gel filtration (Fig. 4). Most of the intracellular covalently linked Ig L chain dimers eluted at a position corresponding to the expected molecular mass of 55 kDa (maximum at fraction 18 in Fig. 4, left panel). Most of the non-disulfide linked Ig L chains also left the column in the dimer fraction, indicating that these Ig L chains are noncovalently linked dimers. Only a minor fraction eluted in the low molecular mass fractions from 10 to 25 kDa (fractions 23-25). The asymmetric elution profile of the noncovalently linked Ig L chains suggests that some dimers disintegrated during the gel filtration procedure (36Stevens F.J. Westholm F.A. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1144-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and, as a consequence, eluted in the lower molecular mass fractions. A similar co-elution profile of covalently and noncovalently linked Ig L chain dimers was evident with the culture supernatant (Fig. 4, right panel). The overwhelming majority of J558L λ1 chains form homodimers and are secreted as such; some of are covalently linked and some are not. In contrast, a similar analysis showed that the export-incompetent NS1 κ chain is monomeric and complexed with BiP (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It was reported that the Phe to Ser mutation at position 62 in a conserved sequence exposed on the surface of the λ1 chain V domain blocked the secretion of the Ig L chain whether free or associated with μ Ig H chain (37Dul J.L. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We previously analyzed this particular Ig L chain, λ1 FS62, expressed in the absence of Ig H chains and showed that they are indeed not transported but are degraded instead (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, we report an analysis of the export of the same Ig L chain in stably transfected cells, NSFS.³3, that co-express ³3 Ig H chain. In contrast to the model used by Dul and Argon (37Dul J.L. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), our experiments involve (i) stable rather than transient expression and (ii) expression of ³ rather than μ chain. We observed that λ1 FS62 was secreted as part of assembled IgG. In fact, IgG secretion was as efficient as in the control cell line, E7.λ1, which expresses ³3 chain in combination with a λ1 chain that does not carry the Phe to Ser substitution (Fig. 5). Since the mutation in the V domain of the λ1 chain does not lead to a general block in Ig secretion, these results demonstrate that it does not destroy a putative transport signal postulated by Dul and Argon (37Dul J.L. Argon Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8135-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previous studies had shown that the export-incompetent λ1 FS62 chain, like NS1 κ chain, is bound to BiP as a partially oxidized molecule, whereas the export-competent J558L λ1 chain exhibits a fully oxidized conformation (22Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the oxidation state of the λ1 FS62 chain in cells co-expressing Ig H chain, lysates of NSFS62.³3 cells were prepared in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide (to prevent oxygen-mediated oxidation of thiol groups) and immunoprecipitated Ig was analyzed by Western blotting under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 6). Analysis of total Ig chains revealed two Ig L chain bands (Fig. 6, lane 4) corresponding to a partially and a completely oxidized form; both forms migrated more rapidly than completely reduced Ig L chain (compare lane 4 with lane 1). When Ig H chain-associated material was analyzed (lane 5), the co-precipitated Ig L chains migrated as fully oxidized molecules as did the J558L λ1 chains (lane 2). In contrast, Ig L chains remaining in the Ig H chain-depleted fraction were partially oxidized (lane 6) as they were in the absence of Ig H chain expression (lane 3). Thus, in the same cell, free λ1 FS62 chain is partially oxidized, while Ig L chain co-precipitated with Ig H chain is completely oxidized. The finding that λ1 FS62 chains have formed the second internal disulfide bond upon Ig H chain association raises the question whether assembly precedes oxidation of the second Ig L chain domain or is required for stabilization of completely folded λ1 FS62 chain. To determine the sequence of events, we performed pulse-chase experiments with NSFS62.³3 cells and a"

When expressed alone, Torpedo AChET remains essentially intracellular, forming dimers and tetramers; in contrast, rat AChET is secreted and produces mostly amphiphilic monomers (G1a) and dimers (G2a), together with smaller proportions of nonamphiphilic (G4na) tetramers, amphiphilic tetramers (G4a), and an unstable higher polymer (13.7 S).

https://openalex.org/W2081128766,"It has been suggested that the matrix (MA) domain of HIV-1 Gag plays a central role in translocating the HIV-1 preintegration complex to the nucleus following infection of nondividing cells. Gallay et al. proposed that phosphorylation of 1% of MA on a C-terminal Tyr (residue 131) was required to reverse the membrane binding properties of MA and promote an association between MA and the integrase protein, thus enabling MA to assist in translocating the HIV-1 preintegration complex to the nucleus (9Gallay P Swingler S Aiken C Trono D Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Gallay P Swingler S Song J Bushman F Trono D Cell. 1995; 83: 569-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The critical piece of biological data in support of this model was that mutation of MA Tyr 131 to Phe blocked infection of differentiated primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) (9Gallay P Swingler S Aiken C Trono D Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To confirm this observation, we introduced the same single amino acid substitution (Tyr to Phe) at residue 131 of MA. We initially introduced the 131YF mutation into the T-cell line tropic molecular clone pNL4-3, and determined that this substitution did not affect Gag precursor processing, virion assembly and release, or virus spread in a T-cell line (data not shown). To analyze the effect of the 131YF substitution on infection of primary MDM, we introduced this mutation into the macrophage-tropic pNL4-3 derivative pNL(AD8) (5Freed E.O Martin M.A Nature. 1994; 369: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with pNL(AD8), pNL(AD8)131YF, or pNL4-3. Virus stocks were prepared from the transfected cell medium, normalized for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, and then used to infect MDM cultures. Virus replication in the infected MDM cultures was monitored by RT analysis. Infections were repeated with several different virus stocks and cells from six different donors. In all assays, the 131YF mutant replicated with kinetics indistinguishable from wild-type (Fig. 1A; data not shown). As expected, the T-cell line restricted HIV-1 isolate pNL4-3 failed to productively infect the MDM cultures. To exclude the possibility that the virus replication observed in the pNL(AD8)131YF-infected MDM cultures was due to reversion of the 131YF mutation, we prepared DNA from the infected MDM cultures and PCR amplified the MA coding region. DNA sequencing indicated that the 131YF mutation was still present (data not shown). Since the virus used in the initial Gallay et al. report was defective for the HIV-1 accessory gene vpr (Gallay et al., 1995), and because it had been proposed that Vpr and MA contain redundant nuclear localization signals (11Heinzinger N.K Bukrinsky M.I Haggerty S.A Ragland A.M Kewalramani V Lee M.-A Gendelman H.E Ratner L Stevenson M Emerman M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), we introduced a previously described (7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) vpr mutation into the pNL(AD8)131YF clone. As reported earlier (7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the vpr mutation (R-) alone reduced peak RT production by approximately two- to threefold relative to wild type (Fig. 1A). The 131YF/vpr double mutant (131YF/R-) replicated with kinetics indistinguishable from the vpr mutant. Thus, the 131YF mutation had no effect on virus infectivity in primary human macrophage cultures even in the context of a mutant Vpr. To test the possibility that the apparent discrepancy between our results and those reported by 9Gallay P Swingler S Aiken C Trono D Cell. 1995; 80: 379-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar might reflect differences between the virus isolates used in the two studies, the molecular clones used in the Gallay et al. experiments were obtained from D. Trono (Salk Institute). The ability of these clones to productively infect MDM was tested in parallel with our wild-type and 131YF mutant clones (Fig. 1B). Consistent with the results obtained with our wild-type and mutant virus stocks, the macrophage-tropic isolate R7Bal and the Tyr mutant derivative MAY132F. R7Bal replicated with indistinguishable kinetics. We note that R7Bal and MAY132F.R7Bal contain a truncated vpr gene (16von Schwedler U Kornbluth R.S Trono D Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 6992-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, in some primary macrophage systems, virus infection occurs primarily in a small subpopulation of cells which are actively proliferating (15Schuitemaker H Kootstra N.A Fouchier R.A.M Hooibrink B Miedema F EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5929-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To test whether this is the case in our experiments, we determined the fraction of cells which are actively proliferating at the time of infection and at two-weeks post-infection. This was done by labeling nuclear DNA with propidium iodide and using flow cytometry to determine relative DNA content, then quantitating the proportion of nuclei in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (14Nicoletti I.G Migliorati M.C Pagliacci F Grignani F Riccardi C J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Only 0.5%-4% of nuclei were in S-phase. No significant differences in S-phase fraction were detected by comparing infected and uninfected cells, or comparing day 0 and peak infection cultures (data not shown). At peak infection, most of the cells in the infected macrophage cultures had fused to form large multinucleated syncytia, suggesting that the virus infection had spread throughout the culture. We confirmed that the majority of cells in the infected cultures were expressing HIV RNA by in situ hybridization. More than 70% of the nuclei in infected cultures contained HIV-1 RNA, whereas no hybridization signal was detected in nuclei from uninfected cultures (data not shown). Using macrophage culture techniques similar to those employed in this study13Lazdins J.K Klimkait T Woods-Cook K Walker M Alteri E Cox D Cerletti N Shipman R Bilbe G McMaster G J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar reported that 100% of cells became infected at the peak of virus production. The fact that a very low percentage of cells displayed proliferative capacity while a high percentage of cells became productively infected with both wild-type and 131YF mutant viruses indicates that virus replication was not restricted to actively proliferating cells. Even in cultures in which fewer than 1% of the cells displayed proliferative capacity, the 131YF mutation had no effect on virus infectivity. The input inoculum used in our infections is low: typically 500 RT cpm/μl (a multiplicity of infection of approximately 10-2 to 10-3). In cells from certain donors the peak virus output reached 40,000 cpm/μl (e.g. Fig. 1B). This represents an 80-fold amplification of the input inoculum. We emphasize, however, that even in donor cells that were infected much less efficiently, the 131YF mutation had no effect on virus replication (data not shown). As described in the Experimental Procedures, the macrophage system used in this study employs centrifugal elutriation to enrich for monocytes. After elutriation, the cells are allowed to fully differentiate for two weeks on plastic. In the Gallay et al. report, monocytes are purified by adherence to plastic, without an initial elutriation step. To determine whether differences in technique might affect the phenotype of the 131YF MA mutation, we purified and differentiated macrophages using the same methodology employed by Gallay et al. (8Freundlich B Avdalovic N J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 62: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 12Kornbluth R.S Oh P.S Munis J.R Cleveland P.H Richman D.D J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1137-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The macrophages purified by adherence to plastic were then infected with pNL(AD8) and derivatives containing the 131YF MA and/or Vpr mutations. In two independent experiments, the 131YF mutation had no detrimental effect on the kinetics of virus replication (data not shown). Thus, differences in primary macrophage systems cannot explain the divergent results obtained in this and the Gallay et al. studies. We have demonstrated that: i) in cells from numerous macrophage donors, ii) in two different primary macrophage purification/culture systems, iii) in the context of two different macrophage-tropic molecular clones, and iv) in the presence or absence of a functional vpr gene, the 131YF mutation had no detectable effect on infectivity. Prior to the publication of the Gallay et al. papers2Bukrinsky M.I Haggerty S Dempsey M.P Sharova N Adzhubei A Spitz L Lewis P Goldfarb D Emerman M Stevenson M Nature. 1993; 365: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar reported that mutations in a highly basic domain near the N-terminus of MA blocked infection of nondividing cells; it was subsequently reported that this defect is observed only in the context of a nonfunctional vpr gene (11Heinzinger N.K Bukrinsky M.I Haggerty S.A Ragland A.M Kewalramani V Lee M.-A Gendelman H.E Ratner L Stevenson M Emerman M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). We demonstrated, however, that an extensive mutational analysis of basic residues within the MA basic domain failed to support the hypothesis that this domain was required for HIV-1 infectivity in primary human MDM (5Freed E.O Martin M.A Nature. 1994; 369: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data showed that MA basic domain mutants retained infectivity even in the context of a mutant vpr gene, and that MA and vpr mutations displayed additive, rather than synergistic effects in MDM infections (7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We emphasize that our results do not exclude a role for MA in infection of nondividing cells. It is possible, for example, that simultaneous phosphorylation at multiple positions on MA, including Ser and Thr residues, may be required to reverse the intrinsic membrane binding properties of MA (3Bukrinskaya A.G Ghorpade A Heinzinger N.K Smithgall T.E Lewis R.E Stevenson M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Clearly, however, simply blocking Tyr phosphorylation at MA residue 131 has no detectable effect. Following the submission of this manuscript for publication3Bukrinskaya A.G Ghorpade A Heinzinger N.K Smithgall T.E Lewis R.E Stevenson M Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This study utilized the T-cell line restricted HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 for CEM(12D-7) replication assays, and the macrophage-tropic pNL4-3 derivative pNL(AD8) (5Freed E.O Martin M.A Nature. 1994; 369: 107-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3949-3954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for MDM experiments. Mutagenesis was performed as described (6Freed E.O Orenstein J.M Buckler-White A.J Martin M.A J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5311-5320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the 131YF mutation in both Vpr+ and Vpr- clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The R7Bal and MAY132F. R7Bal molecular clones were kindly provided by D. Trono (Salk Institute). Techniques used to prepare and infect cultures of primary MDM have been described previously in detail (13Lazdins J.K Klimkait T Woods-Cook K Walker M Alteri E Cox D Cerletti N Shipman R Bilbe G McMaster G J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1201-1207PubMed Google Scholar, 7Freed E.O Englund G Martin M.A J.

Briefly, elutriated monocytes were plated on bacteriological petri plates and allowed to differentiate for 14 days, after which the cells were transferred to 96-well Nunc tissue culture plates. The macrophage cultures were infected one day post-plating with equivalent amounts of virus, normalized for RT activity. For the system utilizing adherence-purified macrophages, peripheral blood monocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by adherence to gelatin/fibronectin coated tissue culture plates (8Freundlich B Avdalovic N J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 62: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Purified monocytes were then differentiated on tissue culture plates for 7-10 days and infected as described (12Kornbluth R.S Oh P.S Munis J.R Cleveland P.H Richman D.D J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1137-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). DNA content of nuclei was determined as described (14Nicoletti I.G Migliorati M.C Pagliacci F Grignani F Riccardi C J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar) by lysing plasma membranes, staining nuclear DNA with propidium iodide, and quantitating the relative DNA content of nuclei using the Becton-Dickinson FACSORT fluorescence activated cell sorter. The proportion of nuclei in G0/G1, S, and G2/M was determined using the MODFIT DNA analysis software. Cells were fixed and hybridized overnight in hybridization buffer (1Berthold E Maldarelli F J.

This superfamily includes receptors for steroid, thyroid, vitamin D3, and retinoids, and a large number of orphan receptors whose cognate ligands are still unknown (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

These members have been grouped into three categories according to their binding preference to HREs, the palindromic half-site AGAACA is preferred for the binding by the androgen, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progesterone receptors; the direct repeat with various spacing is preferentially recognized by the estrogen, thyroid, retinoic acid, retinoid X, vitamin D, and many orphan receptors; and the single half-site of AGGTCA preceded by two specific flanking nucleotides is favored by some members which bind as a monomer, such as the steroidogenic factor 1 (2Wilson T.E.

The human and rat TR4 cDNAs were isolated from testis and hypothalamus by degenerative PCR cloning (6Chang C. Da Silva S.L. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The TR4 cDNA shows high homology in nucleotide sequence with the TR2 orphan receptor (TR2; another orphan receptor isolated from our laboratory (7Chang C. Kokontis J. Acakpo-Satchivi L. Liao S.

Commun. 1989; 165: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)), suggesting that these two orphan receptors constitute an unique subfamily within the steroid receptor superfamily. TR4 mRNA are widely expressed in the adult rat brain (6Chang C. Da Silva S.L. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Van Horssen A.M. Chang C. Burbach J.P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 2276-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite the high abundance of the TR4 transcripts in nervous tissues, the physiological function of TR4 in neurogenesis remains unclear. To understand the role of TR4 in neurogenesis, we sought downstream regulatory events, namely target genes, which can be regulated by TR4. Thus, we examined the TR4 expression pattern during mouse embryogenesis to further confirm its participation in neuronal development, and then used this information to search for TR4 target genes involved in a neuronal-specific program. We then sought potential TR4 target genes based on the binding preference of TR4. In vitro binding assays suggested that TR4 is capable of binding to 5′-AGGTCA direct repeats with 1-6-base pair spacing (DR1-DR6). 2Y.-F. Lee and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. We hypothesized that the ä component of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFRä) with DR1 in its 5th intron may be a target gene for TR4. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a member of the cytokine superfamily. It utilizes a three-component receptor system consisting of an extracellular CNTF-binding protein, known as CNTFRä (9Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), as well as two signal transducing β receptor subunits, gp130 and LIFRβ, which it shares with its cytokine relatives (10Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 11Ip N.Y. Nye S.H. Boulton T.G. Davis S. Taga T.

CNTFRä is bound to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and its major function is to convey ligand-specificity (9Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Valenzuela D.M. Wong V. Furth M.E. Squinto S.P. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1991; 253: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, upon certain stimulation, CNTFRä can also be released from its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and mimics the effect of CNTF on target gene activation (12Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Ip N.Y. Stahl N. Scherer S. Farruggella T. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. Panayotatos N. Gascan H. Chevalier S. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 259: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The expression of CNTFRä is mostly restricted to nervous tissues and is detected in all neurons that have been shown to respond to CNTF (13Sendtner M. Schmalbruch H. Stockli K.A. Carroll P. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. Nature. 1992; 358: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 14Ip N.Y. Li Y. van de Stadt I. Panayotatos N. Alderson R.F. Lindsay R.M. J.

Clinically, CNTF effectively protects against motor neuron degeneration in human Parkinson's disease (17Klockgether T. Loschmann P.A. Wullner U. Aktuelle Neurol. 1995; 22: 217-223Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The trophic effect of CNTF is also observed on the denervated skeletal muscle (18Helgren M.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Consistent with the CNTF effect on motor neurons, the essential function of the CNTFRä gene has been proved in mice lacking CNTFRä, which exhibit profound motor neuron deficits at birth (19DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J. Pan L. Stahl N. Ip N. Kato A. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Despite the important function of CNTFRä, the regulation of the CNTFRä gene remain almost completely unknown. Because little is known about TR4 targets, we focused study here on a DR1 element present in CNTFRä which can be potentially regulated by TR4. Thus, the 5th intron of the CNTFRä gene (CNTFR-I5) was cloned to show the DR1 response element, where TR4 binds, is conserved and functional. The consequence for TR4 interaction with this DR1 in its natural gene context was determined using a reporter gene assay. Moreover, the expression pattern of TR4 during mouse embryogenesis was examined by in situ hybridization and then compared to that of CNTFRä. Through these studies, our results suggest TR4 may function as an inducer in CNTFRä gene regulation and this event could happen in vivo. Thus, this study provides the first evidence for TR4 to interact with the neurocytokine signaling pathway during neurogenesis. To clone the DNA fragment containing the 5th intron of the CNTFRä gene, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed. Two oligonucleotides (E5: 5′-CACCTTCAATGTGACTGTGC-3′, E6: 5′-GTGCATGTAGCGAATGTGGC-3′) located in the coding regions flanking the 5th intron of human CNTFRä were synthesized for PCR amplification. The positions of E5 and E6 primers are 417-436 and 510-491, respectively (20Valenzuela D.M. Rojas E. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Brannan C.I. McClain J. Masiakowski P. Ip N.Y. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified genomic DNA (1 μg) isolated from several cell lines (human 1299 and Chinese hamster ovary) and from mouse tail were used as the templates. The following thermal cycling program was used to amplify the DNA fragment with the expected size around 270 base pairs: denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 50°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 1 min, for 35 cycles. The amplified DNA fragments (named as CNTFR-I5) from various template sources were gel purified and subcloned into pT7 blue vector (Novagen). Sequence analysis using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) confirmed the identity of these fragments. To test for enhancer activity, pCAT-promoter vector (Promega), which contains an SV40 promoter upstream from the CAT gene, was used and the human CNTFR-I5 DNA fragments (from PCR) were inserted into this vector. Plasmids pCNTFRI5-CATe5+ and pCNTFRI5-CATe5- both contain the CNTFR-I5 insert at the BglII site of the pCAT-promoter vector with the orientation the same or opposite to CAT expression, respectively. Plasmid pCNTFRI5-CATe3+ inserted the CNTFR-I5 at the XbaI site of the pCAT-promoter vector with the orientation the same as CAT gene expression. The identities of these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pCMX-TR4 (21Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol.

The product of TR4 was analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and showed a major band with an expected molecular weight of 67.3 kilodaltons as described previously (21Lee H.-J. Lee Y. Burbach J.P.H. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30129-30133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out as described previously (22Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.05 μl of TNT-expressed TR4 was included in each reaction. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the human CNTFR-DR1 (5′-GCCCTGACCTTGACCTGGCTCTC-3′) contained two mutated nucleotides (letters underlined). For competition reactions, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were mixed with the labeled probe prior to addition to the reactions. For antibody supershift analysis, 1 μl of monoclonal number 29 anti-TR4 antibody2 or 1 μl of unrelated monoclonal antibody (IgG2 isotype) was incubated with the reactions for 15 min at room temperature prior to loading on a 5% native gel. The DNA-protein binding assay was performed as described previously with modifications (22Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.05 μl of in vitro translated TR4 was incubated with various concentrations of the probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (at 4°C) in 0.5 × TBE. After exposing to a film to localize the free probe and protein-probe complex, the respective bands were excised and counted directly in a scintillation counter. The dissociation constant (Kd) value and Bmax were calculated using the Ebda program (Biosoft). Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured and transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure as described previously (22Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To normalize the transfection efficiency, the pCMVβ (Clontech) was co-transfected. Results were plotted as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments of CAT expression normalized to β-galactosidase activity. To clone the full-length mouse TR4 cDNA, reverse-transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR) was employed, following the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer). Mouse testis total RNA (1 μg) was used as a template. The N- and C-terminal mouse TR4 cDNA fragments were separately amplified using the primer sets TR4-16 and TR4-15 or TR4-3 and TR4-42, respectively. The primer sequences are as followings: TR4-16 (5′-AACACGTACACAGACCTCTG-3′), TR4-15 (5′-GCAGACTCACAGATGTAGTG-3′), TR4-3 (5′-CTGAGAAGATCTATATCCGG-3′), and TR4-42 (5′-CTATAGACTGACTCCGGTGATCTG-3′). The identity of PCR products was confirmed by sequencing and showed high homology to human counterparts. These two cDNA fragments were then ligated together to produce a full-length mouse TR4 cDNA. The N terminus of the mouse TR4 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR. The primers TR4-16 and TR4-23 (5′-ACACAGTACTCTACCACCTG-3′) were used to amplify a PCR product (around 400 bp in size) from mouse testis total RNA, which was cloned into the T7 blue vector (Novagen), confirmed by DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), and designated as mTR4N-pBS. For Northern blot analysis, radiolabeling was performed using a PCR reaction including primers (TR4-16 and TR4-23), 0.1 ng of linear template (mTR4N-pBS plasmid), 5 nmol of each dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 0.1 mCi of [ä-32P]dCTP (DuPont). For in situ analysis, radiolabeled antisense and sense TR4 probes (specific activity 1-2 × 109 cpm/μg) were generated by in vitro transcription as described previously (22Lin T.-M. Young W.-J.

The blot was hybridized with the mouse mTR4N probe, washed, dried, exposed to PhosphorImager intensifying screen for 16 h. The image was scanned and printed. Embryo collection, section preparation, and in situ hybridization were performed as described previously (22Lin T.-M. Young W.-J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30121-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both the antisense and sense TR4 probes were included for each batch of experiments. Washes were performed with high stringency (2 × SSC, 50% formamide at 65°C (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0)) before and after RNase digestion (20 mg/ml for 30 min). Slides were dipped into Kodak NTB2 emulsion and exposed for 2 weeks. Subsequently, slides were developed in Kodak D19 developer, fixed, dehydrated, and mounted for dark field analysis. Some slides were stained with hematoxylin for light-field analysis. Based on the genomic organization and DNA sequence published by Valenzuela et al. (20Valenzuela D.M. Rojas E. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Brannan C.I. McClain J. Masiakowski P. Ip N.Y. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the 5th intron of the human CNTFRä gene (CNTFR-I5) contains one perfect DR1 (5′-AGGTCAAGGTCA) and four copies of AGGTCA-like half-sites. It is especially amazing because so many AGGTCA-like sequences are simutaneously localized within a very small intron of around 176 base pair. We wondered whether some of these sites might be HREs regulated by steroid receptors. As shown in Fig. 1A, CNTFR-I5 is located in the middle of the coding sequence for the first fibronectin-like subdomain within the cytokine receptor-like domain of the CNTFRä gene (Fig. 1A) (20Valenzuela D.M. Rojas E. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Brannan C.I. McClain J. Masiakowski P. Ip N.Y. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The presence and positions of introns in the cytokine receptor-like domain are conserved among members in the cytokine receptor superfamily (20Valenzuela D.M. Rojas E. Le Beau M.M. Espinosa R. Brannan C.I. McClain J. Masiakowski P. Ip N.Y. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), implying CNTFR-I5 may contribute a regulatory role through these response elements. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the CNTFR-I5 from human, hamster, and mouse by PCR (see “Materials and Methods”). Sequence comparisons between these three species showed that the DR1 and putative thyroid hormone receptor-binding site (TRE-like sequence) (4Schrader M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were conserved but the TR3/NGFI-B/nur77-binding site (3Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) has one mismatch at its end (Fig. 1B). The other two AGGTCA-like sequences were not well conserved. The appearance of three different types of highly conserved HREs within a small intron suggests that CNTFR-I5 may be critical for CNTFRä gene regulation. To examine whether CNTFR-DR1 could bind TR4, we carried out in vitro DNA binding experiments. Gel retardation assays were performed with in vitro translated TR4 using the 32P-labeled CNTFR-DR1 oligonucleotide as a probe. As shown in Fig. 2A, a specific DNA-protein complex was formed in the presence of both probe and TR4 (lane 3, hollow arrow) but was absent in the reaction containing probe and the mock-translated control (lane 2). This TR4-CNTFR-DR1 complex could be essentially abolished by as low as a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled CNTFR-DR1 oligonucleotide (lane 4), but remained intact in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of “mutant” CNTFR-DR1 oligonucleotide (lane 6). Moreover, this retarded complex could be fully supershifted in the presence of the anti-TR4 monoclonal antibody (lane 8, solid arrow). As a negative control, an unrelated monoclonal antibody with the same IgG2 isotype as that of TR4 showed no effect on the retarded complex (lane 7). Together, these data indicate that the CNTFR-DR1 is a specific binding site for TR4. To determine the binding affinity of TR4 and CNTFR-DR1, we performed Scatchard analysis by EMSA. The typical EMSA pattern of protein-DNA complex formed between increasing amounts of CNTFR-DR1 probe (0.0039-2 ng) and fixed amounts of TR4 was shown (Fig. 2B). The radioactivity of specific complex (bound) and unbound (free) probe were quantitated for the subsequent Scatchard plot analysis. The results are consistent with a single binding population for the specific DNA-protein complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.066 nM and Bmax of 0.089 nM (Fig. 2C). This binding affinity is about 15-45-fold higher than the Kd range for steroid receptors and their HREs (4Schrader M. Becker-Andre M. Carlberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6444-6449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At very low probe concentrations, the specific protein-DNA complex was still visible (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-4). That was further consistent with the calculated high affinity dissociation constant. To investigate whether TR4 could regulate the CNTFRä gene expression through interaction with CNTFR-I5, we carried out the CAT assay following co-transfection of expression vectors and CAT reporter constructs into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Three enhancer-reporter plasmids were created in the present study to test whether the enhancer activity of CNTFR-I5 is position- or orientation-dependent (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, in the presence of the CNTFR-I5, TR4 induced transcriptional activity up to 15-30-fold in a dose-dependent manner (compare lanes 3 and 4 to lane 2; lanes 8 and 9 to lane 7; lanes 13 and 14 to lane 12). In contrast, this induction did not occur when the antisense TR4 expression vector was transfected (lanes 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, and 16). Different orientations or positions did not appear to affect the TR4-mediated transcriptional activity. TR4 does not significantly induce the CAT reporter in the absence of the DR1(22). Taken together, these results suggest that TR4 might induce CNTFRä gene expression via the CNTFR-I5 enhancer. The entire coding region of mouse TR4 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR (for details see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 4A). Sequence comparison with other members of the steroid receptor superfamily indicated that the N-terminal mouse TR4 cDNA fragment (mTR4N) covered between primer TR4-16 and TR4-23 is the most divergent; the homology within this region is around 30% at nucleotide level between mouse TR4 and TR2. 3W.-J. Young, S. M. Smith, and C. Chang, manuscript in preparation. To test the specificity of mTR4N, total RNA samples isolated from mouse testis and kidney were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4B, the mTR4N probe hybridized to two bands, 7.8 and 2.8 kilobase in size, in mouse testis (Fig. 4B, lane 1). The sizes of these two TR4-hybridized bands are different from those of TR2 transcripts, which are 2.4 (major band) and 2.9 kb (minor band) in size. No hybridization signal was detected in the kidney (Fig. 4B, lane 2). These data are consistent with previous observations (6Chang C. Da Silva S.L. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) supporting that the mTR4N probe is specific and only hybridizes to TR4 transcripts. To test whether TR4 could potentially regulate CNTFRä gene expression in vivo, we examined TR4 expression by in situ hybridization. As shown in Fig. 5A, a coronal section through the rostral region of the forebrain demonstrated the presence of TR4 transcripts within the hippocampus, habenula nuclei, and thalamus as well as throughout the cortical layers. The most intense signals were found in the cortex, piriform cortex (Fig. 5, B and C), regions of Ammon's horn (Fig. 5A, CA1, CA2, and CA3), and dentate gyrus (Fig. 5, D and E). Consistent with previous results, the signal within the dentate gyrus was localized to the granule cells, which undergo active postnatal neurogenesis (6Chang C. Da Silva S.L. Ideta R. Lee Y. Yeh S. Burbach J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6040-6044Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). No signal was detected with the sense mTR4N probe (data not shown). -Ours and previous in situ studies suggested that TR4 expression is related to the neural proliferation status. To further pursue this possibility, we examined TR4 expression during embryogenesis. In situ hybridization analysis in mouse embryos revealed that TR4 expression was most prominent in the developing neural structures as well as in certain non-neuronal regions (Fig. 6, B-E). TR4 transcripts were detected as early as embryonic day 9 (E9) (Fig. 6B). This result was confirmed by RT-PCR with a cycle number at the early amplification phase (data not shown). Initially within the neural system of E9-E11, TR4 transcripts were present uniformly throughout the neural tube along both its rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes (Fig. 6, B and C, ne). Subsequently, during E14-E16, expression became restricted to the ventricular zones of brain vesicles, where cells are rapidly proliferating (23Rakic L. Lyubimov N.N. Scand. J. Rehabil. Med. Suppl. 1988; 17: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, D-F, arrow and arrowhead). Sense mTR4N probe did not detect specific signal in E14 embryo (Fig. 6A). Intensive TR4 transcripts in E16 brain were also observed in the striatum (Fig. 6F, Sr), active dividing population of the cerebellar primordium (Fig. 6E, cp), and spinal cord (Fig. 6D, sp). The spinal motor neurons (Fig. 6D, m) were also positive for TR4 expression. This expression pattern is consistent with a potential role for TR4 in the proliferation and/or early differentiation of neuronal precursors within the central nervous system. During the development of the peripheral nervous system, TR4 transcripts were also actively expressed within the ganglia and the neural epithelium of many sensory organs. Abundant TR4 transcripts were detected in the dorsal root (Fig. 6, C-E, dg), superior cervical (Fig. 6, G-H, c), sympathetic (Fig. 6H, s), and trigeminal (Fig. 6, G, V) ganglia. Its abundance within the dorsal root ganglia through E11-E16 suggests a role for TR4 through the progression of these neurons from precursors to postmitotic neurons (24Murphy M. Reid K. Hilton D.J. Bartlett P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3498-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). High levels of TR4 mRNA were also found within all targets of sensory innervation, including the neuronal epithelium of inner ear (Fig. 6, G, e), retina (Fig. 6I), nasal cavity (Fig. 6, J, oe), and tongue (Fig. 6, J, t). The signal intensity of TR4 in the ganglia layer (neuron bodies) of the retina is stronger than the inner and outer nuclear layers (photoreceptors) (Fig. 6I, compare g to n). This pattern of TR4 expression implies that TR4 could have similar roles on the development and/or early differentiation of motor, sensory, sympathetic neurons as well as their precursors. Widely overlapping expression domains of TR4 and CNTFRä (25Ip N.Y. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L. Li Y. Wiegand S.J. Friedman B. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D.

Several important cell cycle events are dependent on cell-substratum adhesion in non-transformed cells, including activation of G1 cyclin-dependent kinases and expression of cyclin A; the adhesion requirement of these events is abrogated in Ras-transformed cells. The ER-1-2 mutant rat fibroblast cell line is: 1) resistant to Ras-mediated, anchorage-independent growth; 2) defective in Ras-mediated, adhesion-independent expression of cyclin A, but not adhesion-independent activation of cyclin-dependent kinases; and 3) rescued for Ras-induced, anchorage-independent growth by ectopic expression of cyclin A. We report here that extracellular ATP induces adhesion-independent expression of cyclin A and rescues growth in soft agar by ER-1-2 cells that express Ras. ADP, AMP and the non-hydrolyzable analog adenosine 5'-(β,³-iminodiphosphate) are also effective, but adenosine is not. Adenine nucleotide-induced growth in soft agar is inhibited by reactive blue 2, an antagonist of some P2 purinoceptors. ATP does not induce adhesion-independent expression of cyclin A in ER-1-2 or control rat fibroblasts that do not express Ras, indicating a requirement for additional Ras-regulated signals for expression of this gene; one such signal may lead to phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, pRB, and related proteins.

These results suggest that extracellular ATP could play a role in the multistage carcinogenic process in vivo. The ability of neoplastically transformed cells to proliferate in the absence of cell-substratum adhesion (i.e. anchorage-independent growth) is the best in vitro correlate of tumorigenicity (1Shin S.-I. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to hypothesize, therefore, that the molecular mechanisms that underlie anchorage-independent growth are related to the mechanisms that mediate some of the aggressive growth properties of malignant tumors. Despite the widespread use of colony formation in soft agar as an assay for the transformed phenotype, the signal transduction pathways that oncogenes use to drive this aberrant form of cell proliferation are poorly understood. We have developed a system that allows analysis of oncogene-induced, anchorage-independent growth independently from several other transformation-associated phenotypes (2Krauss R.S. Guadagno S.N. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3117-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Rat 6 fibroblast-derived, somatic cell mutant line ER-1-2 responds to expression of the Ras oncoprotein with alterations in cell morphology and gene expression that are nearly indistinguishable from those of a control cell line, PKC3-F4 (2Krauss R.S.

ER-1-2 cells are also resistant to anchorage-independent growth induced by v-Src and v-Raf, and this phenotype is dominant in somatic cell hybridizations.

PKC3-F4 and NIH 3T3 cells that express oncogenic Ras proliferate in non-adherent cultures, and all of these cell cycle events occur in the absence of adhesion in the Ras-transformed derivatives (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, ER-1-2 cells that express Ras (ER-1-2/ras cells) possess G1 Cdk activities when cultured without adhesion, but remain almost fully adhesion-dependent for expression of cyclin A (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of cyclin A is sufficient to rescue anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells, but does not induce anchorage-independent growth of PKC3-F4 or ER-1-2 cells, presumably because these cells still lack G1 Cdk activity in the absence of adhesion (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These data therefore indicate that: 1) oncogenic Ras can supplant the adhesion requirement of cellular functions that are necessary for cell cycle progression, 2) the adhesion dependence of G1 Cdk activity can be dissociated from the adhesion dependence of cyclin A expression, and 3) the ability of Ras to direct expression of cyclin A in the absence of cell-substratum adhesion may be a critical, but insufficient, aspect of its transforming properties. cyclin-dependent kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase transformation-restoring factor 2-methylthio-ATP pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid ä,β-methylene-ATP β,³-methylene-ATP P1,P4-di(adenosine-5′) tetraphosphate adenosine 5′-(β,³-iminodiphosphate). Taken together, the results of several studies suggest that cell-substratum adhesion is likely to regulate multiple signaling pathways that lead independently to activation of G1 Cdks and expression of cyclin A (4Guadagno T.M.

The observation that, in the ER-1-2 cell line, Ras is able to overcome the adhesion requirement of G1 Cdk activation, but not the adhesion requirement of cyclin A expression, suggests that Ras also signals via multiple pathways to achieve anchorage-independent growth. This is consistent with numerous recent reports, which indicate that Ras has multiple direct effectors and relies on multiple pathways to achieve cell transformation (8Marshall M.S.

Extracellular ATP, operating via P2 purinoceptors, can elicit an extremely wide range of biological effects in different systems (15Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest to the studies reported here are the observations of Heppel and colleagues that extracellular ATP can act as a mitogen or co-mitogen for a number of different fibroblast cell lines (19Huang N. Wang D. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7904-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Gonzalez F.A. Wang D. Huang N. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have recently described a low molecular weight, hydrophilic, heat-and protease-resistant, secreted factor (designatedtrfactor, TRF) that specifically rescues anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, TRF can be destroyed by ultraviolet light (UV) of 260 nm wavelength, indicating the presence of one or more critical UV-labile chemical bonds.2 Based on its chemical properties, the hypothesis that TRF might be an adenine nucleotide was tested. We report here that extracellular ATP rescued anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells. Furthermore, ATP induced expression of cyclin A in non-adherent cultures of ER-1-2/ras cells. Contrary to our original hypothesis, however, TRF does not appear to be an adenine nucleotide and exerted its effects on anchorage-independent growth via a mechanism distinct from that used by ATP. ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, UTP, AMP-PNP, adenosine, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were all from Boehringer Mannheim. ä,β-Methylene-ATP (ä,β-Me-ATP), β,³-methylene-ATP (β,³-Me-ATP), P1,P4-di(adenosine-5′) tetraphosphate (AppppA), 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, thapsigargin, reactive blue 2, and 8-bromo-cAMP were all from Sigma. 2-Methylthio-ATP (2-Me-S-ATP) and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS) were from Research Biochemicals International. All cell lines were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% calf serum as described previously (2Krauss R.S. Guadagno S.N. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3117-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Soft agar assays were performed as described in Ref. 22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar. Adenine nucleotides and other chemical compounds were added to the soft agar medium at the time the cells were initially inoculated, and with each subsequent feeding. When potential chemical inhibitors of ATP- or TRF-induced anchorage-independent growth were tested, cells were pretreated with the inhibitor for 1 h while growing on tissue culture plates and then inoculated into agar medium with ATP or TRF and inhibitor. For subsequent feedings, the inhibitors were added to one-half the standard feeding volume and the medium was then overlaid on the agar cultures. After a 1-h incubation at 37°C, an additional 0.5 volume containing ATP or TRF was added and the cultures were placed back in the incubator. To recover cells cultured under non-adherent conditions, preparative methylcellulose cultures were used in place of soft agar cultures (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were inoculated into 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum and 1.3% methylcellulose, in a 50-ml conical tube. The tubes were then placed in a water-jacketed CO2 incubator at 37°C. Three days later, the medium was diluted with 40 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (to solubilize the methylcellulose), and the cells were recovered by gentle centrifugation. Recovery of cells by this method was nearly quantitative, and cell viability was >98%, as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assays. The growth properties in soft agar and methylcellulose of the cell lines used in these studies are nearly identical (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analyses were performed as described (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibodies against cyclin A (courtesy of R. Assoian, University of Miami; and M. Pagano, New York University), cyclin D (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), cyclin E (courtesy of J. Roberts, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center) or pRB (PharMingen). After hybridization with the primary antibody, the membrane was reprobed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and specific protein bands detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Corp.). Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) was performed as described (2Krauss R.S. Guadagno S.N. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3117-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TRF was partially purified by fractionating serum-free conditioned medium derived from Rat 6 fibroblasts by size exclusion chromatography on a Bio-Gel P2 column (Bio-Rad) as described previously (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in water, and sterile-filtered prior to use. Because we had previously characterized TRF as a low molecular weight, non-protein, non-lipid secreted factor (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar) that is inactivated by UV light,2 we have tested various cell-derived factors with similar chemical properties for their ability to rescue anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells. Table I and Fig. 1 show that inclusion of 50 μM ATP in the agar medium induced colony formation of ER-1-2/ras cells and two independent subclones of ER-1-2/ras (designated ERRC1 and ERRC6), but did not induce colony formation in the non-Ras-expressing PKC3-F4 or ER-1-2 cell lines. Furthermore, ATP did not enhance colony formation by the fully transformed PKC3-F4/ras cells (Table I and Fig. 1), nor did it enhance the growth of ER-1-2/ras cells cultured on plastic dishes (data not shown). Thus, similar to TRF and ectopic expression of cyclin A (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar), extracellular ATP specifically rescued anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells. We next tested the ability of ATP and other adenine nucleotides to rescue growth in soft agar of ER-1-2/ras cells over the dose range 0.01-100 μM (Fig. 2A). ATP, ADP, and AMP were all equipotent, with an EC50 of <10 μM, and colony formation was observed at doses as low as 1 μM. The non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMP-PNP, was as effective as ATP itself, indicating that hydrolysis of ATP was not necessary for its effects in this system (Fig. 2A). In contrast, adenosine was inactive at concentrations up to 100 μM (Fig. 2A).Table I.Rescue of growth in soft agar of ER-1-2/ras cells by extracellular ATPCell lineGrowth in soft agar (colonies/104 cells)aA total of 10,000 cells of each cell line were seeded into 0.3% agar, in the presence or absence of ATP (50 μM).

There is currently a lack of highly specific antagonists for the various different P2 purinoceptors. However, reactive blue 2 and PPADS are considered to be relatively specific antagonists for P2Y and P2X receptors, respectively (16Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2B demonstrates that reactive blue 2 inhibited adenine nucleotide-induced colony formation with an IC50 of ∼20 μM. In contrast, TRF-mediated colony formation was not affected by reactive blue 2 at concentrations up to 100 μM, demonstrating that the effect of reactive blue 2 on adenine nucleotide-mediated colony formation was specific and not due to toxicity to the cells (Fig. 2B). These data also indicate that TRF and adenine nucleotides exerted their effects on ER-1-2/ras cells via distinct mechanisms. PPADS did not inhibit colony formation induced either by ATP or by TRF (data not shown). We next tested various ATP analogs and other nucleotides for their ability to stimulate anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells over the dose range 0.01-100 μM (Fig. 2C). β,³-Me-ATP was as effective as ATP at higher doses, but was reproducibly less efficacious at concentrations <20 μM. In contrast, ä,β-Me-ATP, 2-Me-S-ATP, UTP, GTP, and AppppA were all inactive in this assay (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Because ä,β-Me-ATP, 2-Me-S-ATP, and UTP are more potent agonists than ATP for certain purinoceptors (16Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar), and the assay used here involved chronic exposures, it was possible that these compounds were desensitizing a signaling system responsible for inducing anchorage-independent growth and that their inactivity was therefore artifactual. To address this point, the ability of ä,β-Me-ATP, 2-Me-S-ATP, or UTP to inhibit colony formation of ER-1-2/ras cells by 50 μM ATP was tested over the dose range 1-100 μM. None of these three compounds were able to inhibit ATP-mediated colony formation at any dose tested, ruling out a desensitization role for these analogs (data not shown). Finally, we tested several second messenger mimetics in this system: the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, thapsigargin, arachidonic acid, and the calcium ionophore A23187 were all inactive in stimulating anchorage-independent growth of ER-1-2/ras cells (data not shown). 8-Bromo-cAMP also did not stimulate growth of ER-1-2/ras cells and, in fact, potently inhibited anchorage-independent growth of the fully transformed PKC3-F4/ras cells (data not shown). The ER-1-2 cell line is defective in Ras-mediated, anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A, and ectopic expression of cyclin A rescues colony formation of ER-1-2/ras cells in soft agar (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It was of interest, therefore, to test whether ATP induced anchorage-independent expression of the endogenous cyclin A gene in ER-1-2/ras cells. Because it is not possible to recover viable, non-adherent cells from soft agar cultures, we utilized a methylcellulose culture system that allows for nearly quantitative recovery of intact cells cultured under non-adherent conditions (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated previously that the growth properties in soft agar and methylcellulose of the cell lines used in these studies are nearly identical (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ATP induced colony formation of ER-1-2/ras cells in methylcellulose cultures at a similar frequency as in soft agar cultures, and this colony formation was inhibited by reactive blue 2 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, ER-1-2/ras cells expressed only trace levels of cyclin A protein in methylcellulose cultures that were not supplemented with ATP, but addition of 50 μM ATP induced expression of cyclin A in such cultures. This response was not an indirect effect due simply to ATP driving the ER-1-2/ras cells through the cell cycle because partially purified TRF did not induce cyclin A in these cells (Fig. 3A), despite the fact that it rescued colony formation to a similar extent as ATP (Ref. 22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar and see Fig. 4). The specificity of this response was further underscored by the observation that ATP did not alter the levels of cyclins D1 and E in methylcellulose cultures of ER-1-2/ras cells (Fig. 3A). Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the induction of cyclin A by ATP occurred at the RNA level (Fig. 3B). To examine the time course of cyclin A induction by ATP, ER-1-2/ras cells were inoculated into methylcellulose-containing medium and incubated for 24 h to allow some decay of adhesion-mediated cyclin A production. ATP was then added to the cultures and cyclin A protein levels analyzed at various time points thereafter. As shown in Fig. 3C, cyclin A levels continued to decrease over the next 6 h in both ATP-treated and untreated cultures. There was only a small effect on cyclin A expression between 3 and 12 h after exposure to ATP, but by 24 h post-treatment cyclin A was fully induced.Fig. 4Additive effects of ATP and TRF on soft agar colony formation by ER-1-2/ras cells. ER-1-2/ras cells were inoculated into soft agar medium containing either ATP (50 μM), a maximally effective dose of partially purified TRF, or both. Values represent averages of triplicate determinations ± one standard deviation. The experiment was performed twice; representative data are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next asked whether ATP could induce cyclin A expression in the PKC3-F4 and ER-1-2 cell lines, which were not induced to grow in soft agar by this compound. As seen in Fig. 3D, expression of cyclin A was completely adhesion-dependent in these two cell lines, and ATP did not lead to expression of cyclin A in non-adherent, methylcellulose cultures of these cells. Thus, additional Ras-mediated signals were required for anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A. A role for the E2F transcription factor has been implicated in the induction of the cyclin A gene near the G1/S phase border (23Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Because E2F activity is strongly influenced by the phosphorylation status of pRB family members (24Beijersbergin R.L. Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 103-120PubMed Google Scholar), and pRB phosphorylation is an adhesion-dependent event (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of ATP on pRB phosphorylation in non-adherent cultures of PKC3-F4, ER-1-2, and ER-1-2/ras cells. Similar to our previous observations, pRB was hypophosphorylated in extracts prepared from non-adherent cultures of PKC3-F4 and ER-1-2 cells (Fig. 3E). Consistent with its inability to induce cyclin A or soft agar colony formation in PKC3-F4 and ER-1-2 cells, addition of ATP to these cells in the absence of adhesion had no effect on the phosphorylation status of pRB. It is possible, therefore, that one of the additional Ras-mediated events that is necessary for anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A is phosphorylation of pRB family members and, by implication, resultant alterations in E2F activity. As expected, pRB was hyperphosphorylated in ER-1-2/ras cells with or without treatment with ATP (Fig. 3E). TRF did not induce anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A (Fig. 3A), yet it rescued colony formation in soft agar of ER-1-2/ras cells (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that TRF exerted its effects via a mechanism distinct from that used by ATP, which did induce cyclin A. If this were true, it would be predicted that the effects of TRF and ATP would be at least additive. To test this hypothesis, 50 μM ATP (a saturating dose; see Fig. 2A) was mixed with a maximally effective dose of partially purified TRF (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar), and the number of soft agar colonies formed by ER-1-2/ras cells treated with the mixture was compared to the number formed with each agent alone. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the mixture of ATP and TRF had a slightly more than additive effect when compared to either compound alone. Anchorage-independent growth is the best in vitro correlate of tumorigenicity (1Shin S.-I. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar); identification of the oncoprotein-driven signaling pathways that mediate this aberrant form of cell proliferation is therefore necessary for molecular elucidation of the transformed phenotype. Recent studies indicate that several biochemical events that are necessary for cell cycle progression are dependent on cell-substratum adhesion in non-transformed cells. These events include activation of G1 cyclin-Cdk complexes (as measured by pRB phosphorylation, and cyclin E- and A-dependent kinase activities) and expression of the cyclin A gene (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Fang F. Orend G. Watanabe N. Hunter T. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1996; 271: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 7Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell. Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 and Rat 6-derived fibroblast cell lines that are transformed by Ras display both G1 Cdk activities and expression of cyclin A even when cultured under non-adherent conditions (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of these observations is demonstrated in the ER-1-2 somatic cell mutant line, which is resistant to Ras-induced, anchorage-independent growth (2Krauss R.S. Guadagno S.N. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3117-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). ER-1-2/ras cells exhibit G1 Cdk activities in non-adherent cultures, but are defective for expression of cyclin A under such conditions (5Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of cyclin A is sufficient to rescue growth in soft agar of ER-1-2/ras cells, but is not sufficient to induce anchorage-independent growth of Rat 6-derived lines that do not express Ras. Thus, Ras-mediated events other than anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A are also required for growth in soft agar; one such event is likely to be loss of the adhesion requirement for G1 Cdk activity. With such functionally relevant end points as anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A now identified, it should be possible to dissect the signaling pathways utilized by Ras to drive anchorage-independent growth. In particular, it should be possible to exploit the ER-1-2/ras cell line toward this end. Constitutively activated forms of components of these pathways would be predicted to rescue growth in soft agar of these cells in the same fashion that ectopic expression of cyclin A did, provided that they function downstream of the defective signaling point in these cells. We have recently observed that ER-1-2/ras cells display constitutively active MAPK and, further, that the transformed phenotype of these cells is not rescued by ectopic expression of activated alleles of MAPK kinase, Rac1 or RhoA,2 each of which is required for transformation by Ras (11Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar, 12Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M.

A. 1995; 92: 11781-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the pathways controlled by these proteins may not directly regulate, or be sufficient for, anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A. Alternatively, the defective signaling point in ER-1-2/ras cells might reside between one of these proteins and the cyclin A gene. We report here that an extracellular signaling agent, ATP, induced anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A and rescued growth in soft agar in ER-1-2/ras cells. These data argue that a pathway that leads to induction of the cyclin A gene in the absence of the normal adhesion requirement is functional in these cells and can be activated by extracellular adenine nucleotides. The observations that: 1) an antagonist of P2Y purinoceptors (reactive blue 2) blocked the effects of adenine nucleotides on agar growth, and 2) a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PNP) was fully efficacious, suggest that the adenine nucleotides might have exerted their effects via activation of a purinoceptor. If this is the case, we are not aware of any cloned or characterized receptor that displays a similar pharmacological profile (16Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the cyclin A gene is dramatically up-regulated in non-transformed cells at the G1/S border, and cyclin A is required for the G1/S transition and progression through both S and G2 phases (for review, see Refs. 25Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar and 26Heichman K.A. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 557-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, expression of cyclin A requires signals from both growth factors and cell-substratum adhesion, and occurs as late as 18 h after adherent, quiescent cells are treated with growth factors (25Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2586) Google Scholar, 26Heichman K.A. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 557-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The cyclin A gene promoter must therefore integrate information from multiple signaling pathways that has accrued over a considerable period of time. It is striking that cyclin A was induced in an adhesion-independent manner in ER-1-2/ras cells by treatment with a soluble, extracellular signaling factor, ATP. Perhaps ATP- and integrin-mediated signaling pathways overlap in Rat 6 cells. Signals provided by ATP treatment were not sufficient to induce cyclin A, however, since PKC3-F4 and ER-1-2 cells that did not express Ras did not respond, nor were they stimulated to grow in soft agar. Thus, additional Ras-mediated events were necessary for anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A, which, as described above, was itself insufficient to drive proliferation of suspended cells. Because non-adherent PKC3-F4 and ER-1-2 cells displayed only hypophosphorylated pRB even when treated with ATP, and E2F activity has been implicated in cyclin A gene induction (23Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Berges J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), one likely possibility for an additional required event is phosphorylation of pRB family members and concomitant alterations in E2F activity. Taken together, it appears that the putative dominant mutation in ER-1-2 cells acts very specifically to block a Ras-regulated signaling pathway that, in cooperation with other Ras-regulated events, leads to anchorage-independent expression of cyclin A and therefore to growth in soft agar. We propose that signals provided by ATP, possibly via activation of a purinoceptor, feed into this pathway at a point downstream of the point of blockade in ER-1-2 cells. The requirement for multiple Ras-regulated signaling and cell cycle events for anchorage-independent growth is consistent with the notion that anchorage-independent growth is the most stringent in vitro criterion of transformation and has a very high correlation with tumorigenicity (1Shin S.-I. Freedman V.H. Risser R. Pollack R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4435-4439Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). We originally tested ATP for its effects on ER-1-2/ras cells because the chemical properties of TRF might be consistent with those of a nucleotide (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of TRF were not, however, inhibited by reactive blue 2, nor did TRF induce cyclin A expression, despite its ability to rescue growth in soft agar of these cells (22Yang J.-J. Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1291-1299PubMed Google Scholar). It is concluded that TRF is very likely not an adenine nucleotide. The mechanism of action of TRF remains unknown; the fact that it can drive proliferation of cells that produce only trace levels of cyclin A underscores the complexity of the perverse growth properties of oncogene-transformed cells. Further analysis of ATP-mediated signaling in ER-1-2/ras cells could provide insight into the signaling pathways utilized by Ras to induce anchorage-independent growth in wild-type cells. The observations presented here may have further implications, as well. The ability of extracellular adenine nucleotides to influence a cell cycle event that is strongly linked to the transformed phenotype suggests that these compounds could play a role in multistage carcinogenesis in vivo. For example, early in the carcinogenic process, it is possible that cells could acquire the ability to carry out the activation of G1 Cdks without adhesion signals, but not yet the ability to express cyclin A under such conditions. Exposure to adenine nucleotides might serve as a tumor promotion-like stimulus to such cells. We thank Rick Assoian, Michele Pagano and Jim Roberts for gifts of antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2051041862,"Primate ä-chymases are mast cell neutral proteases that are involved in regulating several regulatory peptides including angiotensin II. Because of significant substrate specificity differences among the chymase group of enzymes, animal models that overexpress primate chymases are crucial for delineating the in vivo function of these enzymes. Activation of ä-prochymase requires processing enzymes and proteoglycans found in mast cell secretory granules. Thus, the development of models overexpressing active primate chymase requires a mast cell-specific promoter. We show that the 571-base pair (bp) 5′-upstream sequence of the baboon chymase gene, which encodes an ä-chymase, coupled to the prokaryotic lacZ gene allows the targeting of β-galactosidase to mast cells in transgenic mice. Tissue expression of the transgene is similar to the expression of the endogenous mouse ä-chymase mouse mast cell protease-5. A mouse mast cell line that endogenously expresses mouse mast cell protease-5 (JKras mast cells) also selectively supports the expression of this transgene. In vitro transcription studies in JKras mast cells shows the critical role of a GATA cis-regulatory motif in baboon chymase promoter, located ∼430-bp upstream of the transcription start site. These results suggest that the 571-bp domain of the baboon chymase promoter contains most, if not all, of the mast cell-specific region of the promoter. We describe here for the first time a promoter that directs expression of transgenes specifically to mouse mast cells. This promoter should be generally applicable for dominant expression of mast cell regulatory proteins.

We describe here for the first time a promoter that directs expression of transgenes specifically to mouse mast cells. This promoter should be generally applicable for dominant expression of mast cell regulatory proteins. Mast cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells, but mature mast cells reside in mucosal and connective tissue (1Schwartz L.B. Kaliner M.A. Metcalfe D.D. The Mast Cell in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1993: 219-236Google Scholar). Through the release of proteases, cytokines, and other chemical mediators, mast cells participate in a variety of immunological, inflammatory, and cardiovascular responses. Mast cell proteases include chymases, tryptases, and carboxypeptidase A (2Schwartz L.B. Neutral Proteases of Mast Cells. Karger, Richmond, VA1990Google Scholar). Our recent studies and those of other investigators suggest that chymases can activate and inactivate regulatory peptides and thus can produce complex effects on the cardiovascular system. For example, some chymases, e.g. human, baboon, and dog chymases, form angiotensin II efficiently (3Urata H. Kinoshita A. Misono K.S. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Recent phylogenetic studies indicate that mammalian chymases occur in two distinct isoenzyme groups, ä and β (6Chandrasekharan U.M. Sanker S. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain A. Science. 1996; 271: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A single chymase gene (chm gene) encoding an ä-chymase has been identified in all mammals studied, including human, baboon, dog, rat, gerbil, and mouse (6Chandrasekharan U.M. Sanker S. Glynias M.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, β-chymases are species-specific. Mice, rat, and gerbil contain four, two, and one β-chymase-encoding chm genes, respectively (6Chandrasekharan U.M. Sanker S. Glynias M.J. Karnik S.S. Husain A. Science. 1996; 271: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 11Itoh H. Murakumo Y. Tomita M. Ide H. Kobayaski T. Maruyama H. Horii Y. Nawa Y. Biochem.

Substrate specificity studies indicate that ä- and β-chymases differ in their specificities and that there are more subtle substrate specificity differences between some ä-chymases (3Urata H. Kinoshita A. Misono K.S. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22348-22357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kinoshita A. Urata H. Bumpus F.M. Husain A. J. Biol.

Nakajima K. Nakashimo K. Neurath H. Woodbury R.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although the overall function of mast cells can be explored in mast cell-deficient mice, the in vivo role of ä-chymases cannot be delineated because highly specific inhibitors of these proteases are not currently available. Also, subtle differences in substrate specificity between mammalian ä-chymases make questionable the use of rodent models for the study of primate ä-chymase function. One approach toward understanding the in vivo role of primate ä-chymases is to create transgenic models that overexpress functionally active forms of these enzymes. Our recent studies show that the chymase propeptide sequence is important in the correct folding of this protease within the cell (14Urata H. Karnik S.S. Graham R.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24318-24322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of prochymase requires heparin and dipeptidylpeptidase I, which occur abundantly in mast cells (15Murakami M. Karnik S.S. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2218-2223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, to assess the effect of dominant expression, it is necessary to target the zymogen to mast cells to ensure processing and proper tissue localization of chymase. The unavailability of a promoter that selectively targets the mast cell in vivo has hampered investigation of the in vivo role of these mast cell proteases. We recently cloned the baboon chm gene, including its ∼2.5-kb 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobase(s)mmcp5mouse mast cell protease-5RTreverse transcriptasebpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionT-bluetoluidine blueMELmouse erythroid leukemiaMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferase. 5′-upstream sequence. The 5′-upstream sequence of this gene is highly homologous to the corresponding region of the human chm gene described by Caughey et al. (16Caughey G.H. Schaumberg T.H. Zerweck E.H. Butterfield J.H. Hanson R.D. Silverman G.A. Ley T.J. Genomics. 1993; 15: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this report we show that the 571-bp 5′-upstream sequence of the baboon chm gene coupled to the prokaryotic lacZ gene allows the targeting of the β-galactosidase reporter to mast cells in transgenic mice. We also show that tissue expression of the lacZ gene directed by the baboon chm 571-bp 5′-upstream region is similar to the endogenous pattern of expression of the mouse ä-chymase mmcp5 and that this promoter is highly active in JKras mast cells, a mouse mast cell line that endogenously expresses mmcp5. Furthermore, in vitro transcriptional studies in this mouse mast cell line demonstrate the critical role of a GATA cis-regulatory motif in baboon chm promoter-directed expression of the reporter gene. These studies provide a novel tool for the specific expression of genes in mast cells that is likely to be crucial in uncovering the in vivo role of primate chymases as well as other mast cell proteins and provide insight into cis-trans interactions that may be important in baboon chm gene expression in mast cells. kilobase(s) mouse mast cell protease-5 reverse transcriptase base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction toluidine blue mouse erythroid leukemia 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of a single 7-kb EcoRI-digested band from baboon genomic DNA that hybridized to a 32P-labeled human chymase cDNA probe. EcoRI-digested 6-8-kb fragments of baboon genomic DNA were cloned into a phage λ gt10 vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per manufacturer's protocol. The 7-kb insert, which strongly hybridized to the human chymase cDNA probe, was subcloned into a pBluescript KS+ phagemid (Stratagene). The nucleotide sequence of the overlapping fragments was determined in both directions. The 5′-end of baboon heart-derived chymase mRNA was defined by primer extension analysis (17Murasawa S. Matsubara H. Urakami M. Inada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26996-27003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA, prepared from the baboon left cardiac ventricle, was incubated for 1 h at 42°C in a reaction buffer containing Moloney murine virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) and a 30-bp 32P-labeled oligonucleotide derived from the 3′-end of the first exon of the baboon chm gene. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the sample was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and the size of the prominent radiolabeled DNA fragment extended onto the primer was determined. The lacZ gene was released from a pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid by SalI and BamHI digestion (the SalI site is created by PCR and located just before the ATG translation start site). Two different transgenes were constructed by ligation of 2,426- or 571-bp fragments of the baboon chm gene's 5′-upstream region with the lacZ gene. The linearized transgene constructs were microinjected (18Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); ∼2 pl of the DNA solution (∼1000 copies) was microinjected into one pronucleus of each mouse (FVB) F2 embryo. Injections were made by the Transgenic Core Facility of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Two-cell stage embryos were transferred to the oviducts of 0.5-day post-coitus pseudopregnant Swiss FBR females. The offspring were screened for transgene integration by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA using a 32P-labeled 3.34-kb prokaryotic lacZ gene as probe. A previously described histochemical staining procedure was used to assess β-galactosidase activity (18Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Three-week-old transgenic mice as well as their nontransgenic littermates were sacrificed. Tissue samples from each mouse were fixed for 40-60 min in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% gluteradehyde, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.01% sodium deoxycholate in phosphate-buffered saline, embedded in the embedding medium OCT and frozen on dry ice. Serial 6-μm tissue sections were cut with a cryostat, loaded on charge-coated slides (Fisher), and refixed in the same solution for 10 min. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were submerged in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 1 mg/ml 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM K3Fe(CN)6, and 10 mM K4Fe(CN)6. Incubation was carried out for 3-4 h at 37°C. After 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside staining, sections were dehydrated and mounted in Permount (Fisher). Adjacent slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or with 1% toluidine blue (T-blue). Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 108 cells using an RNAzol kit (TEL-TEST, Friendswood, TX). 20-μg RNA samples were size-fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After UV cross-linking, the blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled human chymase cDNA at high stringency. Mouse mastocytoma P815 cells, mouse erythroid leukemia (MEL) cells, and NIH3T3 (3T3) fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. JKras mast cells (20Rein A. Keller J. Schultz A.M. Holmes K.L. Medicus R. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. James N. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). P815 mast cells and MEL cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. JKras mast cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and murine interleukin-3 (20 units/ml). 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were kept at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and split (∼1:4) every 5 days. Baboon chm promoter-CAT chimeras were made by fusing varying lengths of the baboon chm gene's 5′-upstream sequence to the coding sequences for CAT. These baboon chm promoters of varying lengths were generated by PCR amplification. For each construct two primers were used; each contained either a terminal PstI site or a SalI site to facilitate cloning into the PstI and SalI sites immediately upstream of the CAT reporter gene in the plasmid pSV40-CAT enhancer (Promega, Madison, WI). The number following the Δ in Fig. 1 indicates the end of the 5′-upstream sequence with respect to the transcription-initiation site (designated +1) was determined by primer extension analysis. In addition to the specified amounts of the 5′-upstream sequence, these constructs contained the transcription-initiation site and 30 bp of the 5′-upstream region between the transcription-initiation site and the putative translation start site of the baboon chm gene. Transient transfection of 3T3 fibroblasts was performed using the calcium/phosphate co-precipitation method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). JKras mast cells and P815 mast cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). As an internal control for these transfections, the pSV-lacZ plasmid was co-transfected with the test plasmid (1:5). The cells were harvested and ruptured by three freeze-thaw cycles. One-half of the extract was heated for 10 min at 65°C to destroy endogenous deacetylating activity. After removal of the cellular debris, the heat-treated extract was assayed for CAT activity. The remaining extract was assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Based on β-galactosidase activity, CAT activity in each sample was adjusted for between plate and between experiment variability in transfection efficiency. Transient transfection of COS-1 cells was performed using the DEAE-dextran method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The pSV-lacZ plasmid was co-transfected with the test plasmid (1:5) as an internal control. Human GATA-2 cDNA plasmid, a gift from Dr. S. H. Orkin (Harvard Medical School, Boston), was co-transfected with the Δ571-bchm-CAT construct to determine transcriptional activation of this promoter construct by human GATA-2. CAT activity in each sample was adjusted for between plate and between experiment variability in transfection efficiency. JKras mast cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (21Tolunay H.E. Yang L. Kemper W.M. Safer B. Anderson W.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% glycerol, and stored at -70°C. In vitro transcription reactions were performed with 2 nM supercoiled template DNA and 10-15 μl of nuclear extract (10-15 mg/ml) in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 12 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 50 mM KCl, 25 mM (NH4)2SO4, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM dithiothreitol, 2 units of RNasin, 12% glycerol, 600 μM ATP, 600 μM UTP, 600 μM GTP, 25 μM CTP, and 10 μCi of [ä-32P]CTP (Amersham Corp.). Transcription reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30°C and terminated by the addition of 0.2% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 μg of tRNA carrier/ml. RNA in the transcription mixture was extracted with 200 μl of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mM EDTA. The RNA samples were separated on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel in 1 × MOPS buffer, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and subjected to autoradiography for 16 h. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described (22Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed with 20 μg of JKras mast cell nuclear extract and ∼0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to a fragment (-417 to -441 bp) of the baboon chm promoter (100,000 cpm) in 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.9, containing 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 100 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml poly d(I-C). To study the effect of competitor oligonucleotides on the binding of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide to JKras mast cell nuclear trans-acting factors, a 10-, 30-, or 60-fold excess of competitor oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. 32P-Labeled DNA-protein complexes were resolved from unbound radiolabeled DNA on 6% polyacrylamide gels run in 22.5 mM Tris borate buffer, pH 8.3. The gels were dried under vacuum and autoradiographed for ∼16 h. Single-stranded cDNAs were prepared from total RNA from JKras mast cells, MEL cells, P815 cells, 3T3 fibroblasts, and mouse spleen and from tissues from the transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine virus reverse transcriptase. The resulting single-stranded cDNAs were amplified using a 0.5 μM concentration of each primer. For mmcp5, 5′-TTCTGAGAACTACCTGTCGGCC-3′ was used as the sense strand, and 5′-GAATTGTGTCGAAAACTGGTGAAGTG-3′ was used as the antisense strand. For mouse GATA-1, 5′-CAACAGTATGGAGGGAATTCCTGGGGGCT-3′ was used as the sense strand, and 5′-GGCCGGTTCTGACCATTCATTTTGTGATA-3′ was used as the antisense strand. For mouse GATA-2, 5′-GACGGAGAGCATGAAGATGG-3′ was used as the sense strand, and 5′-AGGCATTGCACAGGTAGTGG-3′ was used as the antisense strand; these primers were based on the sequence of human GATA-2. For mouse GATA-3, 5′-CCTTGGAACCTCAGCCCTTTTTCCAAGACCTCCA-3′ was used as the sense strand, and 5′-GGCCGGTTCTGACCATTCATTTTGTGATA-3′ was used as the antisense strand. For lacZ, 5′-CCAGCGTTTCAACGCGCTGTATGGCG-3′ was used as the sense strand, and 5′-AGACGTCACGGAAAATGCCGCTCATC-3′ was used as the antisense strand. For GAPDH, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACCTTGGC-3′ was used as the sense strand, and 5′-GTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTG-3′ was used as the antisense strand. Autoradiographic data were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. RT-PCR agarose gel bands were quantitated using a densitometric image analyzer (densitometer) driven by a Macintosh computer. Quantitative data are presented as the means ± S.E., and differences between means were evaluated using a Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The nucleotide sequence and organization of the baboon chm gene is shown in Fig. 1. Based on a comparison with the baboon chymase cDNA structure, this gene has five coding blocks. The first coding block is 58 bp in length; it encodes, in an open reading frame, the first 19 amino acids (-21 to -3) of the preproenzyme. The second, third, fourth, and fifth coding blocks of the baboon chm gene encode amino acids -2 to 49, 50 to 94, 95 to 179, and 180 to 226. As assessed by primer extension analysis, the primary transcription-initiation site of the baboon chm gene is 30 bp upstream of the translation-initiation site (data not shown). The translation-initiation ATG codon of the baboon chm gene was predicted based on the structure of the baboon chymase cDNA. The 5′-upstream region of the baboon chm gene contains a CAAT and a TATA box, -108 to -105 bp and -29 to -25 bp upstream, respectively, of the transcription-initiation site. A consensus polyadenylation motif, AATAAA, which is followed by a cleavage site motif, consisting of a CA sequence located 15 bp downstream along with a GT cluster, is found in the 3′-untranslated region. The structure of the baboon chm gene's 5′-upstream region (-2,426 to -1 bp) is ∼92% identical to that of the human chm gene. Baboon chymase is 97% identical to human chymase (9Urata H. Kinoshita A. Perez D.M. Misono K.S. Bumpus F.M. Graham R.M. Husain A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17173-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 76% identical to its mouse homolog mmcp5 (12McNeil H.P. Austen K.F. Somerville L.L. Gurish M.F. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20316-20322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the baboon chm promoter, two constructions were made. These constructs consist of 571- and 2,426-bp 5′-upstream sequences of the baboon chm gene linked to the prokaryotic lacZ gene, i.e. Δ571-bchm-lacZ and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ, respectively. Δ571-bchm-lacZ and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ constructions were used to generate transgenic founders. Germline transmission occurred with Δ571-bchm-lacZ (two female and one male founder) and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ (1 male founder) constructs. A Δ571-bchm-lacZ male founder and a Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ male founder were used to generate F1 transgenic heterozygous mice. Subsequent tissue and cell expression of the lacZ gene was determined in F1 heterozygous transgenic mice. Tissue expression of β-galactosidase mRNA in transgenic heterozygous mice and mmcp5 expression in nontransgenic littermates was quantified using RT-PCR. Ratios of mmcp5/GAPDH in tissues from nontransgenic mice and lacZ/GAPDH mRNA in tissues from Δ571-bchm-lacZ and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ transgenic mice are summarized in Fig. 2. The relative distribution of GAPDH-normalized lacZ expression in the stomach, intestine, spleen, heart, lung, and brain tissues was similar between the Δ571-bchm-lacZ and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ constructs and also similar to that of mmcp5. To identify the cell types in transgenic mice that express the lacZ gene, we examined T-blue-staining cells (T-blue produces a deep purple stain in mast cells) and β-galactosidase-containing cells in serial sections of the stomach from the Δ571-bchm-lacZ and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ transgenic mice. Fig. 3 indicates the selective expression of β-galactosidase in T-blue staining cells in the submucosa of the stomach from a Δ571-bchm-lacZ transgenic mouse. Similar results were observed in the gastric submocosa and small intestine of other Δ571-bchm-lacZ (n = 2) and Δ2,426-bchm-lacZ (n = 2) transgenic mice (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows representative cells in the Δ571-bchm-lacZ transgenic left cardiac ventricle staining for T-blue or β-galactosidase. To determine if Δ571-bchm promoter-driven lacZ expression occurs in circulating mast cell progenitors, leukocytes from Δ571-bchm-lacZ transgenic mice were examined for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase activity was not observed in several leukocyte samples (data not shown).Fig. 3Photomicrographs showing the expression of the Δ571bchm-lacZ construct in the gastric submucosa of an F1 heterozygous transgenic mouse.

Using mouse chymase subtype selective PCR primers, Fig. 5B shows that JKras mast cells contain mmcp5 mRNA. Using mouse β-chymase subtype-selective PCR primers showed the absence of β-chymase mRNA in JKras mast cells (data not shown). JKras mast cells are interleukin-3-dependent Harvey sarcoma virus-infected immune mast cells from the mouse spleen (20Rein A. Keller J. Schultz A.M. Holmes K.L. Medicus R. Ihle J.N. Mol.

To examine whether this discrimination in the expression of an ä-chymase-encoding chm gene in these two mast cell lines is mimicked by the transcriptional activity of the Δ571 baboon chm promoter-CAT construction, Δ571-directed expression of the CAT gene was determined in JKras mast cells and P815 mast cells and compared with its transcriptional activity in 3T3 fibroblasts. Table I shows CAT activity in JKras mast cells, P185 mast cells, and 3T3 fibroblasts after transient transfection with the baboon chm-CAT construction Δ571.

We examined the possibility that sulfhydryl reducing agents activate transcription of cholesterol 7ä-hydroxylase. Adding dithiothreitol (DTT, 1 mM) and dexamethasone to L35 hepatoma cells increased the content of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA 3-fold above the levels observed with dexamethasone alone. Without dexamethasone, DTT had no affect. The addition of reduced glutathione to L35 cells demonstrated a similar potentiation of expression dependent on dexamethasone. Nuclear run-on assays showed that in the presence of both dexamethasone and DTT, the transcription of the 7ä-hydroxylase gene was clearly increased. In contrast, by itself, dexamethasone did not cause a detectable increase in the transcription of the 7ä-hydroxylase gene. Dexamethasone and DTT did not affect the transcription of β-actin, suggesting a selective induction of the 7ä-hydroxylase gene. DTT reversed repression of 7ä-hydroxylase expression by insulin but not the repression by phorbol ester.

We have used a unique line of rat hepatoma cells (L35 cells) to examine the molecular mechanisms regulating 7ä-hydroxylase (9Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2049-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 16Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells show the unique ability to express 7ä-hydroxylase in cultured cells at levels similar to those observed in vivo (9Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2049-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression of 7ä-hydroxylase by L35 cells is sensitive to dexamethasone (induced) and insulin (repressed)(16) in a manner similar to that which occurs in vivo. In this study, we examine the mechanism responsible for these changes. The results show that by itself, dexamethasone induces 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA expression mainly by a posttranscriptional mechanism (no detectable change in transcription). However, when presented in combination with the sulfhydryl reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), transcription of 7ä-hydroxylase was increased, resulting in an increased mRNA expression that was greater than that observed with dexamethasone alone. Hepatic levels of reduced sulfhydryl reagents may have a significant influence on 7ä-hydroxylase expression. All reagents used for biochemical techniques were purchased from Sigma, VWR, or Fisher. Enzymes for restriction or labeling of cDNA probes were purchased from New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim. Cell culture medium was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc./BRL, and serum was from Gemini. DTT and glutathione (obtained from Sigma) were stored as powdered forms (at -20°C, desiccated without exposure to light). Immediately prior to use, each agent was dissolved in culture medium to a final concentration of 1 mM. This concentration of sulfhydryl reductant was chosen based on previous studies by our laboratory and others showing that it affects the sulfhydryl redox state of the cell as shown by changes in gene expression, the secretion of specific proteins, and the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase without causing toxicity (see “Discussion”). The cDNA probes used for hybridizations have been described (3Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L35 rat hepatoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 8% serum, as described (9Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment, the medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% Nutridoma HU for 3 days. The medium was then changed to DMEM lacking serum but containing the indicated concentrations of additives (as indicated in the figure legends). When used, dexamethasone, dissolved in ethanol, was added to DMEM to a final concentration of 0.1 mM (9Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control cells received ethanol only. Cells were harvested, at the times indicated in the figure legends, by removing the culture medium and adding guanidinium isothiocyanate (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62834) Google Scholar), with modifications (16Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)-containing RNA was obtained using the miniscale oligo(dT) cellulose (Collaborative Biotech type 3) method as described (16Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA (3-10 μg of poly(A) RNA) was loaded onto 0.8% agarose, 3% formaldehyde gels (19Derman E. Krauter K. Walling L. Weinberger C. Ray M. Darnell J.E. Cell. 1981; 23: 731-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and subjected to electrophoresis. The gels were blotted onto Zetaprobe GT (Bio-Rad) nylon membranes and hybridized with nick translated cDNA probes in the conditions described for Zetaprobe by Bio-Rad. After hybridization and washing, Northern blots were exposed to storage phosphor screens of a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, Kodak Biomax MS film, or to DuPont Reflection Autoradiography film. Transcription run-on assays were performed with modifications of the procedures outlined by Ausubel et al. (17Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K., (eds) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 1, pp. 4.10.1.–4.10.10, John Wiley & Sons, New York.Google Scholar). L35 cells, cultured as described above, were harvested by scraping the cells from the plate and pelleting the cells in a Beckman GPR centrifuge at 1000 rpm using a swinging bucket rotor for 5 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was washed with cold, sterile PBS, and 2.5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM KCl, and 3.0 mM MgCl2) were added and then brought up to 5.0 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer with 0.3% Nonidet P-40. Then the tubes were incubated on ice for 5 min. The resulting nuclei were pelleted at 500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. They were washed in 5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer with 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and pelleted for 5 min at 500 rpm; then the supernatant was removed. The wash was repeated using hypotonic lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C in 100 μl of nuclear storage buffer (40% glycerol, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). The nuclear run-on transcription buffer contained 30% glycerol, 2.5 mM DTT, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 70 mM KCl, 0.25 mM each of GTP, CTP, ATP, and 100 mCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The transcription reaction was run for 15 min at 26°C and stopped by adding EDTA, tRNA, and guanidinium isothiocyanate-RNA isolation mix. After the 32P-labeled nuclear RNA was isolated and precipitated, incorporation was estimated by binding to DE81 paper (Whatman), and equal counts of each reaction hybridized to nylon-bound unlabeled cDNAs for 7ä-hydroxylase and β-actin. Hybridization was performed at 65°C in 0.015 M Tris, 0.7 M NaCl, 0.015 M EDTA, 1 × Denhardt's, 2% (w/v) Na4P2O7, 0.2% SDS, and tRNA to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, pH 7.5. After washing, the blots were exposed to DuPont Reflection Autoradiography film. When incubated with L35 cells for 48 h together with DTT (1 mM), dexamethasone increased the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase to levels that were 2-3-fold greater than the levels obtained by incubating with dexamethasone alone (Fig. 1). In contrast, DTT by itself had no effect on the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA. The increased abundance of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA caused by the combination of dexamethasone and DTT was specific, as demonstrated by no significant effect on the expression of β-actin (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the effect of DTT was not associated with any sign of toxicity. Protein synthesis, cell viability, and growth were unaffected (data not shown). These data suggest that the sulfhydryl reducing agent, DTT, potentiates the induction of 7ä-hydroxylase caused by dexamethasone. Results similar to those obtained using DTT were obtained using the natural sulfhydryl reducing agent glutathione (Fig. 2). In the presence, but not in the absence, of dexamethasone, reduced glutathione (1 mM) induced the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA up to 4-fold greater than the level obtained with dexamethasone alone. In the absence of dexamethasone, reduced glutathione did not induce 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA above that observed with culture medium alone (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the increased abundance of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA caused by glutathione was specific, as demonstrated by no significant effect on the expression of β-actin In cells cultured in the absence of either dexamethasone or DTT, the transcription of 7ä-hydroxylase was barely detectable, whereas the transcription of β-actin was clearly evident (Fig. 3). Adding DTT by itself did not induce 7ä-hydroxylase expression. Although dexamethasone by itself caused dramatic increases in the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA (Fig. 1), in three separate experiments performed on three separate occasions, its rate of transcription was similar to that of control cells. In marked contrast, adding DTT with dexamethasone increased the rate of transcription of 7ä-hydroxylase 4.5-fold above the level of control cells and cells treated with only dexamethasone (Fig. 3). It may be important to point out that in a fourth experiment of treating L35 cells with dexamethasone alone, the transcription of 7ä-hydroxylase was slightly greater than control cells. However, this rate of transcription was still less than 25% of cells treated with dexamethasone and DTT (data not shown). Neither dexamethasone nor DTT (separately or together) affected the transcription of β-actin. Previous studies show that once induced by dexamethasone, L35 cells maintain an expression of 7ä-hydroxylase in the absence of dexamethasone for at least 48 h, the longest time period examined (16Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This apparently stable expression of 7ä-hydroxylase can be reversed by either insulin or phorbol esters (16Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies by others show that insulin (20Twisk J. Hoekman M.F.M. Lehman E.M. Meijer P. Mager W.H. Princen H.M.G. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar) and phorbol esters (21Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1359-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) both repress 7ä-hydroxylase by blocking transcription. In the absence of DTT, insulin repressed the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase but had no effect on the expression of β-actin (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of DTT, insulin had no significant effect on the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase or β-actin (Fig. 4). Moreover, either in the presence or absence of insulin, DTT in combination with dexamethasone caused the same degree of induction of 7ä-hydroxylase (Fig. 4). DTT did not affect the ability of insulin to increase protein synthesis (as determined by the incorporation of [35S]methionine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein (data not shown)). Similar data were obtained using reduced glutathione (1 mM)(data not shown). In contrast to the blocking insulin repression of 7ä-hydroxylase, DTT had no effect on the repression caused by phorbol esters (Fig. 5). Both in the absence and presence of DTT, phorbol esters repressed the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase (Fig. 5). Our results show that DTT affects the ability of dexamethasone and insulin to alter the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase. In contrast, DTT by itself has no affect on 7ä-hydroxylase expression. Furthermore, DTT did not affect the ability of phorbol esters to repress 7ä-hydroxylase. Additional data demonstrated that the effect of DTT could be recapitulated with the endogenous sulfhydryl reducing agent glutathione (22Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5866) Google Scholar). Together, our data indicate that in the unique hepatoma cell line (L35 cells), the relative concentration of sulfhydryl reducing agents selectively affects the ability of hormones to alter the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA. Previous studies show that the changes in 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA levels in L35 cells correspond to parallel changes in enzyme activity (9Leighton J.K. Dueland S. Straka M.S. Trawick J. Davis R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2049-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, the changes in 7ä-hydroxylase mRNA levels in L35 cells also correspond to parallel changes in protein levels, determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The question remains as to whether our results obtained in L35 cells apply to other liver cell systems or to the in vivo situation. Although our studies are the first to show that sulfhydryl reductants affect 7ä-hydroxylase gene transcription, there are several studies that show that sulfhydryl reductants affect the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase enzyme activity, mRNA levels, and rates of bile acid synthesis in vivo (rats)(23) and in human hepatoma cells (23Hassan A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24Hassan A.S. Bunick D. St. Denis S.H. Biochem.

It is well established that hepatic levels of the natural sulfhydryl reductant glutathione are an important indicator of liver function (22Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5866) Google Scholar). Hepatic levels of glutathione change in response to liver injury, inflammation, and disease. Our results showing a significant role of sulfhydryl reductants in the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase may explain the basis for decreased levels of expression in one or more of these altered states. The level of glutathione in liver (23Hassan A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in HepG2 cells is positively correlated with bile acid synthesis (23Hassan A.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Induction of 7ä-hydroxylase was caused by altering glutathione levels (23Hassan A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 963: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and by increasing the level of L-cysteine (also a sulfhydryl donor)(26). Increased cysteine levels were related to induction of bile acid synthesis by taurine in HepG2 cells (27Stephan Z.F. Lindsey S. Hayes K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6069-6073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that in L35 cells, sulfhydryl reducing agents by themselves cannot increase transcription of 7ä-hydroxylase (Fig. 3). These cells require the addition of dexamethasone to uncover the transcriptional activation of the 7ä-hydroxylase gene. The redox state of the cell, or the addition of sulfhydryl reducing agents such as DTT, can affect several components of the transcription apparatus. The binding affinity of some transcription factors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (28Tienrungroj W. Meshinchi S. Sanchez E.R. Pratt S.E. Grippo J.F. Holmgren A. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6992-7000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), SP1 (29Ammendola R. Mesuraca M. Russo T. Cimino F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and c-Myb (30Guehmann S. Vorbrueggen G. Kalkbrenner F. Moelling K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) may be increased by the addition of DTT to cultured cells. Not only is the DNA binding affinity of thyroid transcription factor I increased by DTT addition (31Arnone M.I. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12048-12055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but so are its dimerization and activity in inducing gene expression in FRTL-5 cells (31Arnone M.I. Zannini M. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12048-12055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, DTT can activate the transcription factor NF-κB (32Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L588-L602PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in these cells, DTT had no affect on SP1 (32Das K.C. Lewis-Molock Y. White C.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L588-L602PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB also responds to reduced glutathione levels and a number of different thiols in T cells (33Mihm S. Galter D. Droge W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These effects of reducing agents on gene expression are thought to be related to physiologic responses, in at least T cells (33Mihm S. Galter D. Droge W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the liver (29Ammendola R. Mesuraca M. Russo T. Cimino F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), via the relative levels and of intracellular reduced glutathione. DTT and the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor, were antagonistic to each other in the regulation of NF-κB activity in HeLa cells, with tumor necrosis factor activating and DTT inhibiting NF-κB (34Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Regulation of NF-κB by sulfhydryl agents is mediated via I-κB phosphorylation, dissociation, and proteolysis (35Staal F.J.T. Roedere M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 36Shreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 37Roff M. Thompson J.

The expression of 7ä-hydroxylase has been shown to be negatively regulated by phorbol esters (16Trawick J.D. Lewis K.D. Dueland S. Moore G.L. Simon F.R. Davis R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 588-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stravitz R.T. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Hylemon P.B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1359-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and various cytokines including tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 (38Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol esters also decreased the level of intracellular thiols (35Staal F.J.T. Roedere M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Although based on these findings, it might be possible that phorbol esters repress 7ä-hydroxylase via a mechanism associated with reduced intracellular sulfhydryl agents; however, our finding that DTT and glutathione could not reverse the phorbol ester repression of 7ä-hydroxylase in L35 cells argues against this. An alternative mechanism that might account for reduced sulfhydryl reagents affecting the transcription of 7ä-hydroxylase is through an indirect effect mediated by the secretory pathway. The activation of NF-κB occurs through proteolysis of the regulatory factor I-κB in the endoplasmic reticulum (35Staal F.J.T. Roedere M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 36Shreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar, 37Roff M. Thompson J.

DTT can alter the retention, degradation, and secretion of some proteins containing disulfide bridges by interfering with their ability to fold properly (39Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because NF-κB can be regulated by the level of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (34Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2580-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), it is possible that DTT induction of 7ä-hydroxylase might be mediated through a signal derived from the secretory pathway. This signal could affect I-κB proteolysis and/or NF-κB itself or the content of other transcription factors or gene products. NF-κB does not always act positively on its target genes; at least one gene that NF-κB represses has been identified (40Supakar P.C. Jung M.H. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 837-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Our findings showing that sulfhydryl reducing agents have a marked influence on 7ä-hydroxylase transcription and expression are analogous to those reported on the transcriptional regulation of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 (41Barker C.W. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3985-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured hepatoma cells, all three hepatic cytochrome 450s (CYP7, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2) are repressed by insulin in a manner that is reversed by sulfhydryl reducing agents. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are also repressed by inflammation (41Barker C.W. Fagan J.B. Pasco D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3985-3990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies in C57BL/6 and BALB/c inbred mice show that CYP7 is repressed by feeding a high fat diet containing cholic acid (4Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Nenseter M.S. MacPhee A.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22695-22698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In marked contrast, feeding the same diet to inbred strain C3H does not cause a repression of CYP7 (4Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Nenseter M.S. MacPhee A.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22695-22698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies show that the high fat diet containing cholic acid causes a NF-κB-induced inflammatory response in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice but not in C3H mice (42Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2488-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). This inflammatory response is associated with reduced hepatic glutathione content (42Berliner J.A. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Watson A.D. Lusis A.J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2488-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Our findings showing that sulfhydryl reducing agents block the ability of insulin to repress 7ä-hydroxylase may help to explain an apparent enigma in regard to in vivo regulation. It is well established that the expression of 7ä-hydroxylase in vivo is greatest soon after food consumption (1Myant N.B. Mitropoulos K.A. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 135-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normally, this is also when insulin levels are greatest. Our findings would predict that in the context of normal hepatic function, the hepatic content of reduced glutathione is sufficient to block insulin repression of 7ä-hydroxylase in vivo. An appreciation of our finding that sulfhydryl reducing agents have a marked influence on 7ä-hydroxylase transcription may help to delineate the molecular events through which the transcription of this important gene product is altered in response to diet and physiologic state.

https://openalex.org/W1969836866,"Previously, we demonstrated that ä-spectrin is a substrate for the ubiquitin system and that this conjugation is a dynamic process (Corsi, D., Galluzzi, L., Crinelli, R., and Magnani, M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8928-8935). In this study, we mapped the sites of ubiquitination on erythrocyte ä-spectrin. A peptide map of digested ä-spectrin, previously submitted to in vitro 125I-ubiquitin conjugation, revealed the presence of four distinct labeled bands with Mr 40,000, 36,000, 29,000, and 25,500. Western blotting experiments using antibodies against each ä-spectrin domain revealed that only IgG anti-äIII domain recognized the 125I-labeled ubiquitin peptide of 29 kDa, whereas the IgG anti-äV domain recognized the Mr 40,000 125I-ubiquitin-labeled peptide. The other two labeled bands of Mr 36,000 and Mr 25,500 were identified as tetra and tri multiubiquitin chains. Ubiquitination of the äIII and äV domains was further confirmed by anti-ä-spectrin domain immunoaffinity chromatography. Endoprotease Lys C-digested spectrin conjugated previously to 125I-ubiquitin was incubated with antibodies against each trypsin-resistant domain of ä-spectrin. Gamma counting of the radiolabeled antigen-antibody complexes purified by protein A chromatography showed labeling in the IgG anti-äIII and anti-äV complexes alone. Domain äIII is not associated with any known function, whereas domain äV contains the nucleation site for the association of the ä and β chains. Ubiquitination of the latter domain suggests a role for ubiquitin in the modulation of the stability, deformability, and viscoelastic properties of the erythrocyte membrane. Previously, we demonstrated that ä-spectrin is a substrate for the ubiquitin system and that this conjugation is a dynamic process (Corsi, D., Galluzzi, L., Crinelli, R., and Magnani, M. (1995) J.

INTRODUCTIONUbiquitin (Ub), 1The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinE1Ub activating enzymeE2Ub carrier proteinE3Ub-protein isopeptide ligasemeUbmethylated UbPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloridePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. a 76-amino acid protein, has been found both free and covalently bound to target proteins via an isopeptide linkage between the carboxyl group of the terminal glycine moiety of Ub and free ϵ amino groups on the target protein (1Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte fraction II (2Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (protein adsorbed to DEAE 52-cellulose and eluted with 0.5 M KCl) contains the enzymatic system (E1, E2 s, E3 s) that is involved in ubiquitin conjugation. Usually, a protein can have one or more sites for ubiquitin, in which one ubiquitin or multiubiquitin chains can be linked. In the latter case, one Ub is linked to the lysine 48 of another ubiquitin bound to the substrate (3Chau V. Tobias J.V. Bachmair A. Ecker C.K. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Ub-conjugated proteins can either be degraded to small peptides by a large 26 S ATP-dependent protease complex, or the Ub moiety can be removed by Ub isopeptidases, releasing ubiquitin and the intact protein (4Hersko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational process involved not only in protein degradation but also in other cellular functions. In fact, many studies have reported the in vivo presence of several stable Ub-protein conjugates that are not subject to degradation (5Finley D. Chau U. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 6Mayer R.J. Arnold J. Làszlò L. Landon M. Lowe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, another linkage in which ubiquitin is linked to a previously bound Ub involves lysine 63 of Ub, and these chains serve nonproteolytic functions (7Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In general, ubiquitin is involved in different cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation (8Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1982; 28: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), cell cycle regulation (9Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W.

Science. 1988; 231: 845-850Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In particular, in the last decade Ub has been found to be bound to many specific substrates such as lysozyme (12Hough R. Pratt G.

Commun. 1995; 213: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as well as others.Recently, we demonstrated that red blood cell ä-spectrin is also a specific substrate for ubiquitination (28Corsi D. Galluzzi L. Crinelli R. Magnani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ä- and β-spectrin are the major protein constituents of the red blood cell membrane skeleton and contribute to about 25% of total red cell membrane proteins. This membrane skeleton provides support for the overlying lipid bilayer and contributes to the viscoelastic properties and deformability of the membrane (29Cohen C.M. Semin. Hematol. 1983; 20: 141-158PubMed Google Scholar).The spectrin molecule is composed of two subunits with apparent molecular masses of 240 kDa (ä-spectrin) and 220 kDa (β-spectrin), intertwined side-to-side to form a heterodimer. The two ä and β subunits of spectrin are different not only in molecular mass but also in constitution. In fact, the ä-spectrin chain consists of series of 22 repeats of 106 residues, whereas the β chain consists of 17 repeats of 106 residues (30Bennet V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The tryptic digestion of spectrin gave evidence of a linear disposition of trypsin-resistant domains (31Speicher D.W. Morrow J.S. Knowles W.L. Marchesi V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5673-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Five domains were defined on the ä chain (äI to äV from the N terminus) and four on β chain (βI to βIV from the C terminus). The heterodimer ä-β assembly requires a specific nucleation site located in the äV and βIV domains (32Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A self-association between the N-terminal region of the ä chain and the C-terminal region of the β chain is involved in the formation of a tetramer, which is the predominant form in the erythrocyte (33Ji T.H. Kiehm D.J. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2990-2993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Moreover, spectrin forms noncovalent associations with other proteins of the cytoskeleton, such as band 2.1 (34Kennedy S. Warren S. Forget B. Morrow J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), band 4.1, and actin (35Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteins such as adducin, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, and dematin function as accessory proteins of spectrin-actin junctions and are probably involved in the stabilization of spectrin-actin complexes (36Bennet V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spectrin and protein 4.1 interact through phosphatidylserine with the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (37Rybicki A.C. Heath R. Lubin B. Schwartz R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In an attempt to gain insight into the potential biological role of ä-spectrin ubiquitination, we searched for the site(s) of ubiquitination present on ä-spectrin. The data reported in this study show that ubiquitination occurs on the äIII and äV domains of ä-spectrin, suggesting that at least ubiquitination of the äV domain can play a role in cytoskeleton stability mediated by the ä-β-spectrin nucleation site.DISCUSSIONSpectrin is the principal component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton and plays a dominant role in determining such mechanical properties of the erythrocyte as elasticity and deformability (47Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane equilibrium depends on the structural integrity of the skeletal proteins and on normal molecular interactions between the cytoskeletal proteins and membrane. Moreover, the binding of cytosolic components such as enzymes and hemoglobin to cytoskeletal proteins can play a role in membrane stability. Among the factors that may serve as regulators of cytoskeletal organization is protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (36Bennet V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). β-Spectrin has been reported to be a substrate for cytosol and membranous casein kinases. In particular, this chain contains a cluster of six phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of spectrin has been shown not to affect either dimer-dimer associations (48Ungewickell E. Gratzer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) or spectrin binding to ankyrin in vitro (49Lu P.-W. Soong C.-J. Tao M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14958-14964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation affects spectrin inextractability from “inside-out” vesicles (50Lutz H.V. Stringaro-Wipf G. Maretzki D. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1986; 8: 576-579Google Scholar) and modulates the mechanical function and stability of the intact membrane structure (51Manno S. Takakuwa Y. Nagao K. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5659-5665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Other mediators, such as Ca2+ and calmodulin, can also regulate membrane stability (52Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, free calmodulin can be ubiquitinated in a Ca2+-dependent manner and subsequently degraded, a process which could act as a control mechanism for all free calmodulin in excess (53Ziegenhagen R. Jennissen H.P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 1317-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, we described and characterized a new posttranslational modification of erythrocyte ä-spectrin in which ubiquitin binds covalently to the ä-spectrin chain (28Corsi D. Galluzzi L. Crinelli R. Magnani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).In this report, using different approaches, we demonstrate the existence of two binding sites for ubiquitin on ä-spectrin. Digestion with endoprotease Lys C of ubiquitinated spectrin revealed the presence of two 125I-Ub peptides of Mr 40,000 and 29,000. As shown by Western blotting, these radiolabeled peptides were recognized by polyclonal IgG anti-äV domain and anti-äIII domain, respectively, indicating that these two peptides are the sites of ubiquitination on red blood cell ä-spectrin. It could be speculated that ä-spectrin ubiquitination on domains III and V may play a role in membrane stability as found for other mediators of red blood cell membrane. The äIII domain is not associated to any known function, whereas the äV domain contains the nucleation site for association with the β chain (32Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is involved in Ca2+ binding (54Lundberg S. Lehto V.P. Backman L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and, with the βIV domain, participates in the interaction with actin and protein 4.1 (55Husain A. Howlett G.J. Sawyer W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 122: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the äV domain is involved in the ubiquitination of ä-spectrin and contains repeats 20 through 22, which exhibit atypical features. In fact, there is insertion of several amino acids into the repeats 20 and 21. Moreover, repeat 22 has a reduced homology to a typical spectrin repeat. Moreover, the nucleation site present in the äV domain is not only responsible for the initial ä-β spectrin binding but also controls the side-to-side register of the many homologous repeats in both subunits. An unusual feature of the nucleation regions is that three of the repeats (two in the ä and one in the β subunits) have an eight-residue insertion in the normal 106-residue repeat unit (32Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These eight-residue insertions, which contain a lysine residue, might confer unique conformational properties upon the nucleation site, and the ubiquitination of domain äV might play a role in this context. The erythroblast-to-erythrocyte maturation process is accompanied by changes in the composition and properties of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, mature erythrocytes are incapable of ubiquitin/26 S proteosome-dependent degradation (56Speiser S. Etlinger J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14122-14127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, ubiquitination of ä-spectrin could play two different roles during erythrocyte maturation. In erythroblasts, the amount of ä-spectrin synthesized exceeds by more than 3-fold the amount assembled on the membrane, and the excess unassembled peptides are rapidly degraded (57Lazarides E. Moon R.J. Cell. 1984; 37: 354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It could be speculated that the binding of ubiquitin to ä-spectrin in erythroblasts involves subsequent degradation. It is important to note that the sequence of ä-spectrin contains a glutamic residue in the first position that may act as a secondary destabilizing residue according to the N-end rule (58Varshavsky A. Cell. 1992; 69: 725-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) when spectrin is in the unassembled form. The second determinant, a specific internal lysine residue, could be the first lysine located at position 5 or 15 (domain I) of the ä-spectrin sequence. Excess hemoglobin subunits are subject to an analogous targeted degradation in thalassemia (59Shaeffer J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because, as shown in this report, ubiquitination occurs in mature red blood cells on the äIII and äV domains, and thus quite far from the äI domain (moreover, these cells are incapable of ubiquitin/26 S proteosome-dependent degradation), the ubiquitination process of assembled ä-spectrin probably has a different role in these cells than in erythroblasts. Ubiquitin itself and/or multiubiquitin chains could have a potential function as conformation-perturbing devices when conjugated to cytoskeletal proteins, given their orientational flexibility and reversibility (60Varshavsky A. Bachmair A. Finley D. Gonda D. Wünning I. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin. Plenum Press, New York1988: 287-324Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, we suggest that the ubiquitination of ä-spectrin in mature erythrocytes should be considered a new posttranslational event with a regulatory role in spectrin function rather than a signal for ä-spectrin degradation. In fact, ubiquitination is a dynamic process (28Corsi D. Galluzzi L. Crinelli R. Magnani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the linkage is covalent, and a significant amount (3% of the total ä-spectrin chain) is continuously ubiquitinated in erythrocytes. As reported previously for globin-spectrin complex formation during erythrocyte senescence (61Fortier N. Snyder L.M. Garver F. Kiefer C. McKenney J. Mohandas N. Blood. 1988; 71: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such an amount could account for a significant change in membrane deformability. We also investigated whether other proteins belonging to the spectrin superfamily are ubiquitinated. Brain ä-fodrin was not found to be a substrate for ubiquitin in an in vitro assay. This non-erythroid spectrin and erythroid ä-spectrin have very similar sequences (54% identity) throughout their entire length (62Sahr K.E. Laurila P. Kotula L. Scarpa A.L. Coupal E. Leto T.L. Linnenbach A.J. Winkelmann J.C. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Curtis P.J. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4434-4443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but interestingly, fodrin at its C-terminal has an atypical sequence of 150 residues in repeat 22 (äV domain), and the identity of the 37 residues at the very C-terminal is less than 10%. Moreover, fodrin differs considerably from erythrocyte ä-spectrin in repeats 11 and 12 (äIII domain) and possesses a calmodulin-binding site in the latter repeat that is absent in ä-spectrin (63Winkelmann J.C. Forget B.G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, erythrocyte ä-spectrin and brain fodrin differ mainly in the domains found to be susceptible to ubiquitination. It would be interesting to examine whether ä-actinin, another protein of the spectrin superfamily, is ubiquitinated. In particular, repeats 20 through 22, together with the nonrepeat C terminus of ä-spectrin, are highly homologous with the C terminus of ä-actinin (64Baron M.D. Davison M.D. Jones P. Critchley D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1987; 15: 796Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies now in progress in our laboratory indicate that ä-actinin is ubiquitinated, at least in vivo. To date, no information is available on the function of the äIII domain of ä-spectrin, but because the carboxyl terminus of the ä-spectrin subunits (äV domain) is involved in the binding of the β-spectrin chain to form the ä-β dimer and is an important site for many mediators in red blood cells, the ubiquitination of this cytoskeletal protein may be of physiological significance. INTRODUCTIONUbiquitin (Ub), 1The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinE1Ub activating enzymeE2Ub carrier proteinE3Ub-protein isopeptide ligasemeUbmethylated UbPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloridePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. a 76-amino acid protein, has been found both free and covalently bound to target proteins via an isopeptide linkage between the carboxyl group of the terminal glycine moiety of Ub and free ϵ amino groups on the target protein (1Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte fraction II (2Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (protein adsorbed to DEAE 52-cellulose and eluted with 0.5 M KCl) contains the enzymatic system (E1, E2 s, E3 s) that is involved in ubiquitin conjugation. Usually, a protein can have one or more sites for ubiquitin, in which one ubiquitin or multiubiquitin chains can be linked. In the latter case, one Ub is linked to the lysine 48 of another ubiquitin bound to the substrate (3Chau V. Tobias J.V. Bachmair A. Ecker C.K. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Ub-conjugated proteins can either be degraded to small peptides by a large 26 S ATP-dependent protease complex, or the Ub moiety can be removed by Ub isopeptidases, releasing ubiquitin and the intact protein (4Hersko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational process involved not only in protein degradation but also in other cellular functions. In fact, many studies have reported the in vivo presence of several stable Ub-protein conjugates that are not subject to degradation (5Finley D. Chau U. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 25-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 6Mayer R.J. Arnold J. Làszlò L. Landon M. Lowe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Moreover, another linkage in which ubiquitin is linked to a previously bound Ub involves lysine 63 of Ub, and these chains serve nonproteolytic functions (7Arnason T. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In general, ubiquitin is involved in different cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation (8Levinger L. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1982; 28: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), cell cycle regulation (9Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar), stress responses (10Bond U. Agell N. Haas A.L. Redman K. Schlesinger M.J. J. Biol.

Science. 1988; 231: 845-850Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In particular, in the last decade Ub has been found to be bound to many specific substrates such as lysozyme (12Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2400-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phytochrome (13Shanklin J. Jabben M. Viestra R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1995; 213: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), as well as others.Recently, we demonstrated that red blood cell ä-spectrin is also a specific substrate for ubiquitination (28Corsi D. Galluzzi L. Crinelli R. Magnani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). ä- and β-spectrin are the major protein constituents of the red blood cell membrane skeleton and contribute to about 25% of total red cell membrane proteins. This membrane skeleton provides support for the overlying lipid bilayer and contributes to the viscoelastic properties and deformability of the membrane (29Cohen C.M. Semin. Hematol. 1983; 20: 141-158PubMed Google Scholar).The spectrin molecule is composed of two subunits with apparent molecular masses of 240 kDa (ä-spectrin) and 220 kDa (β-spectrin), intertwined side-to-side to form a heterodimer. The two ä and β subunits of spectrin are different not only in molecular mass but also in constitution. In fact, the ä-spectrin chain consists of series of 22 repeats of 106 residues, whereas the β chain consists of 17 repeats of 106 residues (30Bennet V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The tryptic digestion of spectrin gave evidence of a linear disposition of trypsin-resistant domains (31Speicher D.W. Morrow J.S. Knowles W.L. Marchesi V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5673-5677Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Five domains were defined on the ä chain (äI to äV from the N terminus) and four on β chain (βI to βIV from the C terminus). The heterodimer ä-β assembly requires a specific nucleation site located in the äV and βIV domains (32Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A self-association between the N-terminal region of the ä chain and the C-terminal region of the β chain is involved in the formation of a tetramer, which is the predominant form in the erythrocyte (33Ji T.H. Kiehm D.J. Middaugh C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2990-2993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Moreover, spectrin forms noncovalent associations with other proteins of the cytoskeleton, such as band 2.1 (34Kennedy S. Warren S. Forget B. Morrow J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), band 4.1, and actin (35Cohen C.M. Gascard P. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 244-292PubMed Google Scholar). Other proteins such as adducin, tropomyosin, tropomodulin, and dematin function as accessory proteins of spectrin-actin junctions and are probably involved in the stabilization of spectrin-actin complexes (36Bennet V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spectrin and protein 4.1 interact through phosphatidylserine with the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer (37Rybicki A.C. Heath R. Lubin B. Schwartz R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In an attempt to gain insight into the potential biological role of ä-spectrin ubiquitination, we searched for the site(s) of ubiquitination present on ä-spectrin. The data reported in this study show that ubiquitination occurs on the äIII and äV domains of ä-spectrin, suggesting that at least ubiquitination of the äV domain can play a role in cytoskeleton stability mediated by the ä-β-spectrin nucleation site."
