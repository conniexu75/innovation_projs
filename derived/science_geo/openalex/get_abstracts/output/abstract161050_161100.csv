Examples include members of the Drosophila Toll (dToll) and the mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) protein families. Activation ofDrosophila Toll is believed to occur via an endogenous peptide rather than through direct binding of microbial products to the Toll protein. In mammals there is a growing consensus that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) initiates its biological activities through a heteromeric receptor complex containing CD14, TLR4, and at least one other protein, MD-2. LPS binds directly to CD14 but whether LPS then binds to TLR4 and/or MD-2 is not known. We have used transient transfection to express human TLRs, MD-2, or CD14 alone or in different combinations in HEK 293 cells. Interactions between LPS and these proteins were studied using a chemically modified, radioiodinated LPS containing a covalently linked, UV light-activated cross-linking group (125I-ASD-Re595 LPS). Here we show that LPS is cross-linked specifically to TLR4 and MD-2 only when co-expressed with CD14. These data support the contention that LPS is in close proximity to the three known proteins of its membrane receptor complex. Thus, LPS binds directly to each of the members of the tripartite LPS receptor complex.

Schromm A.B. Blunck R. Brandenburg K. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 74: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). LPS is an outer membrane constituent of all Gram-negative bacteria where it has indispensable barrier functions. LPS is also a potent activator of innate immune responses that result in the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators from myeloid lineage and other cell types (2Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). LPS-induced cell activation depends on the presence of three proteins comprising a multiprotein cell surface receptor complex here termed the LPS receptor complex. One essential protein of the LPS receptor complex is CD14 (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar), a 55-kDa glycoprotein present in soluble form (sCD14) in blood or as a membrane-bound form (mCD14) in myeloid lineage cells. This latter form is attached to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Multiple lines of biochemical and genetic evidence support the contention that CD14 principally acts to bind LPS and does not participate in signaling directly. Thus, others and we postulated that there must be at least one transmembrane protein that acts in concert with CD14 (2Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). This putative transmembrane protein is now identified as a member of the mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) family and is TLR4 (4Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4439) Google Scholar, 5Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies suggest that TLR4 plays an important role in LPS signaling under physiological conditions. Positional cloning and sequencing of the lps d locus localized the defect to the tlr4 gene (6Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.-Y. Van Huffel C. Birdwell X.D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar). The importance of TLR4 in LPS signaling is further supported by the fact that TLR4-deficient mice are LPS hyporesponsive but respond normally to products of Gram-positive organisms (7Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). MD-2 is another protein that appears to be important in LPS signaling (8Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). However, its function in the LPS receptor complex is currently unknown. TLR2 is a signaling receptor for a variety of microbial products that in some cases require CD14 for maximum activation (9Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 7-782Crossref Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). Although TLR2 was initially thought to function as an LPS receptor current evidence suggests that it does not play a major role in the physiological response to LPS (9Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 7-782Crossref Scopus (2624) Google Scholar, 10Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J.

Nonetheless a recent publication provides data showing that when TLR2 is overexpressed in 293 cells it mediates cell activation induced by a variety of purified LPS isolates (12Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It thus appears that TLR2 is more promiscuous with respect to ligand recognition and that LPS must be added to the list of TLR2 ligands. Numerous reports describe the direct binding of LPS to CD14 (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar,13Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

The question of whether LPS binds to, or even is in close proximity to the other proteins of the LPS receptor remains unanswered. Here we have used radioiodinated Re595 LPS with a covalently attached UV-activated phenylazide that is capable of cross-linking to nearby proteins in order to characterize interactions between LPS and the LPS receptor complex at the cell surface. Our results show that LPS is brought into close proximity to TLR4 only when it is present as an LPS·CD14 complex and when CD14 and TLR4 are co-expressed with MD-2. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10‥ fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. 3.5 × 106 cells in 10-cm Petri dishes were transfected using LipofectAMINE Reagent Plus (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The total amount of DNA was kept constant by supplementing pFLAG-CMV1 vector DNA (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Murine anti-human TLR4 monoclonal antibodies were from Dr. K. Miyake. The following reagents were prepared as described in the references: Re595 LPS (16Mathison J.C. Wolfson E. Ulevitch R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), rabbit LBP (17Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant human soluble CD14 (18Lee J.-D. Kravchenko V. Kirkland T.N. Han J. Mackman N. Moriarty A. Leturcq D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9930-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against CD14 (28C5, 63D3, and 18E12) were a gift from A. Moriarty and D. Leturcq (R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Escherichia coli LCD25 LPS and 0111:B4 LPS were from List Biological Labs (Campbell, CA). E. coli 055:B5 LPS was from Sigma. Protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). In order to mitigate concerns about protein contaminants the Re595 LPS was also repurified according to the methods of Hirschfeld et al. (10Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). This material was also used to prepare125I-ASD-Re595 LPS; results obtained with the125I-ASD derivative of the repurified Re595 LPS were not distinguishable from the parent LPS. Human CD14 cDNA was cloned in pRc/RSV vector as described (18Lee J.-D. Kravchenko V. Kirkland T.N. Han J. Mackman N. Moriarty A. Leturcq D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9930-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for human TLR2 and TLR4 were gifts from Drs. P. Godowski and C. Janeway, respectively. The cDNAs for Drosophila Toll and human TLR1 were gifts from Dr. Alan Aderem. FLAG-dToll was cloned in pFLAG-CMV1 using HindIII/BamHI restriction sites. Expression vectors for FLAG-MD-2 was engineered by introducing aNotI/SmaI DNA fragment into pFLAG-CMV1 plasmid, in which the prepro trypsin leader sequence precedes an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope. 293 cells cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes were transfected and harvested 2 days after transfection. Cells were washed 2 times with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.4, and 2 times with DMEM containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5‥ endotoxin-free human bovine serum albumin (Serologicals Proteins Inc., Kankakee, IL). LBP·LPS complexes were formed and utilized as previously described (19Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Kline L. Lee J.D. Kato K. Martin T.P. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3011-3021PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg/ml rLBP and 2.5 μg/ml125I-ASD-Re595 LPS were incubated in a solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, 10 min at 37 °C. LBP·LPS complexes were added to cells, incubated 10 min at 37 °C, and photolyzed with a 253-nm UV light for 4 min on ice. A typical incubation reaction contained a final concentration of 250 ng/ml 125I-ASD Re595 LPS and 2.5 μg/ml rLBP. When metabolic inhibition was specified, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in binding buffer containing 10 mm sodium azide, 2 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm deoxyglucose prior to addition of LBP·LPS complexes. Cells were washed extensively and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10‥ glycerol, 1‥ Nonidet P-40, 14 μm pepstatin A, 100 μmleupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mm sodium fluoride. After incubation for 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatants were recovered. Cell lysates were pre-cleared 3 times for 20 min at 4 °C with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads, and mixed with 30 μg of M2 monoclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Immune complexes were allowed to bind to 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight, beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and the washed beads resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 10 min. Aliquots from 20 μl of the original mixtures were separated on 12‥ SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked with 5‥ nonfat milk in blocking buffer (TBS-T, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1‥ Tween 20), and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody for 2 h and with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at ambient temperature. Specific bands were revealed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Aliquots of 80 μl of immunoprecipitates were separated on 12‥ SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and the radioactivity associated with protein was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Each experiment described here was performed at least three times. Here we show individual representative experimental data. 293 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates, and transfected with the indicated plasmids together with pEGFP-N3 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) for 2 days. Subsequently, cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1‥ fetal calf serum and 0.1‥ NaN3 and incubated with anti-FLAG or HTA125 (10 μg/ml each) for 45 min at 4 °C. After 2 washes, cells were labeled for 45 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Cells were then washed twice and analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). HEK 293 cells were transfected with various combinations of DNA encoding wild-type human CD14 and epitope-tagged (FLAG) versions of TLR4 and MD-2. Two days after transfection the cells were washed and exposed to a preformed complex of LBP and 125I-ASD-Re595 LPS as described (19Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Kline L. Lee J.D. Kato K. Martin T.P. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3011-3021PubMed Google Scholar). After photolysis, cells were lysed and the lysates treated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The resultant immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE first to reveal radioactive bands by phosphorimaging (top panels) and then to determine TLR4 and MD-2 protein expression (bottom panels) by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Evidence for LPS cross-linking to TLR4 and MD-2 was obtained by the radiolabeled protein bands noted only when CD14 was expressed (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). We failed to observe binding of LPS to TLR4 or MD-2 when expressed alone (lanes 2 and 4, respectively) or in combination with CD14 (lanes 3 and 5). When TLR4 and MD-2 were expressed together a barely detectable band corresponding to MD-2 was found (lane 6). In dose-response studies, not shown, identical labeling patterns were observed even when we reduced the input LPS concentration to as low as 10 ng/ml. Unless otherwise noted all experiments were done with 250 ng/ml 125I-ASD-Re595 LPS. Western blotting revealed similar levels of expressed proteins. MD-2 appears as two species characterized by faster and slower migrating forms due to differential glycosylation patterns. 2J. da Silva and R. J. Ulevitch, manuscript in preparation. Although CD14 does not contain an epitope tag we were unable to fully eliminate it from anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates despite a pre-clear step and extensive washing. Several lines of evidence suggest this reflects a minor amount of nonspecific carryover in the immunoprecipitates. First, quantitation of the amount of bound LPS showed that LPS bound to TLR4 and MD-2 represented less than 0.1‥ of total LPS bound to the CD14·TLR4·MD-2 complex. The remainder is bound to CD14 or other proteins. This is not surprising given the major function of CD14 to bind and internalize LPS in a high capacity manner. Second, analysis of whole cell lysates only revealed the presence of LPS bound to CD14 whereas immunoprecipitation was required to reveal LPS bound to TLR4 and MD-2 (data not shown). Both mCD14 and sCD14 function to enhance cellular responses to LPS (3Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). We next examined whether sCD14 could substitute for mCD14 in facilitating LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2. 293 cells were transfected with TLR4 and MD-2 either alone or in combination. The cells were then harvested, extensively washed, and exposed to the preformed LBP·LPS complex plus sCD14; sCD14 mediated LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 only when both proteins were co-expressed (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). No labeling of TLR4 or MD-2 was noted when these proteins are expressed alone (lanes 2 and 3). These data suggest that LPS was delivered from an LBP·LPS complex to a TLR4·MD-2 complex in a CD14-dependent manner. To determine whether any other member of the TLR family would bind LPS in a CD14 and MD-2 dependent fashion, experiments were carried out with cells expressing TLR4, TLR1, or dToll. 293 cells were transfected with MD-2 and CD14 either in the presence of TLR4, TLR1, or dToll. Fig.2 A shows a specific binding of LPS only to TLR4. No binding to TLR1 or dToll could be observed under identical experimental conditions. Expression of each of the proteins was evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel) and flow cytometry (Fig. 2 B). TLR4 and MD-2 were clearly detectable at cell surface of 293 cells when expressed alone using HTA125, a monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody, or with anti-FLAG antibody. The co-expression of TLR4 with MD-2 dramatically enhanced the fluorescence intensity of TLR4. This effect was observed with either anti-FLAG or HTA125 antibody. Moreover it was dependent on MD-2, since the introduction of CD14 in the absence of MD-2 had no effect on the fluorescence staining of TLR4 (data not shown). Both TLR1 and dToll were expressed at cell surface as shown in Fig. 2 B(bottom panels). Unlike our observations with TLR4, co-expression with MD-2 did not modify cell surface expression of TLR1 or dToll (data not shown). TLR2 had been reported to be a receptor for Gram-negative LPS (23Kirschning C.J. Wesche H. Ayres T.M. Rothe M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 24Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Xie M.H. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J. Nature. 1998; 395: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). However, these observations resulted in part from trace contaminants present in the LPS isolates (10Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar, 25Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). On the other hand recent work of Dziarski et al. (12Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that TLR2 can recognize some forms of purified, protein-free LPS including that of Re595 LPS. As part as our exploration of the specificity of the labeling reaction we asked whether Re595 LPS might also be brought into close proximity with TLR2 and if so whether CD14 and MD-2 are involved. We observed cross-linking of Re595 LPS to TLR2 in the absence of CD14 and MD-2 (Fig. 3, lane 2). We noted that co-expression of CD14 somewhat enhanced the amount of LPS bound to TLR2 (lane 3). In contrast to our findings with TLR4, co-expression of MD-2 had no detectable influence on Re595 LPS cross-linking to TLR2 whether or not CD14 was present (lanes 4 and 5). Moreover, we failed to observe any detectable binding of Re595 LPS to MD-2 regardless of whether TLR2 and/or CD14 were expressed. TLR2 protein expression level was constant in each of the conditions considered in this experiment (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel) and by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, and in contrast to findings with TLR4, expression of MD-2 failed to enhance cell surface expression of TLR2 (not shown). Others recently showed that co-expression of TLR2 and MD-2 resulted in increased total expression of each protein in cell lysates when compared with the levels detected with each expressed individually (12Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, the latter study did not determine the surface expression levels so we cannot directly compare our findings. In order to be certain of the purity of the LPS used in our studies we re-extracted Re595 LPS according to the methods described in Hirschfeldet al. (10Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). We used the repurified LPS to prepare the radioiodinated derivative for cross-linking studies. The derivatized, repurified Re595 LPS behaved identically in all experiments including the findings of cross-linking to TLR2 as noted above (data not shown). Thus it is virtually certain that the results we describe here with the derivatized Re595 LPS solely reflect interactions of LPS and not protein contaminants with cell surface proteins. Binding of LPS to CD14 has been shown to be independent of cellular energy metabolism (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next investigated cellular energy requirements for LPS binding to MD-2 and TLR4. To do this we compared CD14-dependent binding of Re595 LPS to TLR4 and MD-2 expressed in 293 cells; LPS was added to the cells in the presence and absence of metabolic inhibitors (Fig. 4). Addition of sodium azide, sodium fluoride, and 2-deoxyglucose failed to prevent Re595 LPS cross-linking to TLR4·MD-2. Thus transfer of LPS from CD14 to the TLR4·MD-2 complex does not require cellular energy. Similar results were observed with TLR2. The lipid A moiety has been identified as the LPS component responsible for LPS-induced biological effects through direct interaction with CD14 (1Seydel U. Schromm A.B. Blunck R. Brandenburg K. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 74: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 is a lipid A-dependent phenomenon, competition experiments were carried out in 293 cells transfected with CD14, TLR4, and MD-2. Cells were preincubated with an excess of various LPS isolates, a partial lipid A structure known as lipid IVa (27Lynn W.A. Golenbock D.T. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and lipoteichoic acid for 3 min prior to the addition of 125I-ASD-Re595 LPS (Fig.5). All LPS from E. coliserotypes tested, 0111:B4, 055:B5, and LCD25, inhibited binding of Re595 LPS. The different LPS isolates as well as lipid IVa blocked LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, lipoteichoic acid did not alter Re595 LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2. Others have suggested that lipoteichoic acid is a ligand for TLR2 (28Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17406-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 29Aliprantis A.O. Yang R.-B. Mark M.R. Suggett S. Devaux B. Radolf J.D. Klimpel G.R. Godowski P.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data support the contention that the interactions between Re595 LPS and CD14·TLR4·MD-2 are lipid A-dependent. To further confirm the importance of CD14 in transfer of LPS to the TLR4·MD-2 complex, we evaluated 125I-ASD-Re595 LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 in the absence or presence of various anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 6). Three monoclonal antibodies were used; 28C5 known to prevent LPS binding to both mCD14 and sCD14 (31Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), 18E12 an antibody which prevents LPS-induced cell activation but does not block LPS binding to CD14 (26Kirkland T.N.

Pretreatment with 28C5 markedly inhibited LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2. Treatment with 18E12 did not prevent LPS binding to TLR4 and slightly enhanced binding to MD-2. The antibody 63D3 slightly decreased cross-linking to TLR4 and MD-2. In totality these results suggest that binding of LPS to CD14 is essential for the subsequent step(s) that facilitate interactions of LPS with TLR4 and MD-2. Interestingly 18E12, an anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibody that prevents cell activation without blocking LPS binding to CD14 did not prevent LPS interactions with other members of the receptor complex. This suggests that additional steps subsequent to LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 are required for cell activation. Further support for this concept derives from studies with anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibodies. Of the four monoclonal antibodies available to us, HTA405, HTA414, and HTA1216 all strongly inhibited LPS-induced TNF and IL-8 release from blood cells (25Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). One, HTA125, failed to show the inhibitory activity in the same assay system (data not shown). Thus we used these antibodies to see whether they could modulate LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2. Surprisingly none of the inhibitory antibodies reduced radiolabeling of TLR4 or MD-2. One of the three blocking antibodies, HTA405, reduced the radiolabeling by about 30‥ (data not shown) suggesting it may react at or near an LPS-binding site of TLR4. Here we have used a radioiodinated derivative of Re595 LPS substituted with a UV-activated phenylazide to determine whether, after binding to CD14, we could detect cross-linking of Re595 LPS to other proteins in the putative LPS receptor complex. Using this approach we showed that after binding to CD14, Re595 LPS is in close enough proximity to both TLR4 and MD-2 that cross-linking occurred. These interactions do not require cellular energy, but are strikingly facilitated by CD14, as in cellular activation. Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies that block LPS binding to CD14 prevent the subsequent interactions with TLR4 and MD-2. Interestingly anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibodies that inhibit LPS-induced cell activation do not prevent LPS binding to CD14, TLR4, or MD-2. Altogether these data suggest that LPS binds directly to proteins in the LPS membrane receptor complex but that binding to TLR4 and/or MD-2 is not sufficient to induce cell activation. Other steps such as protein oligomerization or involvement of another member of the LPS receptor complex may be required to induce transmembrane signaling. In this study we used HEK 293 cells since they do not express endogenous TLR4, MD-2, or CD14. Through transient transfection we were able to control expression levels of each of the three components of LPS receptor, particularly of TLR4 that was reported to be expressed at very low levels in most cells (11Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 33Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this cell system allowed us to detect TLR4 and MD-2 as epitope-tagged proteins thereby enriching their concentrations in immunoprecipitates and facilitating detection by Western blotting. Thus the epitope-tagged proteins are essential for detection of cross-linking. Previous studies failed to demonstrate binding to proteins other than CD14 at the cell surface presumably as a result of the low levels of surface expression of TLR4 and MD-2 (19Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Kline L. Lee J.D. Kato K. Martin T.P. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3011-3021PubMed Google Scholar, 34Akashi S. Ogata H. Kirikae F. Kirikae T. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Shimazu R. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 readily occurred only in the presence of the ternary complex composed of CD14, TLR4, and MD-2. As expected, CD14 represents the major binding site on the cell surface since it contained more than 98‥ of total radioactive LPS bound to the cell. Our data suggest that only a small fraction of the LPS bound to CD14 is transferred to TLR4. This observation is reminiscent of the results of Gegner et al. (31Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) who showed that most of the cellular CD14-associated LPS appeared not to be involved in cellular activation. Unfortunately the present system only provides qualitative binding data and detailed analyses of affinities will require the development of more precise analytical approaches. The mechanism by which TLR4 transduces LPS signaling across the plasma membrane is not known. Our observations suggest a complex mechanism for activation of cells by LPS. LPS is transferred from a CD14·LBP complex to a TLR4·MD-2 complex at cell surface. Several lines of evidence support this model. First, LPS binds efficiently to TLR4 and MD-2 only in the presence of CD14. Although MD-2 and TLR4 were both strongly detected at cell surface of cells when co-expressed as shown by FACS analysis, only faint binding of LPS to either protein could be observed in the absence of CD14. CD14 can be present either on the cell surface as a membrane-bound protein, or added to the cells as a soluble form. Second, 28C5, an anti-CD14 antibody that has been shown to mask the LPS-binding site on CD14, strongly abolishes LPS binding not only to CD14, but also to TLR4 and MD-2. Thus there is a critical role of CD14 in delivering LPS to TLR4 and MD-2. Finally, LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 was not affected in the presence of a mixture of metabolic inhibitors suggesting that transfer of LPS takes place at the plasma membrane. The exact role of LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2 with respect to signal transduction is not yet clear. Surprisingly the anti-CD14 monoclonal 18E12 known to block LPS-induced cell activation without preventing binding of LPS to CD14 (26Kirkland T.N. Finley F. Leturcq D. Moriarty A. Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24818-24823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failed to prevent LPS binding to TLR4 and MD-2. Moreover inhibitory anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibodies had a limited or no effect of LPS binding to TLR4 or MD-2. One interpretation of these data is that TLR4 has different domains in the ectodomain; an LPS-binding site, an activation domain, and regions involved in protein-protein interaction with TLR4 itself, MD-2 and/or CD14. It is likely that oligomerization of TLR4 occurs following interactions with LPS. Similarly, Poltorak et al. (33Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) have also argued that LPS binds to TLR4 and initiates subsequent oligomerization required for cell activation. While biochemical and genetic studies establish a role of TLR2 as a receptor for lipoproteins and peptidoglycan from diverse Gram-positive bacteria (28Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H. Rothe M.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). It does appear, however, that purified LPS is capable of activating cells overexpressing TLR2 in the presence of MD-2 (12Dziarski R. Wang Q. Miyake K. Kirschning C.J. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that γδ T cells as well as macrophages derived from C3H/HeJ mice respond to LPS from E. coli andPorphyromonas gingivalis and lipid A specifically through TLR2 (37Mokuno Y. Matsuguchi T. Takano M. Nishimura H. Washizu J. Ogawa T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nimura Y. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 38Hirschfeld M.

Here we show that LPS and TLR2 are capable of interacting as evidenced by the finding of radiolabeled TLR2 following exposure to the derivatized Re595 LPS. However, in contrast to our findings with TLR4, co-expression of MD-2 failed to influence these interactions. It is important to emphasize that we could not detect any cross-linked products when other members of the Toll family, dToll or TLR1, were expressed at the surface of 293 cells even when co-expressed with CD14 and MD-2. Thus we are confident that the cross-linked products detected in cells expressing TLR4 or TLR2 reflect specific LPS interactions with proteins functioning as receptors. Previous studies suggested an essential role for MD-2 in determining cellular responses to LPS (39Yang H. Young D.W. Gusovsky F. Chow J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20861-20866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). No data were provided to suggest a mechanism for MD-2 function. Here we show that MD-2 is essential to detect LPS binding to TLR4, a step that can be assumed to be essential in the activation pathway. Information about a related protein MD-1 may provide some insight into how MD-2 functions. MD-1 is a secreted protein that binds to a protein known as RP105, a member of Toll receptor family that is specifically expressed on B-lymphocytes (40Miyake K. Shimazu R. Kondo J. Niki T. Akashi S. Ogata H. Yamashita Y. Miura Y. Kimoto M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1348-1353PubMed Google Scholar,41Miura Y. Shimazu R. Miyake K. Akashi S. Ogata H. Yamashita Y. Narisawa Y. Kimoto M. Blood. 1998; 92: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MD-1 is thought to control expression of RP105 at the cell surface. Shimazu and co-workers (8Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar) have reported that MD-2 is not expressed on the cell surface of the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 in the absence of TLR4. In contrast, our flow cytometry analyses showed that MD-2 could be detected at the cell surface of 293 cells in the absence of TLR4. TLR4 was also present, although weakly, at cell surface when expressed alone. However, the presence of MD-2 dramatically enhanced cell surface-exposed TLR4. Alternatively MD-2 may complex with TLR4 and enhance reactivity with the detecting antibodies. However, since an identical enhancement was observed with anti-FLAG and HTA125, the anti-TLR4 monoclonal antibody, we feel the latter speculation is less likely. Preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown that MD-2 may interact with selected regions of the ectodomain of TLR4; studies are underway to define these interactions through mutagenesis of TLR4. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the first N-terminal hundred amino acids of TLR4, containing 5 LRRs, play a central role in binding LPS, since its deletion abolished LPS binding but not association with MD-2 (data not shown). The biochemical data we have presented together with results of others (33Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) strongly supports a model where LPS binds directly to the known proteins of the putative LPS receptor complex. This contrasts with what is believed to occur in Drosophila where products of microbial pathogens most likely do not interact directly with Toll-like proteins. An essential question that remains unanswered is how binding to TLR4 and MD-2 is linked to the generation of a transmembrane signal. We thank Dr. Germana Sanna for careful reading of the manuscript."

Nrf2 heterodimerizes with small Maf proteins, but the role of such dimers in gene induction is controversial, and other partners may exist. By using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified activating transcription factor (ATF) 4 as a potential Nrf2-interacting protein. Association between Nrf2 and ATF4 in mammalian cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, Nrf2·ATF4 dimers bound to an StRE sequence from the ho-1 gene. CdCl2, a potent inducer of HO-1, increased expression of ATF4 in mouse hepatoma cells, and detectable induction of ATF4 protein preceded that of HO-1 (30 minversus 2 h). A dominant-negative mutant of ATF4 inhibited basal and CdCl2-stimulated expression of a StRE-dependent/luciferase fusion construct (pE1-luc) in hepatoma cells but only basal expression in mammary epithelial MCF-7 cells. A dominant mutant of Nrf2 was equally inhibitory in both cell types in the presence or absence of CdCl2.

Such conditions typically elicit an adaptive response aimed at reversing this imbalance and maintaining redox homeostasis. In part, this adaptive response includes the activation of specific signaling pathways and, ultimately, the coordinate induction of a select set of genes that encode proteins with distinct activities that individually and collectively manifest antioxidant and cytoprotective functions. Central to this induction process are redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)1 and activator protein-1, arguably the two most prominent regulators of this cellular response mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 1Sen C.K.

A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) have implicated another transcription regulator, Nrf2, with a potentially significant role in the adaptive response to oxidative stress. Nrf2 belongs to the CNC-bZIP subfamily of basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors. CNC-bZIP proteins are distinguished from other bZIP subfamilies, including those composed of Jun, Fos, ATF/CREB, or Maf factors, in that they also contain a Cap'n‘Collar (CNC) structural motif homologous to a region within theDrosophila homoeotic selector protein encoded by thecap'n‘collar gene (9Mohler J. Vani K. Leung S. Epstein A. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). bZIP proteins function as obligate dimers; for example, individual Jun-Jun or Jun-Fos dimers are commonly and collectively referred to as activator protein-1 transcription factors. Sequences necessary for both dimerization and DNA binding reside within the bipartite bZIP domain. Limited but consistent observations (6Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1998; 13: 67-86Google Scholar, 8Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) suggest that under normal conditions, and as is the case for NF-κB factors, Nrf2 exists in an inactive, cytoplasm-localized state, in part or fully as a consequence of binding to the cytoskeleton-associated protein Keap1. After exposure of cells to electrophiles or oxidative stress-generating agents, the cytoplasmic retention mechanism is inactivated, and Nrf2 is transported to the nucleus by an as yet uncharacterized mechanism(s) but one that may involve protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Nrf2 (8Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, Nrf2 activates transcription of a select set of target genes by binding to distinct but very similar DNA elements, individually or alternatively referred to as the NF-E2-binding site (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the Maf recognition element (MARE, 11), the stress-response element (12Choi A.M.K. Alam J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), or the antioxidant-response element (13Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Among others, these include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in heme degradation, a catabolic pathway that leads to the production of bilirubin, a potent antioxidant; NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO), which catalyzes two-electron reduction of quinones, preventing the participation of such compounds in redox cycling and oxidative stress; γ-glutamylcysteine synthase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in glutathione biosynthesis; and glutathione S-transferase, which conjugates hydrophobic electrophiles and reactive oxygen species with glutathione. Nrf2, like other CNC/bZIP proteins and Fos family members, belongs to a sub-class of bZIP factors with leucine zipper motifs incapable of self-dimerization. Consequently, sequence-specific DNA binding and subsequent induction of target gene transcription requires association of Nrf2 with other transcription factors. In accordance with the paradigm established by NF-E2 (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), the first CNC-bZIP containing mammalian transcription factor isolated, the most prominent dimerization partners of Nrf2 are the small Maf proteins, MafF, MafG and MafK (also referred to as p18 (14Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar)). The precise function of such Nrf2·Maf dimers, however, is controversial, as they have been proposed to function as both positive (5Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and negative regulators (15Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) of ARE-dependent gene transcription. Jun-Nrf2 complexes have also been implicated as positive effectors of ARE-dependent genes (16Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Given our incomplete understanding of Nrf2 function, the propensity of bZIP proteins to form inter- and intra-family dimers (17Hai T. Curran T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3720-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar,18Vinson C.R. Hai T. Boyd S.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and of transcription factors in general to form complexes that tend to provide both diversity to, and discrimination of, genetic responses to extracellular stimuli, we reasoned that additional Nrf2-containing complexes exist intracellularly and that such complexes would likely regulate Nrf2 target gene expression. Accordingly, we have used the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure to identify proteins that associate with Nrf2. Herein, we report the identification of ATF4 as a Nrf2-interacting protein and explore the potential role of ATF4 in the regulation of one Nrf2 target gene, ho-1.

Mouse and rat ATF4 cDNAs were cloned into pEF/myc/mito and pcDNA3.1/myc-his (Invitrogen), respectively, to generate pEF/mATF4 and pCMV/rATF4. A dominant mutant of mouse ATF4 was generated by overlap extension using PCR resulting in a protein with 6 amino acid substitutions within the DNA-binding domain (292RYRQKKR298 to292GYLEAAA298). The amplification product was cloned into pEF/myc/mito to generate the plasmid (pEF/mATF4M). The dominant mutant of Jun D (pCMV/JunDM) was constructed by cloning the 591-base pair BssHII/BssHII (blunt-ended) fragment of the mouse Jun D cDNA into the vector pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene). This manipulation deletes amino acid residues 1–169 resulting in a trans-activation domain-deficient mutant of Jun D similar to one described earlier (20Hirai S.I. Ryseck R.-P. Mechta F. Bravo R.

Commun. 1995; 209: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the primer pair Nrf2-1, 5′-CACGCGTCGACTATGCGTGAATCCCAATG-3′, and Nrf2-2, 5′-TCCTCCGGATATCAGTTTTTCTTTGTAT-3′. The amplified product was digested with SalI and EcoRV restriction endonucleases (recognition sites underlined) and cloned between theSalI and StuI sites of the pDBLeu vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gdbd). The integrity of the mouse Nrf2 cDNA and production of the fusion protein was confirmed by DNA sequencing and Western blotting, respectively. The mammalian Gdbd vector, pEG, was constructed by cloning the Gdbd (residues 1–147) into pEF/myc/mito. Mouse Nrf2 sequences (aa residues 13–581 or 314–581) were subsequently cloned downstream of, and in-frame with, the Gdbd to generate pEG/Nrf2 plasmids. The “activation domain” vector (pAD) was constructed by cloning an 870-base pairBglII/HindIII (blunt-ended) fragment of mouse Nrf2 (aa 13–302) into pCMV-Tag2B. Full-length ATF3, p18 and rat ATF4, sequences were subsequently cloned into pAD in-frame with the Nrf2 sequence. pFRluc, containing 5 tandem copies of the Gal4-binding site, was obtained from Stratagene. The construction of pE1-luc, containing the mouse ho-1 gene distal enhancer 1, and pStREluc, containing three copies of the mouseho-1 StRE3, has been described previously (4Alam J. Stewart D.

Screening was carried out using the Y2H system from Life Technologies, Inc. Briefly, plasmid pDBLeu-Nrf2 was introduced into yeast strain MaV203 (MATα, leu2-3, 112,trp1-901, his3Δ200, ade2-101,gal4Δ, gal80Δ,SPAL10::URA3,GAL1::lacZ,HIS UAS GAL1 ::HIS[email protected]LYS2,can1R, cyh2R), and transformants were selected and purified on medium lacking leucine. Subsequently, DNA representing rat brain or liver cDNAs, cloned into the Gal4 activation domain vector pPC86, was transformed into MaV203/pDBLeu-Nrf2 strain. Transformants were selected on medium containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole but lacking tryptophan, leucine, uracil, and histidine. Positive colonies were assayed for activation of the lacZ reporter gene. Plasmids isolated from the positive colonies were rescued in E. coliHD10B and re-assayed for interaction activity by transformation into the MaV203/pDBLeu-Nrf2 strain and growth on selection media. The 5′ end of the rat ATF4 cDNA was isolated by PCR amplification (5′-rapid amplification from cDNA ends) from a rat brain Marathon-Ready cDNA mixture (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendation using two different gene-specific primers ATF4-1 (5′-TAGGACTCAGGGCTCATACAGATGCCA-3′) and ATF4-2 (5′- TTGAAGTGCTTGGCCACCTCCAGATAG-3′) and the adaptor primer provided in the kit. Both amplification products were purified and cloned into the pT-Adv vector (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc). Automated DNA sequence analysis was carried out by the Howard hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer/W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Identical 5′ sequences were obtained from clones derived from both amplification products. COS-7 (African green monkey kidney), Hepa (mouse hepatoma), and MCF-7 (human mammary epithelial) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, whereas HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium. All media were supplemented with 0.45% glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 10 ng/ml insulin (MCF-7 only). Transient transfection of luciferase constructs was carried out by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (23Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Additional details are provided in the figure legends. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with pCMV/β-gal. Preparation of cell extract and measurement of luciferase activity were carried out as described previously (24Alam J. Zhining D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21894-21900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light (Tropix, Inc.) chemiluminescent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length (p18, Fos B, and ATF3) or nearly full-length (mATF4, residues 31–349) coding regions were cloned downstream of, and in-frame with, the hexa-histidine tag in the T7 RNA polymerase-based prokaryotic expression vector series pET30a–c (Novagen Inc.). Recombinant proteins were purified from inclusion bodies by nickel affinity chromatography as per the manufacturer's protocol or according to the protocol of Holzinger et al. (25Holzinger A. Phillips K.S. Weaver T.E. BioTechniques. 1996; 20: 804-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nrf2M protein (residues 393–581), containing the DNA binding and leucine zipper dimerization domains, was synthesized by coupledin vitro transcription and translation reaction as described previously (26Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M.K. Burrow M.E. Tou J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). EMSA was carried out as described previously (23Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-TTTTCTGCTGAGTCAAGGTCCG-3′ (core StRE underlined) as probe. Five μl of Nrf2M synthesis product and/or 100 ng of recombinant protein were used in EMSA reactions. COS-7 cells were transfected 24 h after plating (1 × 106/100-mm plate) with a total of 5 μg of either empty vector (pEF/myc/mito), pEF/mATF4, pEF/Nrf2, or a combination of these plasmids using Lipofectin transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as specified by the manufacturer. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation was carried out with 100 μg of cell lysate using protein G-agarose beads as described (27Yang H. Jiang D. Li W. Liang J. Gentry L.E. Brattain M.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1901-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were eluted from the beads with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (4Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). All antibodies were used at dilutions recommended by the respective suppliers. To identify proteins that interact with Nrf2, a cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal portion of mouse Nrf2 was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame and downstream of the Gdbd. The resulting fusion protein was used as “bait” in a yeast two-hybrid screening assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” From a total of 2 × 106 yeast transformants, harboring either rat brain or liver cDNA/Gal4 activation domain fusions, seven independent clones (3 liver and 4 brain) that encoded Nrf2-interacting polypeptides were identified after a series of selection methods. The nucleotide sequences of the inserts within the positive clones were determined, and the results indicated that five of the cDNAs were derived from the same mRNA. A sequence similarity search using “blastn” revealed significant similarities to sequences encoding mouse ATF4 and human CREB2 (ATF4) (28Hai T. Liu F. Coukos W.J. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 29Karpinski B.A. Morle G.D. Huggenvik J. Uhler M.D. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4820-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) suggesting that these clones encoded the rat homolog of ATF4. Since none of the isolates contained the initiation codon, the full-length ATF4 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from a rat brain cDNA library, cloned, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. The deduced amino acid sequence of rat ATF4 is aligned with those of mouse and human ATF4 in Fig. 1. Between these three species, ATF4 exhibits 84.4% sequence conservation and the rat protein displays 94.8 and 87.2% sequence identity to mouse and human ATF4 s, respectively. As expected, the highest degree of conservation is observed within the basic region (DNA binding) and the adjacent leucine zipper (dimerization) domains. The second “leucine zipper” region, to which a function has yet to be assigned, exhibits greater divergence although the repeating leucine (or corresponding) residues at every 7th position are completely conserved in the three proteins. Association between Nrf2 and ATF4 in mammalian cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and mammalian two-hybrid assays. For the former, expression plasmids encoding ATF4 or Nrf2 were transfected, individually or in combination, into COS-7 cells; the cells were lysed, and the lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-ATF4 or anti-Nrf2 antibodies in the presence or absence of the corresponding blocking peptide. Immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, Nrf2 was not detected in lysates of cells transfected with an empty vector (lane 3) or the ATF4 expression plasmid (lane 6), but was readily observed in lysates of cells transfected with both ATF4 and Nrf2 expression plasmids (lane 4). More importantly, Nrf2 could be immunoprecipitated with anti-ATF4 antibodies (lane 2), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed with anti-Nrf2 antibodies (lane 1). Immunoprecipitation of Nrf2 by both antibodies was abrogated in the presence of the corresponding blocking peptides (lanes 5and 7). The results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments were corroborated by mammalian two-hybrid assays. In these experiments, nearly full-length mouse Nrf2 (aa 13–581; Fig.3 A) or the C-terminal portion of Nrf2 (aa 314–581; Fig. 3 B) was fused to the Gdbd, and these fusions served as interaction targets. Sequences encoding test proteins were fused in-frame to an N-terminal region of Nrf2 (amino acids 13–302) that contains a potent transcription activation domain (AD). Gdbd-Nrf2-(13–581) stronglytrans-activated a luciferase reporter gene under the control of Gal4-binding sites, pFRluc. Co-expression of Nrf2 AD further increased luciferase activity by 4–5-fold suggesting self-interaction between Nrf2 proteins. AD fusions containing full-length rat ATF4 or mouse ATF3 exhibited even greater trans-activation capabilities, ∼35-fold above control and 7-fold above AD alone. The MafK (p18) fusion served as a positive control and exhibited the highest interaction activity. Gdbd-Nrf2-(314–581) contains the DNA interaction and dimerization (i.e. bZIP) domains but is transcriptionally inactive. Co-expression of AD did not stimulate luciferase activity suggesting that Nrf2 self-interaction is limited to the N-terminal portion of Nrf2. ATF3, ATF4, and p18 interacted with Gdbd-Nrf2-(314–581) with the following rank order: p18 ≫ ATF4 ≫ ATF3. Presumably these interactions reflect dimerization between leucine zipper domains. Relative to p18, ATF4 exhibits greater association with Gdbd-Nrf2-(13–581) than with Gdbd-Nrf2 (314) (∼40% versus 5%), even though the latter is produced at higher levels intracellularly (data not shown). To understand the consequence of ATF4/Nrf2 interaction on gene regulation, we initially examined the binding of ATF4 and Nrf2, individually or as a mixture, to the StRE, a cis-acting element known to regulate inducer-mediated ho-1 gene activation in an Nrf2-dependent manner (4Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 22Inamdar N.M. Ahn Y.I. Alam J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 26Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M.K. Burrow M.E. Tou J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). As expected, Nrf2 did not bind to the StRE (Fig.4). ATF4 alone also did not bind to the StRE but, in the presence of Nrf2, exhibited significant binding. Presumably, this DNA-protein interaction reflects the activity of ATF4·Nrf2 dimers. p18, which can form homodimers and highly stable heterodimers with Nrf2 was used as a positive control for protein dimerization and DNA binding. p18 homodimers, which are known to interact with MARE and NF-E2 binding sites, also bound to the StRE, but the strongest binding was observed with p18·Nrf2 heterodimers. The relative affinities (and/or stability) of ATF4·Nrf2 dimers and p18·Nrf2 dimers for the StRE correlated with the relative affinities of protein-protein interactions observed in the mammalian two-hybrid assays. FosB, which cannot form homodimers and would not be expected to dimerize with Nrf2, served as a negative control and did not exhibit specific binding in the absence or presence of Nrf2. Unlike ATF4, recombinant ATF3, presumably ATF3 homodimers, bound weakly to the StRE, but the binding was decreased in the presence of Nrf2. Binding of ATF4·Nrf2 dimers to the StRE suggested a role for ATF4 inho-1 gene regulation. This potential function was investigated further by examining the ability of ATF4 totrans-activate the ho-1 enhancer, E1, in the reporter construct pE1-luc. In Hepa cells, co-transfection of an ATF4 expression plasmid, up to the maximum level tested, decreased basal pE1-luc expression by 20–25% (Fig. 5). ATF4, however, had a synergistic effect on Nrf2-dependent pE1-luc expression, increasing luciferase activity up to 2-fold. In contrast, co-expression of p18 dramatically inhibited Nrf2-mediated trans-activation of E1. This inhibition may, at least in part, be attributed to p18 homodimers as overexpression of p18 alone also inhibited basal pE1-luc expression. Previous studies from our laboratory (4Alam J.

To determine the role, if any, of ATF4 in this process, we first examined the effect of cadmium, a known HO-1 stimulant, on ATF4 expression as earlier reports had suggested that ATF4 is a stress-response protein (30Estes S.D.

RANKL is highly expressed in areas of trabecular bone remodeling and inflammatory bone loss, is increased on marrow stromal cells or osteoblasts by osteotropic hormones or cytokines, and is neutralized by osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor also crucial for preventing arterial calcification. Vascular endothelial cells (VEC) are critically involved in bone development and remodeling and influence OC recruitment, formation, and activity. Although OCs develop and function in close association with bone VEC and sinusoids, signals mediating their interactions are not well known. Here, we show for the first time that human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) express transcripts for both RANKL and OPG; inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1α elevate RANKL and OPG expression 5–40-fold in HMVEC (with an early OPG peak that declines as RANKL rises), and RANKL protein increases on the surface of tumor necrosis factor-α-activated HMVEC. Cytokine-activated HMVEC promoted the formation, fusion, and bone resorption of OCs formed in co-cultures with circulating human monocytic precursors via a RANKL-mediated mechanism fully antagonized by exogenous OPG. Furthermore, paraffin sections of human osteoporotic fractured bone exhibited increased RANKL immunostaining in vivo on VEC located near resorbing OCs in regions undergoing active bone turnover.

OPG production by OB and BMSC is regulated by calcitropic hormones and cytokines, and the balance in the ratio of RANKL to OPG critically determines net effects on OC development and bone resorption (1Hofbauer L.

In vivoadministration of OPG to normal rats reduces osteoclastogenesis and increases bone density, OPG prevents estrogen deficiency-associated bone loss in ovariectomized animals, and transgenic mice overexpressing OPG exhibit increased bone density and severe osteopetrosis (15Simonet W.

Conversely, mice deficient in OPG display increased OC development and activity, early onset osteoporosis, and arterial calcification (17Bucay N. Sarosi I. Dunstan C. Morony S. Tarpley J.

Thus, OPG has been proposed to regulate bone resorption both locally and systemically, as well as to serve as a physiological suppressive signal of local calcification in blood vessels (2Filvaroff E.

Vascular endothelial cells (VEC) are intimately associated with pre-OC and OC during both their formation and resorption of bone (19Collin-Osdoby P. J. Cell.

This close physical interaction permits VEC to influence directly and convey local and systemic regulatory signals for OC development and bone remodeling under normal or pathological conditions (19Collin-Osdoby P.

Circulating pre-OC may therefore also be exposed to and potentially activated by signaling molecules displayed on the VEC surface during and following their transmigration across the VEC layer of blood vessels in response to local stimulatory signals to reach the bone microenvironment. Although all OCs develop and function in close association with the VEC and sinusoids of bone, specific signals mediating interactions between these cells are not well known. Because VEC function as primary immune response cells that are potently activated by TNF-α and IL-1 (27Cines D. Pollak E. Buck C. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G. McEver R. Pober J. Wick T. Konkle B. Schwartz B. Barnathan E. McCrae K. Hug B. Schmidt A. Stern D. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561PubMed Google Scholar,28Mantovani A. Bussolino F. Dejana E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), we investigated whether primary human VEC expressed RANKL and/or OPG, and if such expression was regulated by these or other pro-resorptive stimuli. The functional consequences of RANKL expression and regulation in HMVEC were assessed relative to the in vitro development and activity of multinucleated bone-resorptive OCs from precursors present in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations. Primary HMVEC of normal adult female dermal tissue origin, media (essential growth medium-microvascular, EGM-MV, and essential basal medium, EBM), and media supplements (packaged as SingleQuots containing human recombinant epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, gentamicin, bovine brain extract, and fetal bovine serum, FBS) were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). HMVEC were grown, subcultured by trypsin/EDTA, and used within 4 passages as recommended. HMVEC expressed all the hallmark characteristics of endothelial cells (morphology, tubule formation, acetylated low density lipoprotein uptake, factor VIII expression, PECAM-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ELAM-1, P-selectin, ACE, vimentin, and no smooth muscle α-actin). For molecular analyses, HMVEC were cultured to near confluence in 24-well dishes in EGM-MV complete medium (with supplements and 5% FBS); modulators were administered the next day in fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for the times indicated before RNA was harvested. For withdrawal experiments, the modulator medium was removed after the induction period, the cells were rinsed twice briefly with fresh medium, and the cells were cultured in medium without modulator for various times before RNA was harvested. Cytokine release by HMVEC was evaluated in cells grown to near confluence in EGM-MV complete medium and switched to phenol red-free EBM (lacking supplements) plus 5% FBS for 16–24 h before modulators were administered in fresh medium. The conditioned medium (briefly centrifuged) and cells were harvested after 24 h and stored at −80 °C until analyzed for cytokine and protein levels, respectively. Modulators used were 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3, a gift of Hoffmann-La Roche), dexamethasone (Dex), and human parathyroid hormone-(1–34) (PTH-(1–34); both from Sigma), and human recombinant cytokines TNF-α, IL-1α, and M-CSF (all from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Primary human osteoblasts (HOB) were obtained as cultured outgrowth cells from trabecular bone explants according to the Robey/Termine method as described previously (29Chaudhary L. Cheng S.-L. Avioli L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 156: 69-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) were isolated from discarded thoracic rib surgical specimens or bone obtained from accident victims and cultured in α-MEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Life Technologies, Inc.), with or without Dex (100 nm) and VD3 (10 nm) to promote a more OB-like phenotype as described previously (29Chaudhary L. Cheng S.-L. Avioli L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 156: 69-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cheng S.-L. Yang J. Rifas L. Zhang S.-F. Avioli L. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from cells using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplification for RANKL was performed using forward and reverse primers (designed by Drs. N. Weitzmann and L. Rifas, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) to the extracellular region of OPGL/TRANCE/RANKL (nucleotides 4–735) of cloned human TRANCE (nucleotides 1–738, GenBankTM accession number AF013171) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ready-to-Go RT-PCR beads. Oligonucleotide primers were as follows: forward, 5′-GCTCTAGAGCCATGGATCCTAATAGAAT-3′, and reverse 5′-ATCTCGAGTCACTATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGATCTATATCTCGAACTTTAAAAGCC-3′. RT-PCR amplification for OPG was performed using forward and reverse primers to cloned human OPG (GenBankTM accession numberU94332) as follows: forward, 5′-GGGGACCACAATGAACAAGTTG-3′ (nucleotides 85–106), and reverse, 5′-AGCTTGCACCACTCCAAATCC-3′ (nucleotides 473–493) (31Thomas R. Guise T. Yin J. Elliott J. Horwood N. Martin T. Gillespie M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4451-4458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel reactions were performed for every assay using primers designed to amplify human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as described previously (32Sunyer T. Lewis J. Collin-Osdoby P. Osdoby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Initial trials were performed using RNA obtained from unstimulated cultures as well as each modulator treatment to establish optimal cycle numbers and RNA amounts for routine use so that RT-PCRs would yield RANKL, OPG, and GAPDH amplifications within an exponentially linear range over the amount of input RNA used. Thus, cycle numbers were varied from 20 to 35 (OPG), 30 to 35 (RANKL), and 15 to 35 (GAPDH), and RNA amounts from 0.15 ng to 1.5 μg (OPG), 25 ng to 12 μg (RANKL), and 1 pg to 4 μg (GAPDH), in up to 6 replicate trials each. No products were obtained in controls lacking either RNA or first strand primers, and amplified products were not eliminated or reduced by DNase treatment of the RNA samples. Conditions were chosen that consistently provided mid-linear range amplification of each PCR product for all further studies. Therefore, PCRs were run at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 (RANKL), 26 (OPG), or 20 (GAPDH) cycles. Products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, photographed using a Polaroid camera, and quantified in a scanner (Scanjet II, Hewlett-Packard) computer linked to a Quantimet image analysis system (Leica, United Kingdom). RANKL or OPG signals were normalized to GAPDH signals determined in parallel for each sample, and data were expressed as a percentage of the RANKL/GAPDH or OPG/GAPDH ratio for untreated HMVEC measured in the same trial. The 731-bp RANKL and 408-bp OPG amplicons generated by RT-PCR from HMVEC (as well as HOB and HBMSC) were directly sequenced using an ABI Prism Cycle Sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and DNA sequences were compared with published sequences to confirm their identity using computation performed at the NCBI and the BLAST network service. Cytokine levels in conditioned medium were measured using specific enzyme-linked immunoassay kits (Quantikine kits, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for human IL-1β, TNF-α, and M-CSF as recommended. Standard curves were run with each assay, and control medium was analyzed for background levels of each cytokine (which were insignificant), and modulators were tested in at least 3 separate culture wells per trial for 2–8 independent HMVEC cultures. Results were normalized for cell protein using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (33Rothe L. Collin-Osdoby P. Chen Y. Sunyer T. Chaudhary L. Tsay A. Goldring S. Avioli L. Osdoby P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4353-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. ng/ml of cytokine released per mg of cell protein during 24 h of culture. HMVEC were cultured in EGM-MV complete medium on glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes to near confluency, TNF-α (1 nm) was administered in fresh medium for 24 h, and the cells were fixed and immunostained (34Collin-Osdoby P. Oursler M. Rothe L. Webber D. Anderson F. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, HMVEC were rinsed, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/HBSS (15 min), rinsed, blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA and 10% horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and reacted for 1 h with (or without) primary antibodies diluted in block. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) specific for human ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 (Serotec, Raleigh, NC, each at 1:200 dilution), mAb to the angiogenesis-related integrin αvβ3 (LM 609, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, 1:100 dilution), and goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) raised to a C-terminal extracellular peptide region of human RANKL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, 1:100 dilution) were used. Primary antibody binding was detected using a secondary goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Life Technologies, Inc.; 1:200) for mAbs or a biotinylated donkey anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200) followed by a streptavidin-Texas Red conjugate (Life Technologies, Inc.; 1:1000) for RANKL pAb. In some cases, HMVEC were simultaneously immunostained for both ICAM-1 and RANKL to visualize their co-localization on the HMVEC plasma membrane. Coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides in glycerol-buffered mounting medium (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD), and images were viewed and digitally captured using a Leica scanning laser (argon/krypton/He) confocal microscope (TCS-SP-2) equipped with a 20× phase objective. Wavelengths for excitation and emission for fluorescein isothiocyanate were 494 and 518 nm, respectively, and those for Texas Red were 595 and 615 nm, respectively. Human osteoporotic bone was obtained from fractured femoral heads discarded during hip replacement surgery and briefly held at 4 °C in α-MEM before fixation in 10% buffered formalin. Samples were decalcified, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned by standard procedures. Sections were prepared for immunostaining by deparaffinization in xylene, hydration through 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH, and water, and heating (97 °C for 20 min) in an antigen unmasking Target Retrieval Solution (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Cooled sections were PBS-rinsed, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in Dako Peroxidase Blocking reagent (15 min), rinsed sections were blocked with Dako serum-free Protein Block (10 min), and sections were reacted overnight at 4 °C with the pAb to human RANKL described above (diluted 1:500 to 1:1000 in PBS + 1.5% Dako Protein Block). Sections were rinsed, incubated with biotinylated donkey anti-goat pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100 dilution in PBS/block, 45 min) followed by Dako streptavidin-peroxidase (1:300 in PBS, 15 min), reacted with Dako diaminobenzidine solution (5 min), briefly counterstained using Dako hematoxylin solution, and mounted on glass slides with Permount. Immunostained sections were viewed by light microscopy, and images were digitally captured using a computer-linked Olympus microscope. HMVEC were cultured in 24-well dishes in EGM complete medium to near confluency, two-thirds of the wells were treated for 48 h with either 1 nm TNF-α or IL-1α to maximally induce RANKL (while allowing stimulated OPG levels to decline), and the cells were washed (3 times) to remove cytokines just prior to the addition of human PBMC for co-culture. Human PBMC were prepared from heparinized blood obtained from the American Red Cross (St. Louis, MO). Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (26Shalhoub V. Faust J. Boyle W. Dunstan C.

Some wells also received 100 ng/ml recombinant human OPG:Fc fusion peptide (Alexis Corporation, San Diego, CA). The next day (day 1) all wells were treated with 10 nmVD3 and 25 ng/ml M-CSF, and OPG:Fc was readministered to the wells originally receiving this treatment. On day 5 the cells were refed with M-CSF, with or without OPG:Fc, and the cells were harvested on day 7, rinsed, fixed in 3% PF/HBSS, rinsed, and stained for TRAP activity (34Collin-Osdoby P.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2449-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The function of RseC, encoded by the fourth gene of the rpoEoperon, remains unknown. EςE also transcribeshtrA and fkpA, encoding a periplasmic protease (HtrA/DegP) for the removal of misfolded polypeptides (13Strauch K.L. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 14Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1462-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and a periplasmic peptidyl prolyl isomerase (FkpA) involved in folding envelope proteins (8Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 15Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). rpoH, encoding the transcription factor ς32 for the cytoplasmic heat shock response, is also transcribed by EςE (14Erickson J.W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1462-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).Earlier work described the isolation of rpoE knockout mutations (16Raina S. Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17Rouvière P. de las Peñas A. Mecsas J. Lu C.Z. Rudd K.E. Gross C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1032-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). E. coli appears to requirerpoE for viability and growth under physiological conditions, as the mutant strains cope with loss of rpoEfunction by acquiring compensatory mutations (18de las Peñas A. Connolly L. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6862-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of compensatory mutations as well as the number and identity of the affected genes are still unknown. Even though rpoE seems to be essential, none of the known EςE-transcribed genes (rpoH, htrA, fkpA, rseA,rseB, rseC) is required for either growth or viability of E. coli. Taken together, all previous work suggests that EςE must transcribe additional genes that are involved in the folding of envelope proteins. To identify genes that are transcribed by EςE and to approximate the size of the ςE regulon, we have used two different experimental strategies. Small DNA segments, generated by fragmentation of the E. coli chromosome, were fused to a promoterlesslacZ reporter gene carried on a single copy plasmid. Further, the λMu53-lacZ transposon was used to generate sets of random fusion between the promoterless lacZ reporter and regulatory sequences of the chromosome of E. coli. Screening of both libraries of reporter fusions in various genetic backgrounds identified 20 promoters that activated LacZ expression in a ςE-dependent manner. A hypothesis is presented to account for the essential function of the ςEregulon and to describe the role of the identified genes in responding to misfolded polypeptides within the envelope of E. coli.DISCUSSIONEςE RNA polymerase is thought to be dedicated to expressing folding catalysts that act on proteins in the bacterial envelope. Here we measured the size of the ςE regulon with two methods: two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of RpoE-induced cells and cloning of RpoE-regulated promoters. Results from both experiments as well as previous work suggest that EςEtranscribes some 43 genes. We describe here 20 new promoters that are recognized by EςE RNA polymerase. Some of the genes regulated by EςE were hitherto unknown and have been designated ecf, for extracytoplasmic encoding function. Some of the encoded gene products are located in the periplasmic space and act directly on misfolded proteins: DsbC, FkpA, HtrA, Skp, and SurA. Some other gene products are located in the bacterial cytoplasm and serve regulatory functions that coordinate the expression of the ςE regulon with environmental conditions. RpoE, RpoH, and RpoD represent components of various RNA polymerase species, whereas RseA, RseB, and RseC regulate the availability of ςE for core RNA polymerase. Several ςE-regulated gene products are involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide has been proposed to act as a cofactor for the membrane assembly of outer membrane proteins, a pathway that appears to require Skp activity (8Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Skp has also been shown to play other roles in envelope assembly (36Schafer U. Beck K. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24567-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It seems noteworthy however that skp mutant cells contain increased amounts of lipopolysaccharide within the periplasm (36Schafer U. Beck K. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24567-24574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is as if deletion of the presumed folding factor (Skp) may lead to the simultaneous accumulation of its cofactor (lipopolysaccharide). TherfaDFCL and lpxDA genes provide known components of the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway and are transcribed by EςE polymerase. In fact, the lpxD lpxA fabZgenes are regulated by two ςE-dependent promoters: one placed in front of skp (the first gene of the operon) and a second one in front of lpxD. Our preliminary results suggest that the ecfABC gene products may also be involved in the lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathway. 3C. Dartigalongue, D. Missiakas, and S. Raina, unpublished data. Two ςE-regulated genes encode proteins with sensory functions. MdoG is involved in coordinating cellular pressure with the biosynthesis of periplasmic membrane-derived oligosaccharides (37Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1092-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), whereas CutC has been postulated to be involved in copper homeostasis (38Blattner F.R. Plunkett G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5972) Google Scholar). The requirement of these gene products for protein folding in the periplasmic space is not immediately apparent. In this and perhaps in other cases, the presence of a ςE promoter may provide growth advantages for the E. coli host which are not related to protein folding. The largest group of ςE-regulated genes encodes proteins located in the inner (NlpB, EcfD, EcfG, EcfI, and EcfL) and outer membranes (EcfK and EcfM). The precise function of these proteins remains to be established; however, it is conceivable that the membrane proteins act directly on misfolded membrane proteins and promote either polypeptide degradation or insertion into the lipid bilayer. Alternatively, membrane proteins may be involved in the transport and assembly of lipopolysaccharide into the physiological bilayer structures.Two new members of the RpoE regulon were observed to be essential: ecfE and ecfL. Because these genes appear to be transcribed by several RNA polymerases (data not shown) and have no definitive function attributed, it is impossible to draw conclusions as to why the ςE regulon is essential forE. coli growth. EcfE appears to be a member of a large group of proteases designated RIP (regulated intramembrane proteolysis). Proteases of the RIP family are needed for diverse functions such as lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, and response to unfolded proteins (39Niwa M. Sidrauski C. Kaufman R.J. Walter P. Cell. 1999; 99: 691-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 40Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the role of EcfE in signaling envelope stress in E. coli.In summary, the ςE regulon has evolved to control at least two cellular processes, folding of polypeptides in the bacterial envelope and biosynthesis/transport of lipopolysaccharide. Conditions that cause unfolding of polypeptides are signaled by the RseA and RseB proteins (11Collinet B. Yuzawa H. Chen T. Herrera C. Missiakas D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33898-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the ςE regulon can sense and respond to changes in lipopolysaccharide metabolism. Our future work will address this possibility. Heat shock and other environmental stresses result in the misfolding of polypeptides in all cells. Escherichia coliresponds to the accumulation of misfolded polypeptides by activating the transcription of heat shock genes. Heat is a drastic stress that leads to protein unfolding in general and triggers two heat shock responses controlled by two distinct RNA polymerase species in E. coli 1: α2ββ′ς32 and α2ββ′ςE, Eς32, and EςE, respectively (1Gross C.A.

The unfolding of proteins in the envelope of E. coli uniquely induces the ςE regulon but not Eς32 (3Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ςE (RpoE) is a member of the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) subfamily of sigma factors which function as effector molecules responding to extracytoplasmic stimuli (3Missiakas D. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 5Lonetto M. Brown K.L. Rudd K.E. Buttner M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7573-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Some microorganisms such as Streptomyces coelicolor harbor multiple ECFs that seem specialized in responding to different extracytoplasmic stimuli (5Lonetto M. Brown K.L. Rudd K.E. Buttner M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7573-7577Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 6Kang J.G. Paget M.S. Seok Y.J. Hahn M.Y. Bae J.B. Hahn J.S. Kleanthous C. Buttner M.J. Roe J.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4292-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The E. coli ςE regulon is induced specifically in response to imbalanced synthesis of outer membrane proteins (7Mecsas J. Rouvière P.E. Erickson J.W. Donohue T.J. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2618-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and to misfolding of polypeptides that have been translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane (8Missiakas D. Betton J.-M. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 871-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Previous work identified several genes that are transcribed by EςE (4Raivio T.L. Silhavy T.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). EςE directs its own expression.rpoE is the first gene of an operon that also containsrseA, rseB, and rseC(regulator of sigma E, genes A, B, and C (9de las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RseA is a short hydrophobic polypeptide that integrates into the cytoplasmic membrane. The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of RseA binds to ςE, sequestering the sigma factor from core RNA polymerase (E) (9de las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 3373-3386Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of RseA protrudes into the periplasm, a compartment located between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes of E. coli. The C-terminal domain of RseA interacts with RseB, a periplasmic soluble protein (9de las Peñas A. Conolly L. Gross C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 3373-3386Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 10Missiakas D. Mayer M. Lemaire M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 355-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). RseB is believed to sense the concentration of misfolded polypeptides, causing RseB dissociation from RseA and liberating cytoplasmic ςE for interaction with core RNA polymerase (11Collinet B.

https://openalex.org/W2019175855,"Caspases are universal effectors of apoptosis. The mitochondrial and death receptor pathways activate distinct apical caspases (caspase-9 and -8, respectively) that converge on the proteolytic activation of the downstream executioner caspase-3. Caspase-9 and -8 cleave procaspase-3 to produce a p24 processing intermediate (composed of its prodomain and large subunit), which then undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage to remove the prodomain from the active protease. Recently, several heat shock proteins have been shown to selectively inhibit the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by disrupting the activation of caspase-9 downstream of cytochrome c release. We report here that the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin inhibits both the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. In S-100 cytosolic extracts treated with cytochromec/dATP or caspase-8, αB-crystallin inhibits the autoproteolytic maturation of the p24 partially processed caspase-3 intermediate. In contrast, neither the closely related small heat shock protein family member Hsp27 nor Hsp70 inhibited the maturation of the p24 intermediate. We also demonstrate that αB-crystallin co-immunoprecipitates with the p24 partially processed caspase-3in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that αB-crystallin is a novel negative regulator of apoptosis that acts distally in the conserved cell death machinery by inhibiting the autocatalytic maturation of caspase-3.

Caspases are synthesized as proenzymes that are activated by trans- or auto-proteolytic cleavage at aspartate residues. They are arranged in a proteolytic cascade with some acting as initiators (-8, -9, and -10) and others acting as downstream executioners (-3, -6, and-7). The apical caspases are activated by two principal mechanisms, the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways, that converge on the proteolytic activation of caspase-3. In the former pathway, mitochondria respond to a variety of stimuli including genotoxic stress by releasing cytochrome c into the cytosol (3Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar). Cytochromec then binds to Apaf-1, which oligomerizes in the presence of ATP and recruits/activates procaspase-9; this multimeric complex is often referred to as the apoptosome (4Zou H. Henzel W.

In the death receptor pathway, members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1-α family bind to their receptors, thereby recruiting and activating procaspase-8 via a series of protein-protein interactions mediated by FADD (6Muzio M.

Active caspase-9 (the mitochondrial pathway) or caspase-8 (the death receptor pathway) then initiate the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 by a multi-step mechanism. In the first step, caspase-9 or -8 cleaves procaspase-3 at an aspartate residue between its large and small subunits to generate a p24 intermediate (the prodomain and the large subunit) and the p12 small subunit (8Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Active caspase-3 (two p17/p12 heterodimers) then induces the cell to undergo apoptosis by proteolyzing key cellular targets. Many of the stress stimuli that are capable of triggering apoptosis, such as oxidative stress and heat shock, induce the synthesis of diverse heat shock proteins (HSPs) that confer a protective effect against a wide range of cellular stresses. Recent evidence indicates that many HSPs are anti-apoptotic and directly inhibit caspase activation. For instance, Hsp70 and Hsp90 bind to Apaf-1 and prevent the recruitment of procaspase-9 to the apoptosome, thereby inhibiting caspase-9 activation (13Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D.

Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hsp27, a member of the small HSP family, has been shown to bind/sequester cytosolic cytochromec from the apoptosome and prevent procaspase-9 activation (16Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). However, others have demonstrated that Hsp27 antagonizes apoptosis downstream of caspase-9 activation by binding to procaspase-3 and blocking its proteolytic activation (17Pandey P. Farber R. Nakazawa A. Kumar S. Bharti A. Nalin C. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that some HSPs, and presumably others, confer resistance to apoptosis by specifically inhibiting one or more components of the apoptotic machinery. In the present report, we examined the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of αB-crystallin, a small HSP family member related to Hsp27. Members of the small HSP family contain a highly conserved α-crystallin domain that is flanked by largely divergent amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (18Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). They form oligomeric complexes that function as molecular chaperones to facilitate protein folding and prevent aggregation of denatured or misfolded proteins (18Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin is constitutively expressed in many tissues, and it is particularly abundant in the lens, heart, skeletal muscle and in some cancers (18Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The expression of αB-crystallin is also induced by diverse cellular stresses (20Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Moreover, αB-crystallin has been shown to protect cells against apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents, TNF-α, and Fas (21Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of αB-crystallin's anti-apoptotic actions have not been delineated. We report here that αB-crystallin antagonizes cytochrome c- and caspase-8-dependent activation of caspase-3 by binding to partially processed caspase-3 and inhibiting its autoproteolytic maturation. Human MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were maintained in DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Life Technologies). PC-3 prostate carcinoma and Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The full-length αB-crystallin cDNA was PCR-amplified from human αB-crystallin cDNA with the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGCCGAATTCATGGACATCGCCATCCACCAC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCTCGAGCTATTTCTTGGGGGCTG-CGG-3′. The full-length Hsp27 cDNA was PCR-amplified from human heart cDNA (CLONTECH) using the following primers: 5′-GGCCGAATTCATGACCGAGCGCCGCGTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCTCGAGTTACTTGGCGGCAGTCTCCATC-3′. The PCR products were then digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector in which the FLAG epitope was inserted upstream of the multiple cloning site (kindly provided by Dr. J. Settleman). Sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. MDA-MB-231 and PC-3 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG plasmid containing human αB-crystallin or human Hsp27, or 1 μg of control vector (pEGFP-N1,CLONTECH) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stable transfections, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG vector or pcDNA3FLAG-αB-crystallin and allowed to recover for 48 h; clones stably expressing these constructs were then selected by growth in 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies) for 3 weeks. Individual G418-resistant clones were examined for expression of αB-crystallin by immunoblotting with FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma) as described (23Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 24 h after transient transfection, cells were treated with 50 μm etoposide for 48 h (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for 4 h (PC-3 cells). Transfected cells were identified by GFP-fluorescence (control vector) or indirect immunofluorescence (αB-crystallin or Hsp27) with FLAG M2 mAb as described previously (24Byun, Y., Chen, F., Chang, R., Trivedi, M., Green, K., and Cryns, V. (2001) Cell Death Differ. In press.Google Scholar). Apoptosis was scored as the percentage of transfected cells that had condensed/fragmented nuclei by staining with Hoescht no. 33258 (Sigma) as described (24Byun, Y., Chen, F., Chang, R., Trivedi, M., Green, K., and Cryns, V. (2001) Cell Death Differ. In press.Google Scholar). For stable transfections, pooled, vector-transfected cells or two clones stably expressing αB-crystallin were untreated or treated with 50 μmetoposide for 65 h or 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 1 μg/ml CHX for 36 h; cells were then scored for apoptosis as above. At least 200 cells were counted in each experiment, and experiments were performed in triplicate. The data is presented as the mean ± S.E.; the significance of intergroup differences was assessed by a two-tailed, paired Student's t test. Purified recombinant αB-crystallin and Hsp27 were produced using the Qiagen Expressionist system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length αB-crystallin cDNA was PCR-amplified from the human αB-crystallin cDNA with the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-GGCCGAGCTCATGGACATCGCCATCCACCAC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGTACCCTATTTCTTGGGGGCTGCGG-3′. The full-length Hsp27 cDNA was PCR-amplified from the human Hsp27 cDNA using the following primers: 5′-GGCCGGATCCATGACCGAGCGCCGCGTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCAAGCTTTTACTTGGCGGCAGTCTCCATC-3′. The PCR products were then digested with SacI and KpnI (αB-crystallin) or BamHI and HindIII (Hsp27) and cloned into the corresponding sites in pQE30A (Qiagen). Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were purified under native conditions using 250 mm imidizole to elute the His-tagged proteins from Ni2+-NTA columns (Qiagen) and stored at −80 °C. S-100 extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells as described elsewhere (3Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4463) Google Scholar) except that cells were lysed by four freeze-thaw cycles in a dry ice/ethanol bath. For procaspase-9 activation studies, S-100 extracts were preincubated in the absence or presence of recombinant human αB-crystallin (2–15 μm), Hsp27 (2–15 μm), or Hsp70 (StressGen Biotechnologies, 5 μm) and 35S-labeled procaspase-9 (prepared from procaspase-9 cDNA using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions). Caspases were activated by the addition of 1 μg cytochrome c (Sigma)/1 mm dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 37 °C or 30 ng of recombinant caspase-8 for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography as described (23Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol.

The procaspase-3 and procaspase-7 activation studies were performed as above except that 35S-labeled procaspase-9 was omitted, and the reaction products were analyzed by immunoblotting with caspase-3 mAb (Transduction Laboratories) or caspase-7 mAb (PharMingen) (23Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing FLAG-vector or FLAG-αB-crystallin were lysed in IP lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) at a final concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was incubated with protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) and 2 μg of anti-IgG (Sigma) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) polyclonal antibodies. Complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times in IP wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF) and the immunoprecipated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with αB-crystallin mAb (StressGen Biotechnologies) or caspase-3 mAb as described (23Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Li H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). To begin delineating the mechanisms by which αB-crystallin inhibits apoptosis, we examined whether ectopic expression of αB-crystallin protected cells from stimuli that engaged the mitochondrial pathway (the DNA-damaging agent etoposide) or the death receptor pathway (TNF-α). Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells or PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells, which lack αB-crystallin (data not shown), were transiently transfected with vector or FLAG-tagged αB-crystallin. After overnight incubation, cells were treated with 50 μm etoposide for 48 h (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 10 ng/ml TNF-α and 1 μg/ml CHX for 4 h (PC-3 cells), and the percentage of transfected cells with apoptotic nuclei was determined. As demonstrated in Fig.1 A, transient expression of αB-crystallin potently inhibited apoptosis induced by etoposide or TNF-α. Hsp27, a small HSP family member closely related to αB-crystallin, also conferred a similar degree of protection against etoposide- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We also generated MDA-MB-231 clones stably expressing FLAG-tagged αB-crystallin. As shown in Fig.1 B, the A5 and B4 clones stably expressing αB-crystallin were also protected against apoptosis induced by etoposide and TNF-α compared with pooled, FLAG vector-transfected cells. These findings demonstrate unequivocally that αB-crystallin inhibits both the mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways. In addition, because these two pathways converge on the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3, they suggest that αB-crystallin may negatively regulate apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 activation and/or other downstream events shared by both pathways. We first examined the ability of recombinant αB-crystallin to inhibit the cytochromec-dependent activation of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 in Jurkat S-100 cytosolic extracts. Importantly, the range of concentrations of αB-crystallin (2–15 μm) used are consistent with those observed in a variety of cancer cell lines, either constitutively or in response to heat shock. 2M. Kamradt and V. Cryns, unpublished results. As shown in Fig.2 A (upper panel), the addition of 1 μg of cytochrome c and 1 mmdATP to S-100 extracts induced the cleavage of 35S-labeled procaspase-9 to its well characterized p35 proteolytic product (indicated by an arrow). αB-Crystallin (even at 15 μm concentration) only weakly inhibited the proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 compared with Hsp27 (15 μm) and Hsp70 (5 μm); the latter observation is consistent with the reported ability of Hsp27 and Hsp70 to disrupt apoptosome assembly and prevent procaspase-9 activation (13Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 15Saleh A.

Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, middle panel, the addition of cytochrome c and dATP to S-100 extracts also triggered the cleavage of procaspase-3 into its p20 and p17 forms of the large subunit (indicated by arrows); the caspase-3 mAb used in these studies does not detect the small p12 subunit. However, the addition of αB-crystallin led to the dose-dependent accumulation of the p24 partially processed caspase-3 (prodomain plus the large subunit) with a corresponding reduction in the amount of fully processed caspase-3, particularly p17. The p24 processing intermediate was observed at concentrations of αB-crystallin as low as 2 μm (on prolonged exposure of the immunoblot, data not shown). Because αB-crystallin is similar in size to the p24 partially processed caspase-3, we demonstrated that the caspase-3 mAb does not cross-react with αB-crystallin (Fig. 2 C). The functional relevance of the caspase-3 maturation defect caused by αB-crystallin is demonstrated by αB-crystallin's dose-dependent reduction in the proteolytic processing of procaspase-7 (Fig. 2 A, lower panel), a downstream target of caspase-3. In contrast, neither Hsp27 nor Hsp70 led to the accumulation of the p24 intermediate in cytochromec/dATP-treated S-100 extracts (even with prolonged exposure of immunoblots). Instead, both Hsp27 (10–15 μm) and Hsp70 (5 μm) inhibited the initial caspase-9 cleavage of procaspase-3, again consistent with their previously reported inhibition of caspase-9 activation by cytochrome c (13Beere H.M.

We next examined whether αB-crystallin inhibited the caspase-8-dependent activation of procaspase-3 in S-100 extracts. In this system, procaspase-3 is directly cleaved by caspase-8 to generate the p24 intermediate, and the prodomain is subsequently removed by autoproteolytic cleavage to produce the p20/p17 forms of the large subunit (8Fernandes-Alnemri T.

As demonstrated in Fig. 2 B, treatment of S-100 extracts with active caspase-8 led to the cleavage of procaspase-3 to p20 and p17. However, the addition of αB-crystallin led to the dramatic dose-dependent accumulation of the p24 processing intermediate and a concomitant reduction in the amount of fully processed caspase-3, especially p17. In contrast, adding Hsp27 or Hsp70 did not lead to the accumulation of the p24 intermediate. Moreover, neither Hsp27 nor Hsp70 substantially inhibited the cleavage of procaspase-3 by caspase-8. Although αB-crystallin did not inhibit capase-7 activation in S-100 extracts treated with caspase-8 (data not shown), caspase-8 can directly cleave procaspase-7; hence, caspase-3 activation is not necessary for procaspase-7 processing in this system (8Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7464-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that αB-crystallin negatively regulates the cytochrome c- and caspase-8-dependent activation of caspase-3 by inhibiting the autoproteolytic maturation of its p24 intermediate. To determine whether αB-crystallin binds to caspase-3 in vivo, we immunoprecipitated αB-crystallin from cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged αB-crystallin. Whole cell lysates derived from FLAG-vector- or FLAG-αB-crystallin-expressing cells were immunoprecipitated with FLAG mAb. As shown in Fig.3 (middle panel), αB-crystallin co-immunoprecipitated with the p24 partially processed caspase-3 (indicated by an arrow) in cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged αB-crystallin; this interaction was not observed in FLAG-vector-transfected cells. Importantly, the caspase-3 processing intermediate that co-immunoprecipitated with αB-crystallin is the identical size as the p24 partially processed caspase-3 observed in cytosolic extracts treated with cytochrome c/dATP or caspase-8 in the presence of αB-crystallin (data not shown). Although the p24 intermediate is far less abundant than procaspase-3 in whole cell lysates (Fig. 3, lower panel), it abundantly co-immunoprecipitated with αB-crystallin in the absence of any detectable interaction between αB-crystallin and procaspase-3, thereby underscoring the specificity of the interaction between αB-crystallin and partially processed caspase-3 in vivo. These findings suggest that αB-crystallin antagonizes the autocatalytic processing of caspase-3 by binding to and inhibiting the partially processed protease. Recent studies indicate that several HSPs inhibit the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by specifically binding to components of the cell death apparatus and disrupting the assembly of the apoptosome. Hsp70 and Hsp90 bind to Apaf-1, whereas Hsp27 binds to cytochrome c to prevent the cytochrome c-mediated oligomerization of Apaf-1 and subsequent activation of procaspase-9 (13Beere H.M. Wolf B.B.

We demonstrate here that the small HSP αB-crystallin inhibits both the mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways by a novel mechanism: αB-crystallin binds to caspase-3 that has been partially processed by caspase-9 or caspase-8 cleavage (p24) and inhibits the autoproteolytic removal of its prodomain to produce its large subunit. Because this autocatalytic maturation is required for caspase-3 activation by both the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways, the inhibition of caspase-3 maturation by αB-crystallin is a parsimonious strategy to inhibit both pathways. In contrast, Hsp70 inhibits only the mitochondrial pathway and may even sensitize cells to Fas-induced apoptosis (13Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 15Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat.

Importantly, neither Hsp27 nor Hsp70 had any effect on the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3. These observations indicate unambiguously that αB-crystallin inhibits apoptosis by a novel mechanism that is distinct from that of other HSPs examined to date. Interestingly, the autoproteolytic maturation of capase-3 is also inhibited by the conserved IAP family member XIAP. Like αB-crystallin, XIAP does not inhibit the initial cleavage of procaspase-3 by caspase-8 in cytosolic extracts, but it binds to the p24 partially processed caspase-3 and inhibits its autoproteolytic maturation (12Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Although αB-crystallin is less potent in this respect, its inhibition of caspase-3's autoproteolytic maturation is observed at physiologically relevant concentrations (2–15 μm) as determined by quantitation of αB-crystallin levels in cancer cell lines.2 Indeed, we have likely underestimated the concentration of αB-crystallin in some tissues. For instance, α-crystallin (a protein composed of αB-crystallin and αA-crystallin) accounts for 40% of the soluble protein in the lens, and αB-crystallin constitutes as much as 5% of the total protein in striated muscle (18Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Kato K. Shinohara H. Kurobe N. Inaguma Y. Shimizu K. Ohshima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1074: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, XIAP is also a potent inhibitor/substrate of active caspases-3 and -7 (12Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 26Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar) whereas αB-crystallin is not cleaved by caspases (data not presented). Hence, the molecular mechanism by which αB-crystallin inhibits the autoproteolytic maturation of capase-3 is likely to be different from that of XIAP. Somewhat unexpectedly, the small HSP family members αB-crystallin and Hsp27 inhibit apoptosis by largely distinct mechanisms. In our studies, Hsp27 clearly disrupts the cytochromec-dependent activation of procaspase-9, as others have reported (16Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), whereas αB-crystallin only weakly inhibits this event. Moreover, Hsp27 does not inhibit the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3. Although αB-crystallin and Hsp27 share ∼40% amino acid identity, most of the identical residues are found within their respective α-crystallin domains; the amino and carboxyl termini are largely divergent (18Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Hence, the different anti-apoptotic mechanisms of these closely related small HSPs are likely to be the result of their distinct amino and/or carboxyl termini. Although we and others (21Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Mehlen P. Schulze-Osthoff K. Arrigo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16510-16514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) have observed that Hsp27, like αB-crystallin, inhibits both the mitochondrial and death receptor apoptotic pathways, the mechanism(s) by which Hsp27 inhibits the latter is unclear. In our studies, Hsp27 did not inhibit the caspase-8-dependent activation of procaspase-3, suggesting that Hsp27 inhibits death receptor apoptosis upstream of this step (perhaps by interfering with procaspase-8 activation). Nevertheless, our findings provide unequivocal evidence that αB-crystallin and Hsp27 inhibit apoptosis by distinct mechanisms. In contrast to αB-crystallin, two other HSPs have been shown to promote, rather than inhibit, caspase-3 maturation (28Xanthoudakis S. Roy S. Rasper D. Hennessey T. Aubin Y. Cassady R. Tawa P. Ruel R. Rosen A. Nicholson D.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2049-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Hsp60, Hsp10, and procaspase-3 form a multimeric complex in the mitochondria of intact cells. In cytosolic extracts, Hsp60 and Hsp10 promote the proteolytic activation of procaspase-3 by caspase-8 and -9 in an ATP-dependent fashion, suggesting that their chaperone activity enhances the sensitivity of procaspase-3 to proteolytic cleavage by apical caspases. Together with our observation that αB-crystallin inhibits the autocatalytic maturation of caspase-3, these findings indicate that the proteolytic maturation of caspase-3 is an exquisitely regulated event. In short, αB-crystallin is a novel negative regulator of apoptosis that acts distally in the conserved cell death apparatus (downstream of any previously reported HSP) by disrupting the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3. Given the abundance of αB-crystallin in the lens and in muscle, αB-crystallin is likely to play a particularly important role in regulating apoptosis in these tissues. Indeed, the recent observation that a missense mutation in αB-crystallin (R120G) causes a familial syndrome characterized by cataracts and generalized myopathy underscores the importance of αB-crystallin in the lens and in muscle (30Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prévost M.-C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tomé F. Dupret J.-M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the differentiation of lens epithelial cells into lens fibers is accomplished by an atypical apoptotic mechanism that leads to the removal of the nucleus and other organelles from terminally differentiated lens fiber cells that survive for the lifetime of the organism (31Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Bassnett S. Mataic D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because αB-crystallin is abundantly expressed in lens fiber cells, it is tempting to speculate that its presence prevents the completion of the apoptotic program and promotes the long-term survival of these cells. In addition, our findings clearly raise a number of important questions. For instance, what roles do oligomerization and/or chaperone function play in αB-crystallin's anti-apoptotic actions? Although oligomerization of Hsp27 is necessary for its anti-apoptotic actions (33Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), the role of oligomerization in αB-crystallin's anti-apoptotic actions has not been studied. These and other issues will be examined in future studies using mutants of αB-crystallin that are impaired in one or more of these biochemical properties. We thank Dr. Robert Talanian for providing active caspase-8 and Drs. Junying Yuan, Honglin Li, and Marcus Peter for their critical reading of the manuscript."

Transglutaminases (TGases)1 are a family of thiol- and Ca2+-dependent acyl transferases that catalyze the formation of an amide bond between the γ-carboxamide groups of peptide-bound glutamine residues and the primary amino groups in various compounds, including the ε-amino group of lysine in certain proteins (1Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Seven distinct transglutaminases have been described (reviews in Refs. 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb.

In addition to Gh, also known as tissue TGase (TGase II, 74–80 kDa), these include, the enzymatically inactive band 4.2 (72–77 kDa), involved in the cytoskeletal network; plasma factor XIIIA (fXIIIA, 75 kDa) involved in catalyzing formation of the fibrin clot at sites of blood coagulation; keratinocyte TGase (TGase I, 90 kDa), which plays a major role in terminal differentiation of epithelia, and in the formation of the cornified cell envelope of the epidermis; epidermal TGase (TGase III, 77 kDa), involved in differentiating epidermal and hair follicle cells; prostate TGase (TGase IV, 65–77 kDa), which, in rodents results in the formation of the copulatory plug through cross-linking of proteins in the seminal vesicle secretion (1Folk J.E.

Two new TGases (VI and VII) have recently been identified. 2D. Aeschlimann, personal communication.2D. Aeschlimann, personal communication. Gh/TGase II has G-protein signaling and TGase protein cross-linking activities. It is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues (6Thomazy V. Fesus L. Cell Tiss.

Gh has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction (8Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M.

In the extracellular matrix, Gh cross-links and stabilizes a number of substrates such as laminin-nidogen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, osteonectin, osteopontin, and the cell adhesion molecule C-CAM (16Barsigian C.

Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J.A. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gh has recently been shown to mediate cell adhesion in fibroblasts by acting as a β1 and β3 but not β2integrin-associated coreceptor for fibronectin; an action that is independent of its TGase activity (24Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischmann L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). A rat punch biopsy wound healing model, followed over 6 days, demonstrated increased Gh expression and activity at sites of neovascularization and invasion of the fibrin matrix and then in the granulation tissue matrix during healing (25Haroon Z.A.

An intracellular role for Gh is suggested by the finding that its activity is down-regulated in the myocardium of humans with cardiac failure (26Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sweet W.E. Moravec C.S. Im M.-J. Circulation. 1996; 94: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Also, transgenic overexpression of Gh (∼37-fold) in the heart, results in ventricular remodelling with elevated expression of the hypertrophy-associated genes, β-myosin heavy chain and α-skeletal actin, and diffuse interstitial fibrosis (27Small K.

We report herein that activation of the human NQO1-ARE (hNQO1-ARE) bytert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2), in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. Treatment with tBHQ significantly increased NQO1 protein without activation of Erk1/2. In addition, PD 98059 (a selective mitogen-activated kinase/Erk kinase inhibitor) did not inhibit hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression or NQO1 protein induction by tBHQ. Pretreatment with LY 294002 (a selective PI3-kinase inhibitor), however, inhibited both hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression and endogenous NQO1 protein induction. In support of a role for PI3-kinase in ARE activation we show that: 1) transfection of IMR-32 cells with constitutively active PI3-kinase selectively activated the ARE in a dose-dependent manner that was completely inhibited by treatment with LY 294002; 2) pretreatment of cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitors, LY 294002 and wortmannin, significantly decreased NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation induced by tBHQ; and 3) ARE activation by constitutively active PI3-kinase was blocked completely by dominant negative Nrf2.

The consensus ARE core sequence in the human NQO1 gene (5′-TGACTCAGC-3′) is very similar to the DNA binding sequence for NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2, 5′-TGAGTCA-3′).

Nrf2 was originally cloned using an AP1-NF-E2 tandem repeat as a recognition site probe and belongs to the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors (8Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). Itho et al. (9Itho K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar) suggest that Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Keap1 protein and that oxidative stress releases Nrf2 from the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, resulting in nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Recently our laboratory showed that activation of the human NQO1-ARE depends on Nrf2 and thattert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) dramatically induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation in human neuroblastoma cells (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although the role of Nrf2 in ARE activation seems evident, the upstream regulatory mechanisms by which ARE-activating signals are linked to Nrf2 and how this transcription factor is released from the Nrf2-Keap1 complex remain to be elucidated. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, a serine/threonine kinase family (11Crews C.M. Alessandrini A.A. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl.

Activation of Erk1/2 culminates in the phosphorylation of downstream factors such as p90RSK, c-Myc, and Elk-1, which control various cellular processes (17Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Although there are several reports attempting to address the relationship between MAP kinases and ARE activation, the role of MAP kinases in ARE activation remains controversial, and the mechanism by which MAP kinases drive ARE activation through Nrf2 is unresolved. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol at the D-3 position of the inositol ring and has been shown to form a heterodimer consisting of a 85 kDa (adapter protein) and 110 kDa (catalytic) subunit (20Klippel A.

Based on these diverse effects of PI3-kinase (especially protective effects) and because the induction of phase II enzymes is thought to be a protective response in cells, we were interested in determining whether PI3-kinase is involved in ARE regulation.

IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (ATCC, CCL-127) were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate methods as described previously (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PI3-kinase, IMR-32 cells were cotransfected with the hNQO1-ARE-luciferase reporter construct (80 ng/well), CMV-β-galactosidase (20 ng/well), and the CA PI3-kinase or KD PI3-kinase plasmid. To investigate the effect of DN Nrf2 on ARE activation by constitutively active PI3-kinase, IMR-32 cells were cotransfected with the hNQO1-ARE-luciferase (80 ng/well), CMV-β-galactosidase (20 ng/well), CA PI3-kinase (40 ng/well), and DN Nrf2 (5 ng/well). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated for another 24 h and harvested. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were determined as described previously (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Moehlenkamp J.D. Johnson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as the ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase activity. IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/10-cm dish and grown in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with various chemicals as described in each figure legend. After washing two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Akt enzymatic activity was measured using a commercially available Akt-kinase assay kit (New England Biolabs) using GSK-3 α/β as a substrate. For Western immunoblot analysis, a whole cell extract (for NQO1, phospho-Erk1/2, Erk1/2, and phospho-GSK-3 α/β) or nuclear fraction (for Nrf2) of IMR-32 cells was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The transferred membranes were probed with an hNQO1 (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), phospho-Erk1/2, Erk1/2, phospho-GSK-3 α/β, or Nrf2 antibody. Chemiluminescence was produced using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Representative Western blots are shown in the figures. Cytotoxicity was measured using an MTS cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To investigate the relationship between Erk1/2 activation and ARE activation, we treated IMR-32 cells with a vehicle (0.01% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline) or tBHQ (10 μm) and carried out time-course Western immunoblot analysis for the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as well as for the induction of NQO1. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, tBHQ did not increase phosphorylation of Erk1/2 compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 1 A) or effect the level of Erk1/2 protein (Fig. 1 B) up to 24 h. In contrast, endogenous NQO1 protein induction was significant by 12 h in tBHQ-treated groups (Fig. 1 C). It should be noted that the phosphorylation status of Erk1/2 varied with time in both vehicle- and tBHQ-treated cells (Fig. 1 A). We think the change of the basal level of phospho-Erk1/2 might be caused by a cell cycle effect or a challenge of temperature change during treatment. Irrespective of this observation, tBHQ never consistently increased phospho-Erk1/2 when compared with the appropriate vehicle-treated cells in repeated experiments (data not shown). These data suggest that tBHQ treatment increase endogenous NQO1 protein without changing Erk1/2 activity. Initially, to evaluate the involvement of PI3-kinase in ARE activation, we used a selective PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY 294002. As shown in Fig. 2, A andB, pretreatment with LY 294002 inhibited both tBHQ-mediated NQO1-ARE-luciferase expression and endogenous NQO1 increase in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a positive role for PI3-kinase in ARE activation. These concentrations of LY 294002 had no effect on cell viability as determined by the MTS cytotoxicity assay (data not shown). To evaluate the involvement of Erk1/2 in ARE regulation further, we transiently transfected IMR-32 cells with hNQO1-ARE-luciferase and treated them with PD 98059, a selective inhibitor of MAP/Erk kinase. tBHQ (10 μm) treatment resulted in a 57-fold increase in hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression that was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with LY 294002 (Fig.3 A). In contrast, pretreatment with PD 98059 (50 μm) did not inhibit ARE activation by tBHQ (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, endogenous NQO1 protein induction by tBHQ (10 μm) was decreased by only LY 294002 pretreatment (Fig. 3 B). tBHQ did not increase the level of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, and PD 98059 completely blocked the basal level of phospho-Erk1/2 (Fig. 3 C), indicating that PD 98059 was functioning as expected. Interestingly, LY 294002 increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A), raising the possibility that increased Erk1/2 activity may actually be contributing to the inhibitory effect of LY 294002. To test this hypothesis, IMR-32 cells were treated with nerve growth factor (NGF), a potent activator of Erk1/2 (32Volente C. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21410-21415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). NGF was very effective at increasing Erk1/2 phosphorylation in IMR-32 cells (Fig. 4 B), but NGF treatment neither increased hNQO1-ARE reporter gene expression nor inhibited ARE activation by tBHQ up to 500 ng/ml (Fig.4 C). Similarly, treatment with LY 294002 strongly activated Erk1/2 (Fig. 4 A), but LY 294002 significantly inhibited hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression as well as NQO1 protein increase by tBHQ (Figs. 2 and 3). Recent findings linking PI3-kinase to Akt and subsequent phosphorylation of GSK-3 β (34Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M.

Using insulin as a positive control (37Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), the data show that tBHQ does not increase Akt activity (Fig. 5 A) or lead to increased phosphorylation of GSK-3 β (Fig. 5 B). As expected, the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of GSK-3 β was blocked completely by inhibitors of PI3-kinase activity (Fig. 5 C). Finally, insulin did not increase either hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression (Fig. 6 A) or hNQO1 protein (Fig. 6 B), implying that not all activators of PI3-kinase lead to ARE activation.Figure 6Insulin does not activate ARE.A, IMR-32 cells were transfected with the hNQO1-ARE-luciferase reporter construct (80 ng/well) and CMV-β-galactosidase (20 ng/well). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with the vehicle, tBHQ (10 μm), or insulin (2.5 μg/ml) for 30 min.

First, in IMR-32 cells transfected with CA PI3-kinase or KD PI3-kinase, only the CA PI3-kinase increased hNQO1-ARE reporter gene expression (Fig. 7 A), and that induction was inhibited completely by treatment with LY 294002 (Fig.7 B). Second, we recently reported that tBHQ treatment effectively induces nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in IMR-32 cells (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of IMR-32 cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitors LY 294002 or wortmannin significantly decreased Nrf2 nuclear translocation induced by tBHQ (Fig. 8 A). Finally, ARE activation mediated by CA PI3-kinase was blocked completely by DN Nrf2 (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that Nrf2 is downstream of PI3-kinase in IMR-32 cells. KD PI3-kinase did not show a dominant negative effect on endogenous PI3-kinase, and ARE activation by tBHQ was not inhibited by KD PI3-kinase (data not shown).Figure 8PI3-kinase is linked to Nrf2.A, IMR-32 cells were pretreated with the vehicle (V), LY 294002 (LY, 20 μm) or wortmannin (Wort, 1 μm) for 30 min and treated with the vehicle or tBHQ (T, 10 μm). After 6 h, nuclear extracts were isolated and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The transferred membrane was probed with the Nrf2 antibody.B, the cells were cotransfected with the hNQO1-ARE-luciferase reporter construct (80 ng/well), CMV-β-galactosidase (20 ng/well), CA PI3-kinase (40 ng/well), and DN Nrf2 (5 ng/well).

Selective PI3-kinase inhibitors, however, significantly decreased both ARE activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 by tBHQ. In addition, ARE activation by constitutively active PI3-kinase was blocked completely by dominant negative Nrf2, demonstrating the critically important role for PI3-kinase in Nrf2-dependent ARE activation. Recent publications have looked at the relationship between MAP kinases and the regulation of the ARE. Yu et al. (38Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) reported increased Erk2 activity by tBHQ and positive regulation of ARE by Erk1/2 in HepG2 cells. In contrast, Alam et al. (39Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M.K. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) reported that cadmium increased phospo-Erk1/2, but inhibition of Erk1/2 did not effect heme oxygenase-1 induction in MCF-7 cells. Recently, Zipper and Mulcahy (4Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) published evidence that phospho-Erk1/2 was increased by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and proposed a positive role for Erk1/2 in the regulation of the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase gene and its ARE in HepG2 cells. However, in the present study with IMR-32 cells, modulation of Erk1/2 activity did not effect Nrf2-dependent ARE activation. Another MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, also has been suggested to regulate the ARE positively (4Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 39Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M.K. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In our system, the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase by SB 203580 did not effect tBHQ-induced hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression. 2J. M. Lee and J. A. Johnson, unpublished observations. The data show that strong Erk1/2 activators such as LY 294002 and NGF do not induce ARE activation in IMR-32 cells. In fact, LY 294002 significantly inhibited ARE activation in these neuroblastoma cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that activation of Erk1/2 does not necessarily lead to activation of the ARE in all cell types studied and that the role of MAP kinases in regulating ARE-driven gene expression is probably cell type-specific. Despite the controversy surrounding the MAP kinases, it is quite clear that Nrf2 and its translocation to the nucleus are principal to ARE activation in all cell types (3Wild A.C. Moinova H.R.

Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). We have shown that tBHQ treatment dramatically increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nrf2 is released from Keap1 by treatment with tBHQ in IMR-32 cells. However, the mechanism by which Nrf2 is released from the Nrf2-Keap1 complex is not characterized fully. One hypothesis is that protein modification (such as oxidation at cysteine residues) by oxidative stress releases Nrf2 from the Nrf2-Keap1 complex (7Itho K. Chiba T. Takahasi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar, 9Itho K. Wakabayashi N.

Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that pretreatment of antioxidants or antioxidant enzymes did not inhibit hNQO1-ARE activation by tBHQ in IMR-32 cells, implying that hNQO1-ARE activation by tBHQ does not involve oxidative stress (10Lee J.M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A second hypothesis is based on data from Huang et al. (42Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), who reported that tBHQ or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment induced the phosphorylation of Nrf2 through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism leading the release of Nrf2. Again, data from our laboratory suggest that protein kinase C is not involved in ARE activation in IMR-32 cells (30Moehlenkamp J.D. Johnson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A third hypothesis brings us back to the MAP kinases and the potential phosphorylation of Nrf2 at several identified MAP kinase phosphorylation consensus sites throughout the Nrf2 protein (45Hayes J.D. Ellis E.M. Neal G.E. Harrison D.J. Manson M.M. Downes C.P. Wolf C.R. Lane D.P. Cellular Responses to Stress. Portland Press, London, U. K.1999: 141-168Crossref Google Scholar). Although the relevance of these putative phosphorylation sites has not been demonstrated, Yuet al. (46Yu R. Chen C. Mo Y.Y. Hebbar V. Owuor E.D. Tan T.H. Kong A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) have shown that dominant negative Nrf2 blocks MAP/Erk kinase kinase 1-mediated induction of heme oxygenase-1 and activation of the mouse GSTA1-ARE in HepG2 cells. In this study, we implicate PI3-kinase, not MAP kinase, as a key regulatory protein leading to Nrf2 nuclear translocation and subsequent ARE activation in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells. Recently, Kang et al. (40Kang K.W. Ryu J.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) reported that selective PI3-kinase inhibitors decreased rat GSTA2 mRNA induction by sulfur amino acid deprivation in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells. Because the rat GSTA2 promoter contains an ARE, these data are consistent with our finding that NQO1 induction by tBHQ is blocked by LY 294002. In addition, we show that inhibitors of PI3-kinase block hNQO1-ARE reporter gene activation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 induced by tBHQ. Furthermore, the data indicate that dominant negative Nrf2 completely blocked the increased hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression by constitutively active PI3-kinase. Insulin, a well known activator of PI3-kinase (37Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), however, did not activate the ARE, suggesting that not all activators of PI3-kinase result in ARE activation. Therefore, we speculate that the PI3-kinase responsible for ARE activation is an insulin-independent PI3-kinase or phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase (21Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others propose that increased expression of ARE-driven genes contribute to the ability of cells to tolerate a variety of chemical-induced stresses. Murphy and co-workers (47Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that pretreatment (24 h) of rodent neuroblastoma cells with compounds that activate the ARE and induce NQO1 protects cells from H2O2 and dopamine-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, these investigators demonstrated that the stable overexpression of NQO1 in this cell line did not confer resistance to cytotoxicity, suggesting that the regulation of multiple genes is required for protection. Preliminary data from our laboratory also indicate that pretreatment (24 h) of IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells with tBHQ protects cells from H2O2toxicity. 3J. Li and J. A. Johnson, unpublished observations. Furthermore, recently published studies using Nrf2 null mice show that these mice are more sensitive to butylated hydroxytoluene-induced pulmonary toxicity (48Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar) and acetaminophen-induced hepatic toxicity (49Enomoto A. Itoh K. Nagayoshi E. Haruta J. Kimura T. O'Connor T. Harada T. Yamamoto M. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 59: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The increased sensitivity to these chemicals was correlated with a lower expression of ARE-driven genes in the respective tissues. These data demonstrate the importance of understanding how different tissues or cell types control the expression of ARE-driven genes and the potential impact of modulating their expression on cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W1999307044,"The ribonucleoprotein telomerase holoenzyme is minimally composed of a catalytic subunit, hTERT, and its associated template RNA component, hTR. We have previously found two additional components of the telomerase holoenzyme, the chaperones p23 and heat shock protein (hsp) 90, both of which are required for efficient telomerase assembly <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Both hsp90 and p23 bind specifically to hTERT and influence its proper assembly with the template RNA, hTR. We report here that the hsp70 chaperone also associates with hTERT in the absence of hTR and dissociates when telomerase is folded into its active state, similar to what occurs with other chaperone targets. Our data also indicate that hsp90 and p23 remain associated with functional telomerase complexes, which differs from other hsp90-folded enzymes that require only a transient hsp90·p23 binding. Our data suggest that components of the hsp90 chaperone complex, while required for telomerase assembly, remain associated with active enzyme, which may ultimately provide critical insight into the biochemical properties of telomerase assembly."

This region contains a conserved AP-1 binding site and an osteoblast-specific element 2 (OSE2), which is recognized by members of the Cbfa/Runt family of transcription factors. Both elements act cooperatively and are absolutely required for PTH-dependent promoter activation. In agreement with the crucial role of AP-1 and Cbfa/Runt transcription factors in osteosarcoma cell lines, expression of MMP13 is reduced in mice lacking c-fos and is completely absent incbfa1 −/− embryos (9Porte D.

Since no changes in Cbfa/Runt protein or RNA levels were detectable after PTH treatment, posttranslational modifications of Cbfa1 in the signaling pathway for PTH-induced mmp13 promoter activation was suggested. Indeed, Cbfa1 was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by PKA, a major target of the PTH/PTHrP receptor pathway. Additionally, PTH stimulated the transactivation capacity of Cbfa1 through a PKA site within the C-terminal transactivation domain (18Selvamurugan N. Pulumati M.R. Tyson D.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol.

The close proximity of the AP-1 and OSE2 sites and their cooperative function in response to PTH in osteoblastic cells suggest a physical interaction between AP-1 and Cbfa/Runt transcription factors.

Here, we demonstrate for the first time a direct interaction between AP-1 and Cbfa/Runt transcription factors in vitro as well as in cultured cells. The leucine zipper of c-Jun or c-Fos and the Runt domain of Cbfa/Runt proteins were sufficient for interaction. Additionally, c-Fos was able to interact with a C-terminal part of Cbfa/Runt proteins sharing a conserved repression domain. Furthermore, we identified a new proximal OSE2 site overlapping with the TRE element in the murine and rat mmp13 promoter. Transient transfection assays in fibroblasts and PTH-treated osteosarcoma cells demonstrated that interaction between Cbfa/Runt proteins and AP-1 and the presence of a functional proximal OSE2 site are required for synergistic activity on the mmp13 promoter. These data provide evidence for a direct interaction between AP-1 and Cbfa/Runt transcription factors in the process of PTH-induced expression of MMP13 and for a new functional composite OSE2/TRE element. pGST-Cbfa1 fusion protein resulted from insertion of the BamHI/EcoRI fragment of Cbfa1 (58Komori T.

The following primers were used: TRE/sdm-A (5′-CACACCCCAAAGTACTGACTCATCACTATC-3′) and TRE/sdm-B (5′-GATAGTGATGAGTCAGTACTTTGGGGTGTG-3′). pRSV-lacZ plasmid was kindly provided by T. Wirth. Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21pLysS bacteria (Stratagene) cultured in 300 ml of TY medium (10 g of tryptone/peptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 1 g of casaminoacids, 1 liter of H2O, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin) in the presence of 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), and lysis was performed using the PP100 buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8; 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/μl pepstatin). 250 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were mixed with the cell lysate and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation, and subsequently the beads were washed three or four times with 1 ml of PP100 buffer. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments, the recombinant proteins were eluted from the beads using an elution buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm glutathione). The yield of the purification and the relative amount of recombinant proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. For GST pull-down assays, equal amounts of purified recombinant GST fusion proteins were mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) andin vitro translated c-Jun or c-Fos proteins (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems; Promega). Alternatively, cell lysates prepared with PP100 buffer from PTH-treated or untreated UMR106 cells or transiently transfected HEK293 cells were used. After incubation (1 h at 4 °C), the beads were washed three or four times with 1 ml of PP100 buffer, and the coprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel. GST pull-down assays within vitro translated proteins were analyzed by autoradiography. GST pull-down assays with cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot. For co-immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates prepared with PP100 buffer were first precleared by incubation (30 min, 4 °C) with 10 mg of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then were mixed with 10 mg of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads and 2 μg of monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C with gentle rotation, the protein A-coupled Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PP100 buffer, and co-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot. Western blots were performed as described (40Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Ullmer C. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T.

EMSA were performed with 2–4 μg of protein of nuclear extracts and with 30,000–50,000 cpm of a32P-radiolabeled probe as described (41Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F.

Human HEK293 embryonic kidney cells and mouse F9 embryonic carcinoma cells were transiently transfected according to the calcium phosphate method as described by Angel et al. (43Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Rat UMR106 osteosarcoma cells were transfected by electroporation using the 0.4-cm cuvettes and setting the Gene-pulser (Bio-Rad) to 0.25 kV and 960 microfarads. Transfected cells were split on two 94-mm dishes and cultured overnight. For PTH stimulation, after a 24-h culture, transfected cells were treated for 8 h with PTH. Measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was performed as described (40Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Ullmer C. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1655-1663Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). pRSV-lacZ was co-transfected in all experiments, and β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize for different transfection efficiencies in the individual experiments. A minimum of three independent transfections were performed and S.D. values were calculated. To address the question of whether AP-1 and Cbfa/Runt transcription factors could directly interact with each other, we performed in vitro pull-down assays using purified GST-Cbfa1 fusion proteins and in vitro translated35S-labeled c-Jun or c-Fos proteins (Fig.1 b, lane 1). Association with c-Jun and c-Fos was observed using GST-Cbfa1 but not using GST alone (Fig. 1 b, lanes 2 and 3). Comparison of the input amount ofin vitro translated c-Jun or c-Fos with the amount of the proteins pulled down by GST-Cbfa1 suggests a higher affinity of Cbfa1 for c-Jun as for c-Fos. Posttranslational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) of c-Jun or c-Fos occurred in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (38Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar) and were visible as additional shifted bands in the SDS-PAGE but did not influence the interaction with GST-Cbfa1. Vice versa, in vitro translated35S-labeled Cbfa1 was pulled down by recombinant GST-c-Jun or GST-c-Fos. In agreement with the initial data, the binding activity between Cbfa1 and c-Jun was stronger than that between Cbfa1 and c-Fos (data not shown). Next we determined the domains of Cbfa1 responsible for the interaction with c-Jun or c-Fos. Therefore, Cbfa1 deletion mutants fused to GST were generated (Fig. 1 a), and purified proteins were incubated with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled c-Jun or c-Fos proteins in GST pull-down assays. c-Jun could associate with GST-Cbfa1 deletion mutants lacking either the C- or N-terminal region or even both, but not with mutants missing the Runt domain of Cbfa1 (Fig. 1 b). Similarly, c-Fos could interact with GST-Cbfa1 deletion mutants lacking either the C or N terminus or both (Fig. 1 b). These data demonstrate that the Runt domain is sufficient for interaction with c-Jun or c-Fos. However, additional regions within the Cbfa1 protein were found to be involved in the association; c-Fos could be pulled down by GST-Cbfa1ΔRN1 and GST-Cbfa1ΔRN2, the mutants lacking the Runt domain but containing the C terminus of Cbfa1 (Fig. 1 b, lanes 6and 9). The interaction between Cbfa1 and c-Fos was abolished when, in addition to the Runt domain, the extreme C-terminal end of Cbfa1 was deleted (Fig. 1 b, lane 10). Furthermore, deletion of the N terminus of Cbfa1 resulted in decreased binding of c-Jun but enhanced binding of c-Fos, suggesting that binding affinity for either c-Jun or c-Fos could be specifically regulated by motifs in this region. To investigate if c-Jun and c-Fos are able to interact simultaneously with Cbfa1, we used either full-length GST-Cbfa1 or GST-Cbfa1ΔC fusion proteins together with in vitro translated c-Jun and/or c-Fos labeled with [35S]methionine for pull-down assays (Fig. 1 c). Consistent with the previous results, both c-Jun and c-Fos associate with GST-Cbfa1 as well as GST-Cbfa1ΔC (Fig.1 c). Although c-Jun and c-Fos interact with the Runt domain, no difference between the pull-down assays with c-Jun and c-Fos alone or with the combination of the two proteins was detectable, even if the GST-Cbfa1ΔC mutant was used, which lacks the additional binding site for c-Fos. Consequently, we suggest that c-Jun and c-Fos could associate with Cbfa1 as a monomer or as a Jun-Fos heterodimer and possibly as a Jun homodimer. Cbfa2 is another Cbfa/Runt family member that has been postulated to bind to the upstream OSE2 site on the mmp13 promoter (9Porte D. Tuckermann J. Becker M. Baumann B. Teurich S. Higgins T. Owen M.J. Schorpp-Kistner M. Angel P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The members of the Cbfa/Runt family are highly conserved within the Runt domain and share homology in their C-terminal part. To confirm a possible interaction of c-Jun and c-Fos with Cbfa2, we performed pull-down assays with recombinant full-length GST-Cbfa2 and deletion mutants missing either the C-terminal part (GST-Cbfa2ΔC) or the N-terminal part together with the Runt domain (GST-Cbfa2ΔRN). c-Jun could associate with GST-Cbfa2 and GST-Cbfa2ΔC (Fig. 1 d,lanes 1–3). Similar to Cbfa1, the deletion of the Runt domain resulted in a strong reduction of the association between c-Jun and Cbfa2 (Fig. 1 d, lane 4). c-Fos also int"

In plants, two cDNAs have been cloned from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) by functional complementation of the heme auxotrophic, Protox-deficientE. coli hemG mutant (13Lermontova I. Kruse E. Mock H.-P.

One cDNA encodes a 548-amino acid protein (PPX-I) containing a putative 50-amino acid plastidal targeting sequence, whereas the other cDNA encodes a 504-amino acid protein (PPX-II). The deduced amino acid sequences of PPX-I and PPX-II are only 27.3% identical. The translation product of PPX-I cDNA translocates to chloroplasts, whereas PPX-II are targeted to mitochondria, suggesting that tobacco Protox exists in chloroplasts and mitochondria as isoenzymes (13Lermontova I. Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8895-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Since Protox is the final common enzyme in the chlorophyll and heme biosynthetic pathways in plants, Protox must play a role in distributing Proto IX to both pathways. Accurate examination of the transport and subcellular localization of plant Protox is important for an understanding of tetrapyrrole precursor flux and regulation of tetrapyrrole synthesis. We have recently reported the characterization and subcellular localization of plastidal Protox (Protox I) in spinach (14Che F.-S. Watanabe N. Iwano M. Inokuchi H. Takayama S. Yoshida S. Isogai A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protox I cDNA (gene name is SO-POX1) encodes a 563-amino acid, 60-kDa protein with a putative chloroplast transit peptide. N-terminal sequence analysis of mature Protox I purified from chloroplasts by immunoprecipitation revealed that the Protox I precursor is cleaved at Ser-49. The predicted transit peptide (Met-1 to Cys-48), when analyzed as a GFP-fusion construct, was found to be sufficient for targeting and transport of the fused protein into chloroplasts. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis using electron microscopy has shown that spinach Protox I preferentially associates with the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane, while a small fraction of Protox I is located on the stromal side of the inner envelope membrane (14Che F.-S. Watanabe N. Iwano M. Inokuchi H. Takayama S. Yoshida S. Isogai A. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Knowledge of plant mitochondrial Protox is poor in comparison with that of plastidal Protox. In animal and yeast cells, Protox activity was mainly detected in the inner mitochondrial membrane and solubilized from the membrane by several detergents (3Camadro J.-M. Thome F. Brouillet N. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32085-32091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Siepker L.J. Ford M. de Kock R. Kramer S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3835-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the Protox was intimately associated with this structure. In plant cells, Protox activity and tobacco PPX-II protein itself have also been observed in mitochondria (13Lermontova I. Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8895-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, there have been no investigations into the precise suborganellar location of Protox in plant mitochondria. Furthermore, little is known about the transport mechanism of mitochondrial Protox. In general, proteins transported into the mitochondria have an N-terminal targeting peptide, which is processed after transport is complete (16Graser E. Sjöling S. Tanudji M. Whelan J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 311-338Google Scholar). However, tobacco PPX-II and other known homologs of PPX-II do not possess the typical mitochondrial targeting sequence at their N termini (Ref. 17Volrash, S. L., Johnson, M. A., Potter, S. L., Ward, E. R., and Heifetz, P. B. (September 4, 1997) International Patent WO 97/3201.Google Scholar; accession nos. AB025102and AJ225107). Actually, in vitro transport experiments have shown that tobacco PPX-II is transported to mitochondria without any size reduction (13Lermontova I. Kruse E. Mock H.-P. Grimm B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8895-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this occurs is not yet understood.Protox is the target enzyme of phthalimide-type herbicides such asN-[4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-propagyloxy]-phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide (S23142) and diphenylether-type herbicides such as 5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]-2-nitrobenzoic acid (18Duke S.O. Lydon J. Becerril J.M. Sherman T.D. Lehnen L.P. Matsumoto H. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1994; 559: 191-204Google Scholar). In plant cells, the inhibition of Protox by the herbicides ultimately results in massive accumulation of Protogen, which then leaks out of the plastid (19Jacobs J.M. Jacobs N.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cytosolic protogen is rapidly oxidized to Proto IX by nonspecific, herbicide-resistant peroxidases that are bound to the plasma membrane. Highly reactive singlet oxygen generated by light activation of Proto IX provokes membrane lipid peroxidation, leading to cell death (18Duke S.O. Lydon J. Becerril J.M. Sherman T.D. Lehnen L.P. Matsumoto H. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1994; 559: 191-204Google Scholar). We have previously obtained S23142-resistant tobacco cultured cells (YZI-1S) by stepwise selection with the herbicide (20Ichinose K. Che F.-S. Kimura Y. Matsunobu A. Sato F. Yoshida S. J. Plant Physiol. 1995; 146: 693-698Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Several lines of data provide strong evidence that the herbicide resistance of YZI-1S cells is due to the overproduction of mitochondrial Protox, even though the primary target of the herbicide is chloroplast Protox. In the resistant cells, excess Protogen generated by inhibition of chloroplast Protox is rapidly utilized for heme synthesis in mitochondria by the abnormally high level of mitochondrial Protox, thus preventing the accumulation of Proto IX (21Watanabe N. Che F.-S. Iwano M. Takayama S. Nakano T. Yoshida S. Isogai A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that mitochondrial Protox is also important in preventing the accumulation of the photosensitizer, Proto IX, and in maintaining the flow of tetrapyrrole precursors for heme and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Therefore, detailed knowledge about the subcellular localization and transport mechanism of plant mitochondrial Protox is important for clarification of not only the control mechanism of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis but also the mode of action of the herbicide resistance.In the present study, we report the molecular cloning, subcellular localization, and transport mechanism of spinach Protox II, which has high sequence identity to the tobacco mitochondrial Protox. Surprisingly, this protein was located not only in mitochondria but also in chloroplasts. Two translation products of different sizes (Protox IIL and Protox IIS) were produced from Protox II mRNA using two in-frame initiation codons and then were transported into chloroplasts and mitochondria, respectively. It has been thought that the known plant proteins that are dually targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria have an ambiguous N-terminal targeting sequence, which interacts nonspecifically with import machinery (or chaperon) for both mitochondria and chloroplasts (22Small I. Wintz H. Akashi K. Mireau H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 265-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The manner of the dual targeting in Protox II is clearly different from the above system. We have shown here for the first time the existence of a novel mechanism of intracellular targeting for compartmentalizing protein isoforms in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (Protox,1 EC 1.3.3.4) is the final enzyme in the common pathway of chlorophyll and heme biosynthesis, catalyzing the six-electron oxidation from protoporphyrinogen IX (Protogen) to protoporphyrin IX (Proto IX) (1Dailey H.A.

One protein, AVT1, is required for the vacuolar uptake of large neutral amino acids including tyrosine, glutamine, asparagine, isoleucine, and leucine. Three proteins, AVT3, AVT4, and AVT6, are involved in amino acid efflux from the vacuole and, as such, are the first to be shown directly to transport compounds from the lumen of an acidic intracellular organelle. This function is consistent with the role of the vacuole in protein degradation, whereby accumulated amino acids are exported to the cytosol. Protein AVT6 is responsible for the efflux of aspartate and glutamate, an activity that would account for their exclusion from vacuoles in vivo. Transport by AVT1 and AVT6 requires ATP for function and is abolished in the presence of nigericin, indicating that the same pH gradient can drive amino acid transport in opposing directions. Efflux of tyrosine and other large neutral amino acids by the two closely related proteins, AVT3 and AVT4, is similar in terms of substrate specificity to transport systemh described in mammalian lysosomes and melanosomes. These findings suggest that yeast AVT transporter function has been conserved to control amino acid flux in vacuolar-like organelles.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9733-9750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are specific for the neurotransmitters γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)1and glycine. These proteins differ in sequence, structure, and bioenergetics from the previously characterized family of vesicular transporters that package monoamines and acetylcholine (for current reviews, see Refs. 4Masson J.

Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Common to all of these transporters is the fact that the movement of substrate from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles is driven by a proton electrochemical gradient that is generated by the action of a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase and involves the exchange of lumenal protons. A search for other vertebrate proteins related to the GABA-glycine vesicular transporters has led recently to the isolation and expression of cDNAs that, surprisingly, code for Na+-coupled plasma membrane carriers. The system N transporters from rat (SN1, 6) and mouse (NAT1, 7) are expressed in the liver, kidney, and heart and within brain astrocytes and are specific for glutamine, histidine, and to a lesser degree, asparagine. Amino acid transport by these proteins is unique in that it also involves an exchange of protons (6Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Krizaj D. Barber D. Storm-Mathisen J. Copenhagen D.R. Edwards R.H.

One protein (termed SA1, ATA2, or SAT2) is expressed in most tissues and, compared with system N, has a wider substrate specificity that includes glutamine as well as most of the smaller neutral amino acids. The second system A carrier, referred to as GlnT, transports a similar set of amino acids but is highly expressed in the brain, specifically within neurons that release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (11Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Other characterized members of this growing protein family include the group of plant amino acid/auxin permeases, of which 12 proteins have now been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (13Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1415: 306-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These permeases actively transport amino acids into the plant cell and presumably utilize an amino acid/H+ symport mechanism. The vacuole of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a highly complex organelle that is involved in both the enzymatic degradation of proteins and the homeostatic control of a vast assortment of solutes including ions and amino acids (for a review, see Ref. 14Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like synaptic vesicles, vacuoles maintain an acidic internal environment through the action of a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase that generates a proton electrochemical gradient of 180 mV (ΔpH of 1.7 units) across the vacuolar-membrane (15Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, the equivalent to vacuoles and the major site for protein degradation is the lysosome. Both organelles support a variety of carrier-mediated transport systems, many of which rely on the imposed pH gradient as a driving force. Although several amino acid transport systems have been described in purified vacuoles (16Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Acta. 1991; 1071: 351-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the proteins responsible for these activities have yet to be identified. Sequence analysis of the complete S. cerevisiae genome has predicted seven yeast proteins of unknown function that are related to the UNC-47/VGAT/VIAAT family. Because these proteins do not resemble any of the characterized permeases required for the cellular uptake of amino acids, we have investigated the role of this new family of yeast proteins in vacuolar amino acid transport. Genotypes of the S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are given in Table I. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in either YPD or selective SD medium (20Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). To knock out each of theAVT genes, the entire coding region was replaced with the appropriate selective marker gene. Marker genes were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the plasmids pRS423 (HIS3), pRS424 (TRP1), pRS425 (LEU2), or pRS426 (URA3) (gifts of Joachim Lee) with 60-mer oligonucleotides of which 40 nucleotides corresponded to either the 5′- or 3′-flanking portion of the AVT gene to be disrupted. Transformation of the appropriate haploid yeast strains (21Chen D.C. Yang B.C. Kuo T.T. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) was carried out with gel-purified polymerase chain reaction products followed by selection on SD medium. Correct homologous recombination events were confirmed by chromosomal polymerase chain reaction analysis of the isolated transformants.Table IS. cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeYJL306Mata leu2–3,112 ura3–52,trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM11Δavt1∷URA3 Δavt2∷TRP1 Δavt3∷LEU2 Δavt4∷HIS3 leu2–3,112,ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM12Mata Δavt1∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM13Mata Δavt2∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM14Mata Δavt3∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM15Mata Δavt4∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM16Mata Δavt5∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM17Mata Δavt6∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM18Mata Δavt7∷HIS3, leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM22Δavt1∷URA3 Δavt3∷LEU2 Δavt4∷HIS3 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM33Mata Δavt5∷HIS3 Δavt6∷TRP1 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM35Mata Δavt5∷HIS3 Δavt6∷TRP1 Δavt7∷URA3 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200YSM36Mata Δavt3∷HIS3 Δavt4∷URA3 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 trp1–289 his3-Δ200 Open table in a new tab Yeast vacuoles were isolated using a modified version of the procedure described by Kakinumaet al. (15Kakinuma Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10859-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 500-ml cultures were grown in YPD medium to an A600 of 3.5–4.0, and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,400 ×g for 5 min. Cells were washed once with 30 ml of distilled water at room temperature and converted to spheroplasts by resuspending them in 30 ml of 1 m Sorbitol and adding 500 μl of a 4 mg/ml zymolyase 100T (ICN) solution in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% glycerol. The culture was shaken gently for 1 h at 30 °C, and spheroplasts were collected at 2,200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed twice in 20 ml of ice-cold 1 m Sorbitol. All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were lysed by resuspension in 16 ml of Buffer A (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 12% Ficoll 400, and 0.42 mm Pefabloc SC) and homogenized by 15 strokes in a 15 ml Dounce with tight pestle. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2,200 ×g for 10 min, and 12 ml of the supernatant was divided between two 89 × 14-mm polyallomer tubes. Each sample was overlaid with another 6 ml of Buffer A and centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman SW41 Ti rotor. The floating vacuoles were collected and completely suspended in 400 μl of 2× Buffer C (1× Buffer C = 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm MgCl2, and 12.5 mm KCl) and 0.42 mm Pefabloc SC before diluting with an equal volume of 1× Buffer C and 0.42 mm Pefabloc SC. The final vacuole suspension, which was typically at a concentration of 1.25–1.5 μg/μl as determined by the Bradford assay, was either used immediately or frozen at −80 °C in 200-μl aliquots. Standard reaction conditions included 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 4 mmMgCl2, 4 mm KCl, 4 mm ATP, and 50 μm unlabeled amino acid with 1 μCi of3H-amino acid and 10–20 μg of purified vacuoles per 100 μl of reaction volume. Where indicated, nigericin was also included at a final concentration of 6.5 μm. Generally, reaction mixtures minus vacuoles were preincubated for 1 min at 30 °C. After the addition of vacuoles, duplicate (or quadruplicate in the case of aspartate and glutamate) 100-μl samples were removed at the appropriate times. Vacuoles were recovered quickly by suction on a membrane filter (Millipore HA; 0.45 μm) and washed immediately three times with 2 ml of ice-cold 1× Buffer C. Filters were dried, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 5 ml of Filtron-X (National Diagnostics). All radiolabeled amino acids were obtained from New England Nuclear Laboratories. A homology search of the complete S. cerevisiae genome with VGAT sequences identified seven open reading frames that we have designated AVT1–7 foramino acid vacuolartransport (see below). Along with VGAT and its orthologues, the yeast AVT proteins belong to a large family of proteins that includes the amino acid/auxin permease family of plants (13Young G.B. Jack D.L. Smith D.W. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Like other members of this family, the yeast proteins contain a core region of ∼400–450 amino acids that harbors 9–11 predicted hydrophobic transmembrane domains. In addition to this apparent conservation in topological features, a sequence alignment (see Fig. 1 C) reveals a number of amino acid positions (usually within transmembrane domains) where invariant or highly conserved amino acid residues are utilized. Sizes of the predicted yeast proteins range from 448 to 713 amino acids, with the greatest disparity due to extended and divergent hydrophilic N-terminal sequences in the case of AVT1, AVT3, and AVT4. The yeast AVT proteins can be further subdivided into four main branches defined by AVT1, AVT2, AVT3/4, and AVT5/6/7 (Fig. 1 A). As shown, some of these yeast proteins are more closely related to known transporters from distant species such as worms and mammals than they are to other yeast branch members. Interestingly, AVT3 and AVT4 appear to be more highly evolutionarily conserved because these proteins show significant homology (greater than 25% identity) to a number of predicted proteins from C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, two organisms whose entire genome sequences have now been determined. The relationship of these predicted proteins to AVT3 and AVT4 as compared with UNC-47 is shown in Fig. 1 B, whereas their amino acid sequences have been aligned in Fig. 1 D.Figure 1Seven yeast proteins are related to the UNC-47 family of amino acid transporters.

Hein C. Grenson M. Jauniaux J.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), are involved in the use of GABA as a nitrogen source. To investigate the potential role of theAVT genes in GABA flux and to establish a genetic system to study AVT protein function, we decided to test strains carrying deletedAVT genes for GABA-specific growth defects. Preliminary knockout experiments in diploid strains followed by sporulation and tetrad analysis indicated that the AVT genes were not essential for growth. This allowed the creation, by direct transformation (see “Experimental Procedures” for details), of a variety of isogenic haploid strains carrying both the single and multiple gene deletions shown in Table I. We tested these strains for their ability to grow on 1 mmGABA as the sole nitrogen source and found no discernible difference from the wild type. Furthermore, we disrupted theUGA1 gene (23André B. Jauniaux J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which codes for GABA transaminase that converts GABA to glutamate, in each of the single AVTdeletion strains and observed no differential growth on YPD medium containing high levels (50 mm) of GABA compared with the Δuga1 strain alone. Finally, we have observed that GABA is not actively taken up by purified yeast vacuoles, even at high (500 μm) concentrations (Fig.2 A, see below). Seven amino acid uptake systems have been described in yeast vacuoles (16Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11505-11508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11509-11511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including three that are specific for basic amino acids, the most abundant amino acids found in this organelle (24Kitamoto K. Yoshizawa K. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2683-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Wiemken A. Dürr M. Arch. Microbiol. 1974; 101: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the AVT proteins were involved in these processes, we tested vacuoles purified from the created Δavt strains for the uptake of radiolabeled amino acids. Shown in Fig. 2 A is the ATP-dependent uptake of lysine (10-fold) and arginine (5-fold) in 4 min by vacuoles purified from wild type yeast. Both activities are extremely sensitive to nigericin, a K+/H+ antiporter that disrupts the pH gradient without affecting the electrical gradient. However, robust lysine, arginine, and histidine transport were also observed in vacuoles obtained from any of the AVT gene-deleted strains tested. The results obtained for lysine and arginine with theΔavt1, Δavt2, Δavt3,Δavt4 quadruple mutant and the Δavt5,Δavt6, Δavt7 triple mutant are shown in Fig.2 B. However, the finding that lysine influx is unaffected by AVT protein function allowed us to accurately quantify the activity of purified vacuolar fractions, greatly facilitating the comparative analysis described below. Distinct transport systems have also been described for tyrosine, glutamine/asparagine, isoleucine/leucine, and phenylalanine/tryptophan (17Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11505-11508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like lysine, tyrosine was also concentrated ∼10-fold in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3 B). This uptake was decreased dramatically in the presence of nigericin and was not further reduced by the addition of valinomycin, a K+ ionophore that would dissipate any remaining electrical gradients (data not shown). Our first indication that some of the AVT proteins might be involved in vacuolar amino acid transport came from the observation that tyrosine uptake was completely eliminated in theΔavt1 mutant (Fig. 3 B), whereas high lysine activity was retained (Fig. 3 A). Although tyrosine uptake was shown to be blocked in these vacuoles in vitro, high levels of tyrosine (0.5 and 5 mm) were not toxic to theΔavt1 strain (data not shown). Surprisingly, AVT1 was also required for the active uptake of both glutamine and isoleucine, which were previously thought to be transported by separate carriers. The accumulation of these amino acids was reduced ∼5-fold (Fig.4 A) and 8-fold (Fig.4 B), respectively, in vacuoles purified fromΔavt1 compared with the wild type.Figure 4Both AVT1-dependent influx and synergistic efflux by AVT3 and AVT4 determine steady-state levels of tyrosine, glutamine, and isoleucine. Glutamine (A), isoleucine (B), and tyrosine (C) uptake assays in the presence of ATP by vacuoles purified from the single and double deletion strains shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further testing of vacuoles purified from the other AVT deletion strains resulted in the finding that large neutral amino acids could accumulate more rapidly and to higher levels when compared with wild type. As shown in Fig. 4, tyrosine, glutamine, and isoleucine uptakes were all increased in the Δavt3, Δavt4 double mutant. The effect was more dramatic for tyrosine and isoleucine (greater than 2-fold) but was also significant for glutamine. One interpretation of these observations was that there exists an activity that exports these amino acids to the outside. Thus, AVT3 and AVT4, which share ∼40% sequence identity, appear to act synergistically in this process because single mutants had only partial phenotypes (Fig.4). We note that for each amino acid, the removal of AVT4 appeared to have a more pronounced effect, and, in fact, the uptake of isoleucine was unaltered in vacuoles purified from Δavt3. We conclude from these observations that AVT4 may be a more efficient transporter than AVT3 under the given in vitro assay conditions. One possibility is that AVT4 possesses a higher affinity for the various substrates. As expected, the accumulation of large neutral amino acids in the Δavt3, Δavt4 double mutant was completely eliminated with the further removal of AVT1 (Δavt1, Δavt3, Δavt4 triple mutant; data not shown). Sato et al. (17Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11505-11508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) observed that unlabeled tryptophan or phenylalanine did not compete with tyrosine or leucine for vacuolar uptake and therefore must be actively transported by a protein or proteins other than AVT1. In our hands, uptake assays with [3H]tryptophan appeared to result in some degree of vacuolar accumulation, but over very high background levels due to nonspecific filter binding (data not shown). This has made it difficult to adequately interpret the data and to assess relatively small strain-specific differences. However, we have routinely observed a lack of ATP-dependent tryptophan uptake in vacuoles isolated from Δavt1 but cannot yet offer an explanation for this apparent discrepancy with the previously published competition studies. Previous reports (16Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2079-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sato T. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11505-11508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that many amino acids, including methionine, serine, glycine, cysteine, proline, valine, threonine, and alanine, are not actively taken up by vacuoles in vitro. With the discovery that the inactivation of the amino acid effluxers AVT3 and AVT4 resulted in higher accumulation of some neutral amino acids, we retested glycine and proline in Δavt3,Δavt4 vacuoles and observed no ATP-dependent uptake (data not shown). Vacuoles purified from wild type cells accumulated less glutamate and aspartate in the presence of ATP (Fig.5, A and B). As could be demonstrated for amino acid uptake, this apparent ATP-dependent efflux of acidic amino acids was sensitive to nigericin. To distinguish between efflux, the actual displacement of substrate from the lumen of the vacuole to the outside, and an alternative phenomenon such as decreased inward diffusion when a proton electrochemical gradient was imposed on the system, we carried out the assays shown in Fig. 6. Vacuoles were preloaded with [3H]glutamate in the absence of ATP and then monitored for amino acid content after the addition of ATP or ATP plus nigericin. Consistent with an active efflux mechanism, glutamate levels decreased steadily in the presence of ATP alone. Again, efflux was not observed in the presence of nigericin (Fig.6 A) nor from vacuoles prepared from the Δavt6mutant (Fig. 6 B, see below).Figure 6AVT6, but not AVT5 or AVT7, is required for glutamate and aspartate transport out of vacuoles. Efflux assays using vacuoles purified from either (A) wild type or (B) Δavt6 strains. Vacuoles were preloaded with [3H]glutamate for 5 min at 30 °C. Samples (0 min) were removed immediately before or 1 min and 4 min after the addition of ATP or ATP plus nigericin. Accumulation in 4 min of (C) glutamate and (D) aspartate in the absence or presence of ATP or ATP plus nigericin in vacuoles isolated from the indicated mutant strains is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further tested various AVT deletion strains for ATP-dependent efflux of either glutamate (Fig.6 C) or aspartate (Fig. 6 C) and observed that both activities were lost only in vacuoles purified from Δavt6. Even though AVT5 and AVT7 are 50% and 35% identical, respectively, to AVT6, wild type activity was retained in the Δavt5 andΔavt7 mutant strains. In addition, glutamate and aspartate levels were not further altered in a Δavt5,Δavt6 double mutant (Fig. 6) or in a Δavt5,Δavt6, Δavt7 triple mutant (data not shown). The potential inability of the Δavt5, Δavt6mutant strain to pump acidic amino acids from vacuoles in vivo did not alter its growth (data not shown) on medium containing high glutamate (0.5 m, pH 7.0). We have been unable to assign any vacuolar amino acid transport role to proteins AVT2, AVT5, or AVT7. To determine (a) if these proteins are associated with vacuoles and (b) whether transporters with a definite vacuolar function are localized exclusively to this organelle, we have carried out preliminary indirect immunofluorescence using HA-tagged molecules (data not shown). To summarize briefly, AVT1HA, AVT4HA, and AVT6HA (all proteins with vacuolar function) display a staining pattern that is indistinguishable from that of VMA2, the 60-kDa B subunit of the vacuolar ATPase. A similar pattern was obtained with AVT7HA, but in addition, strong immunoreactivity was observed at the plasma membrane in a large fraction of cells. On the other hand, AVT2HA expression was distinct and resulted in"

We show that the plasma membrane expression of a member of the ClC family of Cl−channels, human CLC-3 (hCLC-3), a 90-kDa protein, is regulated by CaMKII. We cloned the full-length hCLC-3 gene from the human colonic tumor cell line T84, previously shown to express a CaMKII-activated Cl− conductance (ICl,CaMKII), and transfected this gene into the mammalian epithelial cell line tsA, which lacks endogenous expression of ICl,CaMKII. Biotinylation experiments demonstrated plasma membrane expression of hCLC-3 in the stably transfected cells. In whole cell patch clamp experiments, autonomously active CaMKII was introduced into tsA cells stably transfected with hCLC-3 via the patch pipette. Cells transfected with the hCLC-3 gene showed a 22-fold increase in current density over cells expressing the vector alone. Kinase-dependent current expression was abolished in the presence of the autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII. A mutation of glycine 280 to glutamic acid in the conserved motif in the putative pore region of the channel changed anion selectivity from I− > Cl− to Cl− > I−.

Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The 760-amino acid protein encoded by theClc-3 gene was originally cloned from rat kidney and showed abundant expression in rat brain, most notably in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum (1Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). When expressed in a stably transfected cell line, the rat kidney isoform of the channel showed basal activation, inhibition by phorbol esters, and Ca2+sensitivity (2Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S.

Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) examined rat hepatocytes for Clc-3 expression and found that mRNA for two different isoforms was present; a short form corresponding to the guinea pig clone, and a long form containing a putative 58-amino acid addition at the N terminus of the protein. Both isoforms gave rise to current expression with identical selectivity when transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells; however, they differed in the degree of outward rectification and voltage-dependent inactivation (5Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D. Showalter L. Weinman S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastroint. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adding a further dimension to the controversy, Friedrich and colleagues (6Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) report in a mutational analysis of Clc-4 and Clc-5 that they were unable to detect currents upon Clc-3 expression in Xenopus oocytes or in transfected HEK293 cells. Recent evidence from the studies of Stobrawa et al. (7Stobrawa S. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A. Boesl M. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) in transgenic mice with disrupted Clc-3 demonstrates that the chloride channel is broadly expressed and present in endosomal compartments and neuronal synaptic vesicles. Although theClc-3 knockout mice remained smaller than wild type littermates, they nonetheless remained viable for approximately 1 year. Among the most dramatic effects which Stobrawa and colleagues (7Stobrawa S. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A. Boesl M. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.

The loss of both the hippocampus and photoreceptors was attributed to inadequate acidification of synaptic vesicles. Defects observed in theClc-3-deficient mice lead Stobrawa and colleagues (7Stobrawa S. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A. Boesl M. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) to hypothesize that Clc-3 acts as an anion shunt pathway which maintains charge balance for the proton pump which acidifies the vesicle interior prior to membrane fusion (7Stobrawa S. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A. Boesl M. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The finding that Clc-3 is an intracellular chloride channel expressed in both synaptic as well as endosomal vesicles suggests that it may be in dynamic equilibrium with the plasma membrane at a level which is dependent upon vesicular cycling in the various tissues in which it is expressed. Hence, expression of Clc-3 at surface sites will depend upon a balance between vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane and membrane retrieval. Regulated Ca2+-dependent Cl−conductances have been described in cells types as diverse as neurons, lymphocytes, and secretory epithelia. They regulate cellular volume, excitability, and salt balance. The multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)1 is a major mediator of Ca2+ signaling, is abundantly expressed in the brain, and is found in almost every cell type. Regulation of Cl−channels by CaMKII has been shown in cells from the human colonic tumor cell line, T84 (8Worrell R.T. Frizzell R.A. Am. J.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1794-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the channel or channels mediating the CaMKII-dependent conductance has remained unknown. Given the current controversy in the literature as to the activation pathway for heterologously expressed Clc-3, the ubiquitous expression of the CaMKII-activated Cl− conductance in native cells, and the presence of three possible CaMKII consensus sequences in the predicted amino acid sequence, our aim in the present study was to test the hypothesis that hCLC-3 is a Cl−channel regulated by CaMKII. For this study, we cloned a full-length hCLC-3 gene from T84 cells. This gene was 92% identical to the rat long form ofClc-3 reported by Shimada and colleagues (5Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D. Showalter L. Weinman S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastroint. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface biotinylation experiments demonstrated that at least a portion of hCLC-3 is expressed at the surface of the stably transfected cells. Immunohistochemistry data showed that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ shifted the distribution of CLC-3 from a cytoplasmic, vesicular compartment to apparent surface sites. This translocation step was not required for current expression in the stably transfected cells as demonstrated in high resolution membrane capacitance measurements. We used the whole cell voltage-clamp technique to characterize the gating and selectivity of recombinant hCLC-3 channels stably expressed in a large-T antigen stabilized human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (tsA) cells. Our data show that the functional expression of the recombinant hCLC-3 induces Cl− conductance which is regulated by CaMKII with phenotypic properties of endogenous ICl,CaMKII in secretory epithelia. A mutation in the putative pore region, G280E, produced a characteristic change in anion selectivity from the I− > Br− > Cl− to Cl− > Br− > I− further demonstrating that the transfected channel was responsible for the current in the stably transfected cell line. Full-length hCLC-3 was cloned from a human colonic tumor cell line T84 by RT-PCR using SuperScript Preamplification System (Life Technologies Inc., MD). PCR primers (sense strand, TTGCTATGTCTCTGAGCTGC; antisense strand, AAGTAGATGACTCCCTCAGG) were derived from the hCLC-3 gene cloned from a human retina cDNA library by Borsani et al. (19Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. A comparison of the Borsani et al. (19Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) sequence with the T84 clone which we report reveals two variations. First, two amino acid residues (Glu647 and Phe658) are repeated in the Borsani et al. sequence. Second, a silent mutation at Ile772 (ATT) in the Borsani et al.(19Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) clone corresponds to Ile770 (ATC) in the T84 clone. In order to confirm the differences, we independently cloned the full-length hCLC-3 from tsA. The resultant sequence was consistent with the hCLC-3 cloned from T84 cells (GenBankTMAF172729). The full-length hCLC-3 was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1zeo+ vector (Invitrogen, CA) and transfected into tsA cells using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, CA). Stably transfected clonal cell lines were selected using zeocin (Invitrogen) at 400 μg/ml and maintained at 200 μg/ml. The expression of hCLC-3 was detected by immunoblot analysis, and the homogenicity of the clone used in this study was confirmed ∼80% by immunostaining with hCLC-3-specific antibodies. The glycine at position 280 was mutated to a glutamic acid (G280E) using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Escherichia coli transformed with mutant hCLC-3 were grown at 30 °C. The resultant G280E mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis. Mutant hCLC-3 was co-transfected with pEGFPN1 vector (CLONTECH) into tsA cells at a 10:1 ratio, using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Transiently transfected cells were identified by their expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Whole cell electrophysiology recordings were performed at 48 h post-transfection. Antibodies were produced and affinity purified commercially by Quality Controlled Biochemical (Hopkinton, MA). Two synthetic peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin were used to raise antibodies against hCLC-3 in rabbits. The peptides corresponded to amino acids 59–74 plus an additional cysteine (MTNGGSINSSTHLLDLC) and to amino acids 730–744 with an additional alanine and glutamic acid (GSSRVCFAQHTPSLPAE) in the C terminus. After a second boost, α-hCLC-3 serum was affinity purified using peptide coupled to thiol- or amino-linked gels. The stock concentration was 0.072 mg/ml for α-hCLC-359–74 and 1.03 mg/ml for α-hCLC-3730–744. The specificity of the antibodies was verified by immunoblotting whole cell lysates obtained from HEK293 stable cell lines expressing human CLC-1, rat Clc-2, and human CLC-4 (generous gifts of Drs. K. Blumenthal, A. George, and C. Fahlke). Cultured cells were harvested in H20E1D1 solution (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane and cytosolic fractions were crudely separated by centrifugation of the whole cell lysate at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein was denatured with 1/10 V of 10% SDS and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and heated to 95 °C for 5–8 min. For deglycosylation, the denatured protein (100 μg) was incubated with 5 units of N-glycanase F (Oxford GlycoSciences Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) for 18 h at 37 °C. Total protein (100 μg) was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with α-hCLC-359–74 at a 1:400 dilution or α-hCLC-3730–744 at a 1:3000 dilution, and subsequently with donkey α-rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:2000 dilution for 20 min. Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection. Following the protocol provided by Upstate Biotechnology (NY). Cells cultured on 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of modified RIPA buffer (in mm: Tris-HCl, 50; pH 7.4, NaCl, 150; and Nonidet P-40, 1%) containing proteinase inhibitors. One-third the volume of lysate was diluted with PBS to 1 ml, precipitated with 20 μg of α-hCLC-3730–744, then collected with 100 μl of 50% recombinant Protein A (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated protein was heated to 95 °C for 5–8 min in 1% SDS sample buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. One-fifth volume of the supernatant, prior to or following deglycosylation with 3 units of N-glycanase, was used for the Western blot. The membrane was immunoblotted with α-hCLC-359–74 at a 1:500 dilution. The tsA cells stably transfected with hCLC-3 were grown to ∼80% confluence in a 100-mm dish. The cells were washed three times with PBS, scraped, and pelleted (1,000 ×g, 2 min) into an Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. Sulf-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce) dissolved in PBS (pH 8.0, 0.5 mg/ml) was used to resuspend the cells at a concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml. Incubation took place at 4 °C for 30 min on a rotating wheel. The cells were pelleted and the labeling step was repeated once. To terminate the biotinylation, 1/100 volume of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added and incubated for 3 min. Following incubation, the cells were washed with PBS three times for 2 min, and then immunoprecipitated in modified RIPA buffer with proteinase inhibitors. Total protein (300 μg) from the cell lysate was incubated with 40 μg of α-hCLC-3730–744 or PBS, pulled down with 100 μl of 50% Protein A (Sigma), and solublized in 60 μl of 2 × sample buffer containing 200 μmdithiothreitol. The resultant denatured protein was loaded for Western blot (30 μl/lane) analysis. The membrane was blotted with avidin-horesradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5000 dilution and incubated overnight at 4 °C . Mucosal cells were harvested from ovine tracheal, rat ileal, and colonic epithelium. Brush-border was separated from basolateral membrane by differential centrifugation and precipitated with 15 mm CaCl2 as described by Bookstein et al. (20Bookstein C. dePaoli A.M. Xie Y. Niu P. Musch M.W. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Membrane protein (100 μg) prior to or following treatment with 5 units of N-glycanase was used for Western blot analysis. Cells were grown on 25-mm coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were incubated with fresh medium or 10 μmA23187 (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature followed by fixation in neutral-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C, and permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with either α-hCLC-3730–744 at a 1:400 dilution or mouse monoclonal anti-heat shock protein 27 (Affinity BioReagents, Inc.) at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, then washed with PBS, and incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG or goat α-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells without exposure to the primary antibody were used as control. The coverslips were mounted on a slide and observed using confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview). Whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed on both T84 and hCLC-3 transfected tsA cells. All electrophysiological methods were similar to those described earlier (11Xie W.

Currents were elicited during a series of test pulses from −110 to +110 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −40 mV. Test pulses were 200 ms in duration and delivered at 2-s intervals. The pipette solution contained (in mm): N-methyl D-glucamine, 140; HCl, 40; l-glutamic acid, 100; CaCl2, 0.2; MgCl2, 2; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10; and ATP-Mg, 2, pH 7.2. Free Ca2+ was 40 nm. In some of the experiments, 10 mm BAPTA was included in the pipette as the Ca2+ buffer in place of EGTA as indicated in the text. The bath solution contained (in mm): N-methyl D-glucamine, 140; HCl, 140; CaCl2, 2; MgCl2, 1; and HEPES, 10, pH 7.4. Purified rat brain CaMKII was dialyzed daily in PIPES buffer (in mm: PIPES, 25; pH 7.0, EGTA, 1; NaCl, 0.1) using Slide-A-LyzerTM Mini Dialysis Units, 7000 MWCO (Pierce). The autonomous CaMKII was prepared as previously described (9Chan H.C. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32464-32468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The autonomous, autophosphorylated kinase was introduced into the cell via the pipette solution. A 100 μm stock solution of the CaMKII-specific inhibitor autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide (21Ishida A. Kameshita I. Okuno S. Kitani T. Fujisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega) was diluted to 75 units/ml with pipette solution. Whole cell capacitance recordings were obtained using an EPC-9 computer controlled patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany) running PULSE software (HEKA). The EPC-9 includes a built-in data acquisition interface (ITC-16, Instrutech, NY). The software package controlled the stimulus and data acquisition for the software lock-in amplifier in the “sine + dc” mode as described by Gillis (23Gillis K. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The temporal resolution of the capacitance data was 40 ms per point using a 1 kHz, 20 mV sine wave. The holding potential in the capacitance experiments was −10 mV. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments in parentheses. The statistical significance of the results was assessed using Student'st test analysis. The full-length hCLC-3 was cloned from the human colonic tumor cell line T84 using RT-PCR. The putative hCLC-3 protein is 818 amino acid residues in length sharing 92% identity with the long form Clc-3 cloned from rat hepatocytes (5Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D. Showalter L. Weinman S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastroint. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 58 residues at the N terminus are absent from guinea pig clc-3characterized by Duan et al. (3Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The remaining 760-amino acid sequence shows 90% identity with both guinea pig and rat short form Clc-3. Analysis of the putative hCLC-3 amino acid sequence using CBS prediction servers (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, Department of Biotechnology, The Technical University of Denmark) resulted in three putative CaMKII consensus sequences in hCLC-3 located at Ser109, Ser420, Thr713. We generated two polyclonal antibodies directed against peptides corresponding to the N- (α-hCLC-359–74) or C-terminal (α-hCLC-3730–744) sequences of hCLC-3. The specificity of the antibodies was verified by immunoblotting whole cell lysates obtained from HEK 293 stable cell lines expressing hCLC-1, rClc-2, and hCLC-4 (Fig.1 A). The corresponding predicted molecular mass for each of the chloride channel proteins was 107, 100, and 82 kDa, respectively. The affinity purified antibodies were used to evaluate expression of recombinant hCLC-3 in stably transfected tsA cells. Both antibodies detected a protein band from whole cell lysates with a molecular mass range from 90 to 120 kDa (Fig. 1 A). A single molecular mass band of ∼90 kDa was obtained from the same whole cell lysates digested with N-glycanase, which was consistent with the predicted mass for hCLC-3 of 88 kDa. The 90–120-kDa band was observed in the total membrane fraction, but absent from the cytosolic fraction. Given that CLC-3 has been localized to intracellular vesicles in cells from the central nervous system (7Stobrawa S. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A. Boesl M. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), we carried out experiments to determine whether hCLC-3 was also expressed at the cell surface. Cells stably transfected with hCLC-3 were surface biotinylated, immunoprecipited with α-hCLC-3730–744 antibody or PBS, and subsequently immunoblotted with avidin-horesradish peroxidase conjugate. A single protein band was observed at approximately 90 kDa, and was absent in the PBS control (Fig. 1 B) clearly demonstrating that a significant fraction of hCLC-3 expression is at the cell surface. Expression of endogenous hCLC-3 in the human colonic epithelial cell line, T84, and in the murine macrophage cell line J774.1 was too low to be detected by standard Western blot analysis. However, protein expression in these cells was observed by immunoprecipitation with α-hCLC-3730–744 followed by immunoblot detection with α-hCLC-359–74. Following deglycosylation, endogenous hCLC-3 detected in both the gastrointestinal and immune cell lines had a molecular mass of 90 kDa (Fig. 2,IP). To determine protein localization in native, fluid-secreting tissues, the brush border and basolateral fractions of rat ileal and colonic as well as ovine tracheal epithelium were isolated by differential centrifugation. Membrane protein was resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with α-hCLC-3730–744 antibody. An apparent molecular mass range from 90 to 130 kDa was detected in the brush border membrane fraction (Fig.3 A). The tissue dependent difference in apparent molecular weight for CLC-3 is consistent with Western analysis of membrane proteins from mice (7Stobrawa S. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D.

Tracheal CLC-3 revealed a high molecular mass band of greater than 120 kDa indicating an elevated level of glycosylation. CLC-3 detected in gastrointestinal tissue was characterized by a predominant molecular mass of 90 kDa, which did not shift after deglycosylation (Fig.3 B). Regulation of the subcellular distribution of CLC-3 was studied in T84 and the stably transfected tsA cells using confocal microscopy. Increases in the level of intracellular Ca2+ regulates vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion. We hypothesized that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ might shift the apparent expression of CLC-3 to surface sites. Cells were fixed and immunostained with α-hCLC-3730–744 either prior to or following exposure to the calcium ionophore, A23187 (10 μm). As seen in Fig. 4, the ionophore induced a translocation of fluorescence intensity from the cytoplasmic compartment to the plasma membrane in both cell lines. As a control, cells were immunostained under the same condition with another antibody targeting a non-secreted protein, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Fig. 5 demonstrates that HSP27 associated immunofluorescence remained in the cytoplasmic compartment before and after A23187 treatment.Figure 5Intracellular Ca2+ does not change subcellular localization of HSP27. T84 cells were immunostained with an antibody targeting a non-secreted protein, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). Images were acquired with an Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope.

Experiments were performed in asymmetrical solutions where Cl− was the major permeant species, and the theoretical Cl− equilibrium potential was −31 mV. Under these ionic conditions, nonspecific leak current was identified as a depolarizing shift in zero-current potential. Voltage clamp experiments were performed on single, nonconfluent cells that had been maintained in culture for 1–2 days. The autonomous CaMKII was introduced into the cells via the patch pipette as has been previously described (9Chan H.C. Kaetzel M.A. Gotter A.L. Dedman J.R. Nelson D.J. J. Biol.

We have previously observed coordinate regulation of the matrilysin promoter by β-catenin and Ets family transcription factors of the PEA3 subfamily. Here we show that while β-catenin only weakly activates theCOX-2 promoter, PEA3 family transcription factors are potent activators of COX-2 transcription. Consistent with this, PEA3 is up-regulated in Wnt1-expressing mouse mammary epithelial cells, and PEA3 factors are highly expressed in tumors from Wnt1 transgenic mice, in whichCox-2 is also up-regulated. Promoter mapping experiments suggest that the NF-IL6 site in the COX-2 promoter is important for mediating PEA3 responsiveness. The NF-IL6 site is also important for COX-2 transcription in some colorectal cancer lines (Shao, J., Sheng, H., Inoue, H., Morrow, J. D., and DuBois, R. N. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 33951–33956), and PEA3 factors are highly expressed in colorectal cancer cell lines. Therefore, we speculate that PEA3 factors may contribute to the up-regulation of COX-2 expression resulting from bothAPC mutation and Wnt1 expression.

Of these, several have been demonstrated to be directly activated by β-catenin, including cyclin D1, c-myc, matrilysin, and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor δ (8Crawford H.C. Fingleton B.M.

Both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 have resulted in reduced tumorigenesis in several animal cancer models (26Fischer S.M. Lo H.H. Gordon G.B. Seibert K. Kelloff G.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the role of COX-2 in tumorigenesis.Cox-2 overexpression in epithelial cells is associated with enhanced invasiveness and suppression of apoptosis (25Liu, C. H., Chang, S.-H., Narko, K., Trifan, O. C., Wu, M.-T., Smith, E., Haudenschild, C., Lane, T. F., and Hla, T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in press.Google Scholar, 32Tsujii M. DuBois R.N.

Prostaglandin overproduction is likely to have pleiotropic consequences including stimulation of proliferation and local immunosuppressive effects that could facilitate tumorigenesis.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1625-1629PubMed Google Scholar).Modulation of COX-2 protein levels can be achieved via multiple mechanisms, including transcriptional activation, mRNA stabilization, and altered COX-2 protein stability. We have previously demonstrated transcriptional up-regulation of Cox-2 in response to Wnt1 expression in mouse mammary epithelial cells (13Howe L.R. Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying Wnt1-mediated induction of Cox-2. Given that COX-2 is also up-regulated in intestinal tumors resulting from APC mutation, we initially hypothesized that β-catenin might regulate the COX-2 promoter. Here we examine the effect of both β-catenin and Ets family transcription factors of the PEA3 subfamily on COX-2 promoter activity.RESULTSTransient transfections were performed to determine whether theCOX-2 promoter was susceptible to regulation by β-catenin. The 293 human embryonic kidney cell line was selected for these experiments based on ease of transfection (4Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 293 cells were co-transfected with a β-catenin expression vector and with COX-2-LUC, a luciferase reporter construct containing 1.4 kilobase pairs of the human COX-2 promoter (43Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In addition, we tested the effect of the Ets family transcription factor PEA3 since we had previously observed synergistic activation of another target gene, matrilysin, by PEA3 and β-catenin (42Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Gustavson M.D. Kurpios N. Wagenaar R.A. Hassell J.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1370-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Overexpression of β-catenin stimulated the activity of TOPFLASH, an artificial β-catenin/TCF-responsive promoter reporter (44van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), by 5–10-fold (data not shown). However, we observed only very weak activation of the COX-2 promoter construct COX-2-LUC by β-catenin (Fig.1 A). The mean increase observed in six experiments in response to β-catenin was 28% (p < 0.03). In contrast, PEA3 activated COX-2-LUC up to 20-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). Together PEA3 and β-catenin elicited a greater than additive response in some experiments (Fig. 1 A), although the observed trend was not statistically significant.One potential explanation for the contrasting potencies of PEA3 and β-catenin in activating the COX-2 promoter could be different expression levels of the two proteins. To directly compare expressions levels, lysates were prepared from 293 cells transfected with expression vectors for PEA3 or β-catenin (both of which were Myc epitope-tagged) and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc epitope antibody 9E10. On this basis, PEA3 was expressed at 2–4-fold higher levels than β-catenin (Fig. 2). However, transfection of 50-fold less PEA3 than used in this experiment was sufficient to potently activate the COX-2 promoter (Fig.1 B), and it therefore seems unlikely that this small difference in expression levels is sufficient to explain the differential responsiveness of the COX-2 promoter to β-catenin and PEA3.Figure 2Comparison of β-catenin and PEA3 expression. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding β-catenin or PEA3, and lysates prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equivalent amounts of each expression vector were used as in the experiments shown in Figs. 1 A and 4. To compare the relative expression levels of β-catenin and PEA3, varied amounts of each lysate were electrophoresed on the same polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Western blotting sequentially with the anti-Myc epitope antibody 9E10 (upper panel) and the anti-ERK2 antibody 122 (lower panel). 9E10 detected both PEA3 (lanes 1–3) and β-catenin (β-cat; lanes 4–6), since both are Myc-epitope-tagged. Anti-ERK2 antibody was used as a loading control. Comparison of lane 5 with lanes 2 and3 suggests that β-catenin is present at 2–4-fold lower levels than PEA3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined the response of the COX-2 promoter to the Ets factors Ets-1 and Ets-2, in comparison with the PEA3 subfamily members PEA3, ER81, and ERM. Of these, PEA3 was the most potent activator of the COX-2 promoter (Fig.3). ER81 and ERM were also capable of inducing significant activation, in contrast with the weaker responses elicited by Ets-1 and Ets-2. It was not possible to compare expression levels of the various factors directly, since the cDNAs were not uniformly epitope-tagged. However, since Ets-2 caused much stronger activation of the stromelysin-1 promoter than did PEA3 in the same experiment, we conclude that the COX-2 promoter is preferentially responsive to PEA3 family members (Fig. 3). Strikingly, PEA3 alone was also sufficient to activate transcription of the endogenous COX-2 gene. Transient transfection of PEA3 into 293 cells caused accumulation of COX-2 transcript (Fig.4). In contrast, β-catenin alone did not stimulate significant transcription of the endogenousCOX-2 gene, nor did it enhance the response to PEA3, consistent with the data obtained using the COX-2 promoter reporter construct (Fig. 1 A).Figure 3The COX-2 promoter is selectively activated by PEA3 factors. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding PEA3, ER81, ERM, ETS-1, or ETS-2, together with COX-2-LUC and pRL-TK. In parallel, cells were transfected with the Ets expression vectors, pRL-TK, a stromelysin promoter luciferase reporter construct (p754TR-Luc), and a c-Jun expression vector. Luciferase assays were performed as described above.

Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. Brown A.M.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1572-1577PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested to determine whether PEA3 factors could play a role in this up-regulation. In particular, we had observed significantly increased Cox-2transcript in response to Wnt1 in C57MG cells, a mouse mammary epithelial cell line which undergoes Wnt1-induced morphological transformation (48Brown A.M.C. Wildin R.S. Prendergast T.J. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1986; 46: 1001-1009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore PEA3 transcripts were measured in C57MG-derived cell lines, and also in mammary tumors fromWnt1 transgenic mice. We observed up-regulatedPEA3 expression in C57MG cells in response toWnt1 expression (Fig.5 A). This observation is consistent with the Cox-2 up-regulation observed in these cells, and suggests a role for PEA3 in Cox-2 promoter regulation in these cells. To test this, the effects of PEA3 and β-catenin on COX-2 promoter activity in C57MG cells were compared. PEA3 overexpression increased COX-2promoter activity to 205% (p < 0.03; Fig.6). A smaller degree of activation was observed in response to β-catenin in several experiments, but was not statistically significant. These experiments were limited by the poor transfection efficiency associated with C57MG cells (4Xu L. Corcoran R.B. Welsh J.W. Pennica D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data suggest that, both in 293 and C57MG cells (Figs. 1 and 6), PEA3 is a more potent activator of the COX-2 promoter than β-catenin.Figure 5PEA3 factor expression analysis. A, PEA3 expression is up-regulated in C57MG cells expressing Wnt1. Total RNA was prepared from C57/MV7 and C57/Wnt-1 cells and 20 μg analyzed by Northern blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The blot was hybridized sequentially with probes for PEA3 and GAPDH. B, comparison of PEA3 expression in mammary glands and tumor tissue. Total RNA was prepared from a mammary carcinoma from a Wnt1transgenic mouse. RNA was also prepared from the MG of an age-matched wild type littermate. 20 μg of each RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting, and hybridized sequentially with probes for PEA3 and GAPDH. A high level of PEA3 expression was detected in the tumor. Longer exposures revealed much lower PEA3 expression in wild type MG (not shown). C, PEA3 expression in tumors from Wnt1 transgenic mice. Total RNA was prepared from mammary carcinomas from five Wnt1 transgenic mice and analyzed by Northern blotting for PEA3 expression as inB. High level expression was observed in all tumors examined. D, ERM expression in tumors fromWnt1 transgenic mice. RNA from 6 mammary tumors was analyzed by Northern blotting for ERM expression by sequential probing with an ERM probe and a GAPDH probe. High level expression was observed in all tumors examined. No ERM transcript was detectable in wild type MG (not shown). E, comparison of PEA3,ER81, and ERM expression in a singleWnt1 transgenic tumor. RNA from a single tumor was subjected to Northern blotting and probed in parallel with probes for PEA3, ER81, and ERM. All probes were of approximately equal specific activity, and exposures to film were of the same duration, thus allowing an approximate comparison of relative expression levels. ER81was expressed at a much lower level (in tumor 160 and in 6 other tumors tested) than were PEA3 and ERM. One major and two minor ER81 transcripts were detected. GAPDH probing confirmed equal RNA loading (not shown). F, comparison of ER81expression in tumor tissue and wild type mammary glands. 20 μg of total RNA from wild type MG and from tumor from a Wnt1transgenic mouse was analyzed by Northern blotting, with sequential probing with an ER81 probe and a GAPDH probe. No ER81expression was detectable in wild type MG, but a distinct signal was detected in Wnt1 transgenic tumor tissue. SimilarER81 expression was detected in all 7 tumors tested (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6PEA3 stimulates COX-2promoter activity in C57MG cells. C57MG cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding β-catenin or PEA3, together with a COX-2 promoter luciferase reporter construct (COX-2-LUC), and with pRL-TK as an internal control. Luciferase activities were performed as described above.

Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). ERM was also highly expressed in all Wnt1 tumors tested, while no expression was detected in wild type mammary gland (Fig. 5 D; data not shown). Comparison of all three factors revealed that, in contrast to PEA3 and ERM, ER81 was expressed at a relatively low level in the tumors (Fig. 5 E,data not shown), albeit at higher levels than in virgin mammary gland (Fig. 5 F).Our observation of high level expression of PEA3 factors in tumors fromWnt1 transgenic mice, coupled with the demonstration that PEA3 activates the COX-2 promoter, prompted us to test whether Cox-2 was also up-regulated inWnt1-expressing mammary tumors. Levels of Cox-2 protein were compared in normal mammary glands from wild type mice and in tumors from Wnt1 transgenic mice. We observed a significant increase in Cox-2 protein in the three tumors tested compared with virtually undetectable basal levels in wild type mammary gland (Fig.7). These data suggest that increased expression of PEA3 factors may contribute to Cox-2up-regulation in these tumors.Figure 7Cox-2 protein is increased inWnt1-expressing mammary tumors. Cox-2 protein was analyzed in lysates prepared from mammary tumors from threeWnt1 transgenic female mice (lanes 4–6) and from mammary glands isolated from three strain-matched wild type female mice (lanes 1–3). Lysates were prepared from 10 mg of each tissue sample. Cox-2 protein was immunoprecipitated, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed for Cox-2 by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The position of a Cox-2 standard is indicated by the arrow. Very little Cox-2 protein was detectable in the wild type mammary glands (lanes 1–3). In contrast, significant Cox-2 protein was observed in all three tumor samples (lanes 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to map the PEA3-responsive elements in the COX-2promoter, a range of promoter reporter constructs were used in which deletions or site-specific mutations had been introduced (43Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Progressive truncation of the promoter sequentially deletes binding sites for NF-κB, NF-IL6, and finally the CRE (Fig.8 A). No significant diminution in PEA3 responsiveness was observed until residues −220 to −125 were deleted (Fig. 8 B). The −124/+59 construct was virtually unresponsive to PEA3, suggesting that the PEA3 response element(s) lie between −220 and −125. Since an NF-IL6-binding site is present in this region of the promoter, we next tested the responsiveness to PEA3 of various site-specific promoter mutants, including the ILM construct in which the NF-IL6 site is mutagenized. This experiment was primarily intended to rule out involvement of this site in the PEA3 response. However, to our surprise, we found that mutation of the NF-IL6 site completely and specifically abolished both basal and PEA3-stimulatedCOX-2 promoter activity (Fig.9). In contrast, mutation of the NF-κB site had no effect on PEA3 responsiveness. Mutation of the CRE site reduced both basal and PEA-3-stimulated activity, such that the index of stimulation exhibited by the CRM construct was not reduced relative to the wild type construct. Collectively, these data strongly implicate the NF-IL6 site in mediating PEA3 responsiveness. Since we have previously found mutation of the NF-IL6 site to have little effect onCOX-2 promoter responsiveness to the lipid ceramide (49Subbaramaiah K. Chung W.J. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32943-32949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we believe these data to reflect a specific involvement of the NF-IL6 site in mediating PEA3 responsiveness.Figure 8Mapping the site of PEA3 responsiveness in the COX-2 promoter.

In the thymus, AIRE is seen in two types of antigen-presenting cells: medullary epithelial cells and cells of monocyte-dendritic cell lineage that are central in the negative selection of self-reactive T cells (7Heino M.

In view of data on the subcellular localization of AIRE, we have determined the protein domains responsible for its targeting to specific cellular locations. We have also further studied the function of AIRE on a minimal promoter in a transfection assay and determined the activation domain. Finally, we have demonstrated a potential nuclear export signal in the N-terminal HSR domain of AIRE. U937 and COS-1 cells were maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 10% bovine calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.).

For COS-1 transfections, 5 × 105 cells were grown on coverslips in 6-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of the appropriate expression vector. For U937 transfections, 1 × 106cells were transfected with 1 μg of vector DNA. Immunofluorescence staining was performed 24 h post-transfection as described using a monoclonal anti-AIRE antibody (7Heino M. Peterson P. Kudoh J. Nagamine K. Lagerstedt A. Ovod V. Ranki A.

In nuclear export studies, leptomycin B (LMB; from M. Yoshida, University of Tokyo) was added 24 h post-transfection initially at 5, 25, or 30 ng/ml, the cells were grown for 3 or 24 h and stained as above. In subsequent experiments, 10 ng/ml LMB was used. The proportion of cells showing either nuclear, combined nuclear and cytoplasmic, and just cytoplasmic staining was calculated. Immunofluorescence data were acquired using an Olympus BX50 microscope. Images were captured with a Photometrics Imagepoint Cooled CCD video camera and IPLab Spectrum 3.1a software for the Macintosh. Wild-type AIRE cDNA was cloned into the pSI mammalian expression vector (Promega) by polymerase chain reaction using primers with EcoRI and SalI restriction sites in the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The truncated AIRE fragments AIRE-(1–256), -(1–293), -(1–348), -(1–207), -(292–545), -(175–545), and -(84–545) and the missense mutation-containing cDNAs AIRE L28P, AIRE L28P/K83E, and AIRE C437P were subcloned into pSI from various constructs described earlier (4Pitkänen J.

The mutation C302P was engineered into the pSI-AIRE (wild type) vector to disrupt the first PHD zinc finger using the GeneEditor site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The patient mutation K83E was similarly engineered into wild-type pSI-AIRE. To create pSI-AIRE C302P/C437P, an EcoRI-SacI digest from pSI-AIRE C302P was cloned into pSI-AIRE C437P. For pGFP-AIRE NLS the consensus nuclear localization signal plus six flanking amino acids on either terminus (amino acids 101–141) were cloned by polymerase chain reaction into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH).

In assays that look at the effect of AIRE on the interferon β (IFNβ) minimal promoter, the reporter plasmid pIFNβ-LUC (from Kalle Saksela, University of Tampere) was used, which contains the IFNβ minimal promoter (nucleotides −55 to +19) upstream of the luciferase gene. The assays were performed as follows. 2 μg of the reporter was cotransfected with 2 μg of the appropriate pSI-AIRE construct by electroporation into 1 × 106 COS-1 cells. The cells were harvested and lysed 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The luciferase values were normalized with respect to total protein concentration. All experiments were confirmed twice. Earlier reports by us and others have found wild-type AIRE to be partially localized in tubular structures in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (7Heino M. Peterson P. Kudoh J. Nagamine K. Lagerstedt A. Ovod V. Ranki A. Rantala I. Nieminen M. Tuukkanen J. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To identify the domain in AIRE responsible for this particular localization, we performed transfections with several AIRE deletion constructs (TableI, Fig.1).Table ISubcellular localization of various AIRE constructsConstructLocalizationcytonucdotfibr1–545 (wild type)++++1–256 1-aMutations found in APECED patients (R257X, L28P, and K83E).++−+1–293++−+1–348++−+1–207++−+84–545+ 1-bAIRE-(84–545) was almost exclusively located in the nucleus.+−−175–545++−−292–545++−−L28P1-aMutations found in APECED patients (R257X, L28P, and K83E).++−−L28P/K83E++−−K83E1-aMutations found in APECED patients (R257X, L28P, and K83E).++−+C302P++++C437P++++C302P/C437P++++Cyto, cytoplasmic localization; nuc, nuclear localization; dot, nuclear dot staining; fibr, microtubular cytoplasmic staining are shown.1-a Mutations found in APECED patients (R257X, L28P, and K83E).1-b AIRE-(84–545) was almost exclusively located in the nucleus. Open table in a new tab Cyto, cytoplasmic localization; nuc, nuclear localization; dot, nuclear dot staining; fibr, microtubular cytoplasmic staining are shown. Only AIRE fragments containing an intact N terminus formed the tubular cytoplasmic staining seen with wild-type AIRE. The required minimal domain probably lies in the HSR domain, within at least the first 207 amino acids because none of the N-terminal deletions, AIRE-(84–545), -(175–545), or -(292–545), exhibited a tubular pattern but were diffusely localized in the cytoplasm, whereas AIRE-(1–207) localized effectively into tubular structures (Table I). To further confirm this, we tested the missense mutation AIRE L28P, found in APECED patients, and a double mutant construct, AIRE L28P/K83E. We found that both constructs lacked the tubular cytoplasmic pattern. However, the patient mutant construct AIRE K83E showed a cytoplasmic tubular pattern similar to wild type (Table I and Fig. 2). The results were essentially the same in COS-1 and U937 cells. Thus, the N-terminal HSR domain of AIRE is required for tubular localization. Upon studying nuclear localization we observed that C-terminal deletion constructs lacking both (AIRE-(1–256), -(1–207), and -(1–293)) or one (AIRE-(1–348)) PHD zinc finger but containing the nuclear localization signal also localized in the nucleus, suggesting that the nuclear localization signal is functional. The proportion of cells showing nuclear localization was comparable with wild-type AIRE with AIRE-(1–207) and AIRE-(1–256) but was smaller with AIRE-(1–293) and AIRE-(1–348) (not shown). The presence of a consensus nuclear localization signal in AIRE has been reported based on the amino acid sequence (1Nagamine K. Peterson P. Scott H.S. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Heino M. Krohn K.J. Lalioti M.D. Mullis P.E. Antonarakis S.E. Kawasaki K. Asakawa S. Ito F. Shimizu N. Nat.

It has not, however, been shown to be functional. To address this question, a short fragment containing the AIRE NLS (amino acids 101–141) was cloned downstream of the green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-C3,CLONTECH) and transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. We found that the minimal nuclear localization signal effectively transported GFP into the nucleus (Fig.3). Recently, we and others reported that AIRE can function as a transcriptional activator and that the PHD zinc fingers are important for that function (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol.

We set out to determine the role of the PHD zinc finger-containing C terminus in the subcellular localization of AIRE. N-terminal AIRE deletion constructs lacking the nuclear localization signal (AIRE-(175–545) and AIRE-(292–545)) were still transported into the nucleus, approximately as efficiently as wild-type AIRE (TableI). To investigate the role of the PHD zinc fingers in this nuclear transport we tested the missense mutants AIRE C302P and AIRE C437P. Both mutants, however, were effectively transported into the nucleus in a pattern indistinguishable from wild type (Table I). This would seem to indicate that the PHD zinc fingers are not directly implicated as another nuclear targeting signal. Apart from the PHD fingers, the C terminus has the proline-rich region between the zinc fingers and a 70-amino acid region distal to the second PHD finger (Fig. 1). We conclude that the C terminus alone is sufficient to transport AIRE into the nucleus. Taken together with the results presented above, this suggests that AIRE has two functional nuclear localization signals, the consensus NLS in the N terminus and another thus far undefined in the C terminus. In addition to the tubular cytoplasmic localization, AIRE has been reported to exhibit a nuclear-staining pattern resembling PML nuclear bodies, also known as ND10, nuclear dots, or potential oncogenic domains (PODs) (7Heino M.

We performed transfections with wild-type AIRE and several deletion constructs to determine the domain(s) needed to produce the nuclear dot-like structures. Interestingly enough, none of the tested deletion constructs showed the dot-like nuclear staining (Table I). When nuclear localization was seen, the pattern was diffuse. This was also true for the patient mutation L28P and the double mutant L28P/K83E, both of which have diminished transcriptional activating activity (10% and 3% respectively) compared with wild-type AIRE (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The APECED patient mutation K83E also failed to produce the nuclear dot staining, although it is fully functional in transcriptional activation (see below). On the other hand, the PHD zinc finger mutations C302P and C437P, which had no discernible effect on subcellular localization, caused severely decreased transcriptional activation (see below). As shown previously (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the L28P and L28P/K83E mutants were unable to homodimerize. We thus tested the C302P and C437P mutants for homodimerization by GST pull-down and found that both could form homodimers as efficiently as the wild-type protein (not shown). Leptomycin B (LMB) is a specific inhibitor of CRM-1-mediated nuclear export (14Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process that has recently been shown to be important for the function of several proteins, including transcription factors (17Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Different nuclear export signal sequences have been described, many of which are rich in leucine (18Adam S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The presence of several putative export sequences on N- and C-terminal regions and the dual subcellular localization of AIRE in the cytoplasm and nucleus suggested that it might, in addition to being transported into the nucleus, also be actively exported from it. To test this hypothesis, cells transfected with AIRE were subjected to 5, 25, or 35 ng/ml LMB for 3 or 24 h. The proportion of cells exhibiting either a nuclear, cytoplasmic, or combined nuclear and cytoplasmic staining pattern was calculated. We found that treatment of cells with LMB at 15 ng/ml for 3 h increased the proportion of cells showing nuclear localization ∼2-fold, whereas the proportion of cells with only cytoplasmic staining decreased accordingly (Fig.4). Increasing the LMB concentration or treatment time had little effect on the outcome (not shown). To delineate the nuclear export signal we first tested N and C-terminal deletion constructs as putative signals were found in both termini. We found that AIRE-(1–207) showed a response to LMB indistinguishable from wild type, whereas the C-terminal constructs were unaffected (Fig.4). In accordance, the AIRE-(84–545) deletion construct was localized almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 2 and Table I). We suggest that AIRE is shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm, possibly to regulate its function. To assess the function of wild-type AIRE and the effect of patient mutations on that function, we devised an in vivoreporter assay. The reporter used contains the IFNβminimal promoter (nucleotides −55 to +19) upstream of the luciferase gene. Wild-type or mutated AIRE was cotransfected with the appropriate reporter, and luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection. The reporter construct expressed small baseline amounts of luciferase, and the addition of wild-type AIRE increased the transcription of the reporter gene ∼5.5-fold (Fig. 5). To determine whether an activation domain could be demonstrated, we tested our deletion/mutation constructs (Fig. 1). The C-terminal constructs AIRE-(84–545) and AIRE-(292–545) showed an activation comparable with wild-type AIRE and the AIRE-(175–545) construct a slightly lower activation. In accordance, the constructs carrying mutations in the PHD fingers, AIRE C302P, AIRE C437P, and AIRE C302P/C437P, had reduced transcriptional activating capabilities. Thus, wild-type AIRE can activate the IFNβ minimal promoter, and the PHD fingers are directly implicated as the activation domain. As indicated by the results of transfection experiments with the different AIRE deletion and mutation constructs, the domain responsible for the localization into the cytoskeleton is the N terminus (Table I). We narrowed the minimal domain down to the first 207 amino acids. The most likely candidate and the only intact domain in this sequence is the HSR domain, comprising amino acids 1–100 of AIRE. The exact identity of the tubular fibers AIRE colocalizes with is not entirely clear. Rinderle et al. (10Rinderle C. Christensen H.M. Schweiger S. Lehrach H. Yaspo M.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that AIRE colocalizes with vimentin and microtubules in transfected COS and primary fibroblast cells. They also observed that the N-terminal construct (amino acids 1–209) localized in microtubules in primary fibroblasts but did not do so in COS cells. The results of another group are in concordance with our findings as to the common Finnish APECED mutation R257X: they found it to be localized in filamentous structures in the cytoplasm (5Björses P. Halonen M. Palvimo J.J. Kolmer M. Aaltonen J. Ellonen P. Perheentupa J. Ulmanen I. Peltonen L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 378-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (Table I). They also showed colocalization of AIRE with vimentin (9Bjorses P. Pelto-Huikko M. Kaukonen J. Aaltonen J. Peltonen L. Ulmanen I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have shown earlier that the AIRE HSR domain has a predicted four-helix bundle structure and that it mediates AIRE-AIRE homodimerization (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the L28P patient mutation not only abolishes homodimerization and transcriptional activation properties (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol.

This might indicate that homodimerization through the HSR domain is a prerequisite for the tubular localization. All but two AIRE missense mutations found so far in APECED patients are in the HSR domain (1Nagamine K. Peterson P. Scott H.S. Kudoh J. Minoshima S. Heino M. Krohn K.J. Lalioti M.D. Mullis P.E.

Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and likely to be important in the function of AIRE. Further evidence for the importance of the HSR domain is offered because we report here that it mediates the localization of AIRE to microtubular structures. It has been shown that the IκBα protein, a key molecular target in the regulation of NFκB activity, is localized in the microtubule network through its interaction with a cytoskeleton-associated protein (20Crepieux P.K.H. Leclerc N. Spencer W. Richard S. Lin R. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7375-7385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is not yet known whether AIRE interacts with the microtubular network directly or via some other protein-protein interaction, we suggest that the deposition of AIRE in these structures plays an important part in the regulation of its function. To address the functionality of the nuclear localization signal found in the N terminus of AIRE, we studied its ability to transport GFP into nuclei. A polypeptide containing the bipartite AIRE NLS (amino acids 101–141) effectively transported the GFP·NLS fusion into the nuclei of transiently transfected COS-1 cells. In studying the role of the PHD finger-containing C terminus in the subcellular localization of AIRE we rather surprisingly found that the C terminus alone can function as a mediator of nuclear transport irrespective of the consensus nuclear localization signal in the N terminus. The PHD zinc fingers, however, are not likely to be responsible for the nuclear transport as missense mutations (C302P, C437P, and C302P/C437P) fail to alter the subcellular localization of the protein. It can be hypothesized that AIRE, through the C terminus, binds some protein in the cytoplasm, thus inducing transport into the nucleus and subsequent transcriptional regulating activity. We conclude that the C terminus of AIRE is involved in its nuclear transport, possibly as a means of regulating its activity as well as subcellular distribution. Thus, AIRE has two functional nuclear localization signals, the consensus NLS of the N terminus and another as yet undefined in the C terminus. The dual subcellular localization of AIRE and the presence of putative nuclear export signals prompted us to consider the possibility of nuclear export of AIRE. Indeed, we found that leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM-1-mediated nuclear export, increased ∼2-fold the proportion of cells showing a nuclear localization whereas the number of cells showing only cytoplasmic distribution decreased accordingly (Fig. 4). The nuclear export signal was found to most likely reside in the N terminus of AIRE because AIRE-(1–207) showed a response to LMB indistinguishable from wild type. Further, AIRE-(84–545), lacking a putative nuclear export signal and the microtubular localization-mediating HSR domain was almost exclusively located in the nucleus. LMB treatment of AIRE-expressing cells did not lead to complete nuclear accumulation. In the case of AIRE, the effect is seen as an increase in the number of cells showing nuclear staining. We suggest that this is partially because of the localization of AIRE in the microtubular network of the cytoplasm. Binding to these structures in the cytoplasm could inhibit nuclear transport to some extent. Thus, a tempting hypothesis is that AIRE is shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm to regulate its activity, the microtubular network functioning as a cytoplasmic storage compartment and the nuclear dots as the actual site of AIRE function. To study the transcriptional regulating properties of AIRE, we devised a functional assay utilizing the IFNβ minimal promoter upstream of the luciferase gene. We found that wild-type AIRE activated theIFNβ minimal promoter 5.5-fold (Fig. 5). This finding is in agreement with previous studies where AIRE was found to activate transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol.

Peltonen L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 66: 378-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of the activation requires further study. Furthermore, we showed that the AIRE-(292–545) construct, containing the PHD fingers and the proline-rich region inbetween, was also fully functional (Fig. 5). The AIRE-(84–545) construct, containing in addition the SAND domain, was equally active. We also saw activation by AIRE-(175–545), albeit slightly lower than wild type, which was absent in a GAL4-based reporter assay (4Pitkänen J. Doucas V. Sternsdorf T. Nakajima T. Aratani S. Jensen K. Will H. Vähämurto P. Ollila J. Vihinen M. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Peterson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16802-16809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), probably indicating that the minimal promoter assay used here is the more sensitive. The PHD fingers of the C terminus are thus implicated as an activation domain. To summarize, we show here that different domains of the AIRE protein serve distinct roles in its subcellular localization and function. The N terminus confers microtubular localization via the HSR domain. A nuclear export signal is also likely to reside in the same domain. As we have earlier shown that the HSR domain is required for the homodimerization of AIRE, its importance becomes evident. The N terminus of AIRE is also the domain most conserved in mouse Aire, exhibiting almost 100% homology (21Mittaz L. Rossier C. Heino M. Peterson P. Krohn K.J. Gos A. Morris M.A. Kudoh J. Shimizu N.

Autoimmunity. 1999; 31: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The C terminus contains an additional nuclear localization signal, and the PHD zinc fingers function as an activation domain. The present study adds to increasing evidence that define AIRE as a transcriptional regulator. The exact mechanism of how AIRE exerts transcriptional activation and influences its protein partners, though, remains unresolved. The manifesting symptoms of APECED indicate a defect in the mechanisms inducing tolerance to self-antigens. The lack of tolerance seen in APECED might be considered to arise from impaired negative selection of T-cells. Although the mechanisms of tolerance induction in the thymus medulla are also largely unknown, the importance of medullary epithelial cells and dendritic antigen-presenting cells has been established (23Klein L. Kyewski B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In light of the limited expression of AIRE in these very cells and because it is a transcriptional regulator, we suggest that AIRE may regulate genes acting in negative selection in the thymus medulla. The data presented here give a firm basis for further study on the functional significance of the alternating subcellular localization of AIRE, and the specific mechanisms of its action. Especially, the recognition of the proteins AIRE is involved with in each subcellular location will help elucidate this. We believe that the resolution of the aforementioned issues as well as the results shown in this study will eventually give important information on the induction and maintenance of immune tolerance. The technical assistance of Ulla Kiiskinen is highly appreciated."

To test the hypothesis that C-terminal fragments may associate with and regulate C-terminal-truncated α1C(CaV1.2) subunits, we performed electrophysiological and biochemical experiments. In tsA201 cells expressing either wild type or C-terminal-truncated α1C subunits in combination with a β2a subunit, truncation of the α1C subunit by as little as 147 amino acids led to a 10–15-fold increase in currents compared with those obtained from control, full-length α1C subunits. Dialysis of cells expressing the truncated α1C subunits with C-terminal fragments applied through the patch pipette reconstituted the inhibition of the channels seen with full-length α1C subunits. In addition, C-terminal deletion mutants containing a tethered C terminus also exhibited the C-terminal-induced inhibition. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated the association of the C-terminal fragments with truncated α1C subunits. In addition, glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated that the C-terminal inhibitory fragment could associate with at least two domains within the C terminus.

Each α1 subunit contains four repeated domains containing a total of 24 membrane-spanning domains as well as a long hydrophilic C terminus which contains important regulatory domains that contribute to channel regulation. For example, the C terminus of the α1C subunit constitutes ∼30‥ of the total mass of the α1C subunit (3Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

In addition, the C terminus of α1C appears to contain inhibitory domains because deletion of up to ∼70‥ of the C-terminal 665 amino acids leads to increased currents (9Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E.

A puzzling observation that has been made in several laboratories is that the C terminus of several L-type Ca2+ channels appears to be truncated in many native tissues. For example, when the α1C subunit was isolated from cardiac myocytes, only 10–15‥ of the total protein was a full-length 240-kDa α1C subunit, whereas the majority migrated on SDS gels as a ∼190-kDa protein that was lacking the distal ∼50 kDa of the C terminus (10Gao T.

Similar observations have been made for the α1C subunit expressed in brain (11Hell J.W. Yokoyama C.T. Wong S.T. Warner C. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

If the C termini of these proteins were truly absent, this would have major implications for channel regulation. Although many protease inhibitors have been used to try to prevent this truncation, none has altered the proportion of full-length to truncated protein (14Puri T.S.

Despite the fact that ∼90‥ of the α1C subunits appeared to be truncated when isolated from cardiac myocytes, immunofluorescence imaging suggested that the C terminus of the α1C subunit was present in a 1:1 ratio with the α1C subunit and co-localized with channel subunits in cardiac myocytes (10Gao T.

This finding led us to consider the possibility that the processing of the α1Csubunit might have physiological importance and that the C-terminal fragments might remain functionally associated with the channels (17Gerhardstein B.L.

Such a scenario would allow for maintenance of the important regulatory functions ascribed to the cleaved C terminus. As a first test of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that an exogenous protease, chymotrypsin, cleaved the full-length 240-kDa expressed α1C subunitin vitro into a “body” of 190 kDa, similar to what is observed in native systems (10Gao T.

The vectors pCR3α1CΔ1733–2024 and pCR3α1CΔ1733–1905Δ2024 were prepared using strategies similar to those described earlier (4Gao T. Bünemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A schematic diagram depicting the various constructs used in this study is shown in Fig.1. To generate an additional antibody that would recognize C-terminal fragments of the α1Csubunit, a fusion protein encoding amino acid residues 1907–2171 (termed CT4, see Fig. 1 B) in the C terminus of the α1C subunit was produced. The sequence in the CT4 region was subcloned into an expression vector pQE32 (Qiagen), resulting in an in-frame fusion of the 6×-His tag to the CT4 residues. The 6×-His-CT4 was produced and purified under native conditions from bacteria (15Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Purified CT4 fusion proteins were injected into a rabbit, and polyclonal antibodies were prepared at Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). The specificity of this antibody was tested using the wild type α1C subunit, the α1CΔ1905 subunit that lacks the CT4 fragment (Fig. 1), and CT4 expressed in tsA201 cells (see Fig. 1 C). Various C-terminal fragments of the α1C subunit (see Fig. 1) were expressed in tsA201 cells (HEK293 cells transformed with large T-antigen (18Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. Biotechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar)) using the following strategies. The C-terminal domain (CT) containing amino acids 1623–2171 of α1C was excised as aBglII/BamHI fragment. The CT4 (containing amino acids 1907–2171) and CT23 (containing amino acids 1623–1905) fragments were derived from pCR3α1C and pCR3α1CΔ1905 constructs asBamHI/BamHI and BglII/BamHI fragments, respectively. The CT7 fragment containing amino acids 2026–2171 was derived from pCR3α1CΔ2024 construct as aBamHI/BamHI fragment. A fusion protein expression vector, pCR3His/Myc, was derived from pCR3 (Invitrogen) by inserting a 6×-His tag and six copies of the Myc epitope into the multiclonal sites of the original vector to allow expression of a protein with both 6×-His- and Myc tag fused to the N terminus. To create expression constructs encoding different regions of the C terminus of the α1C subunit, the cDNA fragments of CT, CT4, CT7, and CT23 were subcloned into the BamHI-digested pCR3His/Myc vector, resulting in in-frame fusions of the C-terminal fragments to the 6×-His and six copies of Myc tags on the vector. TsA201 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc. containing 10‥ fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc. and 1‥ penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5‥ CO2. Transient expression of the Myc-tagged C-terminal fusion proteins in tsA201 cells along with wild type or mutant rabbit α1C(CaV1.2) subunits (3Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y.

For electrophysiological experiments, tsA201 cells were plated onto 6-cm culture dishes to achieve ∼40–60‥ confluency. The indicated α1C subunit construct cDNAs were co-transfected with β2a subunit cDNA at 1.5 μg each along with 0.2 μg of CD8 cDNA (as an expression indicator (21Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar)). On the day of the experiment transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, dissociated using trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transferred onto either 35-mm culture dishes or 12-mm glass coverslips, each previously coated with rat tail collagen type VII (1 μg/ml) to achieve ∼40‥ confluency. Cells were allowed to settle on the plate for 2 h before electrophysiological recordings. To express C-terminal fragments of α1C in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, the cDNAs encoding CT, CT4, CT7, CT8, CT12, CT14, or CT23 (see Fig. 1) were subcloned into the BamHI site of the GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-tagged C-terminal fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 and purified using glutathione-agarose after standard procedures (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CT7 and CT8 also were expressed and purified as 6×-His-tagged fusion proteins using pQE32-CT7 and pQE30-CT8 and standard procedures. The fusion proteins were used in electrophysiological assays and in GST pull-down experiments. The GST pull-down experiments were performed using various GST-C-terminal fusion proteins containing CT, CT4, CT7, CT8, CT12, CT14, CT23 (see Fig. 1 B) as well as NT (N-terminal amino acids 1–154), L1 (loop between conserved domains I and II, amino acids 437–554), and L2 (loop between conserved domains I and II, amino acids 785–930). In each reaction, purified 6×-His-CT7 was diluted into 0.5 ml of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors (15Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)) and added to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads precoupled to either GST alone (control) or to the various GST-C-terminal, N-terminal, or loop constructs. Incubations were carried out for 4–6 h at 4 °C with agitation. The GST beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of washing buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and after the last wash, 1/5 volume of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Laemmli buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) was added to each reaction. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the bound 6×-His-CT7 was detected by immunoblotting with the CT4 antibody. TsA201 cells were transiently co-transfected with a combination of the channel subunits and different C-terminal fusion proteins. Approximately 40 h post-transfection, whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1‥ Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors (15Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)). The whole cell lysates were diluted 1:3 with lysis buffer without Triton X-100 so that the final concentration of Triton X-100 was 0.3‥. The diluted cell lysates were incubated with either one of the α1Csubunit-specific antibodies, Card I or CI2, coupled to Ultra-link protein G (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed with wash buffer (20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1‥ Triton X-100, 3×1 ml) and analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The detection of the α1C subunits was with the Card I or CI2 antibodies, as specified in the figure legends. Detection of co-immunoprecipitated fusion proteins was with the CT4 or anti-Myc antibodies. In experiments where cross-linking was performed before immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and cross-linking was performed in the presence of a 20 mmphosphate and 0.1 mm of the nickel (Ni(II)) complex of the tripeptide NH2-Gly-Gly-His-COOH (GGH-Ni(II)) (23Brown K.C. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4733-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The nickel-peptide complex was formed by mixing a 1:1 molar ratio of nickel acetate and GGH in water. After a 5-min equilibration, the solution was added to cell lysates to a final volume of 0.4 ml. The cross-linking reactions were initiated by the addition of magnesium monoperoxyphthalic acid hexahydrate (0.1 mm) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 μl of 0.02 m thiourea. The cell lysates were then diluted and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the Card I antibody as described above. Ba2+ currents were obtained at room temperature (∼22 ± 1 °C) from the transfected human embryonic kidney cells using the whole cell patch voltage clamp technique. The currents were recorded utilizing an EPC-7 patch clamp amplifier (List) whose analog output signal was low pass-filtered at 3 kHz and then digitally sampled at 5 kHz using an ISO-2 data acquisition system (MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany). The input series resistance was ∼70‥ electronically compensated by adjusting the circuit to a point just below that which would begin to cause ringing. Patch pipette electrodes having resistances of 2–5 megaohms when filled with internal solution were manufactured from borosilicate glass capillary tubing (Warner Instrument Corp, #GC150F-10) using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.); the pipette tips were polished using a Narashige MF-83 pipette polisher. The internal solution used to fill the pipette electrodes contained 60 mm CsCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm MgGTP, 10 mm ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N′,N′ tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 78 mm methane sulfonic acid, and 78 mm n-methyl-d-glucamine (corrected to pH 7.3 with CsOH; if necessary, adjusted to 330 mosmol with methanesulfonateN-methyl-d-glucamine). To perform electrophysiological experiments, the cells were placed in a bath chamber that was perfused constantly with a solution containing 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm BaCl, 5 mm HEPES, 20 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 78 mm methanesulfonic acid, and 78 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine. The pH was corrected to 7.4 with NaOH, and osmolarity was adjusted to 330 mosmol. Immediately before attempting to obtain whole cell patches, anti-CD8 antibody-coated Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were added to the bath chamber to identify which cells had been successfully transfected cells (21Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). For some experiments, the internal (pipette) solutions also contained one of several indicated peptides at a concentration of 1 μg of protein/ml, and whole cell patch Ba2+ current was recorded either in the presence or absence of the particular peptide. Data depicting the effect of each of the several peptides to modify the size of the peak of the initially recorded whole cell Ba2+current evoked in response to 50-ms depolarizing pulses to +10 mV at 0.1 Hz from a holding potential of −90 mV were recorded and are presented as the peak inward current plotted on the ordinateversus time starting from when the cell was patched and intracellular access was first obtained on the ordinate. Peak currents were analyzed using the ISO-2 (MFK, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) analysis software and normalized to the whole cell capacitance. The data for each condition were pooled and expressed as the mean ± S.E. All experiments were repeated at least four times. Previous studies demonstrate that truncation of 307–472 amino acids from the C terminus of α1C (in mutants α1CΔ1856, α1CΔ1733, and α1CΔ1700) produced increased channel currents in Xenopus oocytes (9Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the C terminus contains inhibitory elements. To test the hypothesis that C-terminal fragments of the α1Csubunit might associate with and regulate the conductance of C-terminal-truncated α1C subunits, we determined if expressed C-terminal fragments could reconstitute the inhibition of currents when co-expressed with C-terminal-truncated mutants of α1C. To do so, we first prepared and analyzed currents from several different mutants. Using 10 mmBa2+ as a charge carrier, whole cell current density was compared from channels containing the full-length α1Csubunit or from the C-terminal deletion mutants α1CΔ2024, α1CΔ1905, and α1CΔ1733 (see Fig. 1). Each construct was transiently expressed in tsA-201 cells, and all channel constructs were co-expressed with the rat β2asubunit (19Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E. Lacerda A.E. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The current-voltage relationships of channels containing full-length α1C, α1CΔ2024, α1CΔ1905, or α1CΔ1733 were determined (Fig. 2). The full-length channel displayed a characteristic L-type current-voltage profile with the maximal peak I Ba at 0 mV and a mean current density of 4.97 ± 1.3 (mean ± S.E., n = 4) pA/pF. In marked contrast, all three truncation mutants displayed significantly larger currents at all voltages between −20 and +40 mV. The current-voltage (I-V) relationship obtained from cells expressing the α1CΔ2024 subunit displayed maximal current at +10 mV with an average peak I Ba of 60.1 ± 19.2 pA/pF (n = 5). Similarly, currents from cells expressing the α1CΔ1905 or α1CΔ1733 subunits also exhibited peak currents between 0 to +10 mV with current densities of 59.3 ± 12.9 pA/pF (n = 4) and 44.7 ± 13.4 pA/pF (n = 6), respectively. These results demonstrated that expression of any of the three truncation mutants gave rise to markedly larger currents in mammalian cells in a manner similar to that previously described for the truncation mutants α1CΔ1856, α1CΔ1733, and α1CΔ1700 that were expressed in Xenopusoocytes. More importantly, the results demonstrated that a C-terminal truncation of the α1C subunit by as little as 147 amino acids (α1CΔ2024) displayed markedly enhanced currents when compared with the intact full-length channel. This suggested that the inhibitory motif might be contained between amino acids 2025 and 2171. We next tested if application of C-terminal fragments would inhibit the C-terminal-truncated α1C subunits. We first tested if the CT fragment, corresponding to amino acids 1622–2171 (Fig. 1), would result in inhibition of I Ba from α1CΔ2024 and α1CΔ1905. GST-CT was applied through the patch clamp pipette at a peptide concentration of 1 μg/ml pipette solution. During recordings, cells were maintained at −90 mV holding potential and depolarized to +10 mV for 50 ms at 10-s intervals. In the control cells, currents in both the α1CΔ1905 (Fig. 3)- and α1CΔ2024 (data not shown)-expressing cells exhibited a time-dependent increase in currents that began immediately upon patching the cells. Peak currents were achieved within ∼3 min after access to the cell was achieved and were maintained with minimal decrease (<10‥) during the 15-min recording period (Fig. 3). In cells exposed to CT, peptide currents also showed an initial increase in current density (Fig. 4). However, a reduced peak, compared with control, was attained within 2 min of open access to the cytosol (Fig. 4). Current continued to decline such thatI Ba was markedly reduced compared with control after a 6–10-min exposure of either α1CΔ2024 or α1CΔ1905 to CT (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table I). The inhibitory effect of CT was essentially abolished when the CT peptide was boiled for 5 min before addition to pipette solution (Table I). These data demonstrated that the inhibition of channels could be reconstituted by applying the CT peptide to cells expressing the C-terminal-truncated mutants, α1CΔ2024 and α1CΔ1905. Furthermore the structural integrity of the peptide was necessary for the peptide to exert its inhibitory effect. These data provided initial support for the hypothesis that C-terminal fragments of α1C can associate with and regulate channel activity in intact cells.Figure 4Cytosolic application of CT peptide results in time-dependent attenuation of peak IBa.

We focused initially on fragments CT4 and CT7, which were approximately equivalent to the fragments deleted from α1CΔ1905 and α1CΔ2024, respectively (see Fig. 1). Application of the GST-CT4 peptide to cells expressing either α1CΔ2024 or α1CΔ1905 caused a marked inhibition of currents in a manner similar to the CT peptide (Fig. 5and Table I). An early and reduced current peak was observed within 4 min of application of CT4; current density was markedly reduced compared with control in α1CΔ2024- and α1CΔ1905-expressing cells from 4 to 10 min after the start of the perfusion (Fig. 5, A and B, TableI). Boiling the CT4 peptide again abolished the inhibitory effect (Table I). Similar"

The distribution of hyperacetylated H4 and H3 was mapped at the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the tissue-specific gene, carbonic anhydrase (CA). H3 and H4 acetylation was found targeted to the CpG island region at the 5′ end of both these genes, falling off in the downstream direction. In contrast, at the βA-globin gene, both H3 and H4 are highly acetylated throughout the gene and at the downstream enhancer, with a maximum at the promoter. Low level acetylation was observed at the 5′ end of the inactive ovalbumin gene. Run-on assays to measure ongoing transcription showed that theGAPDH and CA genes are transcribed at a much lower rate than the adult βA-globin gene. The extensive high level acetylation at the βA-globin gene correlates most simply with its high rate of transcription. The targeted acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the GAPDH andCA genes is consistent with a role in transcriptional initiation and implies that transcriptional elongation does not necessarily require hyperacetylation.

However, apparent inconsistencies have arisen between promoter/enhancer-specific acetylation and more widespread acetylation. Mapping the modification at the chicken β-globin locus in 15-day erythrocytes showed 33 kb1 of acetylated chromatin, having boundaries coincident with the limits of open chromatin (10Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inactive embryonic ε−globin was hyperacetylated as well as the active adult βA-globin gene (11Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Clayton A.L. Crane-Robinson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This implied that core histone acetylation was a precondition for transcription, a view supported by the observation that acetylation at the inducible PDGFβ gene was not enhanced upon induction (12Clayton A.L. Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C.

In a study analyzing the basis of aberrant transcription of c-myc genes linked to an enhancer-LCR from the 3′ end of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus (modeling a well known translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma), widespread hyperacetylation was observed both upstream and downstream of the transcriptional start site, with little concentration in the region of the c-myc promoter (13Madisen L. Krumm A. Hebbes T.R. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6281-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). More recently, analysis of H3 and H4 acetylation at the human β-globin locus in MEL cells containing a complete human chromosome 11, has also shown locus-wide acetylation, particularly of H4. Hyperacetylation of H3 was also widespread but more concentrated at Dnase I-hypersensitive sites and at the active β-gene (14Schubeler D. Francastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I.K. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility of direct linkage between core histone acetylation and the passage of RNA polymerase II, thereby generating widespread modification, was raised by the observation that the elongator complex contains a subunit having HAT activity (15Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13634-13637Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Such widespread acetylation contrasts with the “directed” or “targeted” acetylation implied by observations that gene activation is often accompanied by the recruitment to promoters/enhancers of protein complexes that include subunits having histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (17Brownell J.E.

Using a serum response factor-controlled reporter gene construct in mouse NIH3T3 cells, it was shown that extracellular stimulation of gene activation induced rapid acetylation of H4, but not H3, in the region of the serum response element (30Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, promoter-specific hyperacetylation of histone H3 was observed in GCN5-mediated transcription (31Kuo M.-H. Zhou J. Jambeck P. Churchill M.E.A. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), whereas promoter-specific hypoacetylation of histone H4 was found for Sin3/Rpd3-mediated repression (32Kadosh D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5121-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). A concentration of H4 and H3 acetylation covering only about 3 nucleosomes in the region of the enhanceosome is induced by viral induction of the human interferon-β gene in HeLa cells (33Parekh B.S. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 125-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Mapping of this induced acetylation showed it to extend only marginally into the (rather short) coding sequences. Hyperacetylation of histones H4 and H3 was also noted at the hormone response elements of several estrogen receptor target genes in human MCF-7 cells following induction with hormone (34Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and at the LCR of the human growth hormone locus (35Elefant F. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13827-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone H4 at K16 by MOF, a Drosophila dosage compensation protein, has been shown to activate transcription when targeted to a his3reporter gene promoter in yeast (36Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In a recent in vitroassay using purified components, SAGA and NuA4 HAT complexes targeted by Gal4-VP16 produced a more restricted region of H3 acetylation than that of H4 (37Vignali M. Steger D.J. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2629-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed for the consequences of acetylation in the tail regions of core histones. 1) The modification disrupts inter-nucleosomal interactions mediated by core histone tails, thereby opening up higher order structure and rendering the chromatin accessible to the transcriptional apparatus. This mechanism can be fitted logically to the widespread acetylation (often of H4) found, for example, at globin genes (10Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 14Schubeler D. Francastel C. Cimbora D.M. Reik A. Martin D.I.K. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been proposed that transcriptional elongation is required to form, and core histone acetylation to maintain, the open chromatin structure (38Walia H. Chen H.Y. Sun J.-M. Hoth L.T. Davie J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14516-14522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). 2) The modification has also been shown to facilitate the access of transcription factors to their DNA recognition sequences in individual nucleosomes at promoters/enhancers/LCRs (39Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 40Vettese-Dadey M. Grant P.A. Hebbes T.R. Crane-Robinson C. Allis C.D. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2508-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 41Vitolo J.M. Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2167-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although this mechanism can provide an explanation for the concentration of acetylation (often of H3) in promoter regions, HAT-containing complexes are generally assumed to be recruited by already bound primary transcription factors. Defining the order of binding events is thus crucial to understanding the role of promoter/enhancer/LCR-specific acetylation (42Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar). To further explore the distinction between localized and locus-wide histone acetylation, we have mapped the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 at a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) and a tissue-specific gene (CA) in the same cells as used for acetylation mapping at the β-globin locus, i.e. 15-day chicken embryo erythrocytes. The mapping of acetylated histones at housekeeping genes was in part provoked by the observation of Tazi and Bird (43Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) that chromatin derived from CpG islands is highly enriched in hyperacetylated histone H4, indicating a concentration of the modification in such regions. At the β-globin locus, where the adult gene does not have a CpG island but the embryonic ρ-gene does, no correlation of acetylation with the presence or absence of a CpG island was observed (10Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). However, all housekeeping genes and about one-half of tissue-specific genes have CpG islands; therefore, the enrichment seen by Tazi and Bird (43Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) could be predominantly from housekeeping genes. The present results show a concentration of H4 and H3 acetylation in the upstream CpG island regions of both theGAPDH and CA genes, in contrast to the βA-globin gene for which the modification extends throughout the gene and into the 3′ enhancer. Anti-hyperacetylated histone H4 serum was prepared by immunizing rabbits with chemically acetylated H4, and antibodies were affinity-purified over a column of immunogen, immobilized on agarose beads (2Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 10Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C.

The anti-acetylated histone H3 peptide serum was obtained by immunizing rabbits with peptide 1–27 of H3, acetylated at residues 9, 14, 18, and 23, chemically synthesized as multiple antigenic peptides (MAPs). Antibodies were affinity-purified over a column of the same H3 peptide immobilized on controlled-pore glass beads (Alta Bioscience) using elution conditions as detailed in Ref. 44Hebbes T.R.

Acid-extracted histones from butyrate-treated HeLa cells were resolved by 15% AUT-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (50Bonner W.M. West M.H. Stedman J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 109: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and after equilibration in transfer buffer (15 mm glycine, 20 mm Tris, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol) were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus (400 mA, 90 min at 4 °C). Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) Marvel in 1× PBS for 1 h, washed in 1× PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and incubated with 1:2000 diluted serum for 1 h. After further washing with 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween, chemiluminescent detection was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Salt-soluble chromatin from 15-day chicken embryo erythrocytes was prepared essentially as described in Ref. 2Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar. In brief, a 5-mg DNA/ml suspension of nuclei was digested with MNase at 37 °C for 10 min in digestion buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm butyrate, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine). Digestion was terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 10 mm. Released chromatin was recovered from supernatant S1 after centrifugation (13000 × g, 1 min). The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (0.25 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm sodium butyrate) to release further material. which was recovered in supernatant S2 after centrifugation. S1 and S2 were pooled, and H1/H5-containing chromatin was precipitated by the addition of NaCl to 100 mm. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was layered onto 5–30% exponential sucrose gradients in lysis buffer. Di- and tri-nucleosomal fractions were pooled and used as the input chromatin for the experiments because probing with βA-globin and housekeeping sequences showed them to be well represented in this chromatin size class. ChIP assays were performed as described in Ref. 10Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar. Typically, 400 μg of input chromatin (as DNA) was mixed with 100 μg of affinity-purified antibody in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm butyrate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Immunocomplexes were immobilized using 50 mg of protein A-Sepharose equilibrated in IP buffer, and the suspension was incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C. Unbound chromatin was recovered from the filtrate by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 s) through a 0.45-μm Spin-X filter (Sigma). After a repeat washing with IP buffer, the resin pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of IP buffer containing 1.5% SDS, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and centrifuged to release antibody-bound chromatin in the filtrate. The resin pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of IP buffer containing 0.5% SDS and re-centrifuged, and the two “Bound” filtrates pooled. The histones and DNA from the input, unbound, and bound fractions were recovered as described in Ref. 10Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar. Input, unbound, and bound DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification in the presence of 5 μCi of [32P]dCTP and the appropriate primers. Template concentrations and numbers of cycles were determined for each primer pair so that the products fell within the exponential phase of amplification. Typically, 26–28 cycles were used with templates serially diluted from 8.0 to 0.5 ng. Amplification conditions were: 2-min denaturation at 94 °C followed by n cycles of: denaturation (94 °C for 1 min), annealing (temperature and time optimized for each primer pair), and extension (72 °C for 1 min). Products were analyzed on 6% native acrylamide gels and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The signal from the correctly sized product derived from the input (I) and bound (B) samples were plotted as a function of template concentration to check for linearity and the B/I value determined as the ratio of the slopes of the two plots in the linear region (data not shown). Comparing the bound signal to the input normalizes for variations in the input signal that arise from differing susceptibilities to MNase at different points in the genome (or within a single gene). B/I ratios >1 represent “fold enrichments” achieved by the immunoprecipitation.B/I values of <1 represent depletions in the bound DNA and are plotted as I/B, “fold depletions.” The following primer pairs were used: A1, GTATGGCGCACTCTGGTATAGA, and A2, GAGCGGCCGTCTGTGTC, 304-bp product; A3, ACCTTCTCCCAACTGTCC, and A4, ATTCCTTTCTCACTATGCT, 258-bp product; A5, AAGCCTAGGAATGTTTCC, and A6, TTAGTGGTACTTGCGAGC, 224-bp product; A7, ACAAAGTGAAGGCTTTAATC, and A8, TTTTAGTTCCAGAACATCATT, 254-bp product; Ga, GCTCTTTGTCCCGCCC, and Gb, CGGGGCGATGCGGCTG, 100-bp product; G1, TCTCGCGCAGGACCGCGTGG, and G2, GTGTTCCTGCGGGGAGAGACCG, 244-bp product; G3, ACCTTTGTGGTGTGGGTGCC, and G4, GCCAGAGAGGACGGCAGCCC, 246-bp product; Gc, GAGTCCACTGGTGTCTTCAC, and Gd, GAGATGATAACACGCTTAGC, 250-bp product; CA1, TCAGTGCGGACACAGAGGAGCATT, and CA2, AGTTGAATCACCACTCCCACGGCT, 273-bp product; CA3, TACGCCAGCCACAACGGTGA, and CA4, CTCAGGCCTGGCATCTCAAGGT, 145-bp product; CA5, ACTGCCTTCTCCAGACACTGC, and CA6, TTTCCAGCACCATTCCCTAAGT, 100-bp product; CA7, CTGGATGGAGTCTACAGG, CA8, GCAAAGCACATCATACCTCTGC, 118-bp product; CA9, CAGCGATGAGTGTGTTAGAA, and CA10, TGTCAGTCGCAGTAAGT, 249-bp product; OvA, TTGTTCTCACTTATGTCCTGCC, and OvB, TTCAGTTACAACCAGATAATGG, 201-bp product; Ov1, ACAGCACCAGGACACAGATAA, and Ov2, AAGTCTACTGGCAAGGCTGAA, 175-bp product; Ov3, AACTCATGGATGAAGGCTTAAGG, and Ov4, TTGTCAGCATAGGAATGGTTGG, 220-bp product.

Blood was collected into 1× PBS, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmbenzamidine and filtered through sterile gauze. Erythrocytes were pelleted at 2200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed and pelleted in the same buffer an additional two times. The final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold RSB buffer (10 mmTris-HCl pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2 10 mmKCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 5 min on ice with vigorous agitation to lyse the cells. Nuclei were pelleted at 2000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant removed by aspiration. Pellets were resuspended in glutamate run-on buffer (125 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 40% glycerol), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C. Nuclei for analysis (100 μg of DNA) were thawed quickly and placed on ice, and then 1.0 μl of 1m creatine phosphate in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2.4 μl of 2 mg/ml creatine kinase, 1 μl of 100 mm ATP, 1 μl of AGC (25 mm of each of GTP, ATP, and CTP), 8 μl of [32P]UTP (160 μCi at 800 Ci/mmol) and 50 units of RNAsin (Promega) were added followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm together with 50 units of RNase-free Dnase 1 followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. 5 μl of 10× SET buffer (10% SDS, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA) and 150 μl of 1× SET buffer were added along with 10 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. RNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 90 μl of 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 15 μl of 2 m NaOH was added followed by incubation on ice for 10 min to partially fragment the RNA. Samples were neutralized by adding 0.48 m HEPES and heated to 100 °C for 5 min before applying to the filter. 5 μg of both sense and antisense single-stranded DNA was slot-blotted onto a Biodyne B membrane for each of the GAPDH, CA, ovalbumin, and βA-globin genes. The hybridization buffer was 50% deionized formamide, 6× SSPE buffer (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA), 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml tRNA. Prehybridization was for 2 h at 42 °C with hybridization overnight at 42 °C. Washing was for 10 min in 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 20 min in 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Total RNA was extracted from 15-day chicken erythrocytes using an RNAqueous kit (Ambion) and DNase 1-treated (1 unit/μg, 30 min, 37 °C). First strand cDNA was prepared from 2-μg aliquots using random hexamer primers (Promega) and Superscript II enzyme (Life Technologies, Inc.) under the following conditions: 90 °C for 3 min, add 300 units of Superscript II, 37 °C for 60 min, 95 °C for 3 min. Products were amplified by PCR (94 °C for 2 min; followed by 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min, for 28 cycles; finally, 72 °C for 7 min) with gene-specific primers that where designed to reveal the presence of contaminating genomic DNA in the RNA preparations. The two immunogens used to raise the antibodies utilized in the ChIP assays were chemically acetylated histone H4, in which essentially all of the lysine residues of H4 become modified (2Hebbes T.R.

Western blots were conducted to characterize the specificity of the sera, using histones extracted from butyrate-treated HeLa cells; in each case a Coomassie-stained marker lane of the these histones is shown for comparison. Fig. 1 shows the results for each serum using both SDS gels and acetic acid/urea (AU) or acetic acid/urea/Triton (AUT) gels. The SDS gels in Fig. 1, A andC, show that both sera are highly specific for the histone used as immunogen, although careful inspection shows that the specificities are not absolute. For example, the anti-acetylated H4 serum shows a weak recognition of H3 at the higher loading that amounts to about 10% of the activity against H4, whereas the anti-acetylated H3 peptide serum shows a very weak recognition of H4 and H2B histones. This weak cross-reactivity is almost certainly due to the presence of anti-acetyl lysine activity in the sera, as previously documented for sera derived from chemically acetylated H4 (44Hebbes T.R. Turner C.H. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When the acetylated subspecies are spread out using AUT or AU gels the specificity is more precisely revealed. For histone H4, about half of the activity is directed at the tetra (fully)-acetylated species, with the remainder against Ac3 and Ac2, whereas for histone H3 the activity is about equally directed against the Ac4 and Ac3 species (although a low activity against Ac2 can also be detected). These antisera can most simply be described as being against hyperacetylated H4 and H3. Antibodies from both sera were then affinity-purified using columns carrying the immobilized immunogens, i.e. chemically acetylated histone H4 and the acetylated H3 peptide. All of the ChIP experiments described below were carried out using these affinity-purified antibodies. Nucleosomal fragments from 15-day chicken embryo erythrocyte nuclei were prepared by micrococcal nuclease digestion and fractionated on a sucrose gradient. The di- and tri-nucleosomal components were pooled and used as “input” chromatin for ChIP assays. In a typical assay, 400 μg of input chromatin (as DNA) was mixed with 100 μg of affinity-purified antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunocomplexes were immobilized on protein A-Sepharose and washed to remove the “unbound” chromatin, and the “bound” chromatin was released by a SDS-containing buffer. Typically about 5–10 μg of DNA was recovered from the bound fraction, i.e. about 1.25–2.5% of the input. The content of acetylated histones in the two precipitated chromatin fractions was assessed by comparing the “input” (I) and “bound” (B) samples on stained AUT gels (Fig. 2). When the anti-acetylated H4 antibodies were used, as expected, the bound chromatin was indeed much enriched in multiply acetylated H4 species as compared with the input chromatin. Close inspection also showed some increase in multiply acetylated H3 species. In the experiment using the anti-acetylated H3 antibodies, an enrichment in multiply acetylated H3 species could be seen, as expected, but in addition there was a considerable rise in the acetylation level of the histone H4 present. The tight histone specificity of the anti-acetylated H3 peptide antibodies (Fig. 1) means that the co-isolation of other multiply acetylated histone species must"

Subcellular fractionation showed that this serine protease is synthesized as a membrane-bound protein while a free-form prostasin is secreted into the culture medium. Prostasin was identified in nuclear and membrane fractions. Membrane-bound prostasin can be released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment, or labeled by [3H]ethanolamine, indicating a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchorage. A prostasin-binding protein was identified in mouse and human seminal vesicle fluid. Both the secreted and the membrane-bound prostasin were able to form a covalently linked 82-kDa complex when incubated with seminal vesicle fluid. The complex formation between prostasin and the prostasin-binding protein was inhibited by a prostasin antibody, heparin, and serine protease inhibitors. Prostasin's serine protease activity was inhibited when bound to the prostasin-binding protein in mouse seminal vesicle fluid. This study indicates that prostasin is an active serine protease in its membrane-bound form. A recombinant human prostasin serine protease was expressed in several human cell lines. Subcellular fractionation showed that this serine protease is synthesized as a membrane-bound protein while a free-form prostasin is secreted into the culture medium.

Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of prostasin is 40 kDa when examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)1 under reducing conditions. Prostasin displays trypsin-like enzymatic activities by hydrolyzing peptidyl fluorogenic substrates such asd-Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC. This trypsin-like enzymatic activity can be inhibited by aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin, and benzamidine. Prostasin is present at high levels in normal human semen (8.61 ± 0.42 μg/ml) and in the prostate gland (143.7 ± 15.9 ng/mg). Lower amounts of prostasin can also be detected in other tissues. In the prostate gland, the prostasin protein is present in the epithelial cells as well as in the secretion inside the lumen. The full-length human prostasin mRNA has been deduced (2Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13483-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The predicted mature prostasin peptide sequence has a potential carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic membrane anchorage domain followed by a short cytoplasmic tail. The translated amino acid residue sequence of prostasin is similar to those of human prostase, testisin, plasma kallikrein, coagulation factor XI, hepsin, plasminogen, and acrosin (2Yu J.X. Chao L.

A membrane-bound Xenopus kidney epithelial cell sodium channel-activating protease (CAP1) was found highly homologous to human prostasin, sharing 53% sequence identity at the amino acid level (5Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Recently, the mouse counterpart of CAP1, mCAP1, has been cloned from a cortical collecting duct cell line (6Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Pfister C. Bens M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Hummler E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mCAP1 shares 77% amino acid sequence identity with human prostasin. Serine proteases play important roles in a diverse range of the body's normal physiological processes, and they are implicated in various pathological processes such as cardiovascular disorders and cancers (7Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The prostate produces a number of serine proteases such as prostate-specific antigen (8Wang M.C. Papsidero L.D. Kuriyana M. Valenzuela L.A. Murphy G.P. Chu T.M. Prostate. 1981; 2: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), human glandular kallikrein (9Frenette G. Deperthes D. Tremblay R.R. Lazure C. Dube J.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the most recently discovered prostase (3Nelson P.S. Gan L. Ferguson C. Moss P. Gelinas R. Hood L. Wang K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3114-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Some of these serine proteases are suspected to affect fertility or semen liquefaction (10Lilja H. Oldbring J. Rannevil G. Laurell C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and others are implicated in normal prostate development or prostatic diseases (11Guinan P. Bhatti R. Ray P. J.

For example, both prostate-specific antigen and human glandular kallikrein have become important diagnostic and prognostic markers for prostate cancer. Serine proteases are usually regulated at the post-translational level in addition to the transcriptional regulation at their gene level. The body's own strategy of regulating the serine proteases is to bind the serine proteases with a protein inhibitor such as the inhibitors of the serpin class (15Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These serpin-serine protease pairs are highly specific with regard to the two molecules involved; examples include α1-antitrypsin and elastase (15Carrell R.W. Pemberton P.A. Boswell D.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1987; 52: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), kallistatin and kallikrein (16Chen L.-M. Chao L. Mayfield R.K. Chao J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1990; 194: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The mechanism of serpin inhibition of serine proteases involves the formation of a covalently linked complex at a 1:1 stoichiometry (19Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Such a complex exhibits resistance to treatment with SDS or boiling (16Chen L.-M. Chao L. Mayfield R.K. Chao J. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological functions of prostasin are not fully understood. In a recent study (20Chen, L.-M., Hodge, G. B., Guarda, L. A., Welch, J. L., and Chai, K. X. (2001) Prostate, 48,in press.Google Scholar) we showed that prostasin expression is significantly down-regulated in high grade prostate tumors and is lost in highly invasive human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines. Transfection of two human prostate cancer cell lines DU-145 and PC-3 with human prostasin cDNA reduced in vitro invasiveness of the cells, suggesting an invasion suppressor role for prostasin. This anti-invasion activity is apparently conferred by the cellular prostasin but not the secreted prostasin. In the present study, we determined that prostasin is a GPI-anchored membrane protein in addition to being a secreted protease. The subcellular localization of prostasin was investigated in cells expressing native or recombinant prostasin. We have also identified a prostasin-binding protein (PBP), a potentially serpin class serine protease inhibitor specific for prostasin. We further demonstrated that the membrane-bound prostasin is an active serine protease. These results will provide structural and regulatory information for further investigation of the functions of prostasin in normal prostate development, prostatic diseases, as well as reproductive biology. A human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line, 293-EBNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU-145, and PC-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The LNCaP and the DU-145 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm sodium pyruvate; the PC-3 cells were maintained in F-12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were kept at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All tissue culture media, sera, and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. A full-length human prostasin cDNA of 1,896 base pairs (including a 209-base pair 5′-untranslated region, 1,032 base pairs of the coding region, and a 655-base pair 3′-untranslated region) was generated by means of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with the following two primers, 5′-AGA CGG TGC TGG TGA CTC GT-3′ and 5′-TGT GCT CAA ACA TTT TAA TC-3′, using the total RNA of LNCaP cells as template (2Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13483-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pREP-8 (Invitrogen), at its polylinker site. Transfection of the prostasin cDNA plasmid into 293-EBNA cells was carried out using electroporation. The electroporated cells were then subcultured for selection of transfectants (293/Pro) using 5 mmhistidinol (Sigma) in the culture medium for 2 weeks. The pREP-8 vector plasmid was transfected into 293-EBNA cells and subjected to histidinol selection to establish the control cells (293/Vec). The DU-145 and the PC-3 cells, which do not express prostasin (20Chen, L.-M., Hodge, G. B., Guarda, L. A., Welch, J. L., and Chai, K. X. (2001) Prostate, 48,in press.Google Scholar), were also transfected using plasmids containing the full-length human prostasin cDNA. The methods for plasmid engineering and establishment of transfectants that express human prostasin have been described previously (20Chen, L.-M., Hodge, G. B., Guarda, L. A., Welch, J. L., and Chai, K. X. (2001) Prostate, 48,in press.Google Scholar). The resulting cell lines that express human prostasin were designated DU-145/Pro and PC-3/Pro. These procedures were carried out for all experiments unless stated otherwise. Samples were suspended in 1 × SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 2% v/v glycerol, 2% w/v SDS, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and resolved in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with India ink for 15 min (1:1,000 in TBS-T: 20 mm Tris at pH 7.6 containing 0.137 m NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), blocked in 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, and incubated with the primary antibody for 30 min in a tray or a Surf-blot apparatus (Idea Scientific, Inc., Minneapolis). After washing, the membrane was incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, used at a 1:10,000 dilution) for 30 min. Signals were detected using ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) with WestPico reagents (Pierce) following the supplier's protocol. The membrane was then exposed to Kodak x-ray film. The primary antibodies used were as follows: polyclonal antibodies against prostasin (recombinant or native, used at 1:1,000), a monoclonal antibody against β1-integrin (used at 1:1,000), and a monoclonal antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (used at 1:500). Antibodies against β1-integrin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego). The 293/Pro cells were grown to a confluent monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5 mmhistidinol. Cells were then placed in Opti-MEM I serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 72 h before collection of the conditioned medium. The collected medium was tested for recombinant prostasin (r-hPro) by Western blot analysis using a prostasin-specific antibody (1Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of the secreted prostasin, the serum-free medium was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min to remove dead cells or debris and then passed through an aprotinin-agarose column (1.5 × 20 cm, Sigma) equilibrated with 25 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.6 at a flow rate of 25 ml/h. After extensive washing to remove any unbound proteins, the bound prostasin was eluted with 0.1m glycine (pH 3.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. The eluted prostasin was immediately neutralized with appropriate amounts of 1 m Tris, combined, concentrated with Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA), and stored at −20 °C before use in other assays. 250 μg of the purified r-hPro in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) and was injected subcutaneously into a 1.5-kg female New Zealand White rabbit (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Booster injections with 100 μg of r-hPro (emulsified with incomplete Freund's adjuvant, Sigma) were performed three times at 3-week intervals. Preimmune rabbit serum was collected before the initial immunization. The PC-3/Pro or LNCaP cells were seeded on glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) at a density of 5 × 104/coverslip and grown for 24–36 h prior to a double immunostaining. Briefly, cells were rinsed three times in 1 × PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeablized with 0.18% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking in 10% normal goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 × PBS, cells were incubated with the primary antibodies for 45 min, washed, incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies at room temperature for 30 min, and then washed three times for 10 min each in 1 × PBS. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against prostasin was used at a dilution of 1:100. A monoclonal antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was used as a nuclear specific marker at a dilution of 1:75. A goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein (1:50, Life Technologies, Inc.) and a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (1:800, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) were used as the secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted with Gel/Mount (Fisher Scientific) and analyzed on a Carl Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described in Krajewski et al. (21Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar) and Pemberton et al. (22Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J. Erickson J.R. Mouchabeck Z.M. Kiefer M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 4 × 150-cm2 flasks (estimated 5–10 × 107cells/total) were washed three times with 1 × PBS and removed by mechanical force for the 293/Pro cells or trypsin treatment (0.25% with 1 mm EDTA) for the PC-3/Pro and LNCaP cells. The cells were resuspended in 7 ml of cold MES buffer (17 mmat pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml antipain). The following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cell suspension was homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer for 60 strokes followed by centrifugation twice at 500 × g for 10 min, resulting in the crude nuclear fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 15 min, resulting in the heavy membrane fraction in the pellet containing mitochondria, lysosomes, and peroxisomes. The supernatant from the 10,000 × g centrifugation was subjected to an ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, resulting in a light membrane fraction in the pellet containing the plasma membrane, microsomes, and endoplasmic reticula. The supernatant from the final centrifugation contains soluble or cytosolic proteins. The pellets from each centrifugation were washed with 2 × 10 ml of MES to eliminate carryovers. Differential extraction of membrane fractions was carried out according to Pei et al. (23Pei D. Kang T. Qi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33988-33997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, pellet/membrane fractions were divided equally into three portions and were extracted with 1% Triton X-114 in Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) or high salt (350 mm NaCl in Tris buffer), or alkali (50 mmglycine/NaOH, pH 11.0) for 1 h on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 1 × SDS sample buffer for gel electrophoresis. The supernatant was subjected to a trichloroacetic acid precipitation to recover proteins for gel electrophoresis. The procedure was adapted from those described by Bordier (24Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Rosenberg (25Rosenberg I.M. Protein Analysis and Purification. Birkhauser, Boston1996: 254Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-114 (Sigma) and protease inhibitors for 2 h with gentle shaking at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant (500 μl, or 700–800 μg of total protein) was overlaid onto a 300-μl sucrose cushion (6% w/v sucrose in TBS containing 0.06% Triton X-114). The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 3 min and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature to separate the detergent phase (pellet) and the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was removed and extracted further with 0.5% Triton X-114 and 2% Triton X-114. The aqueous phase after the final centrifugation contains the soluble proteins. The detergent phase (pellet) from the first centrifugation was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold TBS, incubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 min at room temperature to ensure the purity of the detergent phase. The detergent phase was resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold TBS. 10 μl of the resuspended detergent phase was subjected to PI-PLC (Sigma) digestion at 37 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking in a total volume of 100 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 144 mm NaCl). 100 μl of ice-cold TBS containing 2% Triton X-114 was then added to the digestion mixture and subjected to phase separation as described above. At the final step, both the aqueous and detergent phases were precipitated with 6% w/v trichloroacetic acid and 0.013% sodium deoxycholate. The precipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer, neutralized with ammonium hydroxide (microliter amounts), boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Human prostates removed by radical prostatectomy performed at Orlando Regional Medical Center (Orlando, FL) were sectioned with a cryostat at 20-μm thickness. 80 sections were collected and rinsed with PBS twice to remove prostatic fluid. The washed prostate sections were lysed in 1 ml of TBS containing 1% Triton X-114 at 4 °C overnight with rocking. The lysed prostate tissues were centrifuged and subjected to the same phase separation and PI-PLC treatment procedures as described above. Several representative prostate sections (7 μm) cut at intervals of the 80 20-μm sections were subjected to standard hematoxylin and eosin staining for confirmation of benign prostate morphology. The use of human tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Orlando Regional Medical Center and the University of Central Florida. PC-3/Pro (3 × 105) or LNCaP (1 × 106) cells were seeded in a 35-mm dish in 1 ml of Opti-MEM I serum-free medium. The next day, [1-3H]ethan-1-ol-2-amine hydrochloride (37 MBq, 1 mCi/ml, and 30.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml, and the cells were cultured for another 24 h. Cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer (PBS at pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 2 μg/ml anti-prostasin IgG (purified using Econo-Pac protein A cartridge, Bio-Rad) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed with RIPA buffer three times, resuspended in 2 × SDS sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed in a solution of 2-propanol:water:acetic acid (12.5: 32.5: 5) for 30 min and soaked in Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for another 30 min. The gel was dried, and3H-labeled molecules were detected by exposure to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C for 14 days. Seminal vesicle fluid was expressed from one pair of mouse seminal vesicles (C57BL/6 mouse, Harlan, Indianapolis) and mixed with 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. 5 μl of the supernatant (50 μg of total protein) was incubated with either 0.5 μg of the purified recombinant human prostasin or subcellular fractions of 293/Pro and PC-3/Pro cells (prepared in the absence of serine protease inhibitors) at 37 °C for 60 min, or for various time periods for a time course study. The binding reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Mouse tissues were homogenized in PBS (1 g of tissue/5 ml) and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. 40 μg of total protein for each tissue extract was used in the binding assay. 1 μl of human or mouse plasma was also subjected to prostasin binding assay. The use of animals was approved by the IACUC of the University of Central Florida. Human seminal vesicles were obtained from radical prostatectomy performed at Orlando Regional Medical Center. No seminal vesicle metastasis from prostate cancer was found according to the pathology report. Human seminal vesicle fluid was diluted with PBS at a ratio of 1:2, mixed by vortex, and spun. 10 μl of the diluted fluid was incubated with 0.5 μg of purified prostasin at 37 °C for 60 min. The membrane overlay zymography was carried out using the protocols of Enzyme System Product (Livermore, CA) and Beals et al. (26Beals D.F. Stedman E. Kouns D.M. Clin. Chem. 1969; 15: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were first resolved in a 10% polyacrylamide gel without SDS or β-mercaptoethanol. After electrophoresis, the gel was equilibrated in a reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) for 15 min. Pre-wet acetate-cellulose membrane impregnated with the prostasin substrate d-Pro-Phe-Arg-AFC (Enzyme System Product) was then carefully laid over the gel without entrapping air bubbles. The membrane-overlaid gel was placed in a moist chamber at 37 °C for 3–5 h. The reaction was monitored using an ultraviolet lamp and photographed. Serum-free conditioned medium from 293/Pro cell culture was prepared and passed through an aprotinin-agarose column for a one-step affinity-chromatographic purification of the recombinant prostasin as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see also Ref. 1Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Coomassie Blue staining of the purified recombinant prostasin is shown in Fig. 1, left panel (r-hPro). The r-hPro migrates at 40 kDa on an SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Because of glycosylation of the prostasin molecule (1Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13483-13489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it appeared as a rather diffused band on the gel. We prepared a polyclonal antibody (r-Pro Ab) using the purified r-hPro as an antigen. The r-Pro antibody recognized the purified recombinant prostasin (secreted form), the recombinant prostasin in 293/Pro total cell lysate (nonsecreted form), and the native prostasin in ejaculated human semen (obtained from healthy volunteers, Ref. 1Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, upper right panel, lanes 1, 2, and 4). The prostasin protein in the same set of samples was also recognized by a prostasin-specific antibody referenced previously (1Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,lower right panel). Neither antibody cross-reacts with any nonspecific protein in the control 293/Vec total cell lysate (Fig. 1,right panel, lanes 3). The results indicate that the polyclonal antibody against the recombinant prostasin is specific to prostasin and that the recombinant prostasin prepared using the amplified cDNA has an immunological reactivity similar to that of the native prostasin. The antibody against the recombinant prostasin was used in the ensuing assays conducted in this study. A hydropathy plot of the translated prostasin amino acid sequence indicated that the prostasin polypeptide has a potential membrane-anchorage domain at the carboxyl terminus (2Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J.

To confirm the presence of a potentially membrane-anchored form of the prostasin protein, the 293/Pro cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation. Fig. 2shows that prostasin was present in the crude nuclear fraction (P1, 500-g pellet), heavy membranes (P2, 10,000-g pellet), and light membranes (P3, 100,000-g pellet), as determined by Western blot analysis. Prostasin was also detected in the cytosol (S). The purified r-hPro was used as positive control. Equal amounts of total protein (30 μg) from each membrane fraction and the cytosol were applied in each lane. To show that the membrane-anchored prostasin is not a peculiarity in the 293 cells, we performed similar subcellular fractionation analysis on prostasin cDNA-transfected human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (PC-3/Pro) and the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which expresses endogenous prostasin (2Yu J.X.

(2001) Prostate, 48,in press.Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, prostasin is detected in P1, P2, and P3 fractions, but not in the cytosol (S) of PC-3/Pro. In the LNCaP cells, endogenously expressed prostasin is detected only in the P3 fraction. The membrane fractions from PC-3/Pro cells were then immunoblotted with a monoclonal antibody against a nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or a monoclonal antibody against a plasma membrane-bound protein β1-integrin to ensure the purity of each fraction. The results showed that the prostasin protein exists in a membrane-bound form in all cell lines tested. The cells transfected with the vector DNA alone (293/Vec and PC-3/Vec) were subjected to the same fractionation procedures followed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis. No prostasin was detected (data not shown). We further subjected PC-3/Pro and LNCaP cells to a double immunostaining and analyzed the subcellular localization of prostasin using confocal microscopy. The confocal microscopic analysis of PC-3/Pro cells localized prostasin (green) to the ER-Golgi complex (Fig. 3 B), c"

This interface is quite specific as a single amino acid difference annuls the ability of a Gαi peptide to bind the A1 adenosine receptor (Gilchrist, A., Mazzoni, M., Dineen, B., Dice, A., Linden, J., Dunwiddie, T., and Hamm, H. E. (1998 ) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14912–14919). Recently, we demonstrated that a plasmid minigene vector encoding the C-terminal sequence of Gαi could specifically inhibit downstream responses to agonist stimulation of the muscarinic M2 receptor (Gilchrist, A., Bunemann, M., Li, A., Hosey, M. M., and H. E. Hamm (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 6610–6616). To selectively antagonize G protein signal transduction events and determine which G protein underlies a given thrombin-induced response, we generated minigene vectors that encode the C-terminal sequence for each family of Gα subunits. Minigene vectors expressing Gα C-terminal peptides (Gαi, Gαq, Gα12, and Gα13) or the control minigene vector, which expresses the Gαi peptide in random order (GiR), were systematically introduced into a human microvascular endothelial cell line. The C-terminal peptides serve as competitive inhibitors presumably by blocking the site on the G protein-coupled receptor that normally binds the G protein. Our results not only confirm that each G protein can control certain signaling events, they emphasize the specificity of the G protein-coupled receptor-G protein interface.

Its activities are mediated by a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)1 designated protease-activated receptors or PARs. Three of the four PARs cloned thus far can be activated by thrombin (PAR1, PAR2, PAR4), and the resulting intracellular signaling pathways initiated are via heterotrimeric G proteins. Of the four PARs, the signal transduction pathways of PAR1 have been the most extensively studied (9Coughlin S.R. Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Semin. Thromb.

Receptor activation occurs following proteolytic cleavage of the N terminus of the thrombin receptor by thrombin (see reviews in Refs. 27Coughlin S.R. Thromb.

A new N terminus is exposed on the receptor that serves as a tethered peptide ligand, which results in signaling across the membrane. Because proteolytic cleavage of PAR is irreversible, and the tethered ligand cannot diffuse away from the receptor, classical antagonists have been difficult to identify, and alternative targets for blocking downstream consequences of thrombin-mediated cellular activation must be considered (see reviews in Refs. 29Bernatowicz M.S.

One alternative is at the site of receptor-G protein interaction. The molecular interactions that occur between the receptor and the G protein are fundamental to the transduction of environmental signals into specific cellular responses. As is observed with many GPCRs, PAR1 is promiscuous, coupling to multiple G proteins in the same cell including Gi, Gq, and G12/13. A variety of studies have implicated the C terminus of the Gα subunit in mediating receptor-G protein interaction and selectivity (32Conklin R.B. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

This interaction appears to be quite specific, as a single amino acid difference can annul the ability of the Gαi1/2peptide to bind the A1 adenosine receptor (33Gilchrist A. Mazzoni M. Dineen B. Dice A. Linden J. Dunwiddie T. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14912-14919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using a dominant negative strategy we designed a minigene vector that encodes the C-terminal 11 amino acid sequence from Gα (36Gilchrist A. Bünemann M. Li A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We speculated that when the C-terminal Gα peptides were produced inside cells, they would serve as competitive inhibitors of downstream responses, presumably by blocking the binding site on the receptor as had been observed when synthetic peptides were employed (19Ellis C.A.

We demonstrated that the Gαi C-terminal minigene vector (pcDNA-Gi1/2) could specifically inhibit G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel activity mediated through the muscarinic M2 receptor. To determine the specificity of the receptor-G protein interaction, we have now constructed minigene vectors encoding each of the unique human Gα C-terminal sequences. As controls we constructed a minigene vector with the Gαi1/2 sequence in random order (pcDNA-GiR) and a minigene vector in which the final two C-terminal amino acids from the Gq sequence are mutated (pcDNA-GαqΔ). To determine the G proteins that underlie a given thrombin-mediated downstream signaling response, Gα C-terminal minigene vectors were systematically introduced into human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) by transient transfection. Our results indicate that the C-terminal minigenes can appropriately inhibit thrombin-mediated activation events mediated by a particular G protein. Furthermore, the various C-terminal minigenes give us a general idea of which G proteins control subsequent signaling events, as well as highlighting the specificity of the receptor-G protein interface. Together the findings point out the power of the C-terminal minigenes as a tool, and suggest the minigene approach may allow us to define which amino acid residues play a critical role in receptor interaction. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The parent pcDNA 3.1(−) vector was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and the enhanced green fluorescent probe plasmid vector (pEGFP) was from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Oregon Green Bapta-1 acetoxymethyl ester, Pluronic F127, and rhodamine-phalloidin were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All restriction enzymes were procured from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The highly purified α-thrombin (∼2000 units/mg) and quinpirole were obtained from Calbiochem. [3H]Myoinositol (specific activity 22.2 Ci/mmol) and [3H]adenine (specific activity 24 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Isobutyl-methylxanthine and isoproterenol were from Sigma. For our studies we used a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line that was transformed using SV-40 (HMEC-1; obtained from Dr. Asrar Malik, University of Illinois, Chicago). The cells were maintained in MCDB 131 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (5000 units/ml, 5000 µg/ml), hydrocortisone (1 µg/ml), epidermal growth factor (0.01 mg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and subcultured after detachment with trypsin/EDTA (0.05%/0.5 mm). All studies utilized cell passages 18–26. cDNA minigene constructs were designed as described previously (36Gilchrist A. Bünemann M. Li A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the C terminus of each Gα were synthesized and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA 3.1(−). Multiple clones for each Gα C-terminal minigene were selected, grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/ml), and the plasmid DNA was purified using miniprep kits from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The DNA was cut with NcoI and separated on a 1.5% agarose gel to determine whether an insert was present. A shift in the digest band pattern from three bands (3345, 1352, and 735 base pairs) to four bands (3345, 1011, 735, and 380 base pairs) indicates that an insert is present. Clones with the proper digest pattern were verified by dideoxy sequencing. All Gα minigene constructs used for transfection experiments were purified from 1-liter cultures using endotoxin-free maxi-prep kits (Qiagen) as described (36Gilchrist A. Bünemann M. Li A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HMEC were transiently transfected with DNA (2 µg/100-mm plate or 0.5 µg/well for 6-well plate) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). To monitor the efficiency of transfection, cells were cotransfected with pEGFP, a plasmid vector containing enhanced green fluorescent protein. After 6 h, the medium was changed, and fresh medium added. After 48 h, cells cotransfected with pEGFP were replated onto coverslips and analyzed using a fluorescence microscope to determine the efficiency of transfection (39Gerdes H.H. Kaether C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 44-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Typically, 40–60% of the cells were transfected. HMEC were seeded onto 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA-Gi, or pcDNA-GiR (1 µg/well) and were used to assay cAMP accumulation as described (40Faure M. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7851-7854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h, cells were labeled with 3 µCi/ml [3H]adenine for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with serum-free media containing 1 mm isobutyl-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. To stimulate cAMP accumulation, cells were treated with 1 µm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C. To determine the inhibitory effect of thrombin, cells were pretreated with 50 nm thrombin or 1 µmquinpirole for 15 min prior to the addition of isoproterenol. The reactions were terminated by the aspiration of media followed by the addition of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the acid-soluble nucleotides were separated on ion exchange columns. Experiments to measure inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation were performed as described (41Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Tkachuk V.A. Cheknyova E.G. Panchenko M.P. Grigorian G.Y. Vavrek R.J. Stewart J.M. Ryan U.S. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 44-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, HMEC were seeded onto 6-well plates 18 h before transfection at 2 × 105/well. Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1, pcDNA-Gi, pcDNA-GiR, or pcDNA-Gq as described above. After 24 h cells were incubated in 2 ml of culture medium containing 4 µCi/ml [3H]myoinositol to obtain steady state labeling of cellular inositol lipids. Transiently transfected cells were assayed for IP accumulation 48 h after transfection. Two hours prior to stimulation cells were washed, and the medium was replaced with medium containing 5 mm LiCl. Cells were stimulated with 10 nm α-thrombin for 10 min. Aspiration of the medium and addition of ice-cold methanol (final concentration 5%) stopped IP formation. Acid-lysed cells were centrifuged at 2500 rpm, 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant containing IP was eluted through a Poly-prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad) containing 1.6-ml anion exchange resin (Dowex AG1-X8, formate form, 200–400 mesh). The perchloric acid-precipitated pellets that contained phosphatidylinositols and lipids were resuspended with 1 ml of chloroform-methanol, 10 m HCl (200:100:1, v/v/v). These suspensions were mixed with 350 µl of HCl and 350 µl of chloroform and centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 rpm to separate the phases. The lower hydrophobic phase was recovered and dried in counting vials to determine the amount of radioactivity in total phosphatidylinositols. The radioactivity contained in the eluate and phospholipid extracts was counted with a Packard Tricarb 1500 counter (Downers Grove, IL) after the addition of scintillation fluid. HMEC were seeded onto 100-mm plates 18 h before transfection at 1 × 105/ml. Cells were co-transfected with 1 µg of pcDNA3.1, pcDNA-Gi, pcDNA-GiR, or pcDNA-Gq and 1 µg of hemagglutinin-tagged MAPK (HA-MAPK) as described above. After 30 h, the cells were serum-starved for 18 h before being treated with 10 nm thrombin for 20 min. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 10 µg/ml leupeptin), and HA-MAPK protein was immunoprecipitated using 12CA5 antibody (Berkeley Antibodies, Berkeley, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were then added and the tubes rotated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed three times in radioimmune precipitation buffer before being used in the kinase assay (kit obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Kinase activity of HA-MAPK (ERK1) was measured using myelin basic protein as the substrate (42Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). HMEC cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA), pcDNA-Gi, pcDNA-Gq, or pcDNA-GiR minigene DNA. After 48 h, the cells were transferred to coverslips at a low confluency in a 24-well plate and allowed to adhere for 2 h. The medium was aspirated and each coverslip was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of loading buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.83 mm Na2HPO4, 0.17 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm mannose) containing 0.1% (v/v) pluronic F127 and 10 µm Oregon Green Bapta-1 acetoxymethyl ester. The cells were washed twice with and incubated in Ca2+ buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.55 mm MgCl2). The coverslips were placed in the chamber mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope. The experiment was performed at room temperature in Ca2+ buffer. Basal conditions were established for 40 s before the addition of thrombin (∼ 70 nm). Recordings (1000-ms exposure time) were made every 10 s and continued for 170 s after stimulation with thrombin. Images were quantified using the NIH Image Program. As a marker for transfected cells, the pEGFP plasmid containing the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein was co-transfected together with minigene constructs as described above. Cell were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips, serum-starved for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Thereafter, cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mm rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize polymerized F-actin. Cells were washed extensively and mounted using Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were observed with an inverted microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon, Inc., Melville, NY) equipped for both differential interference contrast microscopy and epifluorescence observation using a 60× oil immersion objective. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images were recorded for each cell field with a cooled, integrating Photometric Imagepoint charge-coupled device array camera (CCD; Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ) connected to the microscope. Statistical comparisons were made using a two-tailed Student's t test. Experimental values were considered significant at p < 0.05. Previously, we have shown that a minigene vector expressing the Gαi1/2 C-terminal peptide (pcDNA-Gi1/2) can almost completely inhibit G protein inwardly rectifying K+ channel activity following agonist stimulation of the M2 muscarinic receptor (36Gilchrist A. Bünemann M. Li A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This inhibition was specific as transfection of the pcDNA-Gαs or pcDNA-Gαq C-terminal minigene vector had no effect (36Gilchrist A. Bünemann M. Li A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that a minigene vector encoding the C-terminal sequence from Gαi1/2 could inhibit downstream responses to thrombin stimulation (19Ellis C.A. Malik A.B. Gilchrist A.

To determine whether we could selectively antagonize thrombin-mediated signal transduction, we generated minigene plasmid constructs that encode the C-terminal peptide sequences for several of the different Gα subunits. Short oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the C terminus of each Gα were synthesized and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA 3.1(−). As controls we used minigene vectors containing the Gαi1/2C-terminal peptide in random order (pcDNA-GiR; TableI) and a Gαq minigene vector in which the final two amino acids have been mutated (pcDNA-GqΔ; Table I).Table ISequences of expressed C-terminal minigene peptidesGiMGIKNNLKDCGLFGiRMGNGIKCLFNDKLGqMGLQLNLKEYNAVGqΔMGLQLNLKEYNTLG12MGLQENLKDIMLQG13MGLHDNLKQLMLQThe human C-terminal Gα peptides are shown with the Met and Gly at their N termini as would be expressed by the minigene vectors.

GqΔis the Gq peptide in which the final two amino acids (italicized) have been changed. In our studies, we used a human dermal microvascular cell line transformed with SV-40 (HMEC-1), as these cells are a readily available, easily transfected cell line that represents an established model system for the study of endothelial functions (43Xu Y. Swerlick R.A. Sepp N. Bosse D. Ades E.W. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 833-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the C-terminal peptides are being expressed, the transfected cells were analyzed using reverse-phase HPLC as described previously (36Gilchrist A. Bünemann M. Li A. Hosey M.M. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6610-6616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We estimate, given the efficiency of transfection for the experiment and the amount of lyophilized peptide obtained from reverse-phase HPLC, that the transfected HMEC have a concentration of ∼100 nm peptide after 48 h (data not shown). Following verification of peptide production by the minigenes, we systematically introduced different C-terminal Gα minigenes into the endothelial cells and examined the downstream consequences on biochemical and functional end points following thrombin stimulation. Thrombin stimulation is known to affect cAMP levels, and this effect can be inhibited by pertussis toxin indicating that Gi/Go is involved in the signaling pathway (44Manolopoulos G.V. Fenton J.W. Lelkes P.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1356: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether the Gαi1/2 C-terminal minigene could affect intracellular cAMP levels following thrombin stimulation, we transfected HMEC with pcDNA-Gi or the control vectors pcDNA (vector only) or pcDNA-GiR (the Gαi sequence in random order). As shown in Fig. 1 we found that basal cAMP levels were essentially equivalent for all conditions tested. Endothelial cells stimulated with isoproterenol to activate β-adrenergic receptors increase their cAMP levels through the Gs pathway. Cells transfected with pcDNA, pcDNA-Gi, or pcDNA-GiR showed little difference in isoproterenol-mediated cAMP accumulation, with an 82, 64, and 77-fold increase, respectively. When the endothelial cells are pre-incubated with 50 nm thrombin for 15 min prior to the addition of isoproterenol, a decrease in cAMP levels was observed. Endothelial cells transfected with the control pcDNA vector and pre-incubated with thrombin showed a 39% decrease in cAMP level over cells stimulated with only isoproterenol. Similarly, cells transfected with the pcDNA-GiR minigene vector and pre-incubated with thrombin had a 43% decrease over cells stimulated with isoproterenol only. However, cells transfected with the pcDNA-Gi minigene vector and pre-incubated with thrombin had virtually no decrease in cAMP levels (0.1%) as compared with cells stimulated with isoproterenol only. Thus, cells expressing the Gi C-terminal peptide appear to be unable to inhibit adenylyl cyclase following activation with thrombin. Our results support our previous work and indicate that we can specifically block thrombin-mediated Gi signalin"

We demonstrate here that BCR-activated BLNK−/− B cells fail to enter the cell cycle, and this is due to their inability to induce the expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4. BCR-stimulated BLNK−/− B cells also do not up-regulate the cell survival protein Bcl-xL, which may be necessary for the cells to complete the cell cycle. In addition, BLNK−/− B cells exhibit a high rate of spontaneous apoptosis in culture. Examination of the various BCR-activated signaling pathways in mouse BLNK−/− B cells reveals the intact activation of Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinases but the impaired activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB that is known to regulate genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. The inability to activate NF-κB in BCR-stimulated BLNK−/− B cells is due to a failure to induce the degradation of the inhibitory κB protein. In all these aspects, BLNK−/− B cells resemble xid B cells that have a mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Recently, phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 has also been demonstrated to be essential for NF-κB activation. Since BLNK has been shown separately to interact with both Btk and PLC-γ2, our finding of normal Btk but impaired PLC-γ2 activation in BCR-stimulated BLNK−/− B cells strongly suggests that BLNK orchestrates the formation of a Btk-PLC-γ2 signaling axis that regulates NF-κB activation. Taken together, the NF-κB activation defect may be sufficient to explain the similar defects in BCR-induced B cell proliferation and T cell-independent immune responses in BLNK−/−, Btk−/−, and PLC-γ2−/− mice.

Its signaling can lead to various distinct cellular responses including receptor editing, anergy, and cell death of immature B cells and activation, proliferation, and differentiation of mature B lymphocytes (1DeFranco A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In molecular terms, the engagement of the BCR is known to activate cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Syk, Src, and Tec families such as Syk, Lyn, Blk, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). The activation of these PTKs generally leads to calcium fluxes, the phosphorylation of other signaling molecules, and, ultimately, to the induction of transcription factors that result in new gene expression (2Campbell K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how these downstream signaling events are being coordinated with the activation of the BCR-proximal PTKs. In particular, it is still not clear how the biochemical events initiated by BCR signaling could be translated into distinct cellular responses. Recently, adaptor proteins have been shown to interface PTK activation with selective downstream molecules and could therefore channel BCR signaling to elicit distinct cellular outcomes (3Myung P. Boerthe N. Koretzky G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One such adaptor molecule in B-lymphocyte is B cell linker (BLNK) (4Fu C. Turck C. Kurosaki T. Chan A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), otherwise known as SLP-65 (5Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) or BASH (6Goitsuka R. Fujimura Y. Mamada H. Umeda A. Morimura T. Uetsuka K. Doi K. Tsuji S. Kitamura D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5804-5808PubMed Google Scholar). BLNK is a Src homology 2 and 3 domain-containing protein that bears homology to another adaptor molecule called SLP-76 that is found in T cells (7Jackman J. Motto D. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C. Peltz G. Koretzky G. Findell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7029-7032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). BLNK is phosphorylated upon BCR stimulation (5Wienands J. Schweikert J. Wollscheid B. Jumaa H. Nielsen P. Reth M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and couples Syk activation to Grb2, Vav, Nck, and phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2 that is intimately associated with intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (8Ishiai M.

In addition, BLNK has been shown to play a role in the activation of all three major classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), namely the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK in the DT40 chicken B cell line (8Ishiai M.

BLNK also interacts with Btk through the Src homology 2 domain of the latter (9Hashimoto S. Iwamatsu A. Ishiai M. Okawa K. Yamadori T. Matsushita M. Baba Y. Kishimoto T. Kurosaki T. Tsukada S.

BLNK−/− mice have a severe but incomplete block in B cell development and lack specifically CD5+ B cells due to a defect in the generation and maintenance of this B cell subset (22Xu S. Wong S. Lam K.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4153-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, they do not respond to T cell-independent antigen (18Xu S. Tan J. Wong E. Manickam A. Ponniah S.

BLNK−/− B cells also do not proliferate and up-regulate the expression of activation markers upon BCR cross-linking (18Xu S. Tan J. Wong E. Manickam A. Ponniah S. Lam K.P. Int.

Given the similarities in the phenotypes of Btk−/− and BLNK−/−mice and the demonstrated interaction between Btk and BLNK (9Hashimoto S. Iwamatsu A. Ishiai M. Okawa K. Yamadori T. Matsushita M.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we now examine the BCR-initiated molecular events leading to cell cycle entry and survival in BLNK−/− B cells. In this report, we demonstrate that BCR-activated BLNK−/− B cells fail to enter the cell cycle; this is due to their inability to express the cell cycle regulatory and cell survival proteins. Finally, we examine the BCR-activated signal transduction pathways that may be perturbed in mouse primary B lymphocytes lacking BLNK and show that these mutant cells specifically do not activate the NF-κB signaling pathway that have been implicated in the regulation of genes essential for B cell proliferation and survival. The generation of BLNK−/−mice has been described previously (18Xu S. Tan J. Wong E. Manickam A. Ponniah S. Lam K.P. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All mice were used at 6–12 weeks of age and in accordance with institutional guidelines. Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of wild-type and BLNK−/− mice and depleted of erythrocytes by treatment with red blood cell lysis solution (0.15 mNH4Cl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, pH 7.2). Primary B lymphocytes were isolated by negative selection of splenic cell samples using anti-CD43 monoclonal antibody-coupled MACS beads (Miltenyi, Germany). The purity of the B cells recovered was ∼90%, as assessed by FACS analyses using anti-B220 and anti-IgM antibodies. Purified primary B cells were stimulated with LPS (Sigma), PMA (Sigma), or goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragment (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). For the NF-κB assays, cells were cultured initially at 5 × 106 cells/200 μl in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium containing HEPES buffer, 2400 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate and l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) to reduce the background levels of NF-κB activity. For the IκBα assays, cells were pre-treated with 50 μmcycloheximide (Sigma) for 30 min and subsequently stimulated in the continued presence of the drug. For the preparation of nuclear extracts, cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in a hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The nuclear extracts were spun through Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) to concentrate and desalt the samples. A Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay was employed to determine the amount of nuclear proteins present using known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standards. For the preparation of total cell lysate, cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in a phosphotyrosine lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). A colorimetric MTT assay (Roche, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to measure cell proliferation in vitro. Briefly, 5 × 105 B cells were stimulated with varying concentrations of F(ab)′2 goat anti-mouse IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) antibody or LPS (Sigma) for 48 h in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the MTT labeling reagent for 4 h and with the second step reagent overnight. Cell proliferation was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 570 nm wavelength. For cell cycle analysis, wild-type and BLNK−/− B cells that were not treated or were stimulated with anti-IgM (20 μg/ml) or LPS (25 μg/ml) were cultured in the presence of 40 μm5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma) at 4 × 106cells/well in a 48-well tissue culture plate. After 48 h of incubation, cells were harvested and washed once with 1% BSA in PBS. The cell pellet was subsequently resuspended in 200 μl of PBS and fixed overnight in 1 ml of 70% ethanol at −20 °C. After centrifugation, the cells were incubated with 1 ml of 2 nHCl/Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min to denature the DNA. The cells were further washed with 0.5% Tween 20/BSA/PBS. Anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton Dickinson) was added to the cells for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) was added at 5 μg/ml to the fixed cells, and the analyses were carried out on a FACScan using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For the analysis of cell death, ex vivo cells and cells that were non-treated or stimulated with anti-IgM or LPS overnight were harvested, washed once in PBS, and fixed overnight in ethanol at −20 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed once in PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of 100 μg/ml ribonuclease A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, propidium iodide was added at 50 μg/ml to the cells prior to their analyses on a FACScan. Nuclear extract (10 μg) isolated from B cells was incubated with an [α-32P]ATP end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe that contains two tandemly positioned NF-κB-binding sites, 5′-CATGGCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT-3′ and 5′-CATGAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. The reaction was performed in 20 μl of binding buffer (60 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm dithiothreitol, 62.5% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) for 30 min on ice. After incubation, the samples were resolved in a 5% native gel for 2 h. The gel was dried for 1 h and exposed to an autoradiography film. Densitometry analysis was carried out using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer and multi-analysis software (Bio-Rad). After stimulation with anti-IgM, LPS, or PMA, the purified B cells were lysed on ice for 15 min in a 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-C1, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Proteins corresponding to 5 × 106 cells or 5 μg of nuclear extracts were electrophoresed in 9–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated separately with the various antibodies that recognized the different molecules being studied. Protein bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-cyclin D2 (M-20, Santa Cruz), anti-cdk4 (SC-22, Santa Cruz), anti-Bcl-xL(clone 44, Transduction Laboratories), anti-bcl-2 (Ab-4, Oncogene), anti-tubulin (Ab-4, NeoMarkers), anti-NF-κB p50 (H-119, santa Cruz), anti-NF-κB p65 (C-20, Santa Cruz), anti-IκBα (SC-371, Santa Cruz), anti-p38 MAPK (SC-721, Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (catalog no. 9211, Cell Signaling Technology (CST)), anti-JNK (catalog no. 9252, CST), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK (catalog no. 9251, CST), anti-ERK2 (SC-154, Santa Cruz), anti-phospho-ERK (SC-7383, Santa Cruz), anti-Akt (catalog no. 9272, CST), and anti-phospho-Akt (catalog no. 9271, CST). All antibodies were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. For immunoprecipitation studies, anti-Btk (catalog no. 65251A, PharMingen) or anti-PLCγ2 (SC-407, Santa Cruz) antibodies were coupled to Protein A/G Plus-Agarose (SC-2003, Santa Cruz) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and incubated with pre-cleared total cell lysates of untreated or goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab)′2(10 μg/ml) stimulated B cells for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were boiled in loading buffer for 3 min, and the released proteins were resolved in a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were first probed with horseradish peroxidase coupled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (P11625, Transduction Laboratories) and subsequently with the immunoprecipitating antibodies. We have shown previously that anti-IgM stimulation that induces BCR signaling does not lead to the proliferation of BLNK−/− B cells (18Xu S. Tan J. Wong E. Manickam A. Ponniah S. Lam K.P. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This is re-capitulated and shown in Fig. 1 A, where BLNK−/− B cells are non-responsive to increasing amount of anti-IgM stimulation. In comparison and as expected, wild-type B cells undergo cellular proliferation in a manner proportional to the extent of their BCR cross-linking. The inability of BLNK−/− B cells to proliferate upon BCR engagement is specific to this stimulus as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a potent mitogen, induces similar levels of proliferation in both the wild-type and BLNK−/− B cells (Fig.1 B). This phenomenon whereby BLNK−/− B cells respond to LPS but not anti-IgM stimulations was observed regardless of the age of the mice in which the cells were isolated (data not shown). Anti-IgM stimulation causes B cell to enter the cell cycle (25Solvason N. Wu W. Kabra N. Wu X. Lees E. Howard M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The failure of BLNK−/− B cells to proliferate upon BCR engagement would suggest that these cells are defective in their entry and/or completion of their cell cycle. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed cell cycle analysis on anti-IgM-treated wild-type and BLNK−/− B cells. As described previously (26Carayon P. Bord A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 147: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the combined use of BrdUrd incorporation and PI staining of total cellular DNA content allows one to discriminate cells in the various stages of the cell cycle. In contrast to cells in the resting G0/G1phase, cells in the S phase of the cell cycle are actively synthesizing DNA and will incorporate BrdUrd. They will also exhibit a higher level of PI staining due to their increased cellular DNA content. As seen in Fig. 2, analysis of anti-IgM-stimulated wild-type B cells clearly reveals a population of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, such S phase cycling cells are absent in anti-IgM-treated samples of BLNK−/− B cells, suggesting that the mutant cells are arrested at the G0/G1 phase. Again as control, BLNK−/− B cells are able to enter the cell cycle upon treatment with LPS, and they show a pattern of BrdUrd incorporation indistinguishable from that of LPS-treated wild-type B cells (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the proliferation data shown in Fig. 1 B, which indicate the ability of BLNK−/− B cells to respond to LPS stimulation. Thus, the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 together show that the failure of BLNK−/− B cells to proliferate in respond to anti-IgM stimulation is due to their inability to enter the cell cycle. The entry of cells into the cell cycle is regulated by the activity of specific proteins such as the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) (27Reed S. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar). The D-type cyclins and their kinase partners, cdk4 and cdk6, are the earliest cell cycle regulatory protein complexes to be expressed when cells leave quiescence and enter the cell cycle (28Sherr C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Normal proliferating B cells express cyclins D2 and D3 but not D1 (25Solvason N. Wu W. Kabra N. Wu X. Lees E. Howard M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cyclin D2 and its kinase partner, cdk4, are up-regulated from mid to late-G1 phase of the cell cycle and are readily detected in cycling B cells (29Tanguay D. Chiles T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 539-548PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if cyclin D2 and cdk4 can be induced in BLNK−/− B cells, we treated the wild-type and mutant cells with anti-IgM antibodies for various times. As shown in Fig. 3, cyclin D2 is maximally induced in wild-type B cells 24 h after BCR cross-linking and its expression can be detected even after 48 h of treatment. Similarly, cdk4, which is expressed at basal level in normal resting B cells, is also up-regulated upon anti-IgM stimulation. In contrast, both cyclin D2 and cdk4 are not expressed or up-regulated in BLNK−/− B cells regardless of the duration of their BCR cross-linking. As control, we examined the induction of cell cycle regulatory proteins in BLNK−/− B cells after LPS treatment. As expected, LPS induces the up-regulation of cyclin D2 and cdk4 in wild-type B cells (Fig. 3). LPS is also able to induce the expression of cyclin D2 and cdk4 in BLNK−/− B cells, consistent with the fact that LPS-treated mutant B cells do proliferate (Fig. 1), incorporate BrdUrd (Fig. 2), and enter the cell cycle. This suggests that the failure to express the cell cycle regulatory proteins in BLNK−/− B cells is specific to anti-IgM stimulation. Thus, the failure of anti-IgM-stimulated BLNK−/− B cells to proliferate may be due to the inability of these cells to transduce the signal for the induction of specific regulatory proteins that are critical for the entry into cell cycle. In addition to the induction of cell cycle regulatory proteins, the cross-linking of the BCR on normal B cells also leads to the expression of the cell survival protein, Bcl-xL (30Choi M. Holmann M. Atkins C. Klaus G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Grillot D. Merino R. Pena J. Fanslow W. Finkelman F. Thompson C. Nunez G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The induction of Bcl-xL has been correlated with the ability of activated B cells to undergo cellular proliferation (30Choi M. Holmann M. Atkins C. Klaus G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and may be required for them to complete the cell cycle (11Anderson J. Teutsch M. Dong Z. Wortis H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10966-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Solvason N. Wu W. Kabra N. Lund-Johansen F. Roncarolo M. Behrens T. Grillot D. Nunez G. Lees E. Howard M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, this protein is expressed in anti-IgM-treated wild-type or BLNK+/− B cells within 24 h of stimulation and its continued expression can be detected up to 72 h of culture (data not shown). In contrast, Bcl-xL is absent in BLNK−/− B cells treated with anti-IgM for the same time duration (Fig.4 A and data not shown). Again as control, Bcl-xLexpression can be detected within 24 h in both LPS-treated wild-type and BLNK−/− B cells (Fig.4 B). Thus, the data indicate that anti-IgM-treated BLNK−/− B cells may also abort the cell cycle due to their inability to express the cell survival Bcl-xLprotein upon activation. Normal B lymphocytes also express the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (32Merino R. Ding L. Veis D. Korsmeyer S. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To examine if BLNK deficiency affects the expression of Bcl-2, as is the case for Bcl-xL above, we examined the expression level of this protein in normal and BLNK−/− B cells before and after various stimulations. As shown in Fig.5 (A and B), Bcl-2 is expressed at equivalent level in wild-type and BLNK−/− B cells ex vivo and its expression level remains relatively unchanged upon stimulation with anti-IgM antibodies or LPS. Thus, a BLNK deficiency specifically affects the expression of Bcl-xL but not that of Bcl-2 in B lymphocytes. In the course of the cell cycle analysis as shown in Fig. 2, it was noticed that BLNK−/− B cells cultured for 48 h in medium alone or in the presence of anti-IgM antibodies show a higher degree of apoptosis compared with similarly treated wild-type B cells. To determine if BLNK−/− B cells indeed exhibit a higher propensity to undergo spontaneous apoptosis in vitro, we examined these cells after overnight culture, either non-stimulated or treated with the various stimuli. Apoptotic cells can be distinguished in FACS analyses by their reduced cellular DNA content, as revealed by PI staining, and by their smaller size, as shown by a reduction in the forward and side scatter profiles. As shown in Fig. 6, BLNK−/− B cells are twice as likely (50–65%) to undergo spontaneous apoptosis in medium after overnight culture as compared with their normal counterparts (33–38%). Anti-IgM treatment can reduce the fraction of dying wild-type (20–23%) but not BLNK−/− (55–63%) B cells. This can be explained by the ability of wild-type but not BLNK−/− B cells to express Bcl-xLupon activation (see Fig. 4). Finally, LPS treatment substantially reduced the fraction of dying cells in both the wild-type and BLNK−/− B cell samples, although the population of apoptotic cells is still higher in the latter compared with the former. This is consistent with the fact that LPS can induce the expression of Bcl-xL in both the wild-type and BLNK−/− B cells (see Fig. 4). The various analyses above describe the cellular defects of BLNK−/− B cells in response to BCR signaling. Given the fact that BLNK is an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction, it would be of interest to correlate the above cellular defects with disruption of distinct signaling pathways. BCR engagement is known to activate the three different classes of MAPKs: ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, that have been shown to regulate proliferation, survival, and differentiation in various cellular systems (33Craxton A. Otipoby K.L. Jiang A. Clark E.A. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 79-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the DT40 chicken B cell line, BLNK is required for the activation of both JNK and p38 MAPK and for the sustained activation of ERK in response to BCR signaling (8Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We therefore re-examined if the activation of MAPKs was similarly affected in mouse primary B cells lacking BLNK and if these signalin"

Olsen B.R. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 191-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Characteristics shared by the α chains in this class are a carboxyl triple helical domain (Col 1) of about 103–115 amino acid residues containing two imperfections in the Gly-X-Y triplet structure; two cysteinyl residues, one at the end of Col 1 and another five residues into the adjacent noncollagenous (NC) 1 domain; and conservation of the sequences of the NC1 and NC2 domains (1Shaw L.M.

The α1(XII), α1(XIV), and the long splice variant of the α1(IX) collagen chain each also have a thrombospondin amino-terminal-like (Tsp) module (also called the PARP domain) (2Moradi-Ameli M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although all the possible supramolecular structures of types IX, XII, and XIV collagen are not yet elucidated, each has been shown to be capable of associating with fibrillar surfaces (3van der Rest M.

Presented in this report are cDNAs for a new collagen that has characteristics very similar to types XII and XIV collagen. The polypeptide encoded by the cDNA has been assigned the next Roman numeral, α1(XX). We demonstrate here that type XX collagen mRNA is not abundant in any embryonic chick tissue. It is, however, a minor component of several connective tissues, such as sternal cartilage, cornea, and tendon. The embryonic tissue of highest abundance is the corneal epithelium, which makes large amounts of fibrillar collagens, as well as epithelial specific products. α1(XX) collagen polypeptides of 185, 170, and 135 kDa are detected by Western analysis, suggestive of alternative splicing. To obtain a human type XIV collagen cDNA, a BLAST search (7Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyer E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70322) Google Scholar) of the data base of expressed sequence tags was performed. A glycerol stock of IMAGE Consortium clone identification number 34933 (8Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) was purchased. The clone was expanded for DNA isolation and sequence analysis. Automated DNA sequencing was performed by the Department of Physiology core facility at Tufts Medical School. Upon aligning the new human cDNA sequence with the sequence of chick and human types XII and XIV collagen, it became clear that clone 34933 was not a human α1(XIV) clone, but, instead, a close relative. The aligned sequences were used to select two conserved areas in the Tsp domain for making degenerate nucleotide primers that would amplify, by RT-PCR (conditions described below), chick and human α1(XII) and α1(XIV) mRNAs, as well as mRNA for the new collagen, designated α1(XX). Degenerate primers (dXX-1 and dXX-2rc) were synthesized corresponding to conserved regions GSFHK(V/L) H(/V)I and D(R/K)CC(D/E)(I/L)P in the Tsp domain. The primer sequences are: dXX-1, GG(A/G)AG(C/T)TT(C/T)CA(C/T)AAGGT(T/G)CA(T/C)(A/G)T and dXX-2rc, GG(G/A)A(T/G)(A/C)TCACA(A/G)CA(T/C)(T/C)(T/G)GTC. As described below, 13-day chick corneal mRNA was amplified with these primers and the product was inserted into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), following the manufacturer's protocol. Transformed colonies were expanded and DNA was isolated using Qiagen's (Valencia, CA) Miniprep DNA isolation kit. Of the clones resulting from this procedure, sequence analysis demonstrated that chick α1(XII), α1(XIV), and α1(XX) cDNAs were obtained. The chick α1(XX) cDNAs were designated clones 2001, with a, b, c, etc. to distinguish individual selected colonies. All were identical. Embryonated eggs were purchased from Spafas (Norwich, CT) and Avian Services (Frenchtown, NJ). The following embryonic tissues were dissected from White Leghorn chick embryos, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at −80 °C until used: 5.5-day notochord and neural retina, 7- and 12-day back skin, 7- and 13-day cornea, 14.5-day sterna, and 17-day lung, calvaria, and tendon. Total RNA was isolated from each using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated using Qiagen Oligotex beads. In other dissections, corneas without surrounding scleral tissue were removed from day 13 embryos and placed into a dish containing 50 mm EDTA, 0.25% dispase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. After 5 min of incubation, the epithelia were gently removed from the underlying stroma. Separated corneal epithelial and stromal/endothelial layers were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then used to isolate poly(A)+ mRNA as described above. A primer, TTACCCGCACTTTGTAGCCATTGA, corresponding to the reverse complement of bases 63–86 of clone 2015 (see Fig. 1), was labeled using the Kinase MaxTM 5′ end-labeling kit from Ambion (Austin, TX), following the protocol of the kit. 50,000 cpm of labeled primer was added to 20 μg of embryonic chick day 13 total RNA and the mixture was ethanol-precipitated. The pellet was taken up in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 100 mmsodium citrate, pH 6.4, 300 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA), incubated at 37 °C overnight, and then ethanol-precipitated again. The pellet was resuspended in 22 μl of water, and then to it was added 8 μl of 5× RT buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2), 4 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 4 μl of containing 10 mm of each dNTP, and 2 μl (400 units) of Superscript II RNase H-minus reverse transcriptase. After incubating for 37 °C for 1 h, 1 μl of a mix of 40 μg/ml RNase A and 2 units/ml RNase T1 were added, and incubation at 37 °C was continued for 30 min. Loading buffer (4 μl of 95% formamide, 60 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) was added to the sample, the temperature was raised to 95 °C for 3 min, and then an aliquot was applied to a 10% denaturing acrylamide gel. After electrophoresis at 40 W, the gel was dried and exposed to film. A 10-day exposure was required to visualize the α1(XX) primer extended product. To obtain the 5′ untranslated region sequence, unlabeled RNase digested primer-extended product was generated. The ∼330-nucleotide product was adapted for amplification using the Life Technologies, Inc. 5′ RACE system kit and subjected to two rounds of polymerase chain reaction using the nested primer of the kit and the collagen XX-specific extension primer. After agarose gel purification, the excised product was sequenced using the USB (Cleveland, OH) Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis from mRNA was performed as previously described (9Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Foley J.W. Gerecke D.R. Linsenmayer C. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar) and used as template in PCR. For RT-PCR, competitive PCR or routine DNA amplifications, the following conditions were used: a 20 μl of final reaction volume mixture was assembled consisting of template DNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, 1 μm each 5′ and 3′ specific primers, and 2.5 units Amplitaq (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The templates were amplified for one cycle of 94 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 2.5 min; and a final cycle of 72 °C for 10 min in a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler. Using a kit fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA), 13-day chick cornea mRNA was made into a cDNA library and adaptor primers were ligated to both the 5′ and 3′ ends, as previously described (11Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The cDNA 2001 (see Fig. 1) sequence was used to design chick α1(XX) collagen-specific primers for 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. A specific primer was paired with a nested adaptor primer to amplify longer α1(XX) cDNAs from the library. Essential to the success of this method is the running of accompanying PCRs, amplified with nested adaptor primer alone. After agarose gel electrophoresis, products uniquely amplified with a specific α1(XX) collagen primer in conjunction with the nested adaptor primer were stabbed from the gel and reamplified with a nested α1(XX) primer and the nested adaptor primer. Unique products of this reamplification were isolated from agarose gels and ligated into PCRII for transformation. Isolated transformants were checked for insert size and sequenced. These new sequence data were used to generate additional specific primers for repeating the process, expanding the overlapping clones in each direction from the Tsp domain. These continuous rounds of marathon library screening resulted in 18 overlapping clones, shown in Fig. 1. The sequence derived from the clones is available in GenBankTM accession number AF312825. Listing the sense strand primer first and the reverse complement antisense primer second, the pairs used to obtain these clones from the marathon library are as follows: for 2002, AP2 (the CLONTECHMarathon kit nested adaptor primer) and TCCCAGCATGATGAAGCCAGCGGT; for 2003, AGGTTGTGTGCAACAGCTTA and AP2; for 2004, AP2 and AGCTCCCCTCATCCCTCAATG; for 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008, CAAAGGAGAAAAAGGCATGGC and AP2; for 2009, AP2 and GAATGTCTCTGAACAGGGTGAAGGTGCGGG; for 2010, AP2 and TGAACAGGGTGAAGGTGCGGGAGCCACTGA; for 2013, AP2 and TCTGCTAGACATGTAGGTGACGCGATGAC; for 2014, AP2 and GGCATCTTCCCCATACAACGCATAC; for 2015 and 2016, AP2 and GCCACCTGCTTCAGCTCAGCCTCATCCGCG. Other cDNA clones were derived by RT-PCR directly from 13-day cornea mRNA using the following primers: for clone 2011, primers GGGGAAGATGCCAGTGAT and TGAACAGGGTGAAGGTGCGGGAGCCACTGA; for 2012, ATCAAGCTCTATCTGGACTGTAAA and CAGAAGTGCAGGAGCAGGCAG; for 2017, AGGAGAGAAAGGAGACACTGG and CACATCGGCCATCAGGGAATGA; for 2018, CAGGAGGTCCAGGAGGTCCCT and a modified oligo dT primer, (N)(N)(N)(N)(T)25. The α1(XX) collagen competitor was a deletion construct, produced as previously reported (9Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev.

The G3PDH competitor and primers were those previously reported (9Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev.

The template for making the α1(XX) collagen deletion construct was clone 2001. Base numbers correspond to those found in GenBankTM accession number AF312825. Primers used to amplify the fragments on each side of the deletion were as follows: (a) the “extreme” end sense primer ATCAAGCTCTATCTGGACTGTAAA (bases 3355–3378) in conjunction with CTCCTCCTCCGCCCC-TCGTGATCCACTCCT (the reverse complement of bases 3470–3483 linked to bases 3525–3540), and (b) sense primer AGGAGTGGATCACGA-GGGGCGGAGGAGGAC (bases 3470–3483 linked to bases 3525–3540) in conjunction with CAGAAGTGCAGGAGCAGGCAG (reverse complement of bases 3596–3616). Products were isolated from agarose gels, mixed together, and fused by overlap extension (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar) with both primers referred to as extreme end primers: ATCAAGCTCTATCTGGACTGTAAA (sense primer, same as given above ina) and GGAAGATCACAGCATCGGTC (reverse complement 3438–3557). The overlap extension product, spanning bases 3355 to 3557 with bases 3484–3524 deleted, was ligated into PCRII and used to transform bacteria. Isolated colonies were sequenced. Several competitor clones had the correct sequence with the desired deletion. One was grown in large scale and plasmid DNA was isolated with Qiagen's maxiprep kit. After linearizing the plasmid by XhoI digestion, the competitor was quantitated on agarose gels by comparison to known standards. To perform the competitive PCR, 400 ng of 7-day and 13-day corneal mRNA and 13-day corneal epithelial and stromal/endothelial mRNA were made into cDNA in a 20-μl volume. A set of seven PCRs was done for each tissue, varying the amount of competitor added to each reaction. In each tube, buffer, dNTPs, extreme end primers and enzyme components for a 20-μl PCR were brought up to a volume of 18 μl so that 1 μl of tissue cDNA (representing 20 ng of mRNA starting material) and 1 μl of a serial dilution of competitor DNA could be added as previously described (9Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Foley J.W. Gerecke D.R. Linsenmayer C. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar). In the series of seven tubes, the 1 μl of competitor DNA corresponded to the following 3-fold dilutions: 0.67, 0.33, 0.10, 0.067, 0.033, 0.01, and 0.0067 amol/μl. G3PDH was quantitated using competitor and primers that were previously described (9Gordon M.K. Foley J.W. Linsenmayer T.F. Fitch J.M. Dev.

Sci. 1997; 38: 153-166PubMed Google Scholar). Ten microliters of each competitive PCR was applied to 3% MetaPhor agarose gels (FMC, Rockland, ME) made with TBE buffer and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The endogenous α1(XX) collagen product was 202 base pairs; the competitor was 159 base pairs. The G3PDH endogenous product was 101 base pairs; its competitor was 60 base pairs. Gels were photographed with an Eagle Eye II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) digital camera. Photograph exposure times were chosen that ensured no band exceeded 256 pixels. The images were stored on disks for later analysis. The optical density of the bands was analyzed by Scanalytics (Billerica, MA) DNA One Scan software, and the ratio of the endogenous to the competitor band was converted to a number of amol. Because the endogenous and competitor PCR products differed in size, a correction factor was applied to adjust for molar differences in the binding of ethidium bromide. The calculated amol of cDNA synthesized from endogenous G3PDH mRNA was multiplied by 60/101, or 0.594, and the amol of endogenous α1(XX) collagen cDNA made from mRNA was multiplied by 159/202, or 0.787. The data were then plotted as amol endogenous α1(XX) collagen product/amol α1(XX) competitor on the y axis versus amol α1(XX) competitor added on the x axis. The point on the graph at which endogenous/competitor equals 1 is the equivalence point, and represents the amount of target mRNA in the starting sample. To represent the amount of mRNA present in an equal number of cells, the amol α1(XX) collagen mRNA was normalized by dividing it by the corresponding amol G3PDH mRNA value. All relative PCRs were performed in 20 μl containing the following: 1 μl of cDNA (representing 0.014 ng of poly(A)+ RNA), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μm each primer (either the pair for type XX collagen or for the experimental normalizer, G3PDH, as in the competitive PCR above), 0.1 mm each dNTP, 0.2 μl of [α-32P]dCTP (10 μCi/μl; >3000 Ci per mmol) and 0.025 units of Amplitaq (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For consistency, multiple PCRs were set up from master mixes made with all reagents except the cDNA; 19-μl aliquots of the master mix were put in thin-walled 250-μl tubes, and 1 μl of the appropriate cDNA was added. Conditions for cycling were as follows: 1 premelt step at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by the linear range number of cycles, experimentally determined to be 21 (see below), each consisting of a 94 °C melting step for 15 s, a 56 °C annealing incubation for 25 s, and a 72 °C elongation step for 90 s. Reactions were terminated in the linear range of amplification to ensure that the amount of product amplified reflects the quantity of starting mRNA. To determine this range, eight identical 20-μl PCRs were performed using the type XX collagen extreme end primers or G3PDH primers for each embryonic tissue cDNA tested. These were 5.5-day notochord and neural retina, 7- and 12-day back skin, 7- and 13-day cornea, 14.5-day sterna, and 17-day lung, calvaria, and tendon. The samples were loaded into a Perkin-Elmer 9600 thermocycler, and one tube of each was removed after 15 cycles, one after 17 cycles, and one each after completing cycles 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 35. After adding 10 μl of loading buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.6, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) to each tube, 5 μl of each sample was applied to 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (containing 7.7 m urea) (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The gel was run at 2000 V until the dye ran to the bottom, and then it was fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid; dried; and exposed to film. Bands were excised from the dried gel and counted by the Cerenkov method in a scintillation counter. The cpm (y axis) were plottedversus the cycle number (x axis). The linear range of amplification for all tissues with the G3PDH primers and for the tissues most abundant in collagen XX was between 19 and 23 cycles. All subsequent relative PCRs were performed for 21 cycles. Relative PCRs were performed for all tissue samples at the same time, using a master mix of components, and run on one gel for consistency. Bands were excised from the gel and counted as described above. The sequence of the translated α1(XX) collagen polypeptide was computer analyzed to determine an optimal antigenic site. The services of Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX) were used to synthesize the selected peptide and to generate a monospecific polyclonal antibody against the α1(XX) collagen chain. The α1(XX) peptide sequence chosen was KADLQEVSFDQQEC, a region in the Tsp domain. (The carboxyl-terminal cysteine is not in the α1(XX) collagen sequence but is needed for coupling the peptide before injection into rabbits.) The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titer of the 10-week bleed, diluted 1:100,000, showed that the anti-chick anti-collagen XX antibody was more than 6 times greater than the preimmune serum. Synthetic peptides were made for the analogous regions of the Tsp domain in α1(XIV) collagen (KGDFQTVTFEGPE) and α1(XII) collagen (RGEVQTVTFDNDE) and were used to check for cross-reactivity with the anti-collagen XX antibody. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, no cross-reaction was detected. To isolate corneal proteins for Western analysis, central corneas were isolated from 13-day chick embryos and stored at −80 °C until use. Prior to extraction, tissue was weighed. For each gram, 5 ml of low salt extraction buffer (200 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.8) was added. The tissue was homogenized in a polytron. An equal volume of buffer was added to reduce viscosity, and the sample was rehomogenized. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected. The protein concentration was determined to be 0.45 mg/ml by a dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) using IgG as a standard. Samples (40 μg of total protein) were run in reducing (1% mercapoethanol) sample buffer (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), heated to 95 °C, 10 min, and loaded on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (with a 4% stacking gel). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, washed with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20, and incubated with primary antibody (1:10,000 in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20/1% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 1 h. (In addition to the anti-chick α1(XX) collagen antibody, anti-chick anti-α1(XIV) collagen (10Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Foley J.W. Gerecke D.R. Linsenmayer C. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Invest.

Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) (1:20,000) for 1 h. Chemiluminescence (Pierce) was recorded on x-ray films. The data base of expressed sequence tag cDNAs was searched for human type XIV collagen cDNAs. Four candidate cDNAs were found. One expressed sequence tag had been placed in the data base with about 70 bases sequenced, encoding 23 amino acid residues of a Tsp domain, and on the basis of sequence similarity, it was tentatively identified as an α1(XIV) collagen cDNA. Although this region was highly homologous to type XIV collagen, it was not identical to the known human sequence: 16 of the 23 amino acid residues were identical, but 7 were conservative changes. A glycerol stock of this clone was purchased (IMAGE Consortium clone identification number 34933 (8Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar)) and expanded for DNA isolation. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the cDNA encoded 233 amino acid residues of a Tsp domain and 12 amino acids (four triplets) of a collagenous domain (Col 2), suggesting that it was indeed a member of the collagen family. BLAST searches (7Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyer E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70322) Google Scholar) indicated that the Tsp domain of the new collagen α chain was closest in identity to type XIV collagen and second closest to type XII collagen. Within the Tsp domains found in collagens (2Moradi-Ameli M. Deleage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), localized areas are unique to collagens XII and XIV of avian and mammalian species. The new human cDNA shared these subfamily similarities, allowing us to design degenerate primers that would theoretically amplify mRNAs of any subfamily member, type XII, XIV, or the new chain, from chick or human, by RT-PCR. Because of our interest in development, particularly of the cornea, our goal was to obtain the chick cDNA corresponding to the new human collagen α chain. As expected, by amplifying chick cornea cDNA with this degenerate primer pair, cDNA clones were obtained for the known Tsp domains of chick types XII and XIV, as well as for a new cDNA (clone 2001, shown in Fig. 1), almost identical in sequence to the human cDNA (data not shown). Using this chick α chain sequence, unique primers were designed from regions where the sequence diverged from collagens XII and XIV. These primers amplified only the new chick collagen α chain, and not α1(XII) or α1(XIV) collagens in RT-PCR. A Marathon cDNA library was made from day 13 embryonic chick corneal mRNA, and the specific primers were used to extend the sequence of chick cDNA by 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The resulting overlapping clones are shown in Fig. 1. The divergence of the domain structure from α1(XII) and α1(XIV) collagen chain sequences in the NC3 domain suggested that the cDNA represented a new member of the FACIT family and not a new α chain of an already described collagen. Assigning the translated cDNA sequence the next available Roman numeral, the clone was designated the α1(XX) collagen chain. The nucleotide sequence of the composite cDNA is found under GenBankTM accession numberAF312825. It is believed that the entire 3′ end of the mRNA is represented in this composite because two clones, isolated by different methods, yielded identical 3′ end products, each with a poly(A) tail. One cDNA was isolated by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends of the marathon library using a primer in the Col 1 domain and the adaptor primer; the other was isolated by RT-PCR, using a specific forward Col 1 primer and a modified oligo dT primer, (N)(N)(N)(N)(T)25, with total RNA isolated from 13-day chick embryo corneal epithelium as template. We attempted to estimate how much of the 5′ end of the mRNA was missing from our cDNAs by comparing the number of sequenced nucleotides with the size of the mRNA on Northern blots. However, no signal was ever detected on Northern blots of cornea mRNA. Ultimately, it became clear from competitive PCR quantitations that this analysis failed because the α1(XX) collagen mRNA is a nonabundant species. Primer extension was used as an alternative method to determine how much of the mRNA was not represented in the composite cDNA. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the major primer extended band, visible after a 10-day exposure, was about 330 bases. The primer used was 86 nucleotides into clone 2015; therefore, about 245 nucleotides of the mRNA had ye"

In a cell-free system, cleavage of eIF4B by caspase-3 coincides with a general inhibition of protein synthetic activity. Affinity chromatography demonstrates that mammalian eIF4B interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein and that a region consisting of the N-terminal 80 amino acids of eIF4B is both necessary and sufficient for such binding. This interaction is lost when eIF4B is cleaved by caspase-3, which removes the N-terminal 45 amino acids. Similarly, the association of eIF4B with the poly(A)-binding proteinin vivo is reduced when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis. Cleavage of the poly(A)-binding protein itself, using human rhinovirus 3C protease, also eliminates the interaction with eIF4B. Thus, disruption of the association between mammalian eIF4B and the poly(A)-binding protein can occur during both apoptosis and picornaviral infection and is likely to contribute to the inhibition of translation observed under these conditions.

The cleavage of PABP by the picornavirus-encoded 2A or 3C proteases separates a large N-terminal fragment from a C-terminal homodimerization domain (47Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A.L. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this may contribute to the inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we provide evidence for a direct interaction between mammalian eIF4B and PABP. We demonstrate that recombinant eIF4B can bind to PABP via the N terminus of eIF4B and that this interaction is ablated when eIF4B is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro or when cells are induced to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, the cleavage of PABP with human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease eliminates the ability of PABP to bind to eIF4B. These data suggest that in addition to the cleavage of eIF4G that occurs during apoptosis and picornavirus infection, the association between mammalian eIF4B and PABP is targeted under these conditions by the cleavage of eIF4B and PABP, respectively. The vector encoding full-length human His-eIF4B (in pET15b) was a gift from Dr. C. Hellen (State University of New York Health Center, Brooklyn, NY) and that encoding human glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PABP (in pGEX2T) was provided by Dr. J. Hensold (Case Western Reserve University). Vectors encoding truncated forms of human His-eIF4B were provided by Dr. J. W. B. Hershey (University of California-Davis). His-tagged forms of full-length and truncated eIF4B, 4E-BP1, and the C-terminal region of eIF4GI were expressed in BL21 cells and purified on nickel-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) (49Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). GST-PABP was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Purified, recombinant proteins were dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm MOPS-K+, pH 7.2, 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. The baculovirus vector encoding untagged Xenopus PABP was provided by Dr. D. Schoenberg (Ohio State University). Seventy-two hours after baculovirus infection, insect cell extracts were prepared by cell lysis with 1% (v/v) Igepal and stored in aliquots at −70 °C (34Bushell M. McKendrick L. Janicke R.U. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Antisera to eIF4B and PABP were gifts from Drs. J. W. B. Hershey and D. Schoenberg, respectively. Antiserum specific for the C-terminal domain of eIF4G was as described previously (36Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (50Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol.

Reticulocyte lysate was incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C with purified caspase-3 (TCS Biologicals, Buckingham, UK) (5 or 10 μg/ml, as indicated), in the absence or presence of 50 μm zVAD·FMK (Alexis, UK). Lysates were also incubated with 200 units/ml recombinant HRV protease 3C at 5 °C for 2 h prior to translation assays. Purified His-eIF4B was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm benzamidine and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 (PBS-TB) with 0.5 μg/ml purified caspase-3 for 2 h at 37 °C. Untagged PABP or GST-PABP was incubated with 60 units/ml HRV protease 3C in PBS-TB for 30 min at 37 °C. Protein synthesis assays used non-nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysates essentially as described in Ref. 52Rau M. Ohlmann T. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8983-8990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar. Incubations were carried out in the absence or presence of 25 μg/ml poly(A)+ or poly(A)− mRNA encoding luciferase, which was generated using the Ambion Message Machine system as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE. Translation of the luciferase reporter mRNA was quantified by analysis on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 860) using ImageQuant software. Following incubation together in PBS-TB, His-eIF4B or GST-PABP and their associated proteins were recovered on nickel-NTA-agarose or glutathione-Sepharose, respectively. All resins were washed five times each (with 1 ml of PBS-TB), and the recovered proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Jurkat cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 250 ng/ml anti-Fas antiserum for 2 h at 37 °C. Extracts from control and apoptotic cells were prepared as described previously (33Morley S.J. Jeffrey I. Bushell M. Pain V.M. Clemens M.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Initiation factor eIF4B is cleaved in apoptotic cells to yield a smaller fragment (ΔeIF4B). In addition, other factors, including eIF4GI, eIF4GII, eIF3p35, and eIF2α are cleaved under the same conditions (31Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Morley S.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Morley S.J. McKendrick L. Bushell M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Morley S.J.

However, the relative contribution of each of these events to the overall down-regulation of protein synthesis during apoptosis is not yet known. Using a cell-free system, we have investigated the time at which cleavage of eIF4B occurs relative to that of other caspase targets in the protein synthetic machinery upon addition of purified caspase-3. Fig.1 A (right panel) shows that in the reticulocyte lysate system, eIF4B is cleaved within 10 min of caspase-3 treatment, whereas eIF4G remains intact (as judged by the appearance of the specific cleavage products p120 and M-FAG (35Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) until at least 20 min of incubation. At similarly early times following caspase-3-treatment, eIF3p35 and eIF2α are also not significantly cleaved (data not shown). The early cleavage of eIF4B coincides with the start of caspase-induced loss of protein synthetic activity, which affects both endogenous globin translation (Fig.1 A, left panel, and Fig. 1 B, left panel, lanes 2, 5, and 8) and the translation of exogenous capped or uncapped polyadenylated luciferase mRNA (Fig. 1 B, left panel, lanes 5 and 8, respectively). The caspase-mediated cleavages are prevented by inclusion of zVAD·FMK in the incubation (Fig. 1 B, right panel), as is the inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1, A and B). Cleavage of eIF4B by caspase-3 removes an N-terminal fragment of 45 amino acids (36Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As eIF4B interacts with PABP in plants to modulate the activity of the cap-binding complex (42Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 43Bi X. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17740-17746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we have examined, using affinity chromatography, whether eIF4B and PABP interact directly in the mammalian system and whether caspase-3 cleavage of eIF4B affects this binding. Fig.2 A shows that whereas mammalian His-eIF4B did not itself bind to glutathione-Sepharose (lane 3), there was substantial recovery of the factor on these beads following incubation with GST-tagged PABP (lane 5). Conversely, PABP could be isolated from a reticulocyte lysate by chromatography on nickel-agarose in the presence but not in the absence of His-eIF4B that was bound to the beads (Fig.2 B). An irrelevant His-tagged protein (the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP1) did not bind PABP in this system, ruling out the possibility of nonspecific interactions between PABP and nickel-agarose or the His tag. Similarly, purified His-eIF4B associated with GST-PABP could be recovered with the latter protein on glutathione-Sepharose, whereas another His-tagged protein (the C-terminal part of eIF4GI (49Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar)) did not bind under the same conditions (Fig. 2 C). This eliminates the possibility of nonspecific interactions between the His tag and PABP, GST, or glutathione-Sepharose itself. The interaction between eIF4B and PABP was not prevented by incubation with RNase A (Fig. 2 A, lane 6), suggesting that it is not mediated by RNA bridging between the two proteins. However, we cannot entirely discount a role for a fragment of RNA that is protected from RNase action by one or both proteins. To delineate the region of eIF4B that interacts with PABP, we incubated truncated versions of His-eIF4B with untagged PABP. Fig.3 shows that whereas PABP alone was not recovered on nickel-agarose (lane 1), the N-terminal region of eIF4B (amino acids 1–150) permitted the co-isolation of PABP (lane 5). Further delineation of this region showed that amino acids 81–180 of eIF4B did not interact with PABP (lane 3), but amino acids 1–80 (lane 4) were sufficient to allow the interaction. To determine whether the caspase-mediated truncation of eIF4B at the N terminus disrupts the interaction of the factor with PABP, we incubated full-length and caspase-cleaved forms of eIF4B with GST-PABP. Protein complexes were subsequently isolated on glutathione-Sepharose. Fig.4 A shows that neither full-length His-eIF4B (lane 2) nor the caspase-truncated ΔeIF4B (lane 3) alone was recovered on the resin. However, in the presence of GST-PABP, full-length His-eIF4B was co-isolated by this procedure (lane 5). In contrast, ΔeIF4B did not associate with GST-PABP (lane 6). Thus, loss of the N-terminal 45 amino acids, as a result of cleavage of eIF4B by caspase-3, is sufficient to ablate the interaction with PABP. Mammalian PABP is cleaved during picornavirus infection by the virally encoded proteases 2A and 3C, and the sites of cleavage have been mapped to near the C terminus (47Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A.L. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have used HRV protease 3C to determine whether such cleavage interferes with the ability to interact with eIF4B. Protease 3C was able to utilize both GST-PABP (Fig. 4 B, lane 3) and untagged PABP (Fig. 4 C) as substrates but did not degrade eIF4B (Fig. 4 C). Following cleavage of GST-PABP, there was a reduction in the co-isolation of full-length eIF4B with PABP (Fig. 4 B, lane 3 versus lane 2). Protease 3C cleavage also prevented the association of untagged PABP with the His-tagged N terminus of eIF4B (Fig. 4 C, lane 5 versus lane 4). These data suggest that the highly conserved C-terminal domain of PABP (53Nietfeld W. Mentzel H. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is required for the interaction with the N-terminal region of eIF4B. We have investigated the consequences for protein synthesis of the cleavage of PABP in the reticulocyte lysate. In contrast to the reported effect of foot-and-mouth disease virus protease 3C in vivo (54Belsham G.J. McInerney G.M. Ross-Smith N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), HRV protease 3C, at the concentration and times used here, did not degrade eIF4G or eIF4A in vitro but caused cleavage of ∼50% of the PABP in the lysate (Fig.5 A). Consequently, it was possible to examine the effect of this enzyme specifically on PABP cleavage and protein synthesis in parallel. In a non-nuclease-treated lysate, to which was added either poly(A)+ or poly(A)− luciferase mRNA, HRV protease 3C had a small inhibitory effect on the translation of both the endogenous globin mRNA (data not shown) and the exogenous poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 5 B, top panel). In contrast, the protease treatment resulted in a substantial increase in the ability to translate the poly(A)− luciferase mRNA (Fig. 5 B, bottom panel). These data suggest that either the PABP cleavage product shows a gain of function toward translation of poly(A)−mRNA or, more likely, the latter acquires a translational advantage in competition with the endogenous globin mRNA. These results also indicate that exposure to HRV protease 3C does not impair the function of other initiation factors required for the translation of both poly(A)+ and poly(A)− mRNAs. A prediction that can be made on the basis of our results is that in cells induced to undergo apoptosis, where eIF4B is cleaved (36Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the association of PABP with eIF4B should be disrupted. To address this, extracts were prepared from control and apoptotic Jurkat cells. The integrity of eIF4G, PABP, eIF4B, and eIF4E and the association of these proteins with each other were monitored by immunoblotting. In agreement with published data (31Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Morley S.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Fig.6 A shows that eIF4G (lane 2 versus lane 1) and eIF4B (lane 4 versus lane 3), but not PABP or eIF4E, were cleaved during apoptosis. PABP and associated proteins were isolated by affinity chromatography on poly(A)-Sepharose (Fig. 6 B). Although similar levels of PABP were recovered from apoptotic and control cell extracts, the amount of eIF4B associated with PABP was substantially reduced in apoptotic extracts (lane 2 versus lane 1). In addition, the amount of eIF4E recovered was greatly diminished (lane 2 versus lane 1), as would be predicted from the cleavage of eIF4G, which results in the separation of the eIF4E binding site from the PABP binding site (35Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have also used m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography to investigate the association of PABP with eIF4F (Fig.6 C). Following induction of apoptosis, there was a decrease in the level of PABP recovered with eIF4E (lane 2 versus lane 1). However, in this instance, it is not possible to discern whether this effect is attributable to the loss of integrity of eIF4B or to the caspase-mediated cleavage of eIF4G (31Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Morley S.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2921-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Bushell M. Poncet D. Marissen W.E. Flotow H. Lloyd R.E. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7565-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), because both these proteins bind PABP independently. The direct interaction between mammalian eIF4B and PABP, in conjunction with the binding of eIF4G to PABP, may facilitate the functional association of the 5′ and 3′ ends of mRNA (1Morley S.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In wheat germ, the association of eIF4B with PABP increases the efficiency of reinitiation of protein synthesis (58Le H. Browning K.S. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17452-17462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a process that is also enhanced by the interaction between eIF4G and PABP (17Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar,43Bi X. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17740-17746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 7 A,the loss of the N terminus of eIF4B (by caspase-mediated cleavage) or of the C terminus of PABP (by picornavirus protease-mediated cleavage) disrupts complex formation between the two proteins. Such an effect would be predicted to inhibit reinitiation. Indeed, cleavages of eIF4B (Fig. 1 and Ref. 36Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and PABP (Fig. 5 and Refs. 47Joachims M. Van Breugel P.C. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 718-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 48Kerekatte V. Keiper B.D. Badorff C. Cai A.L. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are associated with inhibition of protein synthesis in vivo andin vitro. We have previously pointed out (36Bushell M. Wood W. Clemens M.J. Morley S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that ΔeIF4B still contains the DRYG domain required for self-association and binding to eIF3p170 (29Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and also retains the RNA recognition motif domain required for binding RNA (22Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Davies M.V. Kelleher K. Kaufman R.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2783-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 59Méthot N. Rom E. Olsen H. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As the region of eIF4B required for the stimulation of the RNA helicase activity of eIF4A is located in the C-terminal half of the protein (24Méthot N. Pause A. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Methot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), this activity also may not be directly affected. In contrast, interaction of the extreme N terminus of eIF4B with PABP provides a potential mechanism by which cleavage of eIF4B during apoptosis may contribute to the down-regulation of protein synthesis (4Clemens M.J. Bushell M. Jeffrey I.W. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 603-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Because PABP also enhances the RNA helicase activity of the [eIF4A·eIF4B·eIFiso4F] complex in wheat germ (43Bi X. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17740-17746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), such a regulatory mechanism would also be impaired when the eIF4B-PABP interaction is abolished, resulting in less efficient unwinding of mRNA secondary structure. The site of binding of PABP on eIF4GI has been assigned to amino acids 132–160 (17Imataka H. Gradi A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7480-7489Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and there is strong conservation of this sequence in eIF4GII (60Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a region with significant similarity to parts of these sequences is present near the N terminus of eIF4B (Fig.7 A), and our data are consistent with the possibility that this site is critical for eIF4B-PABP interaction. Further deletion mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies will be required to test this. Inhibition of the eIF4B-PABP interaction during infection, as a consequence of the cleavage of PABP by viral proteases (Fig. 4), may be additive or synergistic with that of the cleavages of eIF4GI and eIF4GII in contributing to the shut-off of translation in infected cells (44Lloyd R.E. Jense H.G. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2480-2488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cai A.L. Knowlton K.U. Rhoads R.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 709-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only a partial cleavage of PABP in vitro is sufficient to enhance the translation of non-polyadenylated mRNA relative to that of mRNA with a poly(A) tail, perhaps because the latter is translated less efficiently under these conditions and competes less well. As illustrated in Fig. 7 B, disruption of several protein-protein interactions, as a result of cleavages of initiation factors, is a feature of both the early stages of apoptosis and of infection with picornaviruses. The patterns of the cleavages are different in the two situations, but a degree of evolutionary convergence has apparently occurred between the mechanisms by which protein synthesis is targeted for down-regulation.

By using the differential display approach, we identified a Mycobacterium bovis BCG cellwall skeleton (BCG-CWS)-inducible gene fragment from human monocytes, showing no homology to any reported gene. Full-length cloning of this fragment reveals the following. 1) The differential display product represents the incomplete 3′-untranslated region of LITAF/PIG7. 2) The coding region of the transcript differs from LITAF/PIG7 due to an absence of a single guanine residue, resulting in a potential translational frameshift. 3) The newly coded protein turns out to be 86% identical and 90% similar to an estrogen-inducible rat gene, EET-1. Repeated analysis, expressed sequence tag search, comparison with homologues, and genome sequence analysis confirmed the absence of the single guanine residue. One interesting feature of this protein is that it possesses the RING domain signature and is predicted to be localized in the nucleus. However, detailed analysis together with experimental evidence suggests it is neither a RING family member nor a nuclear protein. Comparison of a total collection of 18 proteins from various species indicates that proteins of this family are small in size and mainly conserved at the C-terminal domain with a unique motif. We characterize this novel protein as an unglycosylatedsmall integral membraneprotein of the lysosome/lateendosome (SIMPLE) whose expression is elicited in monocytes by live and heat-killed BCG, BCG cell wall complex, lipopolysaccharide, and tumor necrosis factor-α.

In order to develop more potent vaccines and therapeutic agents, it has become essential to understand the mechanism of pathogenesis at the point of host-microbial interaction. Despite the identification of a number of host genes involved in protective responses and those exploited by the microbe for pathogenesis, the evolving nature of pathogens and ranges of their variant and invariant components offer a virtually unlimited challenge. We focused on a microbial component derived from the cell wall complex ofMycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG),1 a non-pathogenic vaccine strain of tuberculosis. The cell wall complex, which we call BCG-CWS, is a highly purified fraction with immunotherapeutic potential (1Hayashi, A., Proc. Jpn. Acad., 70, 1994, 205, 209.Google Scholar, 2Hayashi A. Doi O. Azuma I. Toyoshima K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1998; 74: 50-55Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is mainly composed of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and mycolic acid. The conserved microbial structures that are relatively invariant within a class of microorganisms such as LPS, peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid, and lipopeptides are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLR) leading to the induction of immune and inflammatory genes (3Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 4Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). It has been reported recently from our laboratory that BCG-CWS is recognized by both TLR2 and TLR4, and it effectively induces dendritic cell (DC) maturation (5Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Azuma I. Hayashi A. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6883-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) through TNF-α production, which is comparable to the heat-killed or live BCG-induced maturation profile. These findings suggest that the component can be used to explore other potential genes regulated downstream of the signaling cascade, including those genes that could also possibly change during live mycobacterial infection. In a combined effort of mRNA differential display, suppression subtractive hybridization, and cDNA array analysis, several differentially expressed genes have been reported (6Seya T. Begum N.A.

Matsumoto M. Seya T. Toyoshima K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We mainly focused on identifying those gene fragments that are segments of new genes or those that are not yet defined as a part of known genes, with an aim of generating a comparative expression profile for a set of PAMPs (8Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar, 9Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R879-R882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During our study, one of these genes appeared to be significantly similar to the previously identified human genes, LITAF (10Myokai F. Takashiba S. Lebo R. Amar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4518-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and PIG7 (11Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). LITAF is a novel protein binding to a critical region of human TNF-α promoter and is reported to be involved in TNF-α expression during LPS induction (10Myokai F. Takashiba S. Lebo R. Amar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4518-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,12Takashiba S. Van Dyke T.E. Shapira L. Amar S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same gene was found to be induced severalfold during p53-mediated apoptosis (11Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar, 13Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and was described as PIG7. Our findings raise the possibility that the gene we found to be induced by BCG-CWS and named SIMPLE, which is also a human homologue of rat EET-1 (14Everett L.M. Li A. Devaraju G. Caperell-Grant A. Bigsby R.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), could actually be the LITAF/PIG7. Thus, the induction of this gene in various contexts is intriguing and may not be simply a coincidence; here we describe the detailed analysis of the SIMPLE transcript, including its expression, localization, genomic organization, and its assignment under a new family. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by standard density centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from 400 ml of citrate phosphate dextrose-supplemented human blood. CD14+ monocytes were separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by anti-CD14-coated microbeads and a magnetic cell sorting column (Miltenyi Biotec GmBH). Cells were cultured overnight in 10-cm dishes in the presence of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% human AB serum. The next day cells were treated for 8 h with 15 μg/ml BCG-CWS prepared in emulsion buffer (PBS containing 1% Drakeol 6VR and 1% Tween 80). Cells in the control plates were treated with 15 μl/ml emulsion buffer for the same time. For heat-killed and live BCG treatment M. bovis BCG Tokyo strain has been used at a concentration of 1 bacillus/monocyte for 8 h. In some experiments immature dendritic cells (iDC) have been used to stimulate with BCG-CWS, and the preparation of iDC was essentially the same as described previously (5Tsuji S. Matsumoto M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Azuma I. Hayashi A. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6883-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Total RNAs from BCG-CWS-stimulated and unstimulated human monocytes were isolated using TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA from control and from stimulated cells were reverse-transcribed using Superscript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) by 12 types of T12MN (M = A/C/G; N = A/T/C/G) primers. Arbitrary primer (AP) sets were selected from RNAmap Kit I and II (Gene Hunter Corp., Nashville, TN), and PCR amplification was performed using Takara PCR kit components (Tokyo, Japan) and [32P]dCTP (Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). PCR conditions, gel run parameters, fragment elution, and further amplification of PCR products were described previously (15Begum N.A. Mori M. Matsumata T. Takenaka K. Sugimachi K. Barnard G.F. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments extracted from the gel were sequenced after TA cloning (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in an ABI-373 Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Dye terminator ABI sequencing Kit (PE Applied Biosystems). HeLa, COS-7, RK13, DLD-1, THP-1, and RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the Japanese Cell Resource Bank (Osaka, Japan). DLD-1 and THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. HeLa, COS-7, RK13 and RAW264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Total RNAs from unstimulated and stimulated monocytes and other cells were isolated, and at least 10 μg of total RNA/lane was loaded on 1% formamide gel. RNA was transferred onto Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); membranes were prehybridized for 30 min and hybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in rapid hybridization buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in the presence of appropriate 32P-labeled cDNA probe (SIMPLE ORF, GCAP2, PCR-amplified human and murine TNF-α ORF regions, and EST as murine SIMPLE/TBX1). Blots were washed at high stringency (65 °C, 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS) and exposed to the films for different times. The mRNA expression level was estimated from radioactivity of the hybridized probe by phosphorimaging or autoradiography. The open reading frame of SIMPLE cDNA was amplified by 5′-gga tcc atg tcg gtt cca gga cct ta-3′ withBamHI site (bold) and 5′-aag ctt cta caa acg ctt gta ggt gc-3′ with HindIII site (bold) and ligated into theE. coli expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) in frame with N-terminal His tag and used to transform competent E. coliM15[pREP4] cells (Qiagen). N-terminal (His)6-tagged SIMPLE was purified under denaturing condition by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antibody against purified SIMPLE was generated by immunizing a rabbit following standard methods. The coding region of SIMPLE (234–719 bp) was cloned into two mammalian expression vectors pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), respectively. The primer combinations used for cloning intoXhoI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1 were 5′-ctc gag cca cca tgt cgg ttc cag gac ctt a-3′ and 5′-aag ctt cta caa acg ctt gta ggt gc-3′. Primers containingBamHI and EcoRI sites, 5′-gga tcc cca cca tgt cgg ttc cag gac ctt a-3′ and 5′-gaa ttc cta caa acg ctt gta ggt gc-3′, respectively, were used for cloning into pcDNA3. All DNA constructs were checked by sequencing and transfected into various mammalian cell lines (HeLa, COS-7, and RK13) with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For detection of SIMPLE protein, SIMPLE-transfected RK13 cells, human monocytes, HeLa, THP-1 and DLD-1 cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 140 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetamide. The cell lysates were solubilized either in reducing or non-reducing sample buffer and resolved in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were blocked with 10% non-fat milk and treated with rabbit anti-SIMPLE polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. After washing, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and developed with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). THP-1 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g and then washed 3 times with PBS. Cell pellets were washed once with hypotonic buffer (10 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA) and pelleted at 1000 × g for 10 min. The resulting cell pellet were then resuspended in hypotonic buffer and placed on ice for 20 min. Lysis of the cell suspension was accomplished with 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and sequentially centrifuged at 1000 × gto pellet nuclei, 8000 × g to pellet mitochondria and lysosome, and 100,000 × g to pellet endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and membranes. The supernatant after the last centrifugation was kept as the cytosolic fraction. The pellets, resuspended in homogenizing buffer, and the cytosolic fraction were analyzed directly by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-SIMPLE antibody or mouse anti-LAMP-1 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). THP-1 cells (∼5 × 106 cells) were extracted in 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-114 in PBS for 1 h on ice, and the nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The proteins were then partitioned into the detergent and aqueous phases according to the method of Bordier (35Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The separated detergent and aqueous phases were analyzed directly by immunoblotting. THP-1 cells or RK13 cells expressing SIMPLE were solubilized in 20 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm iodoacetamide. To remove the debris, solubilized sample was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 100 microunits of neuraminidase (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 4.5 milliunits ofO-glycanase (endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) treatment for 16 h at 37 °C. HeLa cells incubated in 4-well glass slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) were fixed for 30 min with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS and were permeabilized with 0.5% saponin, 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min, washed four times with PBS. After soaking in 1% BSA/PBS, the cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with rabbit anti-SIMPLE polyclonal antibody or pre-immune rabbit antiserum in 1% BSA/PBS at a dilution of 1:500. The cells were washed with 1% BSA/PBS and treated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) (Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA) diluted in 1% BSA/PBS. Cells were washed 4 times by 1% BSA/PBS and incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-LAMP-1 antibody (5 μg/ml) in 1% BSA/PBS, washed again, and incubated for 30 min with rhodamine B-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Organon Teknika Corp.) (1:100). Visualization of acid pH compartments was performed by staining cells with 75 nm Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 1 h at 37 °C. Single- or double-stained cells were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus FLUOVIEW). Colocalized green (fluorescein isothiocyanate) fluorescence and red (Lysotracker or Rhodamin-B) fluorescence appeared yellow in the merged images. Differential display RT-PCR has been performed between unstimulated and BCG-CWS-stimulated monocyte RNA. A combination of pairs of primers, T12GC (3′ anchor) and AP2 (5′ arbitrary), produced a distinct band designated as GCAP2 in BCG-CWS induced RNA (Fig. 1 A). Amplification and sequencing of this band identified a 373-bp fragment having identity, with a few acceptable mismatches, to the paired primers at the ends (Fig. 2, boxed sequence). This fragment did not show any homology with any known genes in the data base; however, we found several human ESTs. Furthermore, the fragment when used as a probe showed a distinct signal on Northern blots, suggesting the differential display product belongs to a 2.4-kb transcript (Fig. 4). Next, we employed the in silico cloning strategy (16Capone M.C. Gorman D.M. Ching E.P. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 969-973PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mao M. Fu G. Wu J.S. Zhang Q.H. Zhou J.

A. 1998; 95: 8175-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to generate an extended virtual contig with a group of EST clones that were directly, or through another overlapping EST, linked to the GCAP2 sequence. This procedure identified a human EST (AW022014) that bridged between the GCAP2 fragment and ESTs denoted by the LITAF/PIG7-end sequence. Sets of EST contigs for this zone are also currently available under a TIGR transcript (THC116999, October, 2000) at NCBI. In order to verify this link, RT-PCRs with 5′ primers from LITAF and 3′ primers from the GCAP2 fragment and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends from GCAP2 were conducted. Various combinations of RT-PCR primer pairs yielded the expected size bands that were further verified by sequencing and confirmed the link. A representative result of RT-PCR is in Fig.1 B. The newly identified 3′ region exhibited a polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2) located 18 bp upstream to the beginning of the poly(A) tail shown. No such polyadenylation signal has been detected in the published LITAF sequence or in the deposited PIG7 sequence. The poly(A) tail consisting of 19 A residues described for LITAF does not seem to be the true poly(A) tail, rather the sequence corresponds to a stretch of 19 As (1754–1777 bp) interrupted by a G in the SIMPLE cDNA (Fig. 2). The presence of the same A stretch in both cDNA and in genomic sequences (exon 4, Fig.3 C) further emphasizes that the long A-tailing starting at 1755 bp in the LITAF sequence is an intra cDNA region, whereas the poly(A) tail shown for SIMPLE was not derived from the genome. Thus, the GCAP2 fragment defines the 3′ end of the LITAF/PIG7 transcript, which in turn leads us to conclude that LITAF/PIG7 is a differentially expressed gene in BCG-CWS-treated human monocytes.Figure 2The 2.4-kb SIMPLE cDNA (GenBankTMAB034747) and deduced amino acid sequence. The cDNA region (GCAP2) identified by differential display is shown within a box. The large shaded region represents the connecting sequence between LITAF and GCAP2, which also overlaps with the EST AW022014 sequence.

The poly(A) stretch, which corresponds to the 3′ end of the LITAF sequence, is shown in lowercase, boldface letters.

C, genomic organization of SIMPLE on a chromosome 16 HTG clone has been presented schematically. Possible splice junctions are shown inside thebox; exon (Ex) sequences are in capital letters; intron sequences are shown in small letters,and AG/GT sequences at the splice junctions areunderlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During sequencing of several RT-PCRs and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends products from human monocyte RNA, we consistently noticed a single G was missing from a stretch of 5 consecutive guanine residues present in the coding region of LITAF (608–612 bp; GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number NM_004862 orU77396)/PIG7 (454–458 bp; GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numberAF010312). Absence of this G residue created a translational frameshift (Fig. 3 B) yielding a protein of 161 amino acids, whereas LITAF/PIG7 encoded a protein of 228 amino acids. This raised a potential question whether there were two types of transcripts producing two different proteins. In order to verify this further, first we used Pfu polymerase to amplify the coding region from various RNA sources that included monocytes from different donors' blood, THP-1 monocytic cells (from which LITAF has been isolated), and DLD-1 colon carcinoma cells (from which PIG7 has been cloned). After cloning the PCR products in each case, we sequenced the critical region for 10–12 independent clones and detected the stretch of 4 Gs (Fig. 3 A, top) instead of 5 Gs in all of them. Second, we looked for ESTs specific for that region because many tissues express the gene, and if the zone is polymorphic that could be represented by some of the ESTs. We found many ESTs (Fig.3 A) with 4 Gs but could not detect any human or murine EST showing 5 Gs for that particular region, neither in the EST data base nor in the pooled EST set for LITAF/PIG7 under UniGene collection (Hs.76507, October, 2000). Third, we wanted to verify the region from the genomic sequence. For this purpose, we utilized the information from the unfinished genome sequencing project through the HTG data base at NCBI. We partially succeeded, but a few contigs remain yet to be aligned, in identifying the genomic boundaries (Fig. 3 C) for the entire SIMPLE transcript from a chromosome 16 clone, RP11-547D14 (accession number AC007616.3). The astonishing observation was that the region of dispute, 4 Gs or 5 Gs, falls into a potential splice junction (Fig. 3, B and C). According to the splice junction donor acceptor rule (AG/GT), it is clearly in favor of the presence of 4 Gs in the cDNA. Finally, we focused on the deduced amino acid sequence of the transcript. If the protein with the changed C-terminal amino acid truly represented a conserved protein, then we might find other homologues and orthologues in the data base. Due to the advantage of the small size of SIMPLE, we easily could find full-length or near full-length proteins from various species described below (Fig. 9). The C-terminal domain was found to be the most conserved region in a number of proteins from different species, indicating the evolutionarily conserved feature of this domain. On the other hand, we failed to generate any such data for the C-terminal domain specific for LITAF/PIG7. Based on the above four lines of evidence, we conclude that the 161-amino acid sequence coding the SIMPLE gene is the natural and the most abundant transcript. For clarity, from this point, the 161-amino acid-coded 2368-bp transcript will be referred as SIMPLE. For comparison the first base number of SIMPLE cDNA (Fig. 2) has been kept the same as LITAF. Multiple tissue Northern blots from CLONTECH were independently hybridized with full-length cDNA, the coding region, and with the GCAP2 fragment. Three types of hybridizations successively detected a single transcript of the same size on multiple tissues. The result obtained by hybridizing with the coding region of SIMPLE is presented in Fig. 4. Most of the human tissues except testis expressed SIMPLE abundantly, and this was also consistent with the fact that there was a vast collection of human ESTs (UniGene Hs.76507, October, 2000) from various organs and a single EST (AA62566) of testis origin. In respect to the RNA size marker provided on the multiple tissue Northern blot, the message size fits reasonably with the full-length SIMPLE (∼2.4 kb). The message size appeared to be the same in a number of human cell lines, and in 12 paired tumor-normal colon carcinoma samples (data not shown), suggesting there is no aberrant or variant transcript that could be detectable by size difference on Northern blot. The tissue distribution pattern also suggests SIMPLE probably has a more generalized function rather than playing a unique role for the sole benefit of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. However, there is a great variability in the relative expression level among the tissues tested; peripheral blood lymphocyte showed the highest level of expression: little in brain and, compared with ovary, little in testis. Inter-library comparative profile of the SAGE-tag, TGAATACTAC (Fig. 2), indicates that the expression could be regulated by a hormone in the human reproductive tissues: as evident in LNCaP with DHT versus LNCaP without 5α-dihydrotestosterone or MCF7 3 h versusMCF7-estradiol 3 h. The SAGE data further demonstrate that the transcript might be differentially expressed in certain malignancies, such as prostate, breast, and ovary. Often differential display fragments gives rise to false positives, so it was essential to reverify the differential expression in response to stimulation. In different batches of monocytes and iDC, BCG-CWS enhanced the expression of SIMPLE about 2-fold at 8 h of induction (Fig. 5 A), the same incubation time for the differential display study. The expression has also been checked in response to heat-killed and live M. bovis BCG; both are found to be potent inducers of this gene (Fig. 5 B) at 8 h of infection. M. bovis BCG doubling time in monocytes was ∼20 h, suggesting the induction was replication-independent. However, a detailed study is required to confirm whether the expression was phagocytosis-dependent or the expression undergoes alteration with bacilli growth. BCG-CWS and BCG are both potent inducers of TNF-α, and LITAF has been described as a novel regulator of TNF-α expression during LPS stimulation. We wanted to see if there was any correlation of SIMPLE and TNF-α expression in our experimental condition. Human monocytes and murine RAW cells were stimulated by LPS and BCG, and at different time points RNA was prepared. The blots were first probed with species-specific SIMPLE cDNA and then stripped and reprobed with species-specific TNF-α cDNA (Fig.6).

In this study, CaMKIV was found to directly associate with and phosphorylate the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) component p65 both in vitro and in vivo. The phosphorylation of p65 by CaMKIV resulted in recruitment of transcription coactivator cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein and concomitant release of corepressor silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors, as demonstrated by the glutathioneS-transferase pull down and mammalian two hybrid assays. In addition, cotransfection of CaMKIV resulted in cytosolic translocation of the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors. Consistent with these results, cotransfected CaMKIV dramatically stimulated the NFκB transactivation in mammalian cells. From these results, NFκB is suggested to be a novel downstream effector molecule of CaMKIV. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) is a key mediator of Ca2+-induced gene expression.

Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Calcium binds to CaM by means of a structural motif called an EF-hand, and a pair of these structures is located in both globular ends of the protein. CaM binds to and activates target enzymes. These Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases include CaM-kinase kinase, CaMKI and CaMKIV, which are phosphorylated and activated by CaM-kinase kinase, and CaMKII. In particular, CaMKIV is a monomeric multifunctional enzyme that is expressed only in subanatomical portions of the brain, T lymphocytes, and postmeiotic male germ cells. CaMKIV is present in the nucleus of the cells in which it is expressed and has been implicated in regulation of transcription of a number of genes including those encoding interleukin 2, members of the immediate early gene family such as c-fos, tumor necrosis factor family members such as CD40L, FasL, and tumor necrosis factor, the neurotrophin, BDNF, an Epstein-Barr virus gene involved in the switch to the lytic cycle called BZLF1, and orphan members of the steroid receptor superfamily such as ROR and COUP-TF (1Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the only direct substrates for CaMKIV involved in transcription that have been defined to date are CREB and CREM (2Schulman H. Braun A. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 311-343Google Scholar, 3Means A.R. Ribar T.J. Kane C.D. Hook S.S. Anderson K.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 389-407PubMed Google Scholar) although the transcription coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) has also been indirectly implicated as a possible substrate (4Chawla S. Hardingham G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel (NFκB) family of polypeptides, is important for the inducible expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (reviewed in Ref. 5Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-rel, p52, and RelB. These proteins share a 300-amino acid region, known as the Rel homology domain, which binds to DNA and mediates homo- and heterodimerization. This domain is also the target of the IκB proteins, which include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100. In the majority of cells, NFκB exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins (5Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In response to various inducers, a multisubunit protein kinase, the IκB kinase, is rapidly activated and phosphorylates two critical serine residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain of the IκBs. Phosphorylated IκBs are recognized by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and undergo polyubiquitination, which targets them for rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. NFκB dimers, which are spared from degradation, translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription (5Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Transcriptional coactivators either bridge transcription factors and the components of the basal transcriptional apparatus and/or remodel the chromatin structures (reviewed in Ref. 6Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In particular, CBP and its functional homologue p300, as well as steroid receptor coactivator-1 and its family members, were shown to be essential for the activation of transcription by a large number of regulated transcription factors, including NFκB (7Gerritsen M.E.

Interestingly, steroid receptor coactivator-1 and its homologue ACTR, along with CBP and p300, were recently shown to contain histone acetyltransferase activities and associate with yet another histone acetyltransferase protein P/CAF (6Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) and its homologue-silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) harbor transferable repression domains that can associate with various histone deacetylases (HDAC). In humans, three highly homologous class I (HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3) and four class II (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, and HDAC7) HDAC enzymes have been identified to date. The class I deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 are components of multisubunit complexes mSin3A and the NuRD complex (10Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M.

It is interesting to note that N-CoR/SMRT serves as an adapter molecule between the core mSin3 complex and sequence-specific transcriptional repressors without stably associating with the mSin3 complex. More recently, however, SMRT/N-CoR was found to be a direct component of a newly isolated HDAC3 complex (12Wen Y.D. Perissi V. Staszewski L.M. Yang W.M. Krones A. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Seto E.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1048-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-CoR and SMRT have also been reported to partner with HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 (14Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar,15Huang E.Y. Zhang J. Miska E.A. Guenther M.G. Kouzarides T. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 45-54PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the notion that acetylation of histones destabilizes nucleosomes and relieves transcriptional repression by allowing transcription factors to access to recognition elements, whereas deacetylation of the histones stabilizes the repressed state (6Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Interestingly, N-CoR/SMRT is also known to mediate transcriptional repression from a wide variety of other non-receptor-mediated pathways (16Lee S.-K. Kim J.H. Lee Y.C. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

These include AP-1, NFκB, SRF, MyoD, the bHLH-LZ proteins Mad and Mxi that mediate repression of Myc activities and tumor suppression, E2F-repressive retinoblastoma protein, and the oncoproteins PLZF-RAR and LAZ3/BCL6, which are involved in acute promyelocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, respectively. In this work, we found that CaMKIV specifically interacted with and phosphorylated the NFκB component p65, and the CaMKIV-mediated phosphorylation of p65 resulted in enhanced recruitment of CBP with concomitant dissociation of SMRT. In addition, cotransfection of CaMKIV resulted in cytosolic translocation of SMRT. Accordingly, CaMKIV dramatically stimulated the NFκB transactivation. From these results, we concluded that NFκB is a novel downstream effector molecule of CaMKIV. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments for the full-length CaMKIV, CaMKIVc (the CaMKIV residues 1–313), and CREB were subcloned intoEcoRI and XhoI (or SalI) restriction sites of the LexA fusion vector pEG202PL, the B42 fusion vector pJG4–5, the mammalian two hybrid vectors pCMX/Gal4 and pCMX/VP16, and the mammalian expression/in vitro translation vector pcDNA3. The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments for CaMKIV, CaMKIVc, human p65, and p65C (the p65 residues 431–551) were inserted into EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX4T-1. Expression vectors for various CaMKs and their C-terminal deleted forms with constitutive activities were obtained from Dr. Tony Means at Duke University. The mammalian two hybrid vectors pCMX/VP16-SMRT-D, pCMX/VP16-CBP-A, pCMX/Gal4-p65, and pCMX/VP16-p65, the mammalian expression vectors for p65, CBP, CBP-A, SMRT-D, GFP/SMRT, and a constitutively active form of MEKK-1, and the yeast expression vectors encoding B42 fusions to p50 and p65C were as described (9Na S.-Y.

CV-1 and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and polyclonal antibodies against p65 and CaMKIV were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Calcium signaling activator ionomycin and CaMK inhibitor KN-93 were purchased from Calbiochem. HeLa and CV-1 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and transiently transfected using SuperFect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h later, the luciferase assays were done as described (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Associates, NY1995Google Scholar), and the results were normalized to the LacZ expression. For treatment with ionomycin and KN-93, the cells, 24 h post-transfection, were replaced with fresh medium containing ionomycin or KN-93. The cells were lysed 24 h later. For the localization studies of SMRT, ∼105 CV-1 cells were seeded in a chambered coverslip cell culture system (Nalge-Nunc, Rochester, NY) and were transfected with the pCMV-GFP-SMRT vector (24Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), together with an appropriate expression vector for the activated form of MEKK-1 (24Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) or various CaMKs, as indicated (or an equivalent empty vector as a control) using the SuperFect procedure. One day after transfection, the subcellular location of the GFP-SMRT fusion polypeptide was visualized using a Zeiss AxiosKop 2 microscope. The cotransformation and β-galactosidase assay in yeast were done as described (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Associates, NY1995Google Scholar). For each experiment, at least three independently derived colonies expressing chimeric proteins were tested. Equal amounts of GST alone or GST fusion proteins, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified, were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated in the reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin) with labeled proteins expressed by in vitro translation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system, with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Associates, NY1995Google Scholar). Forin vivo phosphorylation, HeLa cells were cultured in 100-mm dish at density of 1 × 105 cells/ml for 24 h, transfected with 5 μg of the indicated expression vectors using SuperFect, grown for 24 h, starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min, and treated with 100 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate. 3 h later, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× phosphatase inhibitor), and centrifuged. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of p65-specific antibody for 2 h and incubated with protein A-agarose for 16 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Purified GST alone and GST fusion protein to p65C were subjected to phosphorylation with either cold ATP or [γ-32P]ATP for labeling. CaMKIV was expressed by in vitro translation by using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system and purified by immunoprecipitation with CaMKIV-specific antibody. Alternatively, HeLa cells cotransfected with indicated expression vectors were lysed, immunoprecipitated with p65 antibody, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and utilized as a source for putative p65-associated kinase(s) in vivo. Kinase reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C with 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. To activate the full-length CaMKIV, 1 mm CaCl2 and 10 μg/ml of CaM were added. It is interesting to note that there are significant overlaps in function between NFκB and CaMKIV, such as their involvement in anti-apoptosis and pro-proliferation (1Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CaMKIV is known to reside in the nucleus in vivo and directly phosphorylate the transcription factors CREB and CREM (2Schulman H. Braun A. Carafoli E. Klee C. Calcium as a Cellular Regulator. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 311-343Google Scholar, 3Means A.R. Ribar T.J. Kane C.D. Hook S.S. Anderson K.A. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 389-407PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether CaMKIV is also functionally linked to NFκB. As shown in Fig.1 A, the constitutively active mutant form of CaMKIV consisting of the CaMKIV residues 1–313 (i.e. CaMKIVc) was found to interact with the NFκB components p50 and p65 in yeast. In the case of p65, p65C consisting of the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65 (i.e. the p65 residues 431–551) was utilized, because the full-length p65 was not readily expressed. As expected, the positive control CREB was also found to directly interact with CaMKIVc in yeast. Similar results were also obtained with the full-length CaMKIV (data not shown). Consistent with these results, coexpression of a fusion protein consisting of the transactivation domain VP16 and CaMKIVc stimulated the Gal4/p65-directed transactivation in HeLa cells, suggesting that p65 directly interacts with CaMKIV in vivo(Fig. 1 B). In this experiment, it is notable that 20 μm of the CaMK inhibitor KN-93 was used, because VP16/CaMKIVc alone was an effective stimulator of the Gal4/p65 transactivation in the absence of KN-93 (data not shown). Coexpression of VP16/p65 also stimulated the Gal4/CaMKIV-mediated level of transactivation directed by the Gal4-Luc reporter construct (data not shown). Finally, labeled p65 protein expressed by using the TNT-coupledin vitro transcription-translation system specifically interacted with GST fusions to the full-length CaMKIV and CaMKIVc but not with GST alone (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, the p50-CaMKIV interaction was much weaker in the mammalian two hybrid tests and not readily observed in the GST pull down assays (data not shown), suggesting that an intermediary protein(s) may mediate the observedin vivo interactions between CaMKIV and p50 in yeast. Nevertheless, these results strongly suggest that specific interactions may occur between CaMKIV and NFκB in vivo. The direct physical interactions between the NFκB component p65 and CaMKIV in vitro (Fig. 1 C) suggested that p65 may serve as a direct substrate for the kinase activity of CaMKIV. Thus, we tested whether p65 can be phosphorylated by CaMKIV in vivo. HeLa cells transfected with either the parental vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-CaMKIVc were subjected to in vivo phosphorylation by incubating the cells in the presence of 100 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated by either preserum or antibody against p65. As shown in Fig. 2 A, fractionation of the lysed extracts in SDS-PAGE and autoradiography showed that the p65 immunoprecipitates but not the preserum-directed immunoprecipitates contained a labeled p65 band. The labeling intensity of the identical band was significantly increased in CaMKIVc-transfected cell extracts. The total amounts of p65 were identical between these samples (data not shown), excluding the possibility that CaMKIVc increased the expression level of p65. These results imply that p65 is either a direct or indirect phosphorylation target of CaMKIV in vivo. To distinguish between these possibilities, purified GST alone or GST fusion proteins to p50, p65, and p65C were subjected to [γ-32P]ATP-phosphorylation with CaMKIV, either in the absence or presence of CaMK-activating CaM. For these reactions, we utilized in vitro-translated CaMKIV, which was purified further by immunoprecipitating with specific antibody against CaMKIV to exclude other kinase activities included in the in vitrotranslation reactions. As expected, GST/p65C but not GST alone was specifically labeled with 32P only in the presence of CaM (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, phosphorylation of p50 was not observed in these experiments, consistent with the lack of its direct interactions with CaMKIV in vitro, whereas the overexposure of the film revealed some weak labeling with the full-length p65 (data not shown). These results suggest that efficient phosphorylation of the full-length p65 in vivo may require other additional proteins or signaling events that are not present in the in vitro reactions. Nevertheless, these results clearly demonstrate that the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65 is a direct phosphorylation substrate of CaMKIV. Finally, we tested whether p65 is associated with CaMK in vivo. To this end, p65 antibody-directed immunoprecipitates from lysates of HeLa cells transfected with either p65 or p65 plus CaMKIV were utilized as a source for kinase to phosphorylate GST alone, GST/p65, and GST/p65C as substrates. In these experiments, GST/p65C but not GST alone was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP only in the presence of CaMK-activating CaM when using cells transfected with p65 alone (Fig.2 C, compare lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, HeLa cells cotransfected with both p65 and CaMKIV exhibited a detectable, basal level of phosphorylation with GST/p65C (Fig.2 C, lane 3), which was further strengthened with addition of CaM (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). In particular, phosphorylation of GST fusion to the full-length p65 was readily detectable under this condition (Fig. 2 C, lanes 5and 6). Thus, the putative proteins or signaling events required for efficient phosphorylation of the full-length p65 in vivo may exist in this p65 antibody-directed immunoprecipitate. Notably, CaMKIV is known to be expressed only in certain cell types whereas CaMKI and CaMKII are ubiquitous in expression. Thus, the CaMK found to be associated with p65 in vivo in the absence of cotransfected CaMKIV (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) is likely to be either CaMKI or CaMKII. Overall, these results strongly demonstrate that the endogenous CaMK in HeLa cells or cotransfected CaMKIV specifically associates with and phosphorylates p65 in vivo. The fact that the CaMKIV-directed phosphorylation site was mapped to the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65, which was previously shown to be the interaction interfaces of both transcription coactivator CBP and corepressor SMRT/N-CoR (7Gerritsen M.E.

Indeed, the mammalian two hybrid-based assays demonstrated that coexpressed CaMKIVc strengthened the interactions of Gal4/p65 and VP16/CBP-A (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the interactions between Gal4/p65 and VP16/SMRT-D were significantly impaired by coexpressed CaMKIVc. CBP-A (i.e. the CBP residues 1–446) and SMRT-D (i.e. the SMRT residues 1060–1495) are the previously defined p65 interaction interfaces (7Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y.

Radiolabeled CBP-A interacted with p65C, which was reacted with CaM-activated CaMKIV but not CaMKIV alone and washed extensively prior to being added to the GST pull down assays (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the mammalian two hybrid tests, interactions of unphosphorylated GST/p65C and radiolabeled SMRT-D were lost when p65C was phosphorylated by CaM-activated CaMKIV (Fig. 3 B). As expected, GST alone did not interact with radiolabeled CBP-A or SMRT-D under any condition. Overall, these results clearly demonstrate that CaMKIV-directed phosphorylation of p65 results in efficient recruitment of transcription coactivator CBP while repulsing corepressor SMRT. Recently, CaMK signaling was shown to promote myogenesis by disrupting MEF2·HDAC complexes and stimulating HDAC nuclear export (26McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 27McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14400-14405Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of SMRT by MEKK-1 was shown to inhibit the ability of SMRT to physically tether to its transcription factor partners and led to a redistribution of the SMRT protein from a nuclear compartment to a more perinuclear or cytoplasmic compartment (24Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These results led us to explore whether CaMKIV has a similar modulatory role with SMRT. As shown in Fig. 4, cotransfection with CaMKIVc expression vector resulted in more cells that express GFP/SMRT in the cytoplasm. In the absence of CaMKc, ∼73% of cells had the previously described, speckled pattern of exclusive nuclear expression with SMRT (6Westin S. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 47: 89-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, ∼75% of cotransfected cells exhibited cytoplasmic staining of SMRT in the presence of CaMKIVc. In these cells, nuclear staining was still observed, but the number of speckles was significantly decreased. Similar results were also obtained with CaMKIc, whereas CaMKIIc was without any significant effect. As reported (24Hong S.H. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6612-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the active form of MEKK-1 also led to the cytoplasmic translocation of SMRT. These results strongly suggest that CaMKI and CaMKIV may stimulate SMRT nuclear export. Currently, we are investigating whether CaMKIV, either directly or indirectly, phosphorylates SMRT. However, close examinations of the SMRT sequences revealed that they lack the known consensus phosphorylation sequences for CaMKIV, (R/K)XX(S/T) (1Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The above results suggest that CaMKIV should serve as an activator of the NFκB transactivation. This prediction was confirmed in experiments in which Gal4/p65-directed transactivation of the Gal4-Luc reporter construct (9Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.J. Choi H.S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Lee S.-K. Kim J.H. Lee Y.C. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol.

Similarly, coexpressed CaMKIVc stimulated the NFκB transactivation with the κB-Luc reporter construct (9Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.J. Choi H.S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Lee S.-K. Kim J.H. Lee Y.C. Cheong J. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12470-12474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). In addition, CBP-dependent stimulation of the p65 transactivation (7Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 8Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) was synergistically enhanced by coexpressed CaMKIVc (Fig.5 B). Similar results were also obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown). The C-terminally deleted, constitutive active form of CaMKI but not CaMKII showed dramatic stimulatory effects on the NFκB transactivation (Fig. 5 C). Thus, CaMKI is likely to represent the CaMK proposed to be associated with p65 in vivo (Fig. 2 C). Treatment of HeLa cells with ionomycin, the CaMK activator, either in the absence or presence of coexpressed CaMKIV, also led to stimulation of the p65-directed transactivation of the κB-Luc reporter construct in HeLa cells, whereas the CaMKIVc-stimulated level of the p65 transactivation was impaired by KN-93, the CaMK inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 D). As already noted, the ionomycin effect on the p65 transactivation in HeLa cells non-transfected with CaMKIV is probably because of the endogenous CaMKI. Accordingly, the inhibition was relatively minor with 3 μm KN-93, the concentration that is known to specifically inhibit CaMKII, whereas 30 μmKN-93, at which both CaMKI and CaMKIV are inhibited, completely blocked the p65 transactivation (Fig. 5 D). From these results, we concluded that CaMKI and CaMKIV are capable of stimulating the NFκB transactivation, likely through direct phosphorylation of p65 and other proteins that appears to result in efficient recruitment of transcription coactivator CBP while disrupting the p65-SMRT interactions and stimulating nuclear export of corepressor SMRT. Several reports have demonstrated that inhibition of CaMK activity is associated with apoptosis and proliferation. Inhibition of CaMK activity with specific inhibitors induces apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells (28Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar) and sensitizes etoposide-resistant cells to apoptotic challenge (29Kawamura K. Grabowski D. Krivacic K. Hidaka H. Ganapathi R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1903-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thymic T cells from transgenic mice expressing a catalytically inactive form of CaMKIV showed defects in survival and proliferation (30Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Illario M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, CaMK inhibitor KN-62 was shown to reduce DNA synthesis in small cell lung carcinoma (31Williams C.L. Phelps S.H. Porter R.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that NFκB has also been linked to both anti-apoptosis and pro-proliferative activities (reviewed in Refs. 32Natoli G. Costanzo A. Guido F. Moretti F. Levrero M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and 33Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Thus, NFκB may mediate these previously characterized anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative effects of CaMKIV, although other activities of CaMKIV previously known and/or yet to be characterized may also turn out to operate through NFκB. Similar to the work described in this report, p65 was recently shown to be phosphorylated by the IκB-associated PKAc subunit through a cyclic AMP-independent mechanism, which promoted a novel bivalent interaction of p65 with the coactivator CBP/p300 (34Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 35Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Thus, p65 appears to be directly phosphorylated by at least two distinct kinases. Finally, the C-terminal transactivation domain of p65 is noted to have a numerous number of phosphorylation sites, including consensus CaMK sites ((R/K)XX(S/T)) (1Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and an effort to precisely map the regulatory phosphorylation sites of p65 by CaMKIV is currently under progress. 2M. K. Jang, J. Cheong, and J. W. Lee, unpublished results. In conclusion, we have shown that CaMKIV specifically interacts with and phosphorylates the NFκB component p65, which results in augmented transcriptional activity of p65 by facilitated dissociation of SMRT with concomitant, enhanced recruitment of CBP. CaMKIV also stimulated the nuclear export of SMRT. Overall, these results suggest that the NFκB component p65 may serve as a novel downstream phosphorylation target of CaMKIV and act as one of its effector molecules in vivo.

Yap1p is located predominantly in the cytoplasm; however, upon imposition of oxidative stress, Yap1p concentrates in the nucleus and activates target genes. Yap1p is constitutively transported in and out of the nucleus. Oxidative stress inhibits the Crm1p/Xpo1p-dependent nuclear export step, resulting in nuclear accumulation of Yap1p. In this study, we examined the mechanism for Yap1p nuclear import, and determined whether the import step is affected by oxidative stress. The nuclear accumulation of Yap1p required the activity of the small GTPase, Ran/Gsp1p. Under conditions in pse1–1 cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation of the importin β family member PSE1/KAP121, nuclear translocation of Yap1p was inhibited dramatically. In an in vitro assay, we showed that Yap1p could directly bind to Pse1p and that this interaction was dissociated by Ran-GTP. These results indicate that Pse1p is the nuclear import receptor for Yap1p. In addition to Pse1p, we suggest that Kap123p, which is homologous to Pse1p, has a minor effect on the nuclear import of Yap1p.

When such information is received, transcription factors in the cytoplasm translocate into the nucleus and become ready to activate specific gene expressions. Macromolecules are transported in and out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC)1embedded in the nuclear envelope. Transport through the NPC is mediated by a family of transport receptors (importin β/karyopherin β family; importins and exportins) that share homology in the Ran binding domain. The transport receptors recognize cargos through transport signals such as the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the nuclear export signal. It has been shown that multiple pathways of nucleocytoplasmic transport are carried out by utilizing different transport receptors and transport signals (see Ref. 1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar for review). 14 transport receptors (the importin β family proteins) have been identified from the genome information of the budding yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 2Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To date, those include nine import receptors, four export receptors, and one other that is uncharacterized. Intriguingly, only four of the yeast transport receptors are essential, and the other receptors are not essential despite the fact that they transport essential cargos. One explanation for this is that multiple transport receptors may mediate the transport of a single specific cargo. The direction of the nucleocytoplasmic transport is thought to be mediated by the function of small GTPase Ran (4Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 5Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Ran GTPase-activating protein and its coactivator, Ran-binding protein 1, are localized in the cytoplasm (6Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 7Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran is exclusively in the nucleus (8Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This distribution predicts that Ran is in the GTP-loaded form (Ran-GTP) in the nucleus and in the GDP-loaded form in the cytoplasm. According to the predicted gradient of different nucleotide-loaded forms of Ran, it has been suggested that these different forms of Ran can regulate the association and dissociation of the receptor-cargo complex. The binding of Ran-GTP to the import receptor facilitates the dissociation of the import receptor-cargo complex and releases cargo into the nucleus (4Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 9Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6237-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, the binding of Ran-GTP to the export receptor is required for the formation of the export receptor-cargo-Ran-GTP complex (11Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar, 12Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7430-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When this trimeric complex is recognized by Ran GTPase-activating protein and Ran-binding protein 1 in the cytoplasm, it dissociates and releases the cargo into the cytoplasm (12Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D. Cell. 1997; 90: 1061-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 14Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ran-GTP gradient is a key determinant for transport event between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. It is becoming clear that nuclear translocation of transcription factors depends on whether transport signals for the receptors are presented rather than on changing activity of the receptor. Some examples indicate that the NLSs of transcription factors, which are normally covered with a higher ordered structure, can be exposed by extracellular signals transmitted through phosphorylation array (see Ref. 15Turpin P. Ossareh-Nazari B. Dargemont C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar for review). The yeast AP-1-like transcription factor, Yap1p, which has a basic leucine-zipper domain and forms a homodimer, is crucial for the oxidative stress response in the budding yeast (16Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In response to oxidative stress, Yap1p is activated to induce multiple target genes, which are critical in the cellular defense system for oxidative stress to increase the levels of reduced thioredoxin and reduced glutathione in the cells (see Ref. 17Carmel-Harel O. Storz G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 439-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar for review). We have shown previously that Yap1p is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and translocates into the nucleus under oxidative stress (16Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the nuclear translocation of Yap1p is regulated at the step of nuclear export. Yap1p is likely to be constitutively imported into the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm by the export receptor Crm1p/Xpo1p. When oxidative stress is imposed, the later step, that is, the interaction of Crm1p with the cysteine-rich domain at the C terminus of Yap1p, is inhibited, resulting in increased Yap1p levels in the nucleus (18Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Consistent with this result, Yap1p derivatives lacking the cysteine-rich domain are constitutively localized in the nucleus, and the resulting Yap1p-dependent transcription of the reporter gene is increased. In addition to this elevated level of transcription, however, oxidative stress can further induce reporter gene expression, suggesting that an additional mode of the regulatory system is responsible (16Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). We have so far found no evidence that the import step is not responsible for the oxidative stress-induced nuclear localization of Yap1p. Here we address the molecular mechanism of the nuclear import of Yap1p to determine whether oxidative stress affects the Yap1p import step. Our results indicate that importin β family member Pse1p/Kap121p is the nuclear import receptor for Yap1p. In addition to Pse1p, we suggest that Kap123p, which is related closely to Pse1p, has a minor effect on the nuclear import of Yap1p. Moreover, we identified the Yap1p NLS and showed that oxidative stress does not affect the nuclear import pathway of Yap1p. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract, pepton, adenine, dextrose or synthetic medium supplemented with amino acids (20Ausubel, I., and Frederick, M. (eds) (2000)Current Protocols in MolecularBiologyVol. 3, p. 13.1, John Wiley $ Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Yeast cells were exposed to oxidative stress by the addition of diamide to a final concentration of 1.5 mm or of H2O2to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, when required, as described previously (16Kuge S.

A 3′-coding region ofGSP1, in which the 21st codon of GGT (Gly) was changed to GTC (Val) (G21V mutation), was isolated by PCR using primers 2 and 3 (SpeI and SalI sites are underlined) and digested with SpeI and SalI. Both of these fragments were ligated between the NdeI and SalI sites of pET15b (Novagen) to generate the His-tagged Gsp1pG21V expression plasmid. The resulting plasmid was designated pET-GSP1G21V. In the construction of plasmids to identify Yap1p NLS, the following GFP fusion vector was generated. Plasmids having genes encoding the duplicate inflame fusion protein of GFP536 (24Shiroki K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or inducible met3 promoter (18Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in plasmid pRS315 (21Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were designated pRS315 cup1–2xGFP-HA and pRS315 met3–2xGFP-HA, respectively. To generate a series of Yap1p derivatives on the N-terminal region of Yap1p (see Fig. 5 A), PCRs using corresponding synthetic oligonucleotides are carried out or restriction enzymes are used. The resulting fragments corresponding to various N-terminal regions of Yap1p were inserted in the 3′-coding region of duplicated GFP. Expected fusion proteins expressed by these plasmids are more than 60 kilodaltons. To determine the minor transport activity of Yap1p and the effect of oxidative stress on the nuclear import of Yap1p, we performed an in vivo nuclear import assay using the inducible met3 promoter to express 2xGFP-fused Yap1p(1–571) or Yap1p(2–59). Yeast cells were cultured under a condition in which the met3 promoter was suppressed in the presence of methionine until the mid-log phase. The cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed once with methionine-depleted medium, and incubated in the methionine-depleted medium to induce the expression of 2xGFP-Yap1p derivatives by a met3 promoter. Oxidative stress and/or temperature shift from the permissive temperature (25 °C) to the restrictive temperature (37 °C) were performed at the same time as induction by the met3promoter. GFP fluorescence, which could be detected from 30 min after induction, was observed at the indicated time. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis was carried out as described previously (16Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase, and the localization of GFP in live yeast cells was observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (MRC1024, Bio-Rad). Purification of GST fusion proteins was performed as described by Isoyama et al. (25Isoyama T. Kamoshita N. Yasui K. Iwai A. Shiroki K. Toyoda H. Yamada A. Takasaki Y. Nomoto A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2319-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with the pGEX-PSE1 or pGEX-KAP123 plasmids to express fusion proteins to GST and grown at 37 °C in the presence of ampicillin. At an A 600 nm of 0.5, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm and further cultured at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4), and disrupted by sonication. The cell lysates were mixed with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The fusion proteins were purified by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To isolate His-Yap1p(1–244) or His-Gsp1pG21V, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying pET-yap1(1–244) or pET-GSP1G21V were grown in the presence of kanamycin or ampicillin, respectively, and the expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 1 mm at 20 °C for 20 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated in lysis buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm imidazole). After the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%, the lysates were loaded into a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The column was washed, and the fusion proteins were eluted with elution buffer (lysis buffer containing 250 mmimidazole). Purified fusion proteins were concentrated by VIVASPIN (Vivascience) and further purified by chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol using the SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the assay of Yap1p binding to Pse1p or Kap123p, fusion proteins were expressed and purified from bacterial lysate as described above. 5 μg of GST-Pse1p, GST-Kap123p, or GST were bound to 20 μl of the 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubating in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads bound to GST fusion proteins were washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) and incubated with 5 μg of His-Yap1p(1–244) in 250 μl of binding buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing extensively, bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie staining or immunoblotting. His-Yap1p(1–244) was detected with anti-His-Tag (MBL) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (DAKO) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. ECL Western blotting detection reagents were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His-Gsp1pG21V was incubated in the presence of 2 mm GTP, 20 mmEDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at room temperature. After the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 50 mm, the reaction mixture was incubated further on ice for 20 min. His-Gsp1pG21V loaded with GTP (His-Gsp1pG21V-GTP) was purified by chromatography on Fast Desalting (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. 10 μg of His-Yap1p(1–244) was incubated with 10 μg of GST-Pse1p or GST-Kap123p prebound to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in a reaction volume of 500 μl for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with washing buffer, divided into two equal parts, and incubated with 5 μg of His-Gsp1pG21V-GTP or buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as unbound protein. Then, the beads were washed several times with washing buffer, and the bound protein was dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-His-tag antibodies as described above. In most cases, nuclear transport events require the activity of the small GTPase Ran (4Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R.

Therefore, we first examined if the nuclear import of Yap1p also requires the activity of Ran using a previously characterized temperature-sensitive mutant (gsp1–1) ofGSP1 encoding the budding yeast homologue of Ran (23Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The constitutive nuclear-localized mutant of Yap1p, GFP-Yap1p(1–571), was expressed in gsp1–1 cells, and the cells were cultured at the permissive temperature (25 °C). As we previously observed in the wild-type cells (16Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), GFP-Yap1p(1–571) was localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A, panel 1). In contrast, this nuclear accumulation was inhibited at the restrictive temperature (37 °C) (Fig. 1), indicating clearly that the nuclear import of Yap1p is mediated in a Ran-dependent manner.Figure 1Nuclear import of Yap1p requires Ran/Gsp1p. The gsp1–1 cells carrying a temperature-sensitive GSP1 allele were transformed with pRS315-GFP-yap1(1–571). The cells were grown to mid-log phase at the permissive temperature of 25 °C and further incubated at the restrictive temperature of 37 °C for 1 h. GFP-Yap1p(1–571) was detected by confocal microscopy as described under ”Experimental Procedures.” The fluorescent images (left panels) and the transmitted images (right panels) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data suggested that, like many other NLS-containing cargo proteins, Yap1p was imported into the nucleus by a transport receptor(s) that requires Ran for its transport activity. To identify such a receptor(s), we examined how the nuclear accumulation of Yap1p was affected using a panel of yeast strains carrying each mutation of transport receptors including the importin β family members as well as importin α. Two different conditions were used to induce the nuclear accumulation, or in other words, to inhibit the nuclear export step of Yap1p. First, the constitutive nuclear-localized mutant of Yap1p (GFP-Yap1p(1–571)) was expressed in mutant cells, and we observed which mutation affected its localization. Second, wild-type Yap1p (Yap1pWT) fused with GFP was expressed in each mutant cell, and the specific nuclear export step of Yap1pWT was inhibited by oxidative stress to induce nuclear accumulation of Yap1p (18Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Yeast cells carrying a mutation of importin α (srp1–31) or importin β (rsl1–4) showed no defect in nuclear translocation of Yap1p (data not shown), demonstrating that the nuclear import of Yap1p does not depend on the classical NLS import pathway. Other strains carrying mutations of importin β family membersxm1Δ, nmd5Δ, or mtr10Δ showed no defect in the nuclear accumulation of Yap1p (data not shown). However, we found that nuclear localization of GFP-Yap1p(1–571) was significantly inhibited in the temperature-sensitive PSE1mutant (pse1–1) cells under the restrictive temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 2 A, comparepanels 2 and 3). In addition, unlike Pse1p, Kap123p did not affect the nuclear localization, although Kap123p is related closely to Pse1p (Fig. 2 A, panel 4). Intriguingly however, most of the GFP-Yap1p(1–571) was spread in the cytoplasm in pse1–1 cells at the restrictive temperature and residual fluorescence could be observed in the nucleus (Fig.2 A, panel 3). One possible explanation for this was that preexisting GFP-Yap1p(1–571) in the nucleus was not degraded within 1 h after shifting to the restrictive temperature. To examine this possibility, nuclear accumulation of Yap1pWT was induced by the imposition of oxidative stress in pse1–1 cells at the same time as the temperature shift to the restrictive temperature. Again, the nuclear accumulation of Yap1pWT induced by diamide was dramatically inhibited only in pse1–1 cells at the restrictive temperature (Fig.2 B, compare panels 4 and 6 withpanels 3 and 5) but not other mutant cells (Fig.2 B, compare panels 7 and 8; data not shown). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 2 B, panel 6, the residual nuclear fluorescence of GFP-Yap1pWTstill could be observed in this condition. We then speculated that other transport receptors could confer the weak activity for nuclear import of Yap1p in addition to Pse1p. It has been suggested that Pse1p and its closely related transport receptor Kap123p (Yrb4p) can confer overlapping functions for nuclear import,e.g. ribosomal protein L25 is transported mainly by Kap123p; however, Pse1p can substitute for Kap123p (10Schlenstedt G.

Therefore, we predicted that Kap123p might be responsible for the residual nuclear localization of Yap1p in pse1–1 cells at the restrictive temperature. To test this possibility, we observed the nuclear accumulation of Yap1p in yeast cells carrying a KAP123disruption mutant in the background of pse1–1"

A number of other regulated Ca2+ entry pathways occur in specific cell types, however, and it is not know to what degree the different pathways interact when present in the same cell. In this study, we have examined the interaction between capacitative calcium entry and arachidonic acid-activated calcium entry, which co-exist in HEK293 cells. These two pathways exhibit mutual antagonism. That is, capacitative calcium entry is potently inhibited by arachidonic acid, and arachidonic acid-activated entry is inhibited by the pre-activation of capacitative calcium entry with thapsigargin. In the latter case, the inhibition does not seem to result from a direct action of thapsigargin, inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps, depletion of Ca2+ stores, or entry of Ca2+ through capacitative calcium entry channels. Rather, it seems that a discrete step in the pathway signaling capacitative calcium entry interacts with and inhibits the arachidonic acid pathway. The findings reveal a novel process of mutual antagonism between two distinct calcium entry pathways. This mutual antagonism may provide an important protective mechanism for the cell, guarding against toxic Ca2+ overload.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). The decline in Ca2+ content of the intracellular stores then secondarily signals the activation of plasma membrane calcium channels, a process known as capacitative calcium entry (2Putney Jr., J.W.

Although capacitative calcium entry seems to be present ubiquitously in receptor-regulated nonexcitable cells, other mechanisms for signaling entry have been found in specific cell types. Examples include receptor-gated channels (12Sasaki T. Gallacher D.V.

In the HEK293 cell line, capacitative and noncapacitative pathways co-exist (19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In these cells, muscarinic receptor activation can lead to baseline [Ca2+]ispikes or [Ca2+]i oscillations. However, despite the discharge of stored Ca2+ during these spikes, the calcium entry necessary for maintaining continuous spiking seems to be noncapacitative (16Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32636-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Also, in this cell line arachidonic acid induces a noncapacitative calcium entry; whether this response represents the noncapacitative mechanism seen with low concentrations of muscarinic agonists is controversial (21Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5613-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, when exogenous arachidonic acid is used to activate entry in HEK293 cells, a significant discharge of stored calcium occurs, yet little if any capacitative entry is activated (see below). Collectively, these observations suggest some degree of interaction between the capacitative and noncapacitative arachidonic acid-mediated pathways. Thus, in the current study we have carried out experiments to examine the regulation of these two calcium entry mechanisms and specifically to determine in what ways the signaling pathways interact. Our findings indicate that although both pathways involve the release of a common intracellular calcium pool, the entry components of the two pathways operate in a mutually exclusive manner. This implies that the underlying signaling mechanisms may be able to interact in a way that prevents the occurrence of supramaximal activation of calcium entry, which could have potentially toxic effects on cell function. Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells obtained from the ATCC were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. For Ca2+ measurements, cells were cultured to about 70% confluence, passaged onto glass coverslips, and used 24–48 h after plating. Fluorescence measurements were made with Fura2-loaded single or groups of HEK293 cells as described previously (22Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6766-6770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In brief, the coverslips with attached cells were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 μm acetoxymethyl ester of Fura2 (Fura2/AM, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C in the dark for 25 min. Before [Ca2+]i measurements, the cells were washed three times and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (25 °C) in HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (120 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMg2SO4, 20 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (adjusted by NaOH)). Ca2+-free solutions contained no added CaCl2 in the HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution. Fluorescence was monitored by placing the Teflon chamber with Fura2-loaded cells onto the stage of a Nikon Diaphot microscope (×40 Neofluor objective). The cells were excited alternatively by 340- and 380-nm wavelength light from a Deltascan D101 (Photon Technology International, Ltd.) light source equipped with a light-path chopper and dual excitation monochromators. Emission fluorescence intensity at 510 nm was recorded by a photomultiplier tube (Omega Optical). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (25 °C) and carried out within 2 h of loading for each coverslip. Changes in [Ca2+]i are reported for one single cell in oscillation experiments or a group of cells (6Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G.

The data are expressed as the ratio of Fura2 fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that due to excitation at 380 nm. In some experiments, [Ca2+]i was monitored on attached populations of cells in 96-well plates using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). When FLIPR384 was used, the cells (20,000 cells/well plated the day before use and cultured as above) were loaded with the single visible wavelength indicator, Fluo-4 (2 μm Fluo-4/AM for 45 min at 37 °C), excited at 488 nm, and emission-selected by a 510–570-nm bandpass filter. Detection was performed with a cooled charge-coupled device camera. Experiments were carried out at room temperature as described above. Arachidonic acid was obtained from BioMol. Carbachol and thapsigargin were purchased from Calbiochem. 2-Aminoethyoxydiphenyl borane (2-APB) was synthesized as described previously (23Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). For some experiments, the average peak responses (the ratio of Fura2 fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to Fura2 fluorescence due to excitation at 380 nm) were calculated and expressed as mean ± S.E. for the indicated number (n) of experiments. Statistical significance was determined with the Student's t test (p < 0.05). Treatment of HEK293 cells with either 1 μm thapsigargin or 30 μm arachidonic acid causes a release of intracellular stored Ca2+ as well as an increase in Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane (Fig.1). Yet, 1 μmGd3+ completely blocks the thapsigargin-induced entry with little effect on the entry caused by arachidonic acid (Fig. 1). Thus, arachidonic acid seems to release Ca2+ stores, but unlike thapsigargin, arachidonic acid does not activate significant capacitative calcium entry. We carried out the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2 to determine whether thapsigargin and arachidonic acid cause the release of Ca2+from the same intracellular pool. HEK293 cells were treated with either 30 μm arachidonic acid or 1 μm thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. In both cases a transient increase in [Ca2+]i was observed, indicative of the release of Ca2+ stores. When the arachidonic acid-treated cells were subsequently treated with 1 μm thapsigargin or when the thapsigargin-treated cells were subsequently treated with 30 μm arachidonic acid, no additional release of Ca2+ was observed. This indicates that these two reagents release Ca2+ from the same intracellular Ca2+ store, and the failure of arachidonic acid to activate capacitative calcium entry cannot be explained by its failure to release the pool of Ca2+ linked to calcium entry. The addition of the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, to cells treated with both arachidonic acid and thapsigargin resulted in a further release of Ca2+, presumably from mitochondria or other cellular sites.Figure 2Thapsigargin (TG) and arachidonic acid (AA) release the same intracellular Ca2+ store. HEK293 cells incubated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ were treated with either 30 μm arachidonic acid (solid trace) or 1 μm thapsigargin (dotted trace) (first arrow). A transient rise in [Ca2+]iindicates the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores. Subsequently, the arachidonic acid-treated cells were treated with thapsigargin, and the thapsigargin-treated cells were treated with arachidonic acid (second arrow). In both cases, the addition of the second reagent failed to cause a rise in [Ca2+]i, indicating that each agent releases the full Ca2+ store available to the other. Additional stores of Ca2+ could be released by the Ca2+ionophore, ionomycin (third arrow). The experiment is representative of a total of four similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One possible explanation for the failure of arachidonic acid to activate capacitative calcium entry is that arachidonic acid may act as an inhibitor of these channels or of some other step in the influx mechanism. There is precedence for this idea, because unsaturated fatty acids (24Gamberucci A. Fulceri R. Benedetti A. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and specifically arachidonic acid (25Alonso-Torre S.R. Garcia-Sancho J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have been shown to inhibit capacitative calcium entry in other systems. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, HEK293 cells were treated with thapsigargin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and then Ca2+ was restored as indicated revealing a robust capacitative calcium entry. The subsequent addition of 30 μm arachidonic acid caused a transient inhibition of Ca2+ entry. This inhibition was not always transient, however, especially when lower concentrations of arachidonic acid were used. The reversal of the inhibition could reflect only transient inhibition of capacitative calcium entry or the development of an arachidonic acid-dependent noncapacitative calcium entry. Furthermore, this protocol does not provide information on possible interactions in the reverse direction, i.e. effects of the capacitative pathway on arachidonic acid-activated Ca2+signaling. To address this issue, we designed experiments that would allow us to examine the effect of prior intracellular store depletion on the arachidonic acid response. To investigate the effects of activation of capacitative calcium entry on arachidonic acid-mediated Ca2+ entry, we carried out the experiment illustrated in Fig. 4. The membrane permeant IP3 receptor antagonist, 2-APB (23Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), has been shown to inhibit capacitative calcium entry, and there is evidence that it acts on the channels in a manner that interferes with the signaling mechanism (26Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, arachidonic acid-induced entry of Ca2+ is not inhibited by this reagent (see below; Ref. 21Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G. St J. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5613-5621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ were treated with 100 μm 2-APB as indicated in Fig. 4, and the subsequent addition of thapsigargin resulted in a transient response, indicating inhibition of capacitative calcium entry. When arachidonic acid was subsequently added, a robust [Ca2+]irise was observed; because intracellular stores were released previously by thapsigargin, this indicates that under this experimental condition, arachidonic acid is capable of the activation of Ca2+ entry. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, we repeated the above protocol utilizing another reagent that selectively blocks capacitative calcium entry, 1 μmGd3+ (27Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). However, while Gd3+prevented Ca2+ entry in response to thapsigargin, arachidonic acid now failed to activate a [Ca2+]isignal. This latter result indicates that depletion of Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin in some manner inhibits the ability of arachidonic acid to activate the noncapacitative calcium entry pathway. The difference in the mechanism of action of 2-APB and Gd3+ is therefore critical to understanding the nature of this interaction. Although the action of 2-APB on capacitative calcium entry channels may not result from inhibition of inositol trisphosphate receptors as first proposed (28Braun F.-J. Broad L.M. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), there is nonetheless evidence that its mode of interaction may involve the interference with the coupling mechanism rather than by acting simply as a blocker of the channel pore (26Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Gd3+, on the other hand, would be expected to block the channels directly. The known actions of thapsigargin are the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps, depletion of Ca2+ stores, and entry of Ca2+ through activated capacitative calcium entry channels (29Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1994; 43: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Neither inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pumps nor depletion of Ca2+ stores can be responsible because 2-APB blocks the interaction (Fig. 5) without interfering with the ability of thapsigargin to deplete Ca2+ stores. The entry of Ca2+ cannot be important because this is blocked by Gd3+, yet this agent does not prevent the inhibition by thapsigargin of arachidonic acid-induced entry. We conclude that a 2-APB-sensitive step in the signaling pathway for capacitative calcium entry acts to inhibit the activation of noncapacitative calcium entry channels by arachidonic acid. The nature of this step is unknown. Clearly, we must first achieve a better understanding of the steps involved in signaling capacitative calcium entry to determine how this pathway interacts with and regulates the arachidonic acid pathway or other calcium signaling pathways. Note that despite the findings indicating that 2-APB does not block capacitative calcium entry by virtue of its action on inositol trisphosphate receptors, an inescapable conclusion from the current findings is that this reagent must be doing something more than simply acting as a channel blocker. Although unlikely, an alternative interpretation of the findings in Figs. 4 and 5 is that somehow treatment with thapsigargin causes arachidonic acid-activated channels to become Gd3+-sensitive. To examine this possibility, we repeated the protocol of Figs. 4 and 5 utilizing both Gd3+ and 2-APB in combination. If thapsigargin causes arachidonic acid-regulated channels to become Gd3+-sensitive, the protocol should result in a block of the arachidonic acid-induced response. If 2-APB acts to prevent a store-depletion inhibitory effect on the channels, then arachidonic acid will give a normal response. The results of this experiment, shown in Fig. 6, show that the latter is indeed the case. A somewhat similar mutual antagonism has been described recently for the interaction between nicotinic- and purinergic-regulated cation channels (30Khakh B.S. Zhou X. Sydes J. Galligan J.J. Lester H.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this instance, the authors proposed close proximity between the interacting receptor/channel types. With respect to the current findings, there is evidence that arachidonic acid-regulated and capacitative calcium entry channels are located some undetermined distance apart in the plasma membrane (19Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31174-31178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Also, in the previous study on ligand-gated channels, the inhibitory interactions resulted in a lack of additivity, but at least under the experimental conditions in our study the degree of cross inhibition was even more striking (Figs.3 and 5). What determines which of these pathways predominate when multiple upstream signals occur? The answer to this question may depend on a number of variables such as the stimulus strength of different initiating agonists. However, as shown in Fig. 1, when arachidonic acid is applied, store depletion occurs, but clearly the arachidonic acid-activated entry predominates. This would suggest that at least under this experimental protocol, the arachidonic acid pathway takes precedence. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate for the first time a process of mutual antagonism between two distinct regulated Ca2+ entry pathways. The function of this mutual antagonism cannot be known for certain, but it is reasonable to suggest that this represents a mechanism to protect cells from the toxic effects of excessive [Ca2+]i loads. Thus, these two pathways exist as alternative pathways for Ca2+ signaling, and the process of mutual antagonism may ensure that they do not operate simultaneously. We thank Drs Elizabeth Murphy and Stephen Shears for constructive criticisms."

Both polymer types are synthesized as proteoglycans. Heparin occurs in connective tissue-type mast cells, whereas HS has a ubiquitous distribution and is produced by almost all mammalian cells. The biosynthesis of heparin and HS follows a common pathway that involves: (i) formation of a GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser carbohydrate-protein linkage region; (ii) assembly of repeating -GlcUA-GlcNAc- disaccharide units; and (iii) modification of the [GlcUA-GlcNAc]n polymers (1Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The latter process includes N-deacetylation andN-sulfation of GlcNAc units, C5-epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA units, and O-sulfation at various sites of the sugar residues. Heparin is highly modified, heavily N- andO-sulfated and with more IdoUA than GlcUA units. Generally, a predominant proportion of heparin chains consists of trisulfated -IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)- units. By comparison, HS has a more variable and heterogeneous structure, with highly modified, less modified, and unmodified sequences arranged in domain-type fashion (3Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 4Casu, B., and Lindahl, U. (2001) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). The IdoUA units occur in essentially two types of domains, composed of contiguousN-sulfated, and of alternating N-sulfated andN-acetylated disaccharide units, respectively (5Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The sequence variability of the chains is believed to reflect the functional role of HS glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in specific interactions with different proteins (1Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

Kato M. Hinkes M. Spring J. Gallo R. Lose E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 333-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). IdoUA residues generally appear to promote protein binding due to their conformational flexibility and have been identified as invariable constituents of protein-binding HS domains (4Casu, B., and Lindahl, U. (2001) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by the C5-epimerase therefore is crucial for many biological functions of heparin and HS. The mechanisms in control of the structural diversity of heparin and, in particular, of HS are only partly understood but clearly rely on the substrate specificities of the enzymes involved (2Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 4Casu, B., and Lindahl, U. (2001) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). The enzymes required to synthesize a HS chain have all been cloned. Notably, several of these proteins, including species committed to polymer modification, occur in multiple forms that are encoded by different genes. Some of these species have been shown to differ with regard to kinetic properties and/or substrate specificity from the respective homologous forms (7Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U.

The IdoUA units of heparin and HS chains occur in widely different structural contexts, which range from the minimally sulfated -GlcNSO3-IdoUA-GlcNAc- sequence found in HS molecules to the extensively sulfated -GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-IdoUA(2-OSO3)-GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)- structure typical of heparin (4Casu, B., and Lindahl, U. (2001) Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem., in press.Google Scholar). These findings raise the question as to whether the C5-epimerase, similar to other enzymes in the same biosynthetic process, also occurs in genetically distinct forms. More specifically, is the same epimerase committed to the formation of heparin, in the mast cell, and to HS, in other cells? Following the isolation of the GlcUA C5-epimerase from bovine liver, the corresponding cDNA was cloned from bovine lung, and a recombinant protein with significant catalytic activity was expressed in insect cells (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the present study we have addressed the question of genetic polymorphism by cloning the murine C5-epimerase gene. Only one form of the gene was found. Moreover, we have cloned the C5-epimerase cDNA from mouse liver that generates HS, and from mouse mastocytoma cells that produce heparin. The results strongly suggest that the same enzyme protein is implicated in both biosynthetic processes. Finally, analysis of the epimerase gene structure indicated that the bovine cDNA previously cloned (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was incomplete, as ∼28% of the 5′-terminal coding region was missing. This conclusion was verified by cloning and expression of the full-length protein, with the catalytic activity much higher than that of the previously expressed truncated form. A mouse genomic library (Lambda FX-II from Stratagene) was screened with a 1407-bp DNA probe from the bovine epimerase coding sequence, labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Approximately 2 × 106 phages were plated at a density of 250,000 plaques per 20 × 20-cm plate, and duplicate nylon filters were prepared from each plate. Hybridization was performed at 60 °C in 5× Denhardt's hybridization solution, containing 100 μg of salmon sperm DNA/ml. The final washes were in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS. Plaques that produced positive signals on both replicas were selected for second and third round screening. Five positive clones were found. Two of the clones were digested, clone 5a with EcoRI and clone 64 withSacI, and the resultant fragments were cloned into pUC 119 and BlueScript vectors, respectively. The insert-containing plasmids were purified using the Qiagen plasmid kit and subsequently sequenced. Nucleotide sequencing was performed using the BigDye terminator method and an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer according to the instructions of the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Exon/intron boundaries were determined by primer walking sequencing on both strands of the subclones. The size of introns was estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The exons were sequenced from both strands. Southern blot analysis was performed according to Sambrook et al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Harbor C.S. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.18-7.26Google Scholar). Mouse genomic DNA (20 μg), prepared from liver using an Easy Prep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was digested with restriction enzymes, and the products were separated by electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel. After separation, the gel was treated with 0.5 m NaOH for 30 min and neutralized in 0.5 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.5 m NaCl. The DNA fragments were transferred onto a Hybond-N+ nylon transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A fragment of an ∼800-bp intron DNA from genomic clone 5a was labeled with [32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and applied as probe. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) for 1 h followed by washing with 0.5× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at room temperature twice for 20 min. The membrane was exposed to a x-ray film for 3 days. Mouse lymphocytes were isolated from normal spleen and cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (FCS), 3 μg/ml concanavalin A, 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide, and 5 × 10−5m mercaptoethanol for 44 h. Human lymphocytes were isolated from blood and cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. Both lymphocyte cultures were synchronized by treatment with bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml). The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and recultured at 37 °C for 4–6 h in α-minimal essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml). The cells were harvested, and chromosome slides were made by hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air drying. The full-length mouse epimerase cDNA was biotinylated with dATP using Life Technologies, Inc., BioNick labeling kit (15 °C, 1 h) (13Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The procedure for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection was as described (13Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 14Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, chromosome slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h and were then treated with RNase A, denatured in 70% formamide in 2× SSC for 2 min at 70 °C, and finally dehydrated with ethanol. The probe was denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization mixture consisting of 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. The slides were pre-hybridized for 15 min at 37 °C, and the probe was loaded on the denatured slides. After overnight hybridization, slides were washed, and signals were detected as well as amplified using the published method (13Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). FISH signals and the 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) banding patterns were recorded by separate photographs, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-banded chromosomes (14Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Mouse multiple tissue Northern blot was purchased from CLONTECH. A DNA probe of 837 bp from the C-terminal end region of bovine cDNA clone was labeled with [32P]dCTP by use of Klenow enzyme. The hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb hybridization solution at 60 °C for 1 h, and the blot was then washed with 0.1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 60 °C. The membrane was exposed to a Kodak x-ray film for 2 days. Primers for cloning of mouse cDNA were designed based on the nucleotide sequence obtained by sequencing the exons of the genomic clones. The sense primer corresponds to bp 1–26 of the open reading frame (5′-ATGCGTTGTTTGGCAGCTCGGGTCAA). The antisense primer corresponds to the 3′-end of the coding sequence (bp 1829–1854), excluding the stop codon (5′-GTTGTGCTTTGCCCTACTGCCTTTAA). PCR was performed using a mouse liver QUICK-CloneTM cDNA (CLONTECH) as template under the following conditions: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles each of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Mouse mastocytoma mast cells (denoted “mast cells” in this paper), established in culture after passage through an ascites stage (15Jacobsson K.-G. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12154-12159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS until confluent. Total RNA was extracted from one flask (75 ml) of cultured mast cells according to the LiCl/urea/SDS procedure of Sambrooket al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Harbor C.S. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.18-7.26Google Scholar). About 1 μg of total RNA was used as template for RT-PCR. The single strand cDNA was prepared in a volume of 20 μl with 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A portion (5 μl) of the RT-PCR reaction mixture was used for amplification of C5-epimerase cDNA using the primer pair described above under the same conditions. For cloning of the 5′-terminal portion of bovine C5-epimerase cDNA, PCR was performed using a bovine lung gt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH) as template under the conditions described above. The sense primer is 5′-ATGCGTTGTTTGGCAGCTCGGGTCAA, corresponding to bp 1–26 of the open reading frame of mouse cDNA. The antisense primer is 5′-GCAGCCCTTGGGCACAGTCCAGTCATTGGGCTTGC corresponding to bp 287–321 of the bovine cDNA reported earlier (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All PCR products were directly cloned into a TOPOTM-TA Cloning vector (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer and were subsequently sequenced. The sequencing was carried out as described for the genomic DNA. Based on the cDNA sequence of the mouse C5-epimerase, new primers were designed and used for generation of a fragment without transmembrane domain for recombinant expression. PCR was performed by using the full-length mouse C5-epimerase cDNA as a template under the conditions described above. The resulting fragment was inserted into a modified (by introducing EGT signal peptide, FLAG epitope, enterokinase cleavage site, and His tag at the 5′-end) pIZ/V5 expression vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced. The expression construct was introduced into Sf9 insect cells, and the cells were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was collected and analyzed for epimerase activity. Medium containing recombinant epimerase (100 ml) was applied to a 20-ml column ofO-desulfated heparin immobilized on Sepharose (16Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 15 mm EDTA. After extensive washing with the same buffer, the bound material was eluted with the same HEPES buffer containing 300 mm KCl, 15 mm EDTA. The eluted material was concentrated by centrifugation in an Ultrafree-MC 10,000 filter unit (Millipore). Bovine liver C5-epimerase was extracted and purified to homogeneity as described (16Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide sequences were determined as described (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U.

Purified enzyme preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with silver and documented. Epimerase assay was based on the release of 3H (recovered as3H2O) from a C5-3H-labeled polysaccharide substrate, as described (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For determination of enzyme activity, tissues were freshly dissected from a (A/Sn × Leaden) F1 mouse that had been inoculated previously with Furth mastocytoma cells in a hind leg (18Furth J. Hagen P. Hirsch E.I. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1957; 95: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The tissues were immediately homogenized in 10 volumes of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm KCl, 15 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (16Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were shaken at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged. The supernatants were collected and assayed for enzyme activity (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and for total protein (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Controls were performed to ascertain that all determinations of epimerase activity in tissue extracts fell within the linear range of the assay. Enzymatic conversion of GlcUA to IdoUA units was directly demonstrated using purified recombinant mouse C5-epimerase (∼50 ng of protein in 100 μl of incubation mixture) and a metabolically [1-3H]glucose-labeled [4GlcUAβ1–4GlcNSO3α1-]n polysaccharide substrate, as described (11Li J.-P.

Briefly, the partially epimerized polysaccharide was subjected to deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid (pH 1.5 reaction) followed by reduction, and the resultant labeled GlcUA-aManR (glucuronyl-2,5-anhydromannitol) and IdoUA-aManR (iduronyl-2,5-anhydromannitol) disaccharides were separated by paper chromatography and quantified by scintillation counting. Mastocytoma cells established from the Furth tumor (15Jacobsson K.-G. Riesenfeld J. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12154-12159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS. To label the cells, 50 μCi of Na35SO4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added per ml of culture medium. After incubation for 24 h, the medium was collected, and the cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m KCl and 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged. The supernatant and medium were pooled and treated with 0.5 m NaOH at 4 °C overnight and subsequently neutralized. The sample, containing released GAG chains, was diluted and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (4 ml) equilibrated in 0.05m NaAc, pH 4.0, containing 0.05 m NaCl. Labeled GAGs were eluted with a gradient of 0.05–1.5 m NaCl in the same buffer. The fractions containing labeled GAGs were pooled and concentrated. Analytical chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel was performed using the same buffer and salt gradient but in a high pressure liquid chromatography system. Treatments of GAGs with chondroitinase ABC (20Lindahl B. Eriksson L. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (21Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) were carried out as described. Unlabeled heparin and chondroitin sulfate standards were detected by the carbazole reaction for hexuronic acid (22Bitter T. Muir H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Screening a genomic library from mouse liver with the previously described32P-labeled bovine epimerase cDNA (11Li J.-P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as a probe yielded five positive clones that were purified and further characterized. The two largest clones, 5a and 64, were 16–18 kb in size, whereas the remaining three ranged 8–12 kb. All clones showed sequence overlap with at least three of the other clones (Fig.1 A). Digestion of clone 5a with EcoRI released seven fragments that were subsequently cloned into pUC119. Clone 64 was cleaved with SacI, and the resultant 3 major fragments were cloned into BlueScript. Analysis of exon-intron organization revealed that the C5-epimerase is encoded by only 3 exons, of which the largest one (exon 3) encodes more than 50% of the protein (Fig. 1 B). The genomic sequences defining the exon/intron boundaries (splice sites) follow the gt/ag consensus rule (Table I). The precise match between the open reading frame (ORF) sequence in the exons and the cDNA (data not shown) suggests that the identified genomic clone represents the functional gene for the C5-epimerase.Table IIntron-exon boundary sequences of the mouse C5-epimerase geneExon no.5′-Splice acceptor and 5′-end sequenceExon size3′-End sequence and 3′-splice donorIntron sizebpbp1>586GTTGAAGgtaggt>15002ttatagGTGTGCCA246TGCTCCAGgtgagt>70003ccacagAAACCAGT>1025 Open table in a new tab In order to address whether the C5-epimerase is encoded by a single gene in the mouse genome, we performed Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA that had been digested with restriction enzymes as indicated in Fig.2. The probe used was an intron fragment (indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 1 A) generated from clone 5a by digestion with EcoRI. This ∼800-bp probe detected a single band of the same size in the sample cleaved withEcoRI and single bands of the expected sizes (estimated based on restriction enzyme mapping) upon cleavage withHindIII (∼3.5 kb), NcoI (∼5 kb),SacI (∼6.5 kb), and PstI (∼8 kb). By using the full-length mouse epimerase cDNA as probe, a single chromosomal locus was detected by FISH mapping in both mouse and human chromosomes. The FISH detection efficiency with this probe was 85% on mouse chromosomes and 63% on human chromosomes. The mouse epimerase is localized to chromosome number 9 (Fig.3 A) and the human epimerase to chromosome number 15 (Fig. 3 B), in accordance with the homology relationship between human and mouse genomes. The loci were further defined based on the combined information from 10 photos each. The epimerase probe thus was mapped to mouse chromosome 9, region C and D (Fig. 3 C), and to human chromosome 15, region q23-q24 (Fig. 3 D). These findings along with the Southern analysis indicate that the C5-epimerase is encoded by a single gene. Northern analysis of a mouse multiple tissue Northern mRNA blot by hybridization with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the C-terminal region of bovine C5-epimerase revealed a single transcript of ∼5 kb in all tissues examined. The highest expression level was seen in liver, whereas small amounts of transcript were seen in spleen (Fig.4 A). Yet epimerase activity in spleen was similar to that in kidney or lung (Fig. 4 B). Although we have no explanation to this discrepancy, we note that two other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HS,N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase 1 and 2-O-sulfotransferase, showed similar low levels of mRNA expression in spleen (23Kusche-Gullberg M.

(2001) Biochemistry, in press.Google Scholar). Mouse mastocytoma showed high epimerase activity (Fig. 4 B) and contained the same ∼5-kb epimerase transcript (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as the other murine tissues. Previous studies in our laboratory led to the isolation of a highly active ∼52-kDa epimerase from bovine liver (16Campbell P. Hannesson H.H. Sandbäck D. Rodén L. Lindahl U. Li J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the subsequent cloning of a bovine lung cDNA (11Li J.-P. Hagner-McWhirter Å. Kjellén L. Palgi J. Jalkanen M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28158-28163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This cDNA encoded a protein consisting of 444 amino acid residues. N-terminal analysis of the purified liver enzyme showed that it lacked 73 amino acid residues predicted from the cDNA and thus represented a truncated form. Yet the recombinant protein, expressed in insect cells, had a catalytic activity much lower than that of the purified liver enzyme. Although this discrepancy could have several reasons, we noted that also the cloned protein could be incomplete, since the 5′-end of the cDNA open reading frame was not defined with certainty. With the gene structure for the epimerase at hand it became possible to reassess this question, by renewed cDNA isolation based on the genomic sequence information. Appropriate oligonucleotide primers were therefore designed based on the genomic sequences, as described under “Experimental Procedures”, and used for PCR amplification using mouse liver cDNA as template. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR product revealed one strong band of ∼2 kb in size,"

It has been shown that about 75% of all CFTR protein and close to 100% of the [ΔPhe508] CFTR variant are rapidly degraded before leaving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). B cell antigen receptor-associated proteins (BAPs) are ubiquitously expressed integral membrane proteins that may control association with the cytoskeleton, vesicular transport, or retrograde transport from thecis Golgi to the ER. The present study delivers evidence for cytosolic co-localization of both BAP31 and CFTR and for the control of expression of recombinant CFTR in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Xenopus oocytes by BAP31. Antisense inhibition of BAP31 in various cell types increased expression of both wild-type CFTR and [ΔPhe508]CFTR and enabled cAMP-activated Cl− currents in [ΔPhe508]CFTR-expressing CHO cells. Coexpression of CFTR together with BAP31 attenuated cAMP-activated Cl−currents in Xenopus oocytes. These data therefore suggest association of BAP31 with CFTR that may control maturation or trafficking of CFTR and thus expression in the plasma membrane.

Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 137: 1-70PubMed Google Scholar). Cl− transport and regulation of ion channels is defective in cystic fibrosis (CF), because of more than 900 different CFTR mutations. The most common mutation, [ΔPhe508]CFTR, leads to a defect in maturation and processing of the CFTR protein and thus does not allow for expression of sufficient amounts of CFTR in plasma membranes of epithelial cells and non-epithelial cells that express recombinant CFTR (2Mall M.

Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). It has been shown that because of incomplete folding, [ΔPhe508]CFTR is not capable of leaving the ER and thus is not processed to a more mature and glycosylated form. Therefore, it does not become protease-resistant, is retained in the ER, and will not undergo complex glycosylation (4Lukacs G.L. Abdalla M. Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It is therefore detected as a band of lower molecular weight when analyzed on an SDS gel (5Morris A.P. Cunningham S.A. Benos D.J. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C688-C694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jiang X. Hill W.G. Pilewski J.M. Weisz O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L913-L920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteolytic systems, including proteasomes, contribute to degradation of wild-type CFTR (wtCFTR) and [ΔPhe508]CFTR (3Jensen T.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The enzymes and compartments responsible for degradation of CFTR are part of the ER quality control system of secretory proteins (8Sommer T. Wolf D.H.

Small amounts of [ΔPhe508]CFTR that escape proteolysis is trafficked to the cell membrane, where it functions as cAMP-regulated Cl− channel (12Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Reyes E. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B.

This is usually 1% or less of the amount of wtCFTR present in the native tissue and is probably higher in Xenopus oocytes (2Mall M. Wissner A. Seydewitz H.H. Kühr J. Brandis M. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G617-G624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Mall M. Hipper A. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins have been identified which bind to B cell antigen receptors (BCR) (15Kim K.-M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Terashima M. Lamers M.C. Köhler G. Reth M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These BCR-associated proteins (BAPs) were identified initially in mouse B cells and have been shown to be expressed ubiquitously in various types of cells, including CHO cells (16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). BAP31 and other members of this family of proteins are present in the ER where they exist as integral membrane proteins associated with membrane immunoglobulin D in B cells (15Kim K.-M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Terashima M. Lamers M.C. Köhler G. Reth M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that BAP31 and related proteins play a role in vesicular transport and control anterograde transport of certain membrane proteins such as cellubrevin (16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Annaert W.G. Becker B. Kistner U. Reth M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We therefore examined in the present study whether BAP31 also affects expression of CFTR. We were particularly interested to see whether expression of [ΔPhe508]CFTR can be influenced by manipulation of the expression of BAP31. The data presented here demonstrate that BAP31 inhibits both expression of wtCFTR as well as [ΔPhe508]CFTR and suggest that BAP31 is participating in formation of the quality control system. CHO cells expressing either wtCFTR or [ΔPhe508]CFTR (kindly provided by Dr. X.-B. Chang and Prof. J. Riordan, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Scottsdale, AZ) were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 50 μmol/liter methotrexate, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Germany) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 (18Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Hanrahan J.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 151: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o−) and mouse epithelial-collecting duct cells (M1) were cultured as described previously (19Kunzelmann K. Koslowsky T. Gruenert D.C. Greger R.

About 5 × 106 CHO cells expressing [ΔPhe508]CFTR were electroporated in the presence of 12 nmol/liter (40 μg/ml) of a plasmid encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-c1;CLONTECH, Germany) and about 0.5 μmol/liter (3.5 μg/ml) phosphorothioated (stabilized) oligonucleotides antisense to the first 20 bases of the BAP31 coding sequence. Control cells were transfected with EGFP and missense oligonucleotides only. Cells were electroporated (Bio-Rad) at 400 V/500 μF and subsequently kept on ice for 10 min. Following, cells were resuspended in culture medium and plated on culture dishes. Alternatively, cells were transfected using 1 μmol/liter antisense DNA and the transfection reagent DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in sample buffer containing 10% SDS and 100 mmol/liter dithiothreitol. Protein concentration was determined according to a modified Laury method, and the lysates containing 20 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (21Chang X.-B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.-X. Jensen T.J. Kartner N. Alon N. Hanrahan J.W. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by 7% (CFTR) and 12% (BAP31) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (22Kartner N.

Using the different protocols, antisense transfection and Western blot analysis were performed three to seven times for each cell line. A mouse monoclonal antibody (M3A7) was used for detection of CFTR (kindly provided by Prof. Dr. J. Riordan, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale) (23Kartner N. Augustinas T. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R.

The goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-DTAF and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-Texas Red secondary antibody conjugates were from Jackson Laboratories. CHO cells grown on 35-mm culture dishes were analyzed for forskolin (10 μmol/liter) activated 36Cl− efflux. Electroporated CHO cells were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes and were allowed to grow to subconfluence for 72 h. After rinsing the culture dishes with efflux buffer (all mmol/liter) 140 NaCl, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.83 K2HPO4, 1 CaSO4, 1 MgSO4, 5 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, 37 °C) fresh efflux buffer (1 ml) containing 2 μCi/ml36Cl− was added to each dish. Cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and then washed three times for 10 s with efflux buffer. 1 ml of efflux buffer was applied, removed in 1-min intervals, and replaced by fresh buffer. At 3 min, forskolin (10 μmol/liter) was added to the buffer. Cells were extracted overnight at 4 °C, remaining36Cl− was determined, and samples were counted in scintillation mixture. The percent efflux/min was calculated according to Ref. 24Kunzelmann K. Schwiebert E.M. Kuo W.-L. Stanton B.A. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

The bath was continuously perfused with Ringer solution at a rate of about 20 ml/min. EGFP fluorescence was observed at 480-nm excitation and 520-nm emission using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Only cells demonstrating EGFP fluorescence were used for patch clamp analysis. During the experiments, 115 mmol/liter Cl− was replaced by equimolar concentrations of the impermeable anion gluconate (30Cl−). Patch clamp analysis was performed in the fast whole cell configuration according to (25Köttgen M. Busch A.E. Hug M.J. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. Pflügers Arch. 1996; 431: 499-555Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The patch pipettes had an input resistance of 2–4 megohms and were filled with a solution containing (mmol/liter) KCl 30, potassium gluconate 95, NaH2PO4 1.2, Na2HPO44.8, EGTA 1, CaCl2 0.726, MgCl2 1.034,d-glucose 5, ATP 1. The pH was adjusted to 7.2, the Ca2+ activity of this solution was 0.1 μmol/liter. The access conductance was measured continuously and was between 30 and 120 nanosiemens. Currents (voltage clamp) and voltages (current clamp) were recorded using a patch clamp amplifier (List Medical Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany) and were displayed continuously on a pen recorder (Gould Instruments). In regular intervals, membrane voltages (Vc) were clamped in steps of 10 mV to ± 40 mV. Gm was calculated according to Ohm's law from the measured I and Vc values (25Köttgen M. Busch A.E. Hug M.J.

CFTR Cl−currents were activated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; 100 μm) and forskolin (10 μm) (Sigma). CHO cells were grown on coverslips, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% azide and were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell were permeabilized with blocking buffer containing 1% fetal calf serum, 0.01% azide and 0.03% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. Cells were incubated with antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing with blocking buffer. After incubation with secondary antibodies, cells were washed three times in blocking buffer, air dried, and mounted in 10 μl of Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Inc.) on a microscope slide. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted using a LEIKA TCS confocal laser scanning microscope (Leitz, Germany). To generate the cDNA encoding BAP31 missing the C-terminal KKXX motif (BAP31-KKXX), the BAP31-containing plasmid was digested withSmaI/BsaAI and re-ligated. The resulting cDNA was missing the last 26 nucleotides encoding the C-terminal 8 amino acids. cDNA sequences encoding wtCFTR, [ΔF508]CFTR, BAP31, BAP31-KKXX, BAP29, and E3/19k were subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene). For in vitro transcription using either T7 or T3 promoters, plasmids were linearized withKpnI, BamHI, SalI, andNotI, respectively. In vitro transcription was performed using T7 and T3 polymerase, respectively, and a cap analog (mCAP RNA capping kit, Stratagene). Oocytes were obtained from adult X. laevisfrogs, defolliculated by 1-h treatment with collagenase (type A, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subsequently injected with 10–30 ng of RNA encoding the individual proteins. Recordings were taken 2–3 days after injection. During two electrode voltage clamp recordings, i/v curves were obtained every 20 s by voltage clamping the oocyte from −80 to +40 mV in steps of 20 mV. Conductances were calculated according to Ohm's law. Oocytes were continuously perfused with amphibian Ringer containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm Ca2+, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm Mg2+ at pH 7.55. CFTR Cl−currents were activated by IBMX (1 mm) and forskolin (10 μm). All used compounds were of highest available grade of purity. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). IBMX and forskolin were from Sigma. The data are shown as original recordings or as mean values ± S.E.; n refers to the number of experiments. Statistical analysis was performed according to paired or unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 were accepted to indicate statistical significance (*). [ΔPhe508]CFTR does not mature properly and is therefore excluded from the glycosylation pathway. Thus, [ΔPhe508]CFTR appears as a lower molecular weight band on an SDS gel when compared with wtCFTR. We analyzed expression of wtCFTR and [ΔPhe508]CFTR in CHO cells lines stably transfected with either wtCFTR or [ΔPhe508]CFTR (4Lukacs G.L. Abdalla M. Kartner N. Riordan J.R. Grinstein S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6076-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Mature and fully glycosylated CFTR of molecular weight of about 180 kDa is detected in wtCFTR-expressing cells whereas [ΔPhe508]CFTR appears as a immature precursor of a lower molecular weight of about 150 kDa (Fig.1 A). CHO cells do also show expression of BAP31 as indicated by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A). Both wtCFTR- and [ΔPhe508]CFTR-expressing cells were transfected with BAP31 antisense oligonucleotides (+ AS), which largely reduced expression of BAP31 when compared with control cells (−AS). Parallel to the reduced expression of BAP31, we detected an increase in both expression of wtCFTR as well as [ΔPhe508]CFTR, suggesting that expression of CFTR is controlled by BAP31. Experiments were carried out at least in triplicates but generally 5–7 times. Expression of BAP31 was also detected in various cultured cell types from pancreas (CFPAC), collecting duct (M1), colon (HT29 and T84) and airways (CFDE, 16HBE14o−, 9HTE), although levels of BAP31 expression varied significantly between the different cell lines. In all theses cell lines, CFTR is expressed endogenously (data not shown). In mouse collecting duct cells (M1) and human bronchial epithelial cell lines (16HBE14o−; HBE), expression of BAP31 was blocked by antisense treatment. Reduced expression of BAP31 was paralleled by enhanced expression of CFTR (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that BAP31 also controls expression of endogenous CFTR in airways and collecting duct of the kidney. Because Western blot analysis suggested that BAP31 is involved in the control of synthesis and maturation of CFTR, we performed immunofluorescence stain of both CFTR and BAP31 (Fig.2). The cells showed a pronounced staining for BAP31 (Texas red fluorescence) and were also significantly stained for wtCFTR (DTAF green fluorescence). The overlay (yellow fluorescence) of both pictures shows co-staining of the two proteins except for areas close to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). These data suggest that both CFTR and BAP31 are colocalized in the ER of CHO cells and thus support the idea of BAP31 controlling maturation or trafficking of CFTR. To examine whether BAP31 also affects functional expression of CFTR, we analyzed cells transfected with BAP31 antisense as well as control cells in a36Cl− efflux assay. To that end, electroporated CHO cells were grown on 35 mm-culture dishes and loaded with 36Cl−. Subsequently,36Cl− efflux was measured in the absence or presence of forskolin (10 μmol/liter). As shown in Fig.3, 36Cl− efflux was continuously declining in the absence of forskolin (dashed lines). In wtCFTR-expressing CHO cells, stimulation with forskolin largely enhanced 36Cl− efflux, indicating activation of a CFTR Cl− conductance, whereas no36Cl− efflux was activated in [ΔPhe508]CFTR-expressing CHO cells. However, in BAP31 antisense-treated cells expressing [ΔPhe508]CFTR, forskolin was able to induce a small but significant36Cl− efflux, and36Cl− efflux in wtCFTR-expressing cells was augmented (solid lines, filled circles). These data suggest that blocking of BAP31 expression enhances CFTR expression and leads to a residual Cl− channel activity in [ΔPhe508]CFTR-expressing CHO cells. We further cotransfected wtCFTR or [ΔPhe508]CFTR-expressing CHO cells with a 40-fold molar excess of BAP31 antisense oligonucleotides and the expression plasmid for green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-C1). Control cells were transfected with pEGFP-c1 only. EGFP fluorescence was monitored during subsequent patch clamp experiments and was used as an indicator for successful transfection. Only fluorescent-labeled cells were used for patch clamp experiments. Activation of wtCFTR was studied initially in wtCFTR-expressing cells. Upon stimulation with IBMX (100 μmol/liter) and forskolin (10 μmol/liter), a large whole cell conductance was activated and the cell membrane voltage (Vm) was depolarized (Fig.4, A and B,upper traces). Partial replacement of extracellular Cl− by impermeable gluconate (30Cl−) partially blocked the activated whole cell conductance and further depolarized Vm, indicating activation of a whole cell Cl−conductance. In the absence of BAP31 antisense, [ΔPhe508]CFTR-expressing cells did not show a response to any of the above maneuvers (Fig. 4, A and B, middle trace). However, in BAP31 antisense-incubated cells, forskolin and IBMX were able to activate a residual Cl− conductance as indicated by changes in whole cell conductance and Vm (Fig. 4,A and B, lower trace). Fig.5 summarizes the effects of IBMX and forskolin and 30Cl− on whole cell conductances and membrane voltages and clearly indicates a significant cAMP-activated whole cell Cl− conductance in CHO cells expressing [ΔF508]CFTR after blocking expression of BAP31.Figure 5Summary of the patch clamp experiments shown in Fig. 4.

Fig.6 A shows whole cell recordings obtained from oocytes expressing only wtCFTR or coexpressing wtCFTR together with BAP31. The corresponding I/V curves are shown in Fig.6 B. The tracings, I/V curves, and the summary (Fig.6 C) of this series of experiments clearly show that coexpression of BAP31 attenuates significantly the activation of a CFTR Cl− conductance in Xenopus oocytes. Injection of a non-translated missense-cRNA did not affect CFTR currents, suggesting that decrease in CFTR is caused by expression of BAP31 rather than nonspecific effects because of additional cRNA injection (data not shown). To further elucidate the impact of BAP expression on CFTR Cl− conductance, we coexpressed a BAP31 variant lacking the last C-terminal 24 nucleotides. This truncated BAP31 version lacks the C-terminal KKEE amino acid motif, which is known as an ER retrieval sequence (consensus sequence KKXX) and which may also have a function as a transport or internalization signal (26Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 27Itin C. Kappeler F. Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ability to inhibit CFTR expression in Xenopus oocytes seems to rely on the presence of the KKXX motif, because BAP31-KKXX was unable to decrease cAMP-activated CFTR Cl− conductance (Fig. 7). Transfection with BAP31 carrying the KKXX may cause an ER overload and may thus cause stress to the cells (28Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To exclude artificial effects on CFTR Cl− conductance caused by possible ER stress, we coexpressed CFTR together with the adenovirus protein E3/19K. E3/19K has been demonstrated to accumulate in ER membranes and to cause cells stress, thereby activating the transcription factor NFκB (28Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, ER stress does not seem the cause for reduced CFTR expression in Xenopus oocytes, because E3/19K exerted no inhibitory effects on CFTR Cl−conductance (Fig. 7). Finally, BAP29, a protein homologous to BAP31 was coexpressed together with CFTR and slightly but not significantly attenuated activation of CFTR upon increase in intracellular cAMP. When coexpressed together with BAP31, heterodimerization of BAP29 and BAP31 is likely to occur (16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The putative BAP31/BAP29 heterodimer was also able to inhibit expression of CFTR Cl− conductance, as shown in Fig. 7. Taken together, these data strongly suggest regulation of CFTR expression by BAP31, which might be part of the quality control system. The present data suggest that the putative integral membrane protein BAP31 interferes with expression of CFTR in heterologous expression systems. BAP31 was identified initially in the murine myeloma cell line J558L and was shown later to be expressed in various cell types (15Kim K.-M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Terashima M. Lamers M.C. Köhler G. Reth M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the present study, we detected expression of BAP31 in CHO cells and also in various types of human epithelial cells lines derived from colon, pancreas, kidney collecting duct, and airways (data not shown). Both BAP29 and BAP31 contain three stretches of hydrophobic amino acids, suggesting that these proteins are multiple spanning transmembrane proteins (16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When BAP31 expression was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides in CHO cells, expression of both wtCFTR or [ΔPhe508]CFTR seemed to be enhanced. The amount of mature wtCFTR protein was enhanced when expression of BAP31 was inhibited in CHO cells, expressing exogenous wtCFTR. Our data show that this effect is not limited to cells overexpressing CFTR. In airway epithelial and collecting duct cells, inhibition of BAP31 expression induced enhanced expression of endogenous CFTR. Expression of mature [ΔPhe508]CFTR in CHO cells after BAP31-antisense treatment was not detected by Western blotting. However, the immature form of the protein was more abundant in cells treated with BAP31-antisense. Moreover, functional assays clearly suggest expression of [ΔPhe508]CFTR protein in the plasma membranes of antisense-treated cells. Thus, mutant CFTR protein may be located in plasma membranes in either an immature unglycosylated form or the small amounts of mature [ΔPhe508]CFTR protein cannot be detected by standard Western blotting. Even longer exposures of the x-ray films did not show a CFTR protein band of high molecular weight. However, it is well known from previous studies that only small amounts of CFTR are required for functional expression in epithelial cells (12Li C. Ramjeesingh M. Reyes E. Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Rommens J.A. Bear C.E. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Cozens A.L. Yezzi M.J. Kunzelmann K. Ohrui T. Chin L. Eng K. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Gruenert D.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The experiments performed in Xenopus oocytes supply further evidence for the impact of BAP31 on processing and expression of CFTR. Interestingly, coexpression of both BAP29 and BAP31 was even more efficient in inhibiting CFTR expression, compared with the effects of solely expression of BAP31. Thus, CFTR may interact with BAP31 homodimers or heterodimers of BAP31 and BAP29, which have been reported previously (16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The present data further stress the importance of the KKXX motif at the C-terminal end of BAP31, because no inhibition of CFTR conductance was observed in the absence of this motif. The KKXX motif is an ER retention signal for residual proteins of the ER, which cycle between ER and the Golgi (16Adachi T. Schamel W.A. Kim K.-M. Watanabe T. Becker B. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Annaert W.G. Becker B. Kistner U. Reth M. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1397-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated to function as a transport signal (30Townsley F.M. Pelham H.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 211-216PubMed Google Scholar). KKXX-carrying proteins bind to COP proteins and are involved in the retrograde transport from the cis Golgi to the ER (31Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 32Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11649-11654Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, the KKXX motif may also serve as an internalization and endocytosis signal (27Itin C. Kappeler F. Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2250-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The KKXX motif seems to be crucial for the inhibitory effects of BAP31 on CFTR. As mentioned above, the KKXX represents an ER retrieval signal and thus ER overload by overexpressing BAP31 may lead to cell stress, activation of NFκB, and eventually cell death by apoptosis (28Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 33Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In fact, BAP31 probably takes part in the control of programmed cell death (34Ng F.W. Nguyen M. Kwan T. Branton P.E. Nicholson D.W. Cromlish J.A. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 35Ng F.W. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3140-3143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although we cannot completely rule out a possible nonspecific effect of BAP31 on CFTR expression, we were able to show that expression of the protein E3/19k that binds very tightly to the ER and induces ER overload (28Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) does not interfere with expression of CFTR in Xenopus oocytes. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that virus maturation in the ER is controlled by an KKXX ER retrieval signal and that viruses lacking the envelope glycoprotein encoding the KKXXmotif have a higher chance for budding at the plasma membrane (36Goepfert P.A. Shaw K. Wang G. Bansal A. Edwards B.H. Mulligan M.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7210-7217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results suggest that trafficking or maturation of a variety of transmembrane proteins might be controlled by BAP31, including CFTR. However, it is unlikely that BAP31 affects expression of all membrane proteins, because we did not detect an increased expression for the α-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase in BAP31-AS treated HBE or M1 cells (data not shown). One function of BAP31 could be that it participates in formation of the quality control mechanism of membrane protein synthesis, which was postulated for CFTR (37Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). It is now well known that biosynthesis of CFTR is strictly controlled by this mechanism, resulting in degradation of most of the wtCFTR and basically all of [ΔPhe508]CFTR (3Jensen T.J. Loo M.A. Pind S. Williams D.B. Goldberg A.L. Riordan J.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Because [ΔPhe508]CFTR is by far the most frequent mutation causing cystic fibrosis, interfering with the expression or function of BAP31 in epithelial cells could be a new way to circumvent the Cl− channel defect in cystic fibrosis.

EhADH2 and other members of the family appear to be composed of separate C-terminal ADH and N-terminal ALDH domains linked together to create a fusion enzyme (8Goodlove P.E. Cunningham P.R. Parker J. Clark D.P. Gene. 1989; 85: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The EhADH2 enzyme utilizes NAD and Fe2+ as co-factors and does not demonstrate homology with the zinc-dependent ADH enzymes (13Danielsson O. Atrian S. Luque T. Hjelmqvist L. Gonzàlez-Duarte R.

Regions of EhADH2 that could be involved in iron binding and NAD binding have been identified, but a requirement for specific residues in enzymatic activity has not been demonstrated (2Yang W. Li E.

The prototype member of the family is the Escherichia coli ADHE enzyme, which is required for the anaerobic growth of E. coli (8Goodlove P.E. Cunningham P.R. Parker J. Clark D.P. Gene. 1989; 85: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Both the ADHE enzyme and the native EhADH2 enzyme form protomers that assemble into large helical structures called spirosomes, which are visible by electron microscopy (5Bruchhaus I. Tannich E.

Episomal expression of the amebic EhADH2 gene inE. coli can complement an ADHE mutation, providing a system for rapid evaluation of the activity of EhADH2 mutants and for testing inhibitors of EhADH2 (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here, we describe studies designed to better understand the structure and function of the EhADH2 enzyme. We have used the constitutive and inducible episomal expression of antisense RNA to EhADH2 in amebae specifically to inhibit EhADH2 expression and assess whether EhADH2 is required for amebic growth and survival. We have analyzed whether EhADH2 is functionally a fusion enzyme with autonomous ADH and ALDH domains by expressing truncated proteins corresponding to the putative ADH and ALDH regions of EhADH2. Finally, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses to identify residues of EhADH2 that are required for both ADH and ALDH activity and a region of the enzyme that may play a role in EhADH2 dimerization and polymerization. Strains DH5α, BL21 (DE3), and SHH31 (ΔadhE fadR met tyrT) were used for expression of recombinant proteins (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in LB broth medium with agitation at 37 °C, and 1.5% Bacto agar (Difco, Sparks, MD) was added for solid media. For anaerobic growth, the transformed strains were grown on solid (1.5% Bacto agar, Difco) or liquid M9 media in anaerobic jars (BBL GasPak™ system, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD) with anaerobic system envelopes (BBL GasPak Plus) (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Indicator strips were used to confirm anaerobic conditions. To construct the antisense insert for EhADH2, a PCR product was generated from nucleotides −50 to +1312 of the EhADH2 gene in the antisense orientation using oligonucleotide primers 5′-AATTGCGGCCGCCTAACCCGTTTTTGGATCAG (forward primer) and 5′-ATAGATCTCCTCCATATGATCCACATCCAAG incorporatingNotI and BglII restriction sites, respectively. This fragment was then inserted into plasmid pSA8 (17Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) replacing the antisense ehcp5 insert to create pZZ1. 1 × 107 E. histolytica HM1:1MSS trophozoites in log phase growth were transfected with 100 ng of plasmid pZZ1, pSA8 (antisense construct against E. histolytica cysteine proteinase 5), or the parent pNeo-Act plasmid without an insert (17Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Selection was performed by adding 10 μg/ml G418 to TYI-S33 media beginning 48 h after transfection and gradually increasing G418 concentration to 50 μg/ml over 2 weeks' time. The EhADH2 antisense RNA under an inducible expression system was generated by PCR from −50 to +1312 of the EhADH2 sequence as template and synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAGGATCCTAACCCGTTTTTGGATCAG (forward primer) and 5′-GAGGTACCTCCATATGATCCACATCCAAG incorporating BamHI and KpnI restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was ligated into pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT (graciously provided by Egbert Tannich, Bernhard Nocht Institute, Hamburg, Germany) (18Hamann L. Buss H. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using theKpnI and BamHI restriction sites to obtain plasmid pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2 (Fig. 2). 1 × 107 E. histolytica trophozoites were transfected with 100 ng of plasmid pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2 or pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT as described previously (18Hamann L. Buss H. Tannich E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hygromycin selection (10 μg/ml) was initiated 48 h after transfection. To assay E. histolytica trophozoite growth during expression of the antisense RNA to EhADH2, starting cultures of 5 × 103 trophozoite transfected with pZZ1, pSA8, or pNeo-Act were grown under 50 μg/ml G418 selection and counted at 48 and 72 h. Results were averaged from three replicate tubes and three separate experiments. For studies of the inducible expression of the EhADH2 antisense RNA, separate cultures of 5 × 103 E. histolytica pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2 (anti-EhADH2) or pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT (p-CAT) transfected trophozoites were grown for 48 h and treated with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. After tetracycline induction, cultures were grown for 48 h. E. histolyticatrophozoites were harvested by chilling culture tubes on ice for 10 min and centrifuging them at 430 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of BYI-S-33 medium and the trophozoites counted with a hemocytometer. EhADH2 expression inE. histolytica trophozoites transfected with pZZ, pSA8, pNeo-Act, pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2, or pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT was assessed by immunoblotting using a 1:10000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised to a recombinant 6His-EhADH2 fusion protein on SDS-PAGE-separated lysates obtained from 1 × 106 trophozoites (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Scanning densitometry of autoradiographs was performed using a DuoScan scanner from Agfa (Ridgeway Park, NJ). Approximately 1 × 108 ameba trophozoites from each of the transfectants described above (pZZ, pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2, pSA8, and pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT), grown under conditions to maximize antisense RNA expression, were harvested by chilling on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 430 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer B (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 2 μm leupeptin, 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, and 5 mmE-64), freeze-thawed five times in ethanol/CO2, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was kept on ice and the activity assays performed immediately. Protein concentrations were calculated using the Bradford method. ADH activity of the amebic lysates (or bacterial lysates from subsequent experiments) was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm following the oxidation of NADH to NAD. The standard assay was performed in the presence of 6 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mmFe (NH4)2(SO4)2, 0.2 mm NADH, 0.5 mm acetaldehyde, and 0.1 Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5 (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ALDH activity was performed in the same buffer, replacing the acetaldehyde with 0.2 mmacetyl-CoA. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as that which consumes 1 μmol of NADH or NAD+/min. Values are expressed as the means of at least three independent experiments. For the determination of Km values for the EhADH2 and EhADH2-(417–870) proteins, 5 μg of purified recombinant protein was used in each assay. Km determinations for alcohol substrates with EhADH2 and EhADH2-(417–870) were made with the spectrophotometric assay in the reverse reaction, using 1 mm NAD+ rather than NADH as previously described (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Km values were calculated using Lineweaver-Burk plots. The T7 promoter-based vector pET23a (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used for E. coli expression of recombinant proteins comprising the N-terminal domain (EhADH2-(1–532)) and the C-terminal domain (EhADH2-(417–870)) of EhADH2 (Fig.1). Nucleotides encoding EhADH2-(1–532) were obtained by PCR from the pET3a/EhADH2 construct (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The sequences flanking the nucleotides encoding EhADH2-(1–532) were modified by the incorporation of a stop codon and a BamHI site at position 1598 of the EhADH2 DNA sequence. The fragment containing EhADH2-(1–532) was then ligated into a NdeI- andBamHI-digested pet23a vector to generate plasmid pEhADH2-(1–532). Nucleotides encoding EhADH2-(417–870) were also obtained by PCR from the pET3a/EhADH2 construct. The sequences flanking regions encoding EhADH2-(417–870) were modified by the incorporation of a BamHI site next to the termination codon TAA at position 2612 at the 3′ end of EhADH2 and a NheI site with an initiating codon at position 1251 of the EhADH2 DNA sequence (2Yang W. Li E. Kairong T. Stanley Jr., S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The fragment containing EhADH2-(417–870) was then ligated intoNheI- and BamHI-digested pET23a vector creating plasmid pEhADH2-(417–870). The recombinant pET3a/EhADH2 vector was used to generate site-directed and deletion mutants using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In separate constructs, the histidines at position 88, 730, 734, or 744 of recombinant EhADH2 were replaced by arginine, and the histidine at position 754 was replaced by arginine or glutamine, generating mutants EhADH2(H88R), EhADH2(H730R), EhADH2(H734R), EhADH2(H744R), EhADH2(H754R), and EhADH2(H754Q). All changes were confirmed by sequence analysis of each plasmid. These replacements are marked in Fig. 1. To generate a C-terminal deletion, the hydrophobic stretch of 17 amino acids at the end of EhADH2 was deleted using a modified PCR reaction (19Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying the N- and C-terminal domains of EhADH2 and plasmids carrying mutant EhADH2 were expressed separately in BL21 (DE3) by standard procedures. For each strain, a single colony was grown overnight in 1-liter cultures under aerobic conditions. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5). Samples were disrupted by sonication and sedimented by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.22-micron pore unit, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Each sample (5 μg) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE analysis to detect expression of the altered EhADH2 protein. Western blot analysis was performed using a 1:10,000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised to a recombinant 6His-EhADH2 fusion protein as described previously (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For functional studies, SHH31 (ΔadhE) was transformed separately with plasmids carrying the altered version of EhADH2. Expression of the mutant proteins by SHH31 (ΔadhE) under aerobic conditions was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. Bacterial lysates from each transformed strain were tested for ADH and ALDH activities as described above. To test for the ability of a mutant EhADH2 protein to complement SHH31 for anaerobic growth, individual colonies from the transformed strain were grown in 14 ml of M9 liquid or on M9 agar for 24, 48, and 72 h under anaerobic conditions (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Growth was measured spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 600 nm or by counting colonies on agar. The sequence encoding EhADH2(H754R) was inserted in plasmid pET29b, which contains a selectable marker for kanamycin resistance (Novagen). The pEhADH2 plasmid contains an ampicillin selection marker. Strain SHH31 (ΔadhE) was co-transformed by electroporation with 2 μg (each) of pEhADH2 (recombinant wild type) and pEhADH2(H754R). Isolated colonies were selected from clones grown in the presence of both kanamycin and ampicillin. Single colonies were grown overnight in 1 liter of LB broth medium under double antibiotic selection. Plasmids pEhADH2 (positive control), pEhADH2(H754R), pET3a, and pET29b (negative controls) were expressed separately. Bacterial lysates were obtained and tested for expression of recombinant EhADH2 proteins, anaerobic growth, and ADH/ALDH activities as described above. Retention of pEhADH2 within SHH31 was shown by reselection of the doubly transfected SHH31 with ampicillin alone, followed by assessment of growth under anaerobic conditions. Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma) was used to size engineered EhADH2 proteins. A single colony of each transformed strain was grown overnight under aerobic conditions. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer, disrupted by French press, and sedimented by centrifugation as described above. Filtered samples were separated over a Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5). Fractions were collected and measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Each protein was sized by comparison with molecular weight standards (Sigma). EhADH2 proteins in samples were identified by immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE separated fractions. For studies of spirosome formation by EhADH2 and its altered derivatives, 100 ng of protein from cell lysates were absorbed to a 200-mesh nickel Formvar- and carbon-coated grids, negatively stained with 0.05% uranyl acetate, and photographed using a Zeiss 902 electron microscope (15Matayoshi S. Oda H. Sarwar G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 525-529PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the role of EhADH2 enzymatic activity in the growth and survival of E. histolytica, we transformed amebae with the plasmid pZZ1, constitutively expressing an antisense EhADH2 transcript. Amebic lysates derived from pZZ1-transfected trophozoites had 30% of the ADH activity of lysates derived from equivalent numbers of wild type HM1:IMSS trophozoites or trophozoites transformed with plasmid pSA8 (which contains an antisense transcript to the E. histolytica cysteine proteinase 5 gene) (Table I) (17Ankri S. Stolarsky T. Mirelman D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Using immunoblotting with antiserum raised against EhADH2, we found that EhADH2 was present in lower amounts (83% reduction by scanning densitometry of the autoradiograph bands) in SDS-PAGE-separated lysates from pZZ1-transfected E. histolytica compared with lysates from pSA8-transfected E. histolytica (Fig.2). In contrast, expression of the serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) (measured by immunoblotting with anti-SREHP monoclonal antibody) did not differ between pZZ1 and wild type trophozoites (data not shown). To look at the effects of reduced EhADH2 synthesis, we measured the growth of pZZ1 transfected E. histolytica trophozoites by inoculating a culture tube with 5 × 103 E. histolyticatrophozoites and then counting viable trophozoites 48 and 72 h after inoculation. We used pSA8-transfected trophozoites as a control for both G418 selection and possible nonspecific effects of antisense expression on amebic growth. As shown in Fig.3 A, both sets of transgenicE. histolytica trophozoites under antibiotic selection with G418 have reduced growth compared with wild type trophozoites. However, amebic trophozoites transfected with the pZZ1 plasmid show significantly reduced growth compared with trophozoites transfected with pSA8.Table IConstitutive expression of an antisense RNA to EhADH2 significantly reduces NAD-dependent ADH and ALDH activities in E. histolytica trophozoitesPlasmidAntisense toADH activityALDH activitymilliunits/mgpSA8E. histolytica cysteine proteinase 5 gene (Ehcp5)185 ± 1578 ± 13pZZ1Ehadh256 ± 1123 ± 9Lysates were obtained from 106 amebae transfected with either pSA8 (expressing an antisense RNA for Ehcp5) or pZZ1 (expressing the antisense RNA for Ehadh2). Results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean from three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab Lysates were obtained from 106 amebae transfected with either pSA8 (expressing an antisense RNA for Ehcp5) or pZZ1 (expressing the antisense RNA for Ehadh2). Results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean from three separate experiments. We confirmed that the reduced growth seen in these trophozoites was caused by expression of the antisense EhADH2 RNA by inducing expression of the antisense RNA in log phase E. histolyticatrophozoites. The pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2 plasmid was used to transformE. histolytica HM1:IMSS trophozoites, while HM1:IMSS trophozoites transformed with the pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT construct served as controls. Transformants were selected for growth in 10 μg/ml hygromycin, and both sets of transformants showed similar growth curves under continuous hygromycin selection (data not shown). We then grew equivalent starting cultures of trophozoites carrying pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2 and trophozoites carrying pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT in the added presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline, and the number of trophozoites was counted at 24 and 48 h following the addition of tetracycline. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the addition of tetracycline caused a significant inhibition of the growth of pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2-transformed amebae at 48 h but did not alter the growth of pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT-transformed trophozoites. To establish that this difference in growth was due to inhibition of EhADH2 synthesis, we measured ADH and ALDH activity in the lysates of 106 pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2-transfected or pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT-transfected trophozoites that had been cultured for 48 h in the presence of tetracycline. There was a 70% reduction in ADH activity and a 66% reduction in ALDH activity in pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2-transfected trophozoites compared with pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT-transfected trophozoites at 48 h after tetracycline addition (Table II).Table IIInduced expression of an antisense RNA to EhADH2 significantly reduces NAD-dependent ADH and ALDH activities in E. histolytica trophozoitesPlasmidADH activitiesALDH activitiesTetracycline+−+−milliunits/mgpEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT210 ± 21203 ± 18113 ± 13117 ± 19pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH283 ± 12191 ± 2337 ± 8122 ± 22ADH and ALDH activities were measured in the lysates from 106amebae transfected with either the vector alone (pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT) or with the plasmid encoding the Ehadh2 antisense sequence (pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2). For values after tetracycline induction,E. histolytica trophozoites were isolated 48 h after growth in 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Open table in a new tab ADH and ALDH activities were measured in the lysates from 106amebae transfected with either the vector alone (pEhHYG-tetR-O-CAT) or with the plasmid encoding the Ehadh2 antisense sequence (pEhHYG-tetR-O-EhADH2). For values after tetracycline induction,E. histolytica trophozoites were isolated 48 h after growth in 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The C-terminal 400 amino acids of EhADH2 show significant homology with class III microbial ADH from organisms such as Clostridium acetobutylicum and Zymomonas mobilis (2Yang W. Li E. Kairong T. Stanley Jr., S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). If the EhADH2 enzyme is truly a fusion enzyme, with distinct ADH and ALDH enzymes linked to form a single peptide, then expression of the individual domains should produce separate functional ADH and ALDH enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we first expressed nucleotides 1251–2612 of EhADH2 in E. coli BL21 and SHH31 to generate a truncated protein containing the entire ADH domain (EhADH2-(417–870)). Expression of EhADH2-(417–870) was confirmed by immunoblotting using polyclonal antiserum to the full-length EhADH2 protein (data not shown). Assays of ADH activity onE. coli SHH31 lysates and on purified EhADH-(417–870) demonstrated that the truncated protein retained ADH activity similar in magnitude to that seen with the full-length EhADH2 enzyme (TableIII). EhADH2-(417–870) did not possess ALDH activity (Table III). The Km values for EhADH2-(417–870) and EhADH2 for the substrates ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetyl-CoA, propanol, and isopropanol were determined (TableIV). The Km values for EhADH2-(417–870) were lower than those obtained for EhADH2 for all substrates tested, and EhADH2-(417–870) was able to utilize isopropanol as a substrate. Gel filtration analysis revealed that EhADH2-(417–870) (predicted molecular mass, 49 kDa) migrated in a fraction consistent with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (Fig.4). Electron microscopic analysis of either the >2000-kDa fraction or the 200-kDa fraction did not reveal spirosome formation (data not shown). For comparison, the full-length EhADH2 enzyme (97.4 kDa) is found in the > 2000-kDa fraction (Fig. 4), where it forms spirosomes (Fig.5), or at 200 kDa consistent with dimer formation (Fig. 4) (16Yong T.-S. Li E. Clark D. Stanley Jr., S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6464-6469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).

In an initial step, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1 or Uba) forms a thioester bond with the C terminus of ubiquitin, which is then transferred to a specific cysteine residue of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2 or Ubc).1 In the final step the E2 enzyme donates ubiquitin to a lysine residue of the target protein, either directly or with the assistance of ubiquitin protein ligase (E3 or Ubr). Following formation of the polyubiquitin chain, the protein moiety is in most cases degraded by the 26 S proteasome complex, and free ubiquitin is released. The E3 ubiquitin protein ligases play a key role in recognition and selection of proteins targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Over the past year many RING finger proteins have been shown to act as E3s, either by themselves (3Tyers M. Willems A.R.

Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The RING proteins are thought to act as scaffolds that bring together the E2 enzyme and the target protein. In most cases the RING motif itself is needed for the E3 activity and interacts specifically with E2 enzymes. The biological significance of this interaction is underlined by the fact that mutations of the RING motif that prevent interaction with E2s can contribute to oncogenic transformation (10Yokouchi M.

We have recently described a family of proteins, termed UIPs (UbcM4-interacting proteins), that interact with two closely related E2 enzymes, UbcM4 (identical to UbcH7) and UbcH8 (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In all cases interaction occurs through the RING domain of the UIPs, the only exception being UIP5, where UbcM4 binds to a sequence that has several amino acids in common with the RING motif; however, the metal-coordinating cysteine and histidine residues are replaced with other amino acids. As this modified RING finger motif was first found in the yeast UFD2 gene, it has been designated U-box (13Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 14Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S.

Recently, a data base search initiated with the U-box of UDF2 revealed the presence of the U-box motif in several other proteins from eukaryotic organisms (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In the present report we have characterized the UIP5 protein and show that the U-box domain can directly interact with several E2 enzymes and, therefore, is likely to function similar to the RING finger in the ubiquitination pathway.

Aresta S. Gunzburg J.D. Camonis J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2035-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or vector pBTML116. The latter vector was derived from pBTM116 (23Bartel P.L. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach.in: IRL Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar) by insertion of a linker region, consisting of two repeats of four glycine and one serine residue, adjacent to the LexA protein, thus giving the bait protein greater flexibility. The plasmid expressing a fusion protein between the VP16 activation domain and a mouse UIP5 fragment extending from amino acid 241 to 335 and containing the U-box has been described earlier (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A construct containing the complete translated region of hUIP5 fused to the LexA binding domain was obtained by PCR amplification of pKIAA0860 (a gift from Dr. T. Nagase, Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan) followed by cloning of the amplified fragment into the vector pBTML116. The fusion protein will be referred to as LexA/hUIP5. Mutations of UbcM4 and hUIP5 were carried out using the Stratagene QuickChange kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Holland). All constructs were sequenced to confirm their structure. Sequences of oligonucleotides used for amplification of cDNAs and for site-directed mutagenesis are available upon request. Expression of VP16 or LexA fusion proteins in yeast was analyzed by SDS-PAGE of total protein extracts and Western blotting. Fusion proteins were detected by using anti-VP16 or anti-LexA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. Plasmids containing the proteins of interest fused to the LexA DNA binding or the VP16 activation domain were co-transformed into the yeast YRN 974 strain. In this strain, a reporter gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP), is chromosomally integrated downstream of a LexA binding site (24Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interaction of two proteins, one with a LexA binding domain, the other with a transcriptional activation domain, results in activation of GFP, which was quantified by flow cytometric analyses. Approximately 20,000 cells of at least three independent transformants were analyzed for fluorescence intensity using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Construction of (His6)-tagged UbcM4 has been described previously (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The plasmid phUIP5-HA, containing the hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the C terminus of the full-length protein, was obtained by standard PCR techniques using as template the plasmid pKIAA0860. The amplified fragment was cloned in the EcoRI site of vector pHCMV-G, from which the insert was removed (25Yee J.-K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Transfection of human 293 kidney cells, purification of (His6)-tagged proteins by metal ion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were performed exactly as described previously (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). UbcM4 with a C-terminal (His6)-tag was amplified by PCR and cloned in frame with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). To obtain GST-hUIP5-(241–335), a fragment encompassing amino acids 241–335 of hUIP5 was amplified by PCR and cloned in the vector pGEX-5X-1 in frame with GST. GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli DH5α induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cell extracts were prepared by resuspending the bacterial pellet in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free,Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), and sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the cleared lysate stored at −70 °C. To obtain purified UbcM4(His6), the GST-UbcM4-(His6) fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose. After several washes, with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl and then with 1× PBS, UbcM4(His6) was released from the GST tag by incubating the resin with 50 units of factor Xa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS followed by several washes with lysis buffer. The eluted UbcM4(His6) was further purified by absorption to TALON resin (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) and elution with imidazole. Binding assays were performed by incubating GST-hUIP5-(241–335) bound to glutathione-Sepharose with UbcM4(His6) in 300 μl of PBS. The bound proteins were then eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH8.0 and 10 mm reduced glutathione and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The GST-tagged hUIP5 protein was detected using a goat polyclonal anti GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). For detection of the (His6)-tagged UbcM4, BMG-His-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used as the primary antibody. Primary antibodies were visualized by peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibodies directed against goat or rabbit immunoglobulins (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and chemiluminescence detection (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cellular RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy total RNA isolation system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), fractionated (10 μg per lane) by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred by capillary blotting onto Nylon Plus membranes (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Preparation of32P-labeled radioactive probe, hybridization, and washing of filters have been described previously (26Harbers K. Müller U. Grams A. Li E. Jaenisch R. Franz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12412-12417Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert from the UIP5 plasmid initially isolated from the mouse embryo cDNA (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) library was used for preparing the radioactive probe. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The plasmids phUIP5-HA and pSG5-LINK-Sp100, encoding Sp100 (27Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), were introduced into HeLa cells by using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on coverslips and fixed for 5 min in methanol and for 30 s in acetone. The HA-tagged hUIP5 was detected using a 1:200 dilution of the rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity antibody 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), and Sp100 was detected using a 1:200 dilution of a rabbit anti-Sp100 antibody (27Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Antibodies were incubated with substrate for 1 h at room temperature and unbound antibodies removed by three successive washes with PBS. To visualize the primary antibodies, rhodamine RedX-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antibodies or dichlorotriazinylfluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were diluted 1:200 in PBS. DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used for staining of nuclear DNA. Cell imaging was performed with a Leica DMRA Microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany) and the Spot Fluorescence Imaging Program (Intas, Heidelberg, Germany). UIP5 was originally isolated as a partial cDNA clone from a mouse embryo yeast two-hybrid library using UbcM4 as a bait (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence predicted from its open reading frame is 84% identical with the protein encoded by the human gene KIAA0860 (GenBankTM accession number AB020667), for which the complete amino acid sequence is known. This protein, which will be referred to in this paper as human UIP5 (hUIP5), was used in all subsequent experiments where the complete UIP5 protein was analyzed. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, hUIP5 contains both a RING-HC domain and an U-box domain. Based on sequence profile analysis, the U-box of hUIP5 (KIAA0860) has been suggested to be a modified RING finger domain that lacks the hallmark metal-chelating residues of the latter but is likely to adopt a RING finger-like conformation (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The amino acids replacing the metal-chelating cysteines and histidines of the RING finger are indicated by asterisks in the U-box sequence of Fig. 1. The function of hUIP5 or its mouse homolog, mUIP5, is presently unknown. As a first step to characterize the gene, we analyzed its transcription pattern in mouse and the cellular location of its protein. At least two transcripts, about 4.5 and 4.2 kilobases in length, can be detected by Northern blot analysis. They occur predominantly in embryonic stem cells, testis, and embryos and placentas at day 14.5 postcoitus (Fig.2). However, mUIP5-specific RNA was also found in other tissues, in particular in brain, when the more sensitive reverse transcriptase-PCR method was used (data not shown). The presence of a potential nuclear localization signal (360PSQKRKI), which is related to that of simian virus 40 large T antigen (28Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), suggested that hUIP5 might be a nuclear protein. To investigate this, a plasmid encoding HA-tagged hUIP5 was transiently transfected into HeLa cells and the protein stained with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, hUIP5 (red fluorescence) was localized exclusively in the nucleus where it is associated with nuclear body-like structures. As the staining pattern was very similar to that of the previously described promyelocytic leukemia protein PML-Sp100 nuclear bodies (reviewed in Ref. 29Matera A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), we determined the localization of hUIP5 with respect to Sp100. For this purpose HeLa cells co-transfected with HA-tagged hUIP5, and Sp100 were double-immunostained with anti-HA (red fluorescence) and anti-Sp100 (green fluorescence) antibodies. An overlay of both pictures showed only very limited co-localization of the two dot-like structures, indicating that the nuclear bodies containing hUIP5 are different from those containing Sp100 (Fig. 3).Figure 3Cellular location of hUIP5. HeLa cells, transiently co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged hUIP5 and Sp100, were stained with anti-HA antibody (A,red fluorescence) or anti-Sp100 antibody (B,green fluorescence).

D, for co-localization the red fluorescence of hUIP5, the green fluorescence of Sp100, and the DAPI staining were merged.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A mouse UIP5 fragment containing little more than the U-box motif was previously shown to bind to UbcM4 (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we show that several other E2 enzymes can also interact with the U-box domain of this protein when analyzed by the yeast two-hybrid system using GFP as a reporter (Fig.4). Among the E2s tested, only UbcH1 and UbcM9 did not bind, the latter being a conjugating enzyme for the ubiquitin-related SUMO-1 (30Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 31Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To determine whether hUIP5 interacts with UbcM4 in mammalian cells, (His6)-tagged UbcM4 and (HA)-tagged hUIP5 were transiently co-expressed in human 293 kidney cells. After lysis of cells, (His6)-tagged UbcM4 was purified by metal affinity chromatography and the presence of hUIP5 associated with UbcM4 analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunostaining with HA antibodies. The results in Fig. 5 show that hUIP5 co-elutes with the metal resin-bound UbcM4 (lane 5). In the absence of (His6)-tagged UbcM4, hUIP5 is not bound to the resin (lane 4). These results clearly indicate that hUIP5 can associate with UbcM4 in mammalian cells. As described above, results obtained with partial cDNA clones indirectly suggested that the U-box of UIP5 and not the RING-HC domain was involved in the interaction with UbcM4. To directly show that the U-box provides the physical basis for binding to UbcM4, some of the amino acid residues in positions occupied by cysteines and histidine in classical RING fingers (marked by asterisks in Fig. 1) were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. Two mutant hUIP5 proteins were generated, one with both, Asp-265 and Thr-268, mutated to Gly (hUIP5[D265G,T268G]) and the other with Ser-280 converted to Leu and Lys-282 to Gly (hUIP5[S280L,K282G]). Both mutant proteins did not interact with UbcM4 when analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid system using GFP as a reporter (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis showed that the mutant UIP5 proteins are synthesized at levels comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Therefore, lack of interaction is not due to the absence or to reduced amounts of the mutant protein. Mutation of the U-box also prevented binding to other E2 enzymes (data not shown). These results clearly show that the U-box is required for hUIP5/E2 interaction. To test if there is a direct interaction between UIP5 and UbcM4, hUIP5 was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. As the complete protein was not soluble under nondenaturating conditions, a 95-amino acid-long fragment containing the U-box was synthesized as a GST fusion protein (GST-hUIP5-(241–335)) and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Binding to UbcM4 was analyzed by adding (His6)-tagged UbcM4 also purified from bacterial extracts. As shown in Fig.7, lane 3, UbcM4 bound to hUIP5 under these in vitro conditions. To determine which amino acids of UbcM4 are necessary for binding to the U-box, mutations were introduced into the UbcM4 molecule and their effect on interaction analyzed with the help of the yeast two-hybrid system. The amino acid sequence of UbcM4 and an alignment of secondary structure features is shown in Fig.8 A. UbcM4, which consists of little more than the conserved UBC domain, has an α/β structure similar to the structures of other E2s (32Cook W.J. Martin P.D. Edwards B.F.P. Yamazaki R.K. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The loop region connecting the third and fourth strand of the β-sheet and the loop located between the fourth β-strand and the second α-helix will be referred to as loop L1 and loop L2, respectively, in accordance with the nomenclature used in a previous publication (33Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure analysis of complexes between UbcH7 and the Hect domain protein E6-AP or the RING finger protein c-Cbl, the N-terminal α-helix H1 and loops L1 and L2 of UbcH7 are involved in interaction with these proteins (33Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 34Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Therefore, in our initial experiments, amino acids in these regions were mutated or deleted and the effect on interaction with the U-box of UIP5 tested. The results are summarized in Fig. 8 C. When the N-terminal 12 amino acids comprising the H1 α-helix of UbcM4 were deleted (UbcM4-(13–154)), interaction with UIP5 was abolished. However, as shown by the hybrid protein UbcH5-(1–14)/UbcM4-(16–154) interaction could be restored by adding the corresponding region of UbcH5. At the C terminus, deletion of 35 residues (UbcM4-(4–119)) did not affect binding; however, larger deletions like in UbcM4-(2–110) abolished interactions. As shown in Fig. 8 C, the truncated UbcM4 proteins that do not interact with UIP5 are synthesized at levels comparable with wild-type UbcM4, ruling out the possibility that lack of interaction is due to the absence of these proteins. In a further set of experiments, the loop regions were mutated. The sequence of loop L1 is highly conserved, and Phe-63 at the tip of L1 has previously been shown to be essential for interaction with Hect domain proteins (35Nuber U. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7576-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and with RING finger proteins. 2G. Martinez-Noel, U. Müller, and K. Harbers, submitted for publication. The results in Fig. 8 C show that mutation of Phe-63 to Asn (UbcM4[F63N]) abolished interaction with UIP5. To analyze the effect of loop L2 mutations on UbcM4/U-box interaction, several amino acid changes were introduced into this region. Whereas mutation of Asn-94 to Asp (UbcM4[N94D]) had no effect, mutation of the adjacent Trp-95, which is present in all E2 enzymes, to Gly (UbcM4[W95G]) and mutation of Pro-97 to Gly (UbcM4[P97G]) abolished binding to hUIP5, clearly indicating that these residues are required for interaction with the U-box. Mutant proteins that do not interact with UIP5 were shown to be present in yeast protein extracts at levels comparable with wild-type UbcM4 (Fig. 8 D). Binding was not affected when Lys-96, Thr-99, and Lys-100 were changed to Ser, Leu, and Thr, respectively (UbcM4[K96S,T99L,K100T]), so that loop L2 of UbcM4 looked like that of UbcH5. In contrast to the effects of mutations in loops L1 and L2, no interference with binding to UIP5 was observed when either the catalytically active cysteine residue (Cys-86) was mutated to alanine (UbcM4[C86A]) or Leu-33 was changed to Phe (UbcM4[L33F]). In summary, amino acids in loops L1 and L2 as well as an intact N-terminal α-helix are required for interaction of UbcM4 with the U-box of UIP5. The most significant result of the present report is the observation that the U-box domain can directly interact with E2 enzymes. No other proteins seem to be necessary for this interaction, as bacterially expressed E2 and UIP5 proteins can associate with each other in vitro. Therefore, for the first time a molecular link has been established between the U-box motif and the ubiquitin-conjugating system. Our results strongly suggest that proteins containing U-box domains are functionally closely related to RING finger proteins, whose importance for the ubiquitin-conjugating system has been firmly established (4Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-R87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Joazeiro C.A.P. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 9Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). This functional similarity is in agreement with the structural similarity, which was suggested by sequence alignment of U-box motifs with a selection of RING finger motifs (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Except for the metal-coordinating cysteine and histidine residues, which are the hallmark of the RING finger, the U-box retains a similar pattern of amino acid conservation. Therefore, it has been postulated that the U-box and RING finger domains have closely related three-dimensional structures consisting of a three-stranded β-sheet, an α-helix, and two large loops (15Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R132-R134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Whereas the structure of the RING domain is stabilized by two tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2+ ions, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds are most likely responsible for maintaining the structural arrangement of the U-box domain. Both loops of the U-box seem to be required for interaction as mutation of the amino acids replacing the cysteine or histidine residues in classical RING fingers in one loop, either the 1st or the 2nd, are sufficient for preventing interaction with UbcM4. Further support for the structural similarity between U-box and RING finger comes from the observation that both interact with the same regions of UbcM4. We show here that the α-helix H1 and amino acid residues within loops L1 and L2 of UbcM4 are required for interaction with UIP5. These same regions were shown by mutational analysis2 and by crystal structure analysis to be important also for complex formation of UbcM4/UbcH7 with the RING domain (34Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Although closely related in structure, the U-box of UIP5 and the RING finger of several other UIPs differ in respect to their specificity of interaction with E2 enzymes. Whereas the RING motif of the UIPs binds only to UbcM4 and the closely related UbcH8 (12Martinez-Noel G. Niedenthal R. Tamura T. Harbers K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the U-box of UIP5 can interact with UbcM2, UbcM3, UbcM4, UbcH5, and UbcH8, all of which are members of a subfamily of E2s that is characterized by the presence of a phenylalanine at the tip of loop L1. We show here that mutation of this phenylalanine residue to asparagine abolishes interaction. Furthermore, E2 enzymes, like UbcH1, which do not contain a phenylalanine in loop L1, are not capable of binding to the U-box. Results from other U-box proteins are needed to confirm that the specificity described here is a general property of U-box/E2 interactions. Evidence from several laboratories suggests that U-box proteins are involved in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The most prominent example is UFD2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was originally identified as a component of the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway (13Johnson E.S. Ma P.C. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and which was recently shown to act as a so-called E4 enzyme, which is required for multiubiquitination of ubiquitin fusion proteins, a process necessary for efficient degradation of such proteins by the proteasome (14Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In yeast, UFD2 is needed for cell survival under stress conditions, suggesting that it mediates degradation of stress-induced aberrant proteins. The UFD2 homolog in Dictyostelium discoideum, NOSA, is required for normal differentiation as disruption of the nosA gene causes developmental arrest at the aggregate stage (37Pukatzki S. Tordilla N. Franke J. Kessin R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24131-24138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Another example for an U-box protein is CHIP, which negatively regulates chaperone activity (38Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Our observation that U-box domains can bind to E2 enzymes supports the suggestion that CHIP mediates interactions between the chaperone and the ubiquitin/proteasome system. The function of UIP5 is presently unknown. Most likely it is not a substrate for ubiquitination as it is not ubiquitinated in vitro (data not shown). However, the fact that it can associate with E2 enzymes strongly suggests that it is involved in the ubiquitination of as yet unidentified target proteins. Of particular interest is the observation that hUIP5 is found exclusively in the nucleus, where it is part of a nuclear dot-like structure. As it does not co-localize with Sp100, it is most likely not a component of the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML bodies. Therefore, it might be associated with other nuclear dot proteins like PLZF (39Ruthardt M. Orleth A. Tomassoni L. Puccetti E. Riganelli D. Alcala M. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Fagioli M. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1945-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the physiological role of nuclear bodies. Some indirect evidence suggests that they might be involved in various aspects of transcriptional regulation and are targets of viral infection (reviewed in Ref. 29Matera A.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In view of the recently described observation that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis can be restricted to a certain cellular compartment (36Lenk U. Sommer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39403-39410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), one could speculate that UIP5 is needed specifically for the ubiquitination and degradation of regulatory proteins in the nucleus. Experiments are under way to test this hypothesis. We thank Drs. H. Will and T. Sternsdorf for providing the Sp100 cDNA and the rabbit anti-Sp100 antibody and Dr. J. Camonis for the plasmid pFBL23."

Previous studies demonstrated that retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) stimulated SP-B gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells. Clustered retinoic acid-responsive element and TTF-1 binding sites were identified in the enhancer region of the SP-B gene and were required for retinoic acid stimulation of the human SP-B (hSP-B) promoter. In addition, RAR and TTF-1 were colocalized in mouse bronchiolar and alveolar type II epithelial cells, the cellular site of SP-B synthesis. In the present studies, RAR and TTF-1 were colocalized in the nucleus of H441 cells. RAR and TTF-1 synergistically stimulated the hSP-B promoter in H441 cells. Direct protein-protein interactions between RAR and TTF-1 were demonstrated by the glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assay and the mammalian cell two hybrid assay. Truncation/deletion studies showed that the RAR-TTF-1 interaction was mediated through the RAR DNA binding domain (DBD) and the TTF-1 homeodomain.

SP-B is produced in alveolar type II epithelial cells and in subsets of non-ciliated bronchiolar cells lining conducting airways, and in H441 cells (human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells). SP-B enhances the spreading and stability of phospholipids in surfactant in the alveoli and plays a critical role in lamellar body and tubular myelin organization (9Whitsett J.A. Nogee L.M.

An enhancer located at –500/–375 base pairs was identified in the hSP-B 5′-flanking regulatory region that contains clustered retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) and TTF-1 binding sites (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol.

Deletion of the enhancer sequence significantly reduced transcriptional activity of the hSP-B promoter (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These sites were required for RA stimulation of hSP-B gene expression in respiratory epithelial cells. Both RAR and TTF-1 bound to the clustered RARE and TTF-1 binding sites in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 276: L398-L404PubMed Google Scholar). RAR belongs to the steroid/nonsteroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and consists of three receptor isotypes α, β, and γ, which are encoded by distinct genes. RAR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor (RXR) that binds to RARE on the target genes. Whereas RAR has weak DNA binding affinity, RXR greatly enhances RAR DNA binding affinity through dimerization of RAR/RXR (17Yang N. Schule R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). RAR consists of a DNA binding domain containing Zn2+ finger motifs, a ligand-binding/dimerization domain, a ligand-independent AF-1 transcription activation domain, and a ligand-dependent AF-2 transcription activation domain. Through these various functional domains, RAR interacts with other transcription factors and coactivators to stimulate gene transcription. TTF-1 is a tissue-specific transcription factor of Nkx2 family members expressed in the lung, the thyroid, and part of the forebrain (18Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the lung, TTF-1 mRNA and protein were detected at the earliest stages of differentiation and were restricted to bronchial and alveolar epithelium in the postnatal lung (18Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTF-1 binds to and activates the promoters of a number of genes selectively expressed in the respiratory epithelium, including SP-B (20Bohinski R.J. Di Lauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Lung morphogenesis and surfactant protein expression were markedly disrupted in TTF-1−/− mice (21Shioko Kimura Y.H. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Studies by deletion/truncation mutagenesis, mammalian cell cotransfection, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and immunofluorescent assays revealed three distinct functional domains of TTF-1 (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal regions of TTF-1 are transactivation domains. The homeodomain (HD) of TTF-1 is responsible for DNA binding and nuclear localization. RA treatment triggers formation of an enhanceosome in the hSP-B enhancer region that contains RAR/RXR, TTF-1, CBP, and p160 coactivators (19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding of RAR and TTF-1 to the hSP-B enhancer plays a critical role for enhanceosome formation. Because both clustered RAR and TTF-1 DNA binding sites overlap in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene, it is highly possible that RAR and TTF-1 interact with each other to facilitate enhanceosome formation. In this report, direct interactions between TTF-1 and RARα were identified that enhanced DNA binding to the hSP-B enhancer in respiratory epithelial cells. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (H441) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2/air and passaged weekly. The hRARα (from Dr. Pierre Chambon) and TTF-1-FLAG (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) expression vectors were cotransfected into H441 cells. Immunofluorescent staining was performed 2 days after cotransfection following a procedure described previously (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TTF-1-FLAG was recognized by FLAG monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate, whereas hRARα was recognized by hRARα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) conjugated with Texas red. The fluorescent signals were analyzed by the Leica DM IRBE confocal microscope. The hSP-B-500 construct was made previously (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The RARα expression vector was from the original authors (Dr. Pierre Chambon). For the RAR/TTF-1 cotransfection study, transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays were performed as described previously (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, H441 cells were seeded at densities of 2 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates. The hSP-B500 reporter construct (0.25 μg) was cotransfected with 0.5 μg of RAR, 0.5 μg of PCR3.0/TTF-1, and 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid into H441 cells by Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 2 days of incubation, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were performed using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The light units were assayed by luminometry (Monolight 3010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). In each transfection, β-galactosidase activities were determined for normalization of transfection efficiency. The full-length and various truncated TTF-1 constructs were from a previous study (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain was subcloned into the PCR3.0 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at the HindIII andNotI sites. Because the TTF-1 C-terminal domain only contains one methionine and generated a weak pull-down signal, three extra methionine codons were placed before the NotI site by PCR to enhance radioactive visualization (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To make GST fusion proteins, the full length, DBD, and AF-2 domain of RARα were subcloned into the pGEX4T-1 GST vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at the EcoRI and NotI restriction enzyme sites by PCR. The plasmids were transformed into JM109 or BL21 bacterial strains for protein expression. After 3 h induction at 37 °C by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the bacteria were harvested and resuspended in 1× PBS, followed by sonication and treatment with 1% Triton X-100. The proteins were purified by incubation with a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature and then eluted from beads using glutathione elution buffer followed by dialysis. Protein expression was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blots using either RARα antibody or GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined. For GST pull-down, full-length TTF-1 and various domain proteins were synthesized and [35S]methionine (Met) labeled using Promega's in vitro transcription/translation kit. Approximately 1 μg each of purified GST, RARα-GST, RARαDBD-GST, and RARαAF-2-GST were incubated with 20 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at room temperature for 30 min. Approximately 25 μl of the [35S]Met-labeled full-length TTF-1 and various domains were added to the fusion protein-bead mixture and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 h. The protein-protein-bead mixtures were washed three times with 30 μl of 1× PBS. The protein-protein-bead complexes were then resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer and run on 10–20% tricine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen-Novex). The protein gels were fixed and incubated in Amplify reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films for visualization. The reporter pG5LUC, pVP16/TTF-1 BD, and pm/RARα BD constructs were made previously (15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs of pVP16/TTF-1 HD AD and pVP16/RARα DBD AD were made by subcloning the PCR products of TTF-1 HD and RARα DBD into the pV16 AD vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) at theEcoRI/XbaI sites. Transfection and luciferase assay were performed as described previously (15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Wild type double-stranded Ba (–439 to –410) and Bb (–417 to –390) oligos from the hSP-B enhancer region were synthesized, annealed, and purified as described previously (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, and incubated with 10 ng of the purified TTF-1 HD-GST fusion protein and 100 ng of the RARα DBD-GST fusion protein alone or in combination. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by following the procedures described previously (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a negative control, GST protein was also incubated with the radiolabeled probes alone or in combination with TTF-1 HD-GST or RARα DBD-GST. The assay followed a previously published procedure (23Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Briefly, H441 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish. The following day, cells were treated with 10 μm of all trans retinoic acid for 24 h. Untreated cells served as controls. Cells were then treated with 1% formaldehyde in serum-free RPMI for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link proteins and DNA, followed by rinsing with PBS twice. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation. The cells were lysed by adding 150 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and were allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min. The cells were sonicated followed by centrifugation, and the supernatants containing soluble chromatin were collected. For immunoprecipitation, either 20 μl of 100 μg/ml RARα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 5 μl of monoclonal TTF-1 antibody, or 1 μl of monoclonal FLAG antibody (Kodak) were added to the supernatants and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The sonicated salmon sperm DNA (5 μg) was also added to cell lysate-antibody complex. Fifty μl of 50% protein A/G plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the samples and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h followed by centrifugation. The pellets were washed three times, once by 100 μl of TSE 150 mm NaCl buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), once by100 μl of TSE 500 mm NaCl buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 500 mm NaCl) and once by 100 μl of Buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.1). Each wash was performed on ice for 10 min. Next, the samples were washed three times with 100 μl of TE buffer. The immunocomplexes were then eluted off the beads by incubation with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 on ice for 10 min. Samples were heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse formaldehyde cross-linking followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. The DNA was then used as templates for quantitative PCR analysis with primers corresponding to the SP-B enhancer region. To study whether RARα and TTF-1 interact with each other to regulate hSP-B gene expression, RARα and TTF-1 colocalization was assessed in H441 cells by double immunofluorescent staining. The hRARα and TTF-1-FLAG expression vectors were cotransfected into H441 cells. Expression of TTF-1-FLAG protein (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and hRARα protein (Texas red) was monitored by immunofluorescent staining using FLAG and RAR antibodies. Confocal microscope analysis of fluorescent image revealed colocalization of RARα and TTF-1-FLAG proteins in the nucleus of H441 cells (Fig. 1). Overlapping of clustered RARα and TTF-1 DNA binding sites located in the 5′-flanking region of the hSP-B gene provides the possibility that two proteins may interact with each other to synergistically stimulate hSP-B promoter expression. RARα and TTF-1 expression vectors were cotransfected with the hSP-B500 luciferase reporter gene into H441 cells. The stimulatory effect of double transfection of RARα and TTF-1 was much higher than the additive effect of RARα and TTF-1 transfection alone (Fig.2), indicating that RARα and TTF-1 may interact to stimulate the hSP-B promoter in respiratory epithelial cells. To prove a direct interaction between RARα and TTF-1, a GST pull-down assay was performed. RARα was fused with GST to make a fusion protein. The purified RARα-GST fusion protein was incubated with the [35S]methionine labeled TTF-1 protein. After purification of incubated protein complexes through a Sepharose 4B-glutathione column, the radiolabeled TTF-1 protein was retained by the RARα-GST fusion protein as detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig.3). The GST control alone showed a very weak nonspecific pull-down signal, whereas the empty vector control (PCR3.0) showed no signal at all, indicating that [35S]Met-TTF-1 pull-down by the RARα-GST fusion protein was specific. This indicates the direct protein-protein interaction between RARα and TTF-1 in vitro. The interaction between RARα and TTF-1 was not further enhanced by RA treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the ligand-dependent AF-2 domain may not be required for interaction with TTF-1. To better understand the mechanism by which RARα and TTF-1 interact with each other, specific domains of TTF-1 required for RARα interaction need to be defined. Previously, TTF-1 functional domains were characterized (Fig.4 A) (22Ghaffari M. Zeng X. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains of TTF-1 were transactivation domains for hSP-B promoter activation. The HD of TTF-1 was the DNA binding and nuclear localization domain. Different portions of the TTF-1 molecule were constructed and radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled TTF-1 fragments were incubated with the full-length RARα-GST fusion protein for pull-down. TTF-1 N-terminal and C-terminal domains failed to be pulled down by RARα-GST, whereas the TTF-1 HD was successfully pulled down by RARα-GST (Fig.4 B). Other TTF-1 fragments containing the HD were also pulled down by RARα-GST. Therefore, the TTF-1 HD is responsible for protein-protein interaction with RARα. The interaction appears to be enhanced by the N-terminal domain of TTF-1. RARα is composed of several functional domains, including AF-2, DBD, LBD, and AF-1 domains (1Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). Because RAR and TTF-1 DNA binding sites overlap in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene, it is highly likely that RARα DBD is involved in the protein-protein interaction with TTF-1. The AF-2 domain is required for ligand-dependent pull-down of nuclear receptor coactivators (25Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Therefore, both RARα DBD and AF-2 domains were selected for further study with TTF-1. Different portions of the TTF-1 molecule were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled TTF-1 fragments were incubated with the purified RARα-DBD-GST or RARα-AF2-GST fusion proteins for pull-down. The full-length TTF-1 and the TTF-1 HD were pulled down by RARα-DBD GST, but not by RARα-AF2-GST (Fig.5). This is in agreement with the observation that TTF-1 pull-down by RARα was not RA-dependent. Therefore, DNA binding domains for both proteins are involved in protein-protein interaction in vitro. To confirm that RARα DBD and TTF-1 HD are required for the interaction with partners in cells, a mammalian two hybrid system was used. The pair of TTF-1 HD AD/RARα BD constructs (Fig. 6 A) and the pair of RARα DBD AD/TTF-1 BD constructs (Fig. 6 B) were co-transfected into H441 cells with the luciferase reporter construct pG5LUC. The luciferase activities were markedly increased in paired cotransfection (Fig. 6). These findings further support the concept that DNA binding domains of both RARα and TTF-1 are required for protein-protein interaction both in vitro and in cells. The protein-protein interaction between DNA binding domains of RARα and TTF-1 prompted us to exam how this interaction alters their DNA binding affinity in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene. Because the HD is the DNA binding domain and is sufficient for TTF-1 binding to the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene (14Yan C. Sever Z. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24852-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the TTF-1 HD-GST fusion protein was used for the DNA binding assay. The purified TTF-1 HD-GST and RARα DBD-GST fusion proteins were incubated with the oligo Ba (–439 to –410) from the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene, which contains overlapping RARE and TTF-1 DNA binding sites as reported previously (15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), individually or in combination. The DNA-protein interactions were monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The RARα DBD-GST fusion protein alone had no detectable DNA binding activity to oligo Ba. This is in agreement with previous observations that DNA binding activity of RARα required dimerization with RXR. Interestingly, the RARα DBD-GST fusion protein significantly enhanced the DNA binding affinity of the TTF-1 HD-GST fusion protein to oligo Ba (Fig. 7). As a negative control, no enhanced TTF-1 HD-GST DNA binding activity to Ba oligo was observed by the GST protein after incubation with TTF-1 HD-GST (data not shown). In vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to test whether RA treatment enhances RAR and TTF-1 binding affinity to the 5′-flanking regulatory region of the hSP-B gene in cells. The primers corresponding to hSP-B base pair –500 to +41 fragment, which contains both clustered RAR and TTF-1 sites, were used for PCR of immunoprecipitated chromatin. The monolayer of H441 cells was treated with all-trans RA (10−5m). The untreated cells were used as a control. After protein-DNA cross-linking, soluble chromatin of H441 cells was prepared and immunoprecipitated with the RAR antibody. The amount of the hSP-B DNA sequence associated with RAR was examined by analytic PCR using paired primers corresponding to the hSP-B enhancer and the promoter region (base pairs –500 to +41). RA treatment enhanced RAR binding affinity to the hSP-B 5′-flanking regulatory region (Fig.8 A). When the TTF-1 antibody was used to immunoprecipitate soluble chromatin, RA treatment also enhanced TTF-1 DNA binding affinity to the hSP-B 5′-flanking regulatory region (Fig. 8 B). As a negative control, when the FLAG antibody was used to immunoprecipitate soluble chromatin, RA treatment did not generate the hSP-B –500/+41 band (Fig. 8 C). Plasmid hSP-B 500 was also used as a template for PCR using the same set of hSP-B primers (Fig. 8 C). Taken together, RA treatment of H441 cells enhanced RAR/TTF-1 complex formation in the hSP-B regulatory region to stimulate hSP-B gene expression in vivo. Pulmonary surfactant is synthesized and secreted primarily by type II epithelial cells in the alveoli of the lung. Deficiency or disruption of pulmonary surfactant causes respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant proteins facilitate the spreading and enhance the stability of phospholipids in the alveoli and play an important role in host defense. Transcriptional regulation of surfactant protein genes by hormones and tissue-specific transcription factors is the key step for elucidation of surfactant homeostasis in lung development and postnatal respiratory adaptation. RA was shown to be important for the stimulation of hSP-B gene expression at the transcriptional level. Although the RA/RAR signaling pathway is well known to be critical to epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation in many tissues, little is known about how this pathway interacts with and is determined by tissue-specific factors in the respiratory system. We previously demonstrated that in the pulmonary epithelial system, RA stimulation of the hSP-B promoter through RARE sites is dependent on the juxtaposed clustered TTF-1 sites in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene (15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both RARα and TTF-1 were expressed in H441 cells and stimulated the hSP-B promoter in dose-dependent fashions (7Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After separation from the downstream TTF-1 sites, the clustered RARE sites in the enhancer region still rendered the SV40 promoter response to stimulation by RA (15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the enhancer of the hSP-B gene works as an independent unit in which the tissue-specific factor TTF-1 determines RA/RAR signaling activity in pulmonary epithelial cells. To determine whether RAR and TTF-1 directly interact with each other, protein-protein interaction studies were performed in the present study. There are three isotypes of RAR mediating RA function in cells. Only RARα was detected both in mouse type II epithelial cells and in the H441 cell line that shares characteristics of non-ciliated bronchiolar cells (7Yan C. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Zeng X. Sever Z. Lin S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L239-L246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, RARα was chosen for protein-protein interaction with TTF-1 in H441 cells. GST pull-down experiments demonstrated the direct protein-protein interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 3). Deletion/truncation studies further defined that the DBD domain of RARα and the HD of TTF-1 were required for protein-protein interaction (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Interestingly, the DBD domain of RARα enhanced TTF-1 HD DNA binding affinity on an hSP-B enhancer oligonucleotide sharing the overlapping RARE/TTF-1 binding sites (Fig.7). This may resulted from conformational changes of the oligonucleotide or TTF-1 in the presence of RARα DBD. This process seems not be affected by RA. The ligand-dependent AF-2 domain, which is required for recruiting nuclear receptor coactivators through protein-protein interaction, was not required for protein-protein interaction with TTF-1. In addition, RARα and TTF-1 were colocalized in the nucleus of H441 cells as demonstrated by confocal/double immunofluorescent study (Fig. 1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that RA treatment increased recruitment of RAR and TTF-1 proteins to the enhancer region of the endogenous hSP-B gene in H441 cells (Fig. 8). Collectively, our data support the idea that RA/RAR not only depends on TTF-1 to stimulate the hSP-B promoter but also facilitates TTF-1 binding to the hSP-B enhancer region. TTF-1 and RAR together synergistically stimulate hSP-B transcription. The complexity of RAR stimulation on target genes depends on multiple protein factors interacting with its various functional domains. In addition to interacting with TTF-1 in this study, RAR interacts with many other transcription factors, including transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (24Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C.

Most importantly, RAR recruits p160 nuclear receptor coactivators and CBP/p300 in the presence of RA through physical interaction with the AF-2 domain (25Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V.

We previously demonstrated that CBP and p160 nuclear receptor coactivators (steroid receptor coactivator 1, transcriptional intermediary factor 2, and activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptor) significantly stimulated the hSP-B promoter in a dose-dependent fashion (15Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). p160 nuclear receptor coactivators and CBP interacted with TTF-1 in the mammalian two hybrid system and synergistically stimulated hSP-B500 with TTF-1 (19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were all colocalized with SP-B in developing and adult epithelial cells in the lung (19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coiling of DNA around a histone octamer in the nucleosome is a cornerstone of transcriptional control. Nucleosomes repress all genes, including genes essential for respiratory functions. They occlude sites of protein binding to DNA and interfere with the interaction of activators, polymerases, transcription factors, and DNA-modifying enzymes (32Kornberg R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M46-M49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, relief of repression by chromatin is the first step toward the initiation of gene transcription. p160 nuclear receptor coactivators and CBP/p300 possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, which reversibly acetylates specific lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of core histones and leads to chromatin remodeling and gene activation (32Kornberg R.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M46-M49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on our findings, an enhanceosome model was postulated that TTF-1, RAR/RXR, CBP, and p160 coactivators form a transcriptional complex in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene (19Naltner A. Wert S. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1066-L1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may play an important role in temporal and spatial expression of SP-B during lung development. The interaction between RAR and TTF-1 provides a foundation for the enhanceosome formation in the enhancer region of the hSP-B gene. Because both RAR and TTF-1 are essential for lung organogenesis and branching morphogenesis, our study provided direct evidence and a model system to explain how RAR and TTF-1 interact with and depend on each other to regulate lung-specific gene expression at the transcriptional level to influence lung development. We thank Dr. P. Chambon for providing the RARα expression vector and Dr. R. DeLauro for providing the TTF-1 expression vector."

The present study employs the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole as an alternative approach to explore the mechanisms of Raf activation. Incubation of cells with nocodazole leads to activation of Pak1/2, kinases downstream of small GTPases Rac/Cdc42, which have been previously indicated to phosphorylate Raf-1 Ser338. Nocodazole-induced stimulation of Raf-1 is augmented by co-expression of small GTPases Rac/Cdc42 and Pak1/2. Dominant negative mutants of these proteins block activation of Raf-1 by nocodazole, but not by epidermal growth factor (EGF). Thus, our studies define Rac/Cdc42/Pak as a module upstream of Raf-1 during its activation by microtubule disruption. Although it is Ras-independent, nocodazole-induced activation of Raf-1 appears to involve the amino-terminal regulatory region in which the integrity of the Ras binding domain is required. Surprisingly, the Raf zinc finger mutation (C165S/C168S) causes a robust activation of Raf-1 by nocodazole, whereas it diminishes Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. We also show that mutation of residues Ser338 to Ala or Tyr340-Tyr341 to Phe-Phe immediately amino-terminal to the catalytic domain abrogates activation of both the wild type and zinc finger mutant Raf by both EGF/4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and nocodazole. Finally, an in vitro kinase assay demonstrates that the zinc finger mutant serves as a better substrate of Pak1 than the wild type Raf-1. Collectively, our results indicate that 1) the zinc finger exerts an inhibitory effect on Raf-1 activation, probably by preventing phosphorylation of 338SSYY341; 2) such inhibition is first overcome by an unknown factor binding in place of Ras-GTP to the amino-terminal regulatory region in response to nocodazole; and 3) EGF and nocodazole utilize different kinases to phosphorylate Ser338, an event crucial for Raf activation.

It involves multiple steps including Ras-GTP binding, membrane recruitment, and phosphorylation. Raf-1 consists of an amino-terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. The amino-terminal moiety of Raf-1 exerts an inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity, since amino-terminal truncations lead to progressive increases in its transforming ability (7Stanton Jr., V.P.

The amino-terminal regulatory region of Raf-1 contains a Ras binding domain (RBD)1 and a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain (CRD), both of which participate in binding to Ras. The first interaction engages Raf RBD ranging from aa 50 to 150 and the effector loop of Ras-GTP, which is essential for activation of Raf-1 (9Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E.

Nevertheless, it is crucial for the formation of a productive complex, as the mutation of residues necessary for this interaction on either proteins abolishes their functions, such as the ability to transform cells (14Marshall M.S.

Thus, these studies suggest that growth factor-stimulated GTP charging of Ras initiates the association of the Raf RBD with the effector loop of Ras, which ensures the second productive interaction between the CRD and Ras. Considerable evidence indicates that phosphorylation plays an important role in Raf activation. Incubation of Raf-1 activated in vivo with serine/threonine or tyrosine protein phosphatases leads to inactivation of Raf-1 (16Kovacina K.S. Yonezawa K. Brautigan D.L. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Roth R.A.

Indeed, a number of serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases have been implicated in the activation of Raf-1 (3Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Raf-1 Ser259 and Ser621 are the major phosphorylation sites which are critical determinants for binding to 14-3-3 (20Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol.

It appears that binding of 14-3-3 to the amino-terminal site (Ser(P)259) plays an inhibitory role, whereas the binding to the carboxyl-terminal site (Ser(P)621) is indispensable for the Raf kinase activity (21Michaud N.R.

In B-Raf, the two residues corresponding to Raf-1 Tyr340-Tyr341 are replaced by aspartic acids, which may account for the increased kinase activity (27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G.

The Pak family, consisting of Pak1 (Pakα), Pak2 (Pakγ), Pak3 (Pakβ), and Pak4, has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, the cell cycle, stress response, oxidant generation, cell adhesion and motility, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Pak1 participates in V12Ras-induced transformation (30Tang Y. Chen Z. Ambrose D. Liu J. Gibbs J.B. Chernoff J. Field J. Mol. Cell.

In addition, integrin-induced activation of Raf-1 has been shown to be mediated by Pak1 (35Chaudhary A. King W.G. Mattalino M.D. Frost J.A. Diaz B. Morrison D.K. Cobb M.H. Marshall M.S. Brugge J.S.

The requirement of multiple factors for receptor tyrosine kinase-stimulated activation of Raf-1 has greatly challenged us in precise elucidation of its regulation. Recent studies on Raf-1 activation by disrupting microtubule integrity that can elude the Ras binding and membrane recruitment may shed a light on uncovering this mystery (36Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C.

We have shown that nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing drug, activates Raf-1 and increases its binding to 14-3-3, while inducing mitosis and hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 (38Hayne C. Tzivion T. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31878-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of Raf-1 is necessary for entry of the cell cycle into mitosis (38Hayne C. Tzivion T. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31878-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have characterized this Ras-independent, nocodazole-induced activation of Raf-1. Here we first show that nocodazole utilizes Rac/Cdc42/Pak to activate Raf-1, in which a crucial step is the phosphorylation of Ser338 by Pak, while EGF activates Raf-1 by a different Ser338 kinase. We also find that, although Raf-1 activation by nocodazole is Ras-independent, the integrity of the Raf RBD, but not the CRD, is still required. Moreover, mutation of Cys165-Cys168 to Ser-Ser within the CRD causes a robust activation of Raf-1 by nocodazole and an increased ability of Raf to be phosphorylated in vitro by Pak, suggesting that the zinc finger structure plays an inhibitory role in Raf activation. Nocodazole and 4β-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma. Human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Monoclonal antibody against Raf-1 (E10), monoclonal antibody against GST (B14), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies and protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody against Raf-1 phospho-Ser338 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against phospho-14-3-3 pan binding sites, phospho-MAPK (Erk1/2) and MAPK, and Akt phospho-Thr473 and Akt were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). cDNAs encoding Raf-1 variants, wild type, Ras binding site mutant (84–87AAAA), zinc finger mutant (165S/168S) and kinase-dead mutant (K375M) were constructed into pMT2Myc as described previously (15Luo Z.

Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Double site mutants, 165S/168S-380A/339A and 165S/168S-340F/341F, were made by replacing the wild typeSalI fragment in pMTMyc-Raf 165S/168S with the one containing the mutation S338A/S339A or Y340F/Y341F. N17HaRas, V12Rac and V12Cdc42 were constructed in pCMV5flag plasmid (15Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). N17Rac and N17Cdc42 in pRK5Myc were obtained from W. Xiong, and Pak2 constructs (in pRK5Myc) were from G. M. Bokoch. Raf 338A/339A and 340F/341F constructs were from M. S. Marshall. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293T) and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of plasmid DNA into HEK293T cells was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. LipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for transfection of plasmids into COS7 cells according to manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 16–20 h and were treated with nocodazole, EGF, or TPA as indicated in figure legends. Cells were then lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) (40Luo Z.J. Zhang X.F. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in cell lysates were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies and protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C overnight. The precipitates were washed once with the lysis buffer, twice with the buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, and twice with a kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). For purification of recombinant GST-Raf, the lysates were incubated with GSH beads and washed as immunoprecipitation. For Western blotting, samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) in a transfer buffer consisting of 154 mmglycine, 20 mm Tris, and 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked and incubated with specific antibodies and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system. Raf-1 kinase activity was measured by a coupled enzyme assay in which bacterially expressed recombinant GST-MEK1 and kinase-dead mutant of ERK2 were sequentially added to the Raf preparation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm, 2000 cpm/pmol), as described previously (40Luo Z.J. Zhang X.F. Rapp U. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23681-23687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by the addition of a SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the labeled mixture was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The radiolabeled Erk2 bands were excised and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Recombinant GST-Pak1 and Myc-tagged Pak2 were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. After stimulation with 300 nm nocodazole for 1 h, cell lysates were prepared as described above. GST-Pak1 was purified by GSH beads and Myc-Pak2 immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10). Pak activity was analyzed at 30 °C for 30 min using 1 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) as a direct substrate. For in vitro phosphorylation of Raf-1, recombinant GST-Pak1 was purified by GSH beads and eluted with 5 mm GSH. The immunoprecipitated Myc-Raf-1 was incubated with Pak1 and ATP. The phosphorylation was visualized by anti-Ser(P)338 blotting (27Mason C.S. Springer C.J. Cooper R.G. Superti-Furga G. Mashall C.J. Marais R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2137-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that nocodazole activates Raf-1 in a time-dependent manner and such activation is necessary for transition of the cell cycle from G2 to M phase (38Hayne C. Tzivion T. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31878-31882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To further study the mechanism of nocodazole-induced Raf activation, we first determined the dose effect of nocodazole on activation of Raf-1. In doing so, cDNAs encoding the wild type and the kinase-defective mutant (K375M) of Raf-1 were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells, and Raf-1 kinase activity was assayed after cells were treated with nocodazole in different doses as indicated in Fig.1A. Raf-1 was progressively activated by increasing doses of nocodazole with a maximal effect at 300 nm under the condition of equal expression of the polypeptides. The inability of the kinase-defective mutant Raf to be activated indicated that the nocodazole-increased kinase activity was not due to kinases copurifying with Raf-1. The dose-dependent activation of Raf-1 is consistent with the ability of nocodazole to disrupt the microtubule structure (data not shown). To differentiate nocodazole-induced activation of Raf-1 from the Ras-dependent one by EGF, Myc-tagged Raf-1 was co-expressed with RafC4 (aa 1–259), the amino-terminal regulatory region containing RBD and CRD, or N17HaRas, a dominant negative mutant of Ras. This experiment was done in COS7 cells since this cell line exhibits better response to EGF than HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig.1B, co-expression of C4 or N17Ras reproducibly inhibited EGF activation of Raf-1 by about 40%, which is similar to our previous findings (41Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In contrast, these mutants did not have significant effect on Raf-1 activation by nocodazole, despite the fact that the immunoblot showed equal expression of C4 or N17Ras under these two treatments (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed a 40% increase in Raf activation by nocodazole in the presence of N17 Ras, as compared with that in its absence (Fig. 1B, lanes 1and 3). Overall, our results indicate that nocodazole up-regulates Raf kinase via a Ras-independent mechanism, which is consistent with previous publications (36Ziogas A. Lorenz I.C. Moelling K. Radziwill G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24108-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Laird A.D. Morrison D.K. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4430-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since Ser338 has been previously shown to be phosphorylated by Pak (33King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 34Sun H. King A.J. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Curr.

Brugge J.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 551-554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we attempted to evaluate the role of Rac/Cdc42 and Pak in nocodazole-induced Raf-1 activation. In the first assay, we introduced GST-Pak1 and Myc-Pak2 into HEK293T cells and examined activation of these kinases by nocodazole (Fig.2A). The recombinant Pak1 was activated by 3-fold, whereas Pak2 activity was increased by about 50%. The lesser activation of Pak2 might be due to its high basal activity or partial activation caused by the basic substrate MBP (49Clark G.J. Drugan J.K. Rossman K.L. Carpenter J.W. Rogers-Graham K. Fu H. Der C.J. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20990-20993Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the next experiment, a constitutively active mutant of Rac, V12Rac was co-expressed with the wild type Raf and its activation was examined after treatment of cells with nocodazole. Coexpression of V12Rac led to about 2.5-fold increase in basal kinase activity of Raf (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4) and more potent activation by nocodazole so that the Raf activity was increased by an additional 7-fold (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 4,and5). Similar activation profiles were obtained by expression of a constitutively active mutant of Cdc42, Pak1, and Pak2 (Fig. 2, C and D). To further establish the role of Rac/Cdc42/Pak pathway in activation of Raf-1 by disrupting the microtubule integrity, we next co-transfected Raf with a dominant negative mutant of Rac, N17Rac, or a kinase-defective mutant of Pak2. Fig. 3shows that, whereas the mutants had no effect on EGF-induced activation of Raf-1, they strongly inhibited Raf-1 activation by nocodazole. The same inhibitory effect was also achieved by co-expression of dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 and Pak1 with Raf-1 (data not shown). These results clearly place the Rac/Cdc42/Pak lineage as an upstream module in the activation of Raf-1 by microtubule depolymerization and suggest that growth factor-dependent activation of Raf-1 occurs through different regulators. To evaluate the role of Ser338-Ser339 and Tyr340-Tyr341 in nocodazole-induced activation of Raf-1, we transfected Raf mutants 338A/339A and 340F/341F into COS7 cells and examined their kinase activities, as compared with the wild type Raf-1 (Fig. 4A). Both mutations greatly inhibited the activation of Raf-1 by EGF and nocodazole. Additionally, co-expression of Pak was without effect on Raf-1 activity if Ser338 was mutated to Ala (Fig.4B). Thus, these results suggest that phosphorylation of this region is critical to both Ras-dependent and independent activation of Raf-1. To verify whether Raf residue Ser338 is phosphorylated during Raf activation, endogenous Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated and blotted with phospho-Ser338 antibody. Fig.5A shows that the phosphorylation of Ser338 was enhanced by both TPA and nocodazole. When Raf-1 was co-expressed with the active mutant of Pak2, Raf Ser338 was highly phosphorylated (Fig. 5B), which held with its stimulatory role in Raf-1 activation by nocodazole (Figs. 2 and 3). The phosphorylation of Raf-1 by Pak seemed to be site-specific, as the phosphorylation of the 14-3-3 binding sites was not altered under the same conditions (Fig. 5B). To ascertain whether the phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 by nocodazole is a specific cellular event, we examined the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473, an indicator for its activation. Fig. 5C shows that phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 was not changed in HEK 293T cells treated with nocodazole and TPA, while MAPK/Erk was significantly activated. Another piece of experimental evidence was the failure of nocodazole to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (data not shown). To assess whether the amino-terminal moiety is necessary for nocodazole-induced Raf-1 activation, we compared the activation of full-length Raf-1 and BXB-Raf-1 containing the entire carboxyl-terminal kinase domain. Fig.6A shows that the full-length Raf-1was activated well by both EGF and nocodazole, whereas the activity of BXB-Raf-1 was barely affected by these agents. The same results were obtained by using both HEK293T and COS7 cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate that the amino-terminal regulatory domain encompassing the Ras binding site is also necessary for Ras-independent activation of Raf-1. We next tested whether RBD is required for the action of nocodazole. To this regard, Raf-1 with the 84KLAK87 to AAAA mutation in the RBD was assayed for its kinase activity. Although the wild type Raf-1 was activated normally by both TPA and nocodazole, the mutation blunted its activation (Fig. 6B), even in the presence of co-expressed Pak1 (Fig. 6C).

Bollen M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The human genome contains hundreds of protein kinases (2Venter J.C. Adams M.D. Myers E.W. Li P.W. Mural R.J. Sutton G.G. Smith H.O. Yandell M. Evans C.A. Holt R.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P. Ballew R.M. Huson D.H. Wortman J.R. et al.Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10633) Google Scholar), but the reversibility of the phosphorylation process suggests that phosphatases also play a major role in the regulation of protein phosphorylation. Although the roles and cellular functions of kinases have been extensively studied, protein phosphatases have received much less attention. A long held view has been that phosphatases serve merely to reverse the actions of protein kinases. More recently has it been recognized that phosphatases may be as numerous and as tightly regulated as protein kinases, with as widely varying substrate specificities and signaling functions (3Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The preference of certain phosphatases for one phosphorylated hydroxyamino acid over others has resulted in the current classification of phosphatases as protein serine/threonine-specific, protein tyrosine-specific, and dual-specificity phosphatases. Although several highly potent and selective inhibitors of serine/threonine phosphatases have been isolated from natural sources, selective protein-tyrosine phosphatase or dual-specificity phosphatase inhibitors are still rare. Protein kinases and phosphatases are part of a complex signaling network of tightly regulated dynamic processes. The nature and details of network organization are just beginning to be unveiled, but their abundance, diversity, and substrate specificity alone cannot explain how these molecules function to regulate complex biochemical pathways. An emerging concept in signaling specificity is the subcellular location at which signaling events occur (4Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Most protein movements within the cell are consistent with a random diffusion process. However, it is now being recognized that spreading as well as restriction of signaling events to certain regions of the cell is driven by the availability of sites for protein-protein and protein-second messenger interactions (5Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 103: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of many key signaling molecules causes a subcellular redistribution that is critical for biological activity (6Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J.

Despite the potential importance that spatial regulation might have in signal transduction and the considerable information that can be derived from localization studies, a lack of readily available, quantitative analytical tools to assess the subcellular localization of multiple signal transduction molecules has impeded progress in this area. Current fluorescent imaging techniques have low throughput and are not well suited for the dissection of how complex signaling networks are coordinated. In this report, we have used a novel, automated, fluorescence-based, multiparametric, solid-phase cytometer, the Cellomics ArrayScan II (9Giuliano K.A. DeBiasio R.L. Dunlay T. Gough A. Volosky J.M.

Chem. 1995; 23: 101-108Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has anti-phosphatase activity that is thought to contribute to its antiproliferative activity. Most notably, it is one of the most potent in vitro inhibitors of the Cdc25 phosphatase family of dual-specificity phosphatases reported to date (12Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, Compound 5 is ∼10- and 100-fold more potent against Cdc25 compared with the prototype dual-specificity phosphatase VHR1 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, respectively (12Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar). Its ability to cause a dual-cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 phases as well as increased phosphorylation of the Cdc25 substrates Cdc2 (Cdk1), Cdk2, and Cdk4 is consistent with Cdc25 phosphatase inhibition by Compound 5 (12Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratories has also demonstrated that Compound 5 causes increased tyrosine phosphorylation on a number of proteins, including the epidermal growth factor receptor and Erk in hepatocytes (13Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and MCF-7 cells (14Kar S. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but it is unknown how Compound 5 enhances Erk phosphorylation or whether Compound 5 treatment changes Erk subcellular localization. A possible link between the mitogenic signal transduction and Cdc25A has been described by Galaktionovet al. (15Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), who reported that Cdc25A associates with Raf-1, a key upstream activator of Erk, in mammalian cells and frog oocytes. More recently, evidence for a possible functional involvement of Cdc25A in the Erk pathway was presented by Xia et al. (16Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), who reported that coexpression of Cdc25A together with Raf-1 prevents Raf-1 activation in response to platelet-derived growth factor in NIH3T3 cells. Nonetheless, no direct evidence for Cdc25A involvement in Erk phosphorylation or activity has been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that Cdc25A expression could reduce Erk phosphorylation and described a novel cell-based assay revealing that Compound 5 directly interfered with Cdc25A function upon Erk phosphorylation. Using quantitative, fluorescence-based, solid-phase cytometry, we documented that Erk hyperphosphorylation by Compound 5 resulted in increased nuclear accumulation of kinase-active phospho-Erk. Thus, an inhibitor of Cdc25 increased Erk phosphorylation, which further supported the hypothesis that Cdc25A regulates Erk phosphorylation status. Compound 5 (2-(2-mercaptoethanol)-3-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) has been described previously (10Nishikawa Y. Carr B.I. Wang M. Kar S. Finn F. Dowd P. Zheng Z.B. Kerns J. Naganathan S. J. Biol.

Mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-Erk antibody (E10) and the MEK inhibitor U-0126 were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Erk2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Primary antibodies for phospho-p38 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB were components of a commercially available assay kit (Cellomics, Pittsburgh, PA). Anti-Oct-1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Hsp90 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Secondary antibodies were AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse (phospho-Erk), goat anti-rabbit (phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK), or donkey anti-goat (NF-κB) IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2at 37 °C. HeLa, PC-3, DU-145, and NIH3T3 cells were from American Type Culture Collection. Rat-1 fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Guillermo Romero (University of Pittsburgh). Hep3B human hepatoma cells have been characterized previously (17Nishikawa Y. Wang Z. Kerns J. Wilcox C.S. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34803-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hep3B, HeLa, PC-3, DU-145, Rat-1, or NIH3T3 cells (4000 cells/well) were plated in the wells of a collagen-coated 96-well dark-well plate (Packard ViewPlateTM) and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were treated for the times indicated with Compound 5 or IL-1α, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100. Cells were stained with antibodies against phospho-Erk, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, or the 65-kDa subunit of NF-κB and washed with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 fluorescent dye, and immunoreactive cells were visualized by the AlexaFluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies using an XF100 filter set at excitation/emission wavelengths of 494/519 nm (AlexaFluor 488) and 350/461 nm (Hoechst). Plates were analyzed by automated image analysis on the ArrayScan II system (Cellomics) using the previously described cytoplasm to nucleus translocation algorithm (18Ding G.J. Fischer P.A.

Control experiments omitting primary antibodies were performed each time to assess the amount of nonspecific background staining. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared using a slightly modified procedure as published by Schreiber et al. (19Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Hep3B cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes, exposed to 10 μmCompound 5 for the indicated periods of time, and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), incubated on ice for 10 min, disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 20-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 2500 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected as cytosolic extract. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 400 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol), incubated on ice for 1 h, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g to collect the nuclear fraction. Solubilized proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were probed with anti-phospho-Erk, anti-Oct-1, and anti-Hsp90 antibodies. Positive antibody reactions were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Erk activity in cytosolic and nuclear fractions was determined using a nonradioactive immunoprecipitation kit (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA). Briefly, 200 μg of nuclear or cytosolic proteins were incubated with 15 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-phospho-Erk antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted and washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of GST-Elk-1 fusion protein and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. The antiproliferative activity of Compound 5 in combination with the MEK inhibitor U-0126 was measured by a previously described assay based on fluorometric quantitation of total cellular DNA content using the fluorochrome Hoechst 33258 (20Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 96-well microplates and treated every day for 3 days with various concentrations of Compound 5 in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor U-0126 (5 μm). Cells were lysed by repeated freeze-thawing, and cellular DNA was quantitated as described (20Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Mammalian expression plasmids encoding full-length wild-type Cdc25A and catalytically inactive C430S mutant Cdc25A in a pcDNA3 vector were generously provided by Dr. Thomas Roberts (Dana Farber Cancer Institute) (16Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out by the LipofectAMINE method following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Briefly, HeLa cells (100,000/well) were plated in the wells of a 6-well plate and transfected with 0.5 μg of cDNA in Opti-MEM transfection medium using LipofectAMINE PlusTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with complete growth medium, and the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Cells were treated with 0–20 μm Compound 5 for 30 min, and protein lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis for phospho-Erk and Erk2 levels as described above. For quantitation of protein expression levels, x-ray films were scanned on a Molecular Dynamics personal SI densitometer and analyzed using the ImageQuant software package (Version 4.1, Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Compound 5 was previously found to induce the prolonged phosphorylation of tyrosines on a number of signaling proteins in the Erk cascade, including Erk1 and Erk2 (13Wang Z. Wang M. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Kar S. Carr B.I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We first asked whether this increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was associated with a change in phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation. Hep3B cells were incubated either with vehicle (Me2SO) (Fig.1, A–C) or Compound 5 (D–F) for 30 min and immunostained with antibodies against a dually phosphorylated (Thr202/Tyr204) form of Erk (B, C, E, and F). Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33342 staining (Fig. 1, Aand D). Fig. 1 B shows that vehicle-treated cells had very low levels of phospho-Erk, most of which was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. Treatment of cells with Compound 5 resulted in a substantial increase in total phospho-Erk, with prominent nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1 E). Overlay images (Fig. 1,C and F) illustrate the quantitation of cytoplasmic and nuclear phospho-Erk levels. Fluorescently labeled cells were analyzed in two separate channels by the ArrayScan II, and the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear distribution was determined by a previously described algorithm (18Ding G.J. Fischer P.A. Boltz R.C. Schmidt J.A. Colaianne J.J. Gough A. Rubin R.A. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28897-28905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Hoechst 33342 staining (Fig. 1, Aand D) defined the nuclear area. Phospho-Erk fluorescence intensity within this nuclear area is referred to as “cytonuclear intensity.” To assess the amount of fluorescently labeled phospho-Erk in the cytoplasm, a set of concentric rings spaced by two pixels was placed around the nuclear boundary. Phospho-Erk fluorescence intensity within the ring area is referred to as “cytoring intensity.” Both cytonuclear and cytoring intensities were normalized to the total cytonuclear or cytoring area and are expressed as average intensity per pixel. All cytoplasmic-to-nuclear difference values were calculated by subtracting the average cytoring intensity per pixel from the average cytonuclear intensity per pixel. Thus, an increase in the cytonuclear difference value is indicative of Erk activation through phosphorylation, translocation, or both. We next examined whether Compound 5 caused selective Erk nuclear accumulation by comparing its effects with those of other signaling events that have also been reported to be activated in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner and are thought to mediate stress responses. Cells were treated for 30 min with either 10 μm Compound 5 or 25 ng/ml IL-1α; immunostained with anti-phospho-Erk, anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-JNK, or anti-NF-κB p65 antibodies; and analyzed for differences in cytoplasmic-to-nuclear fluorescence intensity. A total of 100 cells were imaged in each well. Fig. 2 shows that Compound 5 led to a dramatic increase in nuclear accumulation of phospho-Erk and phospho-p38, but had only a moderate effect on phospho-JNK and did not affect the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. In contrast, IL-1α activated all three stress-response mediators (p38, JNK, and NF-κB), but not Erk. Thus, the activity profile of Compound 5 was distinct from that of the cytokine IL-1α, suggesting that Compound 5 is not a general stress-inducing agent. Experiments with the stress inducer and phosphatase inhibitor sodium arsenite previously demonstrated that p38 and Erk are activated with different kinetics in a variety of cell lines (21Ludwig S. Hoffmeyer A. Goebeler M. Kilian K. Hafner H. Neufeld B. Han J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1917-1922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It was also reported that Erk activation is abrogated by dominant-negative forms of p38 and the p38-specific kinase inhibitor SB-203580, suggesting an involvement of p38 in Erk activation. We thus examined the concentration dependence and kinetics of phospho-Erk and phospho-p38 activation in Hep3B cells. Fig. 3 shows that maximum stimulation of both Erk and p38 was obtained at 10 μm Compound 5. Moreover, continuous exposure to 10 μm Compound 5 caused a progressively greater activation and nuclear accumulation with similar temporal characteristics (Fig. 3, upper panel). We have also found that the p38 inhibitor SB-203580 did not inhibit phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation (data not shown). These results suggest that Compound 5 acts differently than the nonspecific tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium arsenite. Compound 5 is a sulfhydryl-arylating agent, and its sustained anti-phosphatase activity has been ascribed to covalent modification of critical cysteine residues on dual-specificity and tyrosine phosphatases (17Nishikawa Y. Wang Z. Kerns J. Wilcox C.S. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34803-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To test whether its effects were irreversible, we treated cells with Compound 5 for 5 or 10 min, followed by washout, and compared the magnitude of phospho-Erk and phospho-p38 accumulation with that obtained after a 30-min continuous exposure. Fig.4 shows that short pulses of Compound 5 resulted in substantial activation of both Erk and p38, consistent with a rapid and persistent inhibition of cellular phosphatases after compound removal. We next validated the results from the automated, fluorescence-based analysis by conventional biochemical methods. Cells were treated with 10 μm Compound 5 for the indicated times, lysed, separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Erk antibody (Fig.5 A). Untreated cells had almost no nuclear phospho-Erk, consistent with the whole cell images in Fig. 1 B. Within minutes, Compound 5 caused a time-dependent and sustained increase in phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation. In contrast, cytosolic phospho-Erk levels in control cells were higher than those in the nucleus and increased only after a longer exposure to Compound 5 (30 min) (Fig. 5 A). The results from the immunoblot analysis thus confirmed those from the less arduous solid-phase cytometry studies. We then used the identical lysates from Compound 5-treated cells to investigate whether the observed Erk phosphorylation resulted in an increase in Erk kinase activity. It is thought that upon phosphorylation by MEK1 and MEK2 in the cytosol, a fraction of Erk translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates and activates transcription factors such as c-Fos, c-Jun, and Elk-1 (22Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether phosphorylated Erk was functional in Compound 5-treated cells, we examined its ability to phosphorylate the transcription factor Elk-1. Phospho-Erk was immunoprecipitated from Compound 5-treated and untreated cells, and immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant GST-Elk-1 fusion protein as a substrate. Assay mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. Fig.5 B shows that nuclear phospho-Erk had kinase activity and that its kinetics of activation correlated well with its phosphorylation status. Compound 5-induced nuclear phospho-Erk was thus functional and able to phosphorylate its physiological substrate, Elk-1. We next investigated possible consequences of Erk or p38 activation by Compound 5. We first examined whether inhibition of MEK, the direct upstream activating kinase for Erk, would reduce phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation. Cells were pretreated with the MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor U-0126 (23Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) for 45 min, stimulated with Compound 5 for an additional 30 min in the presence of the inhibitor, and analyzed on the ArrayScan II for nuclear accumulation of phospho-Erk, phospho-p38, and phospho-JNK. Consistent with results from Fig. 2, Compound 5 caused a robust increase in nuclear phospho-Erk and phospho-p38, but had only a partial effect on phospho-JNK (Fig. 6). Inclusion of 10 μm U-0126 caused almost complete inhibition of Compound 5-induced Erk activation, but, as expected, had little or no effect on p38 or JNK activation. These data suggest that MEK inhibition is sufficient to inhibit phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation by Compound 5. To determine whether the activation of Erk or p38 played a role in mediating the antiproliferative activity of Compound 5, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of Compound 5 in either the presence or absence of 5 μmU-0126 for 72 h. Cells were harvested and stained with Hoechst 33258, and cellular DNA was quantified by fluorometry as previously described (17Nishikawa Y. Wang Z. Kerns J. Wilcox C.S. Carr B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34803-34810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that inclusion of the MEK inhibitor significantly reduced Compound 5-mediated cell growth inhibition. This strongly suggests that activation of the Erk pathway is the major determinant in the antiproliferative effects of Compound 5. In contrast, p38 activation, which has been implicated in cell death in many cell types, did not appear to mediate growth inhibition of Hep3B cells by Compound 5 since, in the presence of U-0126, cell growth continued despite high levels of nuclear phospho-p38, but depressed levels of phospho-Erk (see Fig.6). To determine whether the observed accumulation of phospho-Erk was specific for Hep3B cells, we examined the ability of Compound 5 to induce phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation in a variety of mammalian cell lines using the ArrayScan II. We found that Compound 5-induced phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation was not unique to Hep3B cells, but that the magnitude of response varied with cell type. Cell lines fell into three categories based on the magnitude of phospho-Erk induction. Strong responders were NIH3T3, Rat-1, and Hep3B cells, which showed up to 24-, 75-, and 57-fold increases over control cells, respectively, in nuclear phospho-Erk levels 30 min after exposure to 10 μm Compound 5 (data not shown). DU-145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells were less responsive (2–3-fold increase after 30-min exposure to 10 μm Compound 5), and HeLa cells did not respond to Compound 5 with enhanced phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation at concentrations up to 30 μm (data not shown). Thus, the induction of phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation by Compound 5 was not limited to Hep3B cells, but instead constituted a more generalized phenomenon. Because in vitro studies had shown that Compound 5 is most effective against the Cdc25 family of dual-specificity phosphatases (12Tamura K. Southwick E.C. Kerns J. Rosi K. Carr B.I. Wilcox C. Lazo J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1317-1325PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether the effects of a brief treatment with Compound 5 on phospho-Erk nuclear accumulation could be attributed to Cdc25A inhibition. Previous reports have revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation status and activity of Raf-1, which is an upstream activator of Erk, are controlled by Cdc25A (16Xia K. Lee R.S. Narsimhan R.P. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Neel B.G. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4819-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that ectopic expression of Cdc2"

We examined the contribution of cytosolic and secretory phospholipase A2s (cPLA2 and sPLA2) to the PG generation by rat gastric epithelial cells in response to both stimuli. Stimulation with TGF-α for 24 h increased cPLA2 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 markedly, PGE2slightly, and type IIA sPLA2 and COX-1 not at all, whereas IL-1β increased sPLA2 only. Both stimuli synergistically increased PGE2, sPLA2, and the two COXs but not cPLA2. The onset of the PGE2 generation paralleled the sPLA2 release but was apparently preceded by increases in cPLA2 and the two COXs.

Furthermore, despite an increase in cPLA2 including its phosphorylated form (phosphoserine),A23187-induced arachidonic acid liberation was impaired in the TGF-α/IL-1β-stimulated cells, in which p11, a putative cPLA2 inhibitory molecule, was also increased and co-immunoprecipitated with cPLA2. These results suggest that synergistic stimulation of sPLA2 and COX-2 expression by TGF-α and IL-1β results in an increase in PGE2.

Conversely, exogenous sPLA2stimulates cPLA2 activation through a receptor-mediated mechanism in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (11Hernandez M. Burillo S.L. Crespo M.S. Nieto M.L. J. Biol.

Staudt G. Kramer R.M. Pfeilschifter J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of cross-talk between the two PLA2s has been proposed. On the other hand, stimulus-induced AA liberation in platelets having the two PLA2s is mainly mediated by cPLA2 (13Bartoli F. Lin H.-K. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Apitz-Castro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15625-15630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because sPLA2 is unable to hydrolyze membrane phospholipids of platelets unless the membrane undergoes certain modifications, such as lipid peroxidation (14Akiba S. Nagatomo R. Hayama M. Sato T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, the isozyme(s) of PLA2s contributing to the generation of PG varies with the types of cells and/or signaling pathways elicited by agonists.It is generally accepted that PG plays an important role in the homeostasis or progression of a variety of diseases with inflammation. The generation of PG in gastric cells including epithelial cells and fibroblasts is involved in the healing of gastric lesions and in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity (15Robert A. Nezamis J.E. Lancaster C. Hancher A.J. Gastroenterology. 1979; 77: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 16Kobayashi K. Arakawa T. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 21: S12-S17PubMed Google Scholar). In an animal model of stress-induced gastric ulcers, generation of PGE2 and expression of two COX isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, are accelerated during the healing of the lesions in parallel with increases in transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (17Konturek P.C.

A recent study showed that TGF-α induces cell proliferation and morphogenesis through a COX-2-dependent mechanism in RGM1 cells (25Sawaoka H. Tsuji S. Tsujii M. Gunawan E.S. Kawai N. Sasaki Y. Hori M. Kawano S. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 61: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, a proinflammatory cytokine, as well as COX-2 is also accelerated during the healing of ischemia/reperfusion-induced gastric lesions in an animal model (26Brzozowski T.

In human gastric fibroblasts, stimulation with IL-1β induces COX-2-dependent PGE2 generation (27Bamba H. Ota S. Kato A. Matsuzaki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, cytoprotection by IL-1β against ethanol-induced gastric injury was shown to be dependent on the generation of PGE2in an animal model (30Robert A. Olafsson A.S. Lancaster C. Zhang W. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Consequently, it is conceivable that TGF-α and IL-1β are implicated in the healing of gastric lesions through, at least in part, COX-2-dependent PGE2generation. However, the role of TGF-α and IL-1β in the activation of the PLA2 isozyme(s) contributing to the generation during the healing remains to be elucidated.Recently, we demonstrated that TGF-α induces cPLA2expression as well as PGE2 generation with no change in sPLA2 activity in RGM1 cells, although the increase in PGE2 was slight (18Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Hayama M. Matsui H. Sato T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGF-α was found to inhibit Ca2+ ionophore-induced cPLA2 activation in parallel with an increase in p11 (18Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Hayama M. Matsui H. Sato T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), known as a putative cPLA2 inhibitory molecule (31Wu T. Angus C.W. Yao X.-L. Logun C. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17202-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that TGF-α-stimulated PGE2 generation occurs under the control of inducible p11, which negatively regulates the hydrolytic activity of cPLA2. Considering the possibility that IL-1β is also involved in the healing of gastric lesions through generation of PG, TGF-α may cooperate with IL-1β to stimulate efficiently the generation in gastric epithelial cells. This appears likely, because a combination of EGF and IL-1β has been shown to induce synergistically COX-2 expression and PGE2 generation in human gingival fibroblasts (33Yucel-Lindberg T. Ahola H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Modéer T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). IL-1β is well known to induce sPLA2expression in a variety of cells (34Pfeilschifter J. Schalkwijk C. Briner V.A. van den Bosch H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2516-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Jacques C. Béréziat G. Humbert L. Olivier J.-L. Corvol M.-T. Masliah J. Berenbaum F. J. Clin.

However, several growth factors including EGF have been reported to inhibit cytokine-induced sPLA2 release (37Pruzanski W. Stefanski E. Vadas P. Kennedy B.P. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 38Thomas G. Bertrand F. Saunier B. J. Biol.

Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in rat calvarial osteoblasts and astrocytes. Thus, little is known about the PLA2 isozymes acting upon stimulation with both growth factors and cytokines.The present study was undertaken to identify the isozyme(s) of PLA2s contributing to the generation of PGE2 in rat gastric epithelial RGM1 cells stimulated with a combination of TGF-α and IL-1β. For this purpose, we examined changes in the two PLA2 isozymes, cPLA2 and sPLA2, in comparison to an increase in PGE2 upon the stimulation, taking into account the possible existence of cross-talk between the PLA2s and selective cooperation with certain COXs.DISCUSSIONSeveral growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines including TGF-α and IL-1β are implicated in the healing of gastric lesions. TGF-α and IL-1β have been shown to stimulate the generation of PG by rat gastric epithelial RGM1 cells (18Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Hayama M. Matsui H. Sato T. Br. J.

Kato A. Matsuzaki F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 567-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which stimulates proliferation of rabbit gastric epithelial cells (28Takahashi M.

These observations suggest that acceleration by TGF-α and IL-1β of the repair of gastric injury is mediated through, at least in part, generation of PG. We demonstrated here that whereas TGF-α or IL-1β alone had little or no effect, in combination they synergistically stimulated the generation of PGE2 by RGM1 cells (Fig. 1), suggesting that the cooperative action of TGF-α and IL-1β also is involved in PG generation during the healing of gastric mucosal lesions. In the present study, we further examined the contribution of cPLA2 and sPLA2 to the generation of PGE2 via a certain COX isoform(s), and the possible interaction between the two PLA2s in the TGF-α/IL-1β-stimulated RGM1 cells.The onset of the synergistic increase in PGE2 induced by both TGF-α and IL-1β was observed 18 h after the stimulation (Fig. 1 A). Under these conditions, both stimuli synergistically increased levels of COX-1 and COX-2 proteins with a significant change observed 3–6 h after the stimulation (Fig. 2,A and B), indicating that the increases in the two COXs preceded the synergistic effect on PGE2generation. Although COX-1 is known as a constitutive enzyme (49Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar), our result showing an increase in COX-1 is consistent with the recent finding that the expression of COX-1 as well as COX-2 is stimulated during the healing of gastric ulcers in an animal model (17Konturek P.C. Brzozowski T. Konturek S.J. Taut A. Sliwowski Z. Stachura J. Hahn E.G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 342: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the synergistic PGE2 generation was suppressed by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 but not the COX-1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that PGE2generation in the stimulated cells is mediated by COX-2 rather than COX-1. The preference for COX-2 over COX-1 may be due to a difference in ability to utilize AA (50Shitashige M. Morita I. Murota S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and/or selective coupling of COX-2 with PGE2 synthase (51Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Collectively, our findings suggest that an increase in COX-2 is required for the synergistic PGE2generation induced by both TGF-α and IL-1β but is not critical for the onset of the generation.The generation of PG in the stomach plays an important role in the healing of gastric lesions and in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity (15Robert A. Nezamis J.E. Lancaster C. Hancher A.J. Gastroenterology. 1979; 77: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 16Kobayashi K. Arakawa T. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 1995; 21: S12-S17PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a number of studies have focused on the regulation of COX isoforms, as shown in gastric epithelial cells (19Nakano O. Sakamoto C.

However, little is known about the regulation of PLA2 isozyme(s) in gastric cells, despite an important role for PLA2 as a key enzyme providing AA, a precursor for PGs. Recently, we reported that stimulation of RGM1 cells with TGF-α alone induces an increase in cPLA2 but not sPLA2 in parallel with a slight and gradual increment of PGE2 (18Akiba S. Hatazawa R. Ono K. Hayama M. Matsui H. Sato T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that cPLA2 is involved in the generation of PGE2. In the present study, although IL-1β dose-dependently enhanced TGF-α-induced PGE2generation (Fig. 1 B), it did not augment increases in cPLA2 protein and activity in response to TGF-α at the same concentration ranges (Fig. 3, A and B). The time-dependent increase in cPLA2 induced by both TGF-α and IL-1β apparently preceded the onset of the synergistic PGE2 generation (Figs. 1 A and3 C). Furthermore, the augmentation by IL-1β of TGF-α-stimulated PGE2 generation was not affected by the cPLA2 inhibitors MAFP or AACOCF3 (Fig.5 B). These results suggest, therefore, that the preceding increase in cPLA2 is not involved in the synergistic PGE2 generation induced by both IL-1β and TGF-α.Among several types of sPLA2s identified in mammalian cells and tissues (2Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar), types IIA, V, and X sPLA2s are implicated in stimulus-induced PG generation in a variety of cells (5Murakami M. Kambe T.

Acta. 1997; 1348: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the role of sPLA2 in PG generation by gastric cells remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that a dose- and time-dependent increase in sPLA2activity evoked by IL-1β in the presence of TGF-α was well consistent with the augmentation by IL-1β of the TGF-α-induced PGE2 generation (Figs. 1 and 4). Furthermore, suppression of the augmented PGE2 generation by the specific sPLA2 inhibitor indoxam was observed in parallel with inhibition of the activity of sPLA2 released at the same concentration ranges (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that an increase in sPLA2 is involved in the synergistic PGE2generation induced by both TGF-α and IL-1β. Considering the result that mRNA for type IIA sPLA2 but not for types V or X sPLA2 was increased upon the stimulation (Fig.4 C), the increased sPLA2 activity may be due to, at least in part, induction of type IIA sPLA2 expression. Although type IIA sPLA2 has been suggested to stimulate liberation of AA through hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids (12Huwiler A. Staudt G. Kramer R.M. Pfeilschifter J. Biochim. Biophys.

At present, the mechanism(s) responsible for the change in cellular susceptibility to sPLA2 in TGF-α/IL-1β-stimulated RGM1 cells is unclear.A number of studies have suggested the existence of interaction between sPLA2 and cPLA2. As the mechanism responsible for the interaction, exogenous sPLA2 has been shown to activate p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase, inducing activation of cPLA2 and liberation of AA, in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells (11Hernandez M.

Thus, the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between the two PLA2s vary with the types of cells and/or stimulation systems. In the present study, we showed that A23187-induced AA liberation was potentiated in IL-1β-stimulated RGM1 cells (Fig. 7 A), in which constitutive cPLA2 and inducible sPLA2co-existed (Figs. 3 and 4). The augmentation was markedly prevented by MAFP in addition to the sPLA2 inhibitor indoxam (Fig.7 D). These findings also suggest that cPLA2 may contribute to sPLA2-catalyzed AA liberation when IL-1β-primed RGM1 cells are activated by Ca2+-mobilizing agonists. However, TGF-α alone did not stimulate sPLA2expression despite an increase in cPLA2 (Figs. 3 and 4). Furthermore, under conditions where TGF-α and IL-1β synergistically stimulated PGE2 generation with preceding cPLA2expression and concomitant sPLA2 release (Figs. 1, 3 and4), indoxam suppressed the PGE2 generation, whereas cPLA2 inhibitors had no effect on the increase in sPLA2 or PGE2 (Figs. 5 and 6). Accordingly, our findings suggest that cPLA2 is not involved in the sPLA2 release and subsequent PGE2 generation in the TGF-α/IL-1β-stimulated cells.It has been shown that p11, known as annexin II light chain, directly inhibits cPLA2 activity through binding to the enzyme (31Wu T.

The arrangement of the dynein arms along the axonemes is complex (1Taylor H.C. Satir P. Holwill M.E.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Dynein arm mechanochemistry is thought to regulate beat frequency and beat form by signal transduction mechanisms that change the parameters of microtubule sliding within the axoneme, such that the outer arm dyneins principally regulate beat frequency whereas the inner arm dyneins control beat form (cf. Refs. 2Brokaw C.J. Kamiya R. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar and 3Satir P. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1985; 36: 153-156PubMed Google Scholar), normally measured by an increase of swimming speed, in the protozoan ciliate,Paramecium tetraurelia. The increase occurs in living cells and in cells that have been permeabilized with Triton X-100 and reactivated with Mg2+-ATP; it persists in the permeabilized cells even when cAMP is subsequently removed and it is quenched by simultaneous addition of Ca2+ to the medium (5Hamasaki T. Murtaugh T.J. Satir B.H. Satir P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 219-230PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported on a molecule, p29, whose phosphorylation bothin vivo and in vitro correlated with the cAMP-dependent Ca2+-sensitive increase in swimming speed. Further studies revealed that p29 is a component of outer arm dynein (6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1991; 88: 7918-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Bonini N.M. Nelson D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 219-230PubMed Google Scholar, 9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which specifically binds to one heavy chain isoform of the three-headed 22 S outer arm dynein. Phosphorylation of p29 increases in vitro microtubule translocation velocity by outer arm dyneins by 40% (6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S.

J. 1995; 69: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, p29 is regarded as a dynein regulatory light chain of ciliary outer arm dyneins in Paramecium. Like Paramecium, Tetrahymena thermophila outer arm dynein consists of three different heavy chain isoforms (11Marchese-Ragona S.P. Wall J.S. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) in a three-headed bouquet that sediments at 22 S, but is probably compactedin situ (12Barkalow K. Avolio J. Holwill M.E.J. Hamasaki T. Satir P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 27: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), together with intermediate chains and light chains. Chilcote and Johnson (13Chilcote T.J. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 17257-17266Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) studied phosphorylation of isolatedTetrahymena 22 S dynein. They were successful in phosphorylating 22 S dynein using the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase from bovine heart with 500 μm ATP and vanadate as a phosphatase inhibitor. They found that about 0.5 mol of phosphate was added per mol of 22 S dynein, mainly into proteins at molecular masses 78 and 34 kDa (p78 and p34, respectively). Phosphorylated p78 and p34 cosedimented with microtubules in an ATP-sensitive manner, as expected for dynein constituents. An endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase was present in the preparations. No dephosphorylation was detected, even with the addition of calcineurin (protein phosphatase type II). Exogenous acid or alkaline phosphatase was able to partially dephosphorylate the dynein, which lowered specific activity of dynein ATPase by 30%. Barkalow et al. (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that p29 fromParamecium binds to Tetrahymena 22 S dynein, which suggested that there was a Tetrahymena ortholog of p29. Accordingly, using a series of fractionation, reconstitution, and analytical technologies, including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis andin vitro motility assays, we have investigated whether p34 as identified by Chilcote and Johnson (13Chilcote T.J. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 17257-17266Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) could be this ortholog. The following strains of T. thermophila were used in this study: a mucus-free mutant, SB 255 (14Orias E. Flacks M. Satir B. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 64: 49-67PubMed Google Scholar), and oad-1, a temperature-sensitive outer dynein arm-deficient mutant (15Ludmann S.A. Schwandt A. Kong X. Bricker C.S. Pennock D.G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Sullivan J. Ludmann S.A. Hamasaki T. Pennock D.G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1996; 43: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). SB 255 cells were grown either in 1-liter cultures in 2-liter capacity flat flasks with shaking at 38 °C or in 8-liter aerated cultures containing Antifoam C (Sigma) at 27 °C. oad-1 cells were grown in 1-liter cultures either at 28 °C (permissive temperature) or at 38 °C (non-permissive temperature). The growth medium was a modified version of a milk medium (17Kiy T. Tiedtke A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 38: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), supplemented with 0.25% proteose peptone and Fe. Na. EDTA (Sigma). Cilia were collected according to the dibucaine method by Satir et al. (18Satir B. Sale W.S. Satir P. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1976; 1: 69-73Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 2% proteose peptone with 3 mm dibucaine and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, allowing deciliation to occur within 5–10 min. Cell bodies were pelleted and discarded by centrifugation at 1500 × g in axoneme buffer (30 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA). Demembranation of cilia and phosphorylation of axonemes were performed according to Hamasakiet al. (5Hamasaki T. Murtaugh T.J. Satir B.H. Satir P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Demembranation was accomplished with 0.5% Triton X-100 in axoneme buffer, and axonemes were collected in axoneme buffer supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol. Axonemes from SB255 cells were in vitro-thiophosphorylated for 30 min at room temperature in axoneme buffer containing about 300 nm 5′-γ-S thiotriphosphate adenosine (cold labeling) or 5′-γ-[35S] thiotriphosphate adenosine (>600 Ci per mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), Thiophosphorylation prevents the action of phosphatases during dynein isolation procedures. Axonemes from oad-1 cells were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were performed in the presence and in the absence of 10–20 μm cAMP and 10−3-10−4m CaCl2 (pCa 3–4). All steps were performed in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors, CompleteTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dynein heavy chains 14 S (inner arm dynein) and 22 S (outer arm dynein) were purified according to the procedure of Hamasaki et al. (6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1991; 88: 7918-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Axonemes were incubated on ice for 30 min in axoneme buffer with 0.6 m KCl. This separates the dynein molecules from microtubules, the latter being pelleted by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min. Usually, the dynein-containing supernatant was further incubated on ice for 30 min in axoneme buffer with 1.2 m KCl, allowing dynein-regulatory proteins to be separated from the dynein heavy chains (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The sample was then loaded onto a Centricon 100 (Millipore, Milford, MA) and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C until the volume of the retentate, containing dynein heavy chains, was less than 100 μl. The retentate was then carefully layered on top of a 5–30% linear sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 h, followed by fractionation of the gradient into about 20 fractions each having a volume of ∼500 μl. The fractions were assayed for ATPase activity (19Hayashi M. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11561-11565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis to identify fractions containing 14 S and 22 S dyneins. Prior to sucrose gradient separation, fractions containing crude 22 S dynein with thiophosphorylated p34 were incubated with antisera generated against the 22 S dynein heavy chains and then mixed with protein-A-Sepharose 3B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), following procedures modified after Wang and Satir (20Wang H. Satir P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) for immunoprecipitation. Controls included a sample containing thiophosphorylated p34 but no dynein heavy chains and 22 S dynein mixed with the-Sepharose beads in the absence of antisera. Purification of p34 fractions from thiophosphorylated axonemes was performed by the method used to isolate p29 fractions from Paramecium dynein (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Centricon 100 flowthrough from the dynein samples was concentrated in a Centricon 10, followed by three washings with axoneme buffer, leading to a final volume of less than 100 μl. Reconstitution of p34 to dynein heavy chains fromTetrahymena and P. tetraurelia was performed according to Barkalow et al. (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A 50-μl volume of the fractions containing non-radiolabeled 14 S or 22 S dynein was transferred to Eppendorf tubes. To this was added 10 μl of the fraction containing radiolabeled p34, which had been thiophosphorylated in the presence of cAMP. The samples were then centrifuged through a Microcon 100 (Millipore), concentrating the retentate to ∼10 μl. The retentate contains the dynein heavy chains, and the flowthrough contains free p34. These samples were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. If the radiolabeled p34 reconstitutes with the heavy chains it will be located in the retentate, whereas unbound p34 will localize to the flowthrough. The flowthrough was concentrated in a Microcon 10 to ∼10 μl. In other experiments we investigated the capability of non-radiolabeled (cold-labeled) p34 and p29 to compete with the binding of radiolabeled p34 to 22 S dynein from either Tetrahymena orParamecium. These experiments were carried out essentially as described above except that increasing concentrations of non-radiolabeled p34 and p29 were added to the samples. In all cases bovine serum albumin (20–50 μg) was added to each reaction tube as a control for nonspecific protein binding. Reconstitution was carried out at room temperature for 1 h with vertical rotation of the test tubes. Proteins from SB255 cells were resolved by gel electrophoresis either under denaturation and reducing conditions (SDS-PAGE)1 or under native settings according to NuPAGE minigel procedures for the NOVEX Xcell (E19001) system (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). Protein samples for SDS-PAGE were run on 10% NuPAGE bis-tris and on 3–8% NuPAGE Tris acetate gels with NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer (NP0002) and NuPAGE Tris acetate running SDS buffer (LA0041), respectively. Samples with proteins to be resolved under native conditions were placed in Tris-glycine native sample buffer (LC2673). They were then loaded and run on 3–8% NuPAGE Tris acetate gels with Tris-glycine native running buffer (LC2672). SDS-PAGE of proteins from oad-1 cells was performed in 10% Tris-glycine gels. SeeBlue™ prestained standards (NOVEX) were used as molecular mass markers. The gels were fixed and stained in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.1% Coomassie Blue R250 for one h, shrunk in 30% ethanol and 2% glycerol for 30 min, and dried on Whatman No. 3MM chromatography paper. Protein samples were desalted and concentrated with phenol precipitation (21Sauvé D.M. Ho D.T. Roberge M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 382-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The proteins were then resolved according to the manufacturer's manual for the Multiphor II horizontal two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first dimension (isoelectric focusing) was performed with Immobiline Dry Strip, pH 3–10 linear pH gradient, and the second dimension (SDS-PAGE) was performed with ExcelGel SDS XL 12–14% Tris-glycine. The gels were silver-stained according to Shevchenko et al. (22Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7830) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. It was often necessary to go through two steps of sensitizing and staining to get clear staining of the proteins, as well as a low background staining. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography. 32P-labeled proteins were detected by Kodak x-ray films, and35S-labeled proteins were detected by Kodak BIOMAX MR film or BIOMAX MS films with Kodak BIOMAX TranSCreen-LE intensifying screen (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The intensity of protein phosphorylation was analyzed by a PhosphorImager™ using the ImageQuaNT system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The effect of p34 phosphorylation on microtubule translocation activity was measured using an in vitro motility assay adapted from Ref. 6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1991; 88: 7918-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar. 22 S dynein was purified from Tetrahymena axonemes that had beenin vitro-thiophosphorylated in the presence and in the absence of cAMP. The dynein was then perfused into the translocation chamber. After 5 min of incubation, excess dynein was removed by washing of the chamber with gliding buffer (50 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 μmtaxol, 3 mm MgSO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA). Attached dynein was activated with gliding buffer supplemented with 1 mm ATP, and this was followed by perfusion with the same buffer containing microtubules (polymerized from phosphocellulose column-purified bovine brain tubulin in the presence of 1 mm GTP and stabilized with 5 μm taxol). Movement of the microtubules was recorded on video. Positions were traced at 4-s intervals, and the length and average velocity of moving microtubules was measured, based on a minimum of >30 individual determinations for each condition. We initially conducted a series of phosphorylation experiments with the temperature-sensitive outer dynein arm-deficient mutant of T. thermophila, oad-1 (Fig.1). In axonemes isolated from cultures grown at 28 °C (permissive temperature) where outer arm dyneins are present in this mutant (15Ludmann S.A. Schwandt A. Kong X. Bricker C.S. Pennock D.G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Sullivan J. Ludmann S.A. Hamasaki T. Pennock D.G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1996; 43: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) 10 μm cAMP induced the [γ-32P]ATP phosphorylation of several proteins in the p34 range, about 6× over no add controls. In the presence of cAMP, addition of Ca2+ increased the p34 phosphorylation further to about 9× control levels, whereas in the absence of cAMP, Ca2+ did not elicit p34 phosphorylation. Similar changes were seen in a p78 protein. However, at 38 °C (non-permissive temperature) where outer arm dyneins are greatly reduced in the mutant, although similar changes were seen at p78, p34 phosphorylation remained at control levels regardless of whether cAMP and/or Ca2+were present. These results confirm that p34 is an outer arm dynein-related molecule that is phosphorylated in a cAMP-dependent manner. Treatment of axonemes with 0.6 m KCl extracts most of the dynein, yielding so-called crude dynein. Further incubation of the dynein fraction in 1.2 m KCl dissociates some of the 22 S dynein into its constituent proteins (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After high salt treatment, the dynein-containing fraction, centrifuged through a Centricon 100, produces a retentate containing the dynein heavy chains and a flowthrough containing axonemal proteins between 10 and 100 kDa, including dynein light chains. Fig. 2 A shows SDS-PAGE and autoradiographic analysis of proteins in T. thermophila SB 255 in the salt-extracted thiophosphorylated axonemes, in the retentate heavy chain containing fraction, and in the 10–100 kDa light chain-containing fraction. p34 is the major protein of the light chain fraction that becomes phosphorylated upon stimulation with cAMP. Phosphorimaging measurements again show a 5× increase on p34 labeling upon cAMP addition, which is enhanced by Ca2+, whereas in Ca2+ alone, p34 phosphorylation remains at control levels (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 3 shows ATPase activity measurements of fractions collected from the crude dynein within a 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. The ATPase peak in fractions 7–11 corresponds to 14 S inner arm dyneins, and the peak in fractions 14–18 correspond to 22 S outer arm dynein (Fig. 3 A), as confirmed by SDS-PAGE showing the dynein heavy chains (Fig.3 B). The corresponding autoradiogram shows that p34 remaining with the dynein heavy chains comigrates with 22 S dynein and not with 14 S dynein (Fig. 3 B). Some p34 (seen in fractions 1–5) dissociates from the dynein heavy chains during this procedure.Figure 3Analysis of dyneins fractionated on a 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. Dyneins were salt-extracted fromTetrahymena SB255 axonemes thiophosphorylated in the presence of cAMP. A, ATPase activity measurements used to identify fractions containing 14 S and 22 S dynein. B, corresponding SDS-PAGE gel, showing the dynein heavy chain (HC) region and autoradiograph (autorad) showing p34.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test further whether p34 is a dynein light chain, we immunoprecipitated 22 S dynein heavy chains using 22 S dynein antisera, protein-A-Sepharose, and p34 coimmunoprecipitated with the dynein heavy chains (Fig. 4 A). The antisera did not immunoprecipitate thiophosphorylated p34 when fractions containing thiophosphorylated p34 but no heavy chains (10–100-kDa light chain-containing fraction) were used for the experiments. As expected, no immunoprecipitate was produced in the absence of antisera. We also examined the phosphorylation pattern of 22 S dynein under native gel electrophoresis conditions. If p34 is a light chain, it should remain attached to 22 S dynein under native conditions, and upon denaturation in SDS-PAGE the amount of phosphorylation in p34 plus the residual radioactivity in the dissociated single-headed dynein heavy chains and their constituent components should quantitatively match the amount of phosphorylation in the native 22 S complex. After denaturation, the β and γ of dynein heavy chains are seen to be phosphorylated at a constitutively low level independently of cAMP addition. A number of additional bands are also phosphorylated. Although the level of p34 phosphorylation varies, the level of phosphorylation in the bands other than p34 in fractions 14–17 of the gel is virtually constant. The phosphorylated bands seen in the autoradiogram after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B) disappear under native conditions, and fraction by fraction the amount of phosphorylation under denaturation conditions is switched to the native 22 S complex (Fig. 4 C). The variation in p34 phosphorylation is reproduced in the complex, which supports the conclusion that p34 is a light chain of native 22 S dynein. To show whether p29 and p34 are functional orthologs, we performed a series of experiments on the ability of radiolabeled p34 to reconstitute withTetrahymena and Paramecium dyneins. Fig.5 shows reconstitution of radiolabeled p34 with Tetrahymena and Paramecium dyneins in our standard assay. In all cases bovine serum albumin was added to the reactions both as a control for nonspecific binding of p34 to proteinper se and to prevent dyneins and p34 from binding to the Centricon membranes. In the absence of any of the dyneins, radiolabeled p34 identified by autoradiogram was found exclusively in the Centricon 100 flowthrough, as was bovine serum albumin. In the presence of dyneins, a small amount of bovine serum albumin was found in the retentate, but this did not affect the retention of p34. 14 S dynein did not rebind p34 in either ciliate, and labeled p34 was found only in the flowthrough. On the other hand, p34 reconstituted with bothParamecium and Tetrahymena 22 S dynein, where much of the labeled p34 remained with the retentate. To test whether p34 competes with p29 for binding to 22 S dynein, we added increasing concentrations of cold-labeled p34 or p29 to a constant amount of 35S-labeled p34 in our assay (Fig.6). Cold-labeled p34 competed with the binding of radiolabeled p34 to Tetrahymena 22 S dynein (Fig.6 B), and cold-labeled p29 competed effectively with the binding of radiolabeled p34 to Paramecium 22 S dynein (Fig.6 A), qualitatively displacing p34 radiolabel from the retentate to the flowthrough. Fig.7 shows a two-dimensional gel analysis of the 10–100-kDa light chain fraction thiophosphorylated in the absence and in the presence of cAMP. The silver stain pattern of proteins is reproducible in the two gels, as are virtually all the radiolabeled spots (Fig. 7 A). After cAMP treatment, a ladder of at least five unique phosphorylated spots (Fig. 7 B), focusing in the pH range from 5 to 6, corresponding to faint spots in the silver-stained gels, is found in the p34 region. These spots increase slightly in molecular mass, whereas at the same time they decrease in pI. The p34 spots are the only significant thiophosphorylated molecules in the 10–100-kDa fractions that were consistently radiolabeled in the presence of cAMP, not seen in the audoradiogram when thiophosphorylation occurred in the absence of cAMP. The in vitro translocation velocity of microtubules on 22 S dynein isolated from axonemes that had been thiophosphorylated in the presence and in the absence of cAMP was determined. The length of the microtubules that moved on the dynein varied, although the distribution of the lengths was essentially similar in all experiments, which allowed us to compare the velocity of translocation from one experiment to another (6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1991; 88: 7918-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 22 S dynein from axonemes thiophosphorylated in the absence of cAMP produced an averagein vitro velocity of microtubules of 0.83 ± 0.08 μm s−1 (mean ± S.E.) (n = 37). This contrasted to microtubule velocity produced by 22 S dynein from axonemes phosphorylated in the presence of cAMP, where the average velocity increased to 1.42 ± 0.09 μm s−1(n = 40) (t test, p < 0.0001). Previous results by Chilcote and Johnson (13Chilcote T.J. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 17257-17266Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) showed that 22 S outer arm dynein in Tetrahymena is associated with a 34-kDa protein (p34) that is phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, resulting in increased phosphate incorporation into the protein. Accordingly, in our studies, thiophosphorylation indicated by 35S incorporation probably represents new phosphate addition, rather than turnover of existing phosphorylated p34. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis shows that p34 is largely unphosphorylated prior to cAMP addition. At least five phosphorylated protein spots appear in a ladder in the p34 region after cAMP treatment. Sequentially the spots increase slightly in molecular mass, while at the same time they decrease in pI, which probably indicates that p34 can be phosphorylated at multiple sites or alternatively that multiple isoforms of p34 of slightly different mass and pIs are present in the axoneme. If multiple phosphorylations of p34 occur, this might mean that sequential phosphorylation of a single dynein regulatory light chain leads to increased outer arm dynein activity. Attempts are now being made to sequence p34 from these gels. Our results support the conclusion that p34 is a functional ortholog of an outer arm dynein regulatory light chain that probably regulates ciliary beat frequency, found in several cilia, of which p29 inParamecium axonemes is the prototype (6Hamasaki T. Barkalow K. Richmond J. Satir P. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1991; 88: 7918-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We earlier demonstrated that p29 rebinds to Tetrahymena, as well as toParamecium outer arm dynein (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Here we show that p34 also rebinds to outer arm dynein, but not inner arm dynein, in both ciliates, with some differences when binding is to dyneins of the sameversus the contrasting organisms, and that cold-labeled p29 competes with the binding of radiolabeled p34. p34 is a constituent dynein regulatory light chain, because it coimmunoprecipitates with 22 S dynein heavy chains (20Wang H. Satir P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and it migrates together with heavy chains of outer arm dynein both in a gradient separation of dyneins and in native gels. We calculate that ∼2% of the molecular weight of outer arm dynein is p34, assuming that there is one p34 for each α-heavy chain in the molecule, an assumption consistent with the measurements of Barkalow et al. (9Barkalow K. Hamasaki T. Satir P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) on p29. The temperature-sensitive mutant, oad-1, when deficient in outer arms (15Ludmann S.A. Schwandt A. Kong X. Bricker C.S. Pennock D.G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Sullivan J. Ludmann S.A. Hamasaki T. Pennock D.G. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1996; 43: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) shows no p34 phosphorylation. Further, the in vitro translocation velocity of microtubules by Tetrahymena 22 S outer arm dynein increases by about 70% after thiophosphorylation in the presence of cAMP, an increase that is attributable to cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of an outer arm dynein regulatory light chain leading to faster ciliary beat. An increase in p34 phosphorylation should be directly proportional to a corresponding increase in ciliary beat frequency (10Hamasaki T. Holwill M.E.J. Barkalow K. Satir P. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2569-2579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) over a necessary wide range of frequencies. The presence of high Ca2+ (pCa 4) increases cAMP-induced phosphorylation of p34 in Tetrahymena axonemes by about 60%, although Ca2+ alone has no effect. Similarly, Chilcote and Johnson (13Chilcote T.J. Johnson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 17257-17266Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) found that Ca2+ and calmodulin alone did not elicit new p34 phosphorylation. Therefore, Ca2+ in the absence of cAMP must be insufficient to activate the relevant endogenous kinases, but, speculatively, it could cause conformational changes to increase the accessibility of p34 to phosphorylation. In mammalian respiratory cilia (23Lansley A.B. Sanderson M.J. Dirksen E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L232-L242PubMed Google Scholar, 24Salathe M. Pratt M.M. Wanner A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

J. 1999; 77: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Ca2+ also increases ciliary beat frequency synergistically with cAMP, possibly via a similar action on dynein regulatory light chain phosphorylation. This is different from Paramecium, where unusually the effect of Ca2+ on cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of p29 is inhibitory, because Ca2+ inhibits the relevant ParameciumcAMP-dependent protein kinase (5Hamasaki T. Murtaugh T.J. Satir B.H. Satir P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tetrahymena cilia can be readily isolated in larger quantities than either Paramecium or mammalian cilia, which may prove significant for the study of certain minor components of the axoneme, such as p34 and its orthologs. Similar approaches have proven useful in identifying dynein light chains usingChlamydomonas (26King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Gene transformation and knockout procedures have been developed for Tetrahymena (27Bruns P.J. Cassidy-Hanley D. Methods Cell Biol. 2000; 62: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gaertig J. Kapler G. Methods Cell Biol. 2000; 62: 485-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of p34 presented here provides the basis for a unique opportunity to study function of the dynein regulatory light chain in further detail through biochemical and molecular genetic approaches that will yield fundamental information regarding the molecular mechanisms of beat frequency control in the ciliary axoneme."

Sequencing by TOFMS may therefore provide a basis for monitoring the effects of host passaging on a virus at the molecular level. Such TOFMS-based analyses assess the complete profiles of coat protein sequences actually present in infected tissues. They are therefore not subject to the selection biases inherent in deducing such sequences from reverse-transcribed viral RNA and cloning the resulting cDNA.

Molecular masses have traditionally been determined by gel electrophoresis; a method whereby the accuracy and resolution are incapable of distinguishing proteins that differ in mass by less than ∼1%. The amino acid sequence provides more definitive information, but most sequences currently in the literature have been deduced from nucleic acid sequences of specific cDNA clones. Thus they fail to take into account changes that are not defined by the nucleic acid, such as post-translational modifications. They also fail to provide a complete profile of the viral coat protein population actually present in infected tissue.With the development of electrospray ionization (ESI)1 and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), as well as new types of mass analyzers, mass spectrometry (MS) now affords a rapid and efficient approach for obtaining more detailed information about virus coat protein sequences in infected tissue (1Gorman J.J.

This can be carried out with an accuracy of a few daltons (in a few tens of kilodaltons), which is usually sufficient to distinguish coat proteins of different viruses or different isolates of the same virus species (15Chernushevich I.V. Krutchinsky A.N. Ens W. Standing K.G. Proceedings of the 44th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics. ASMS, Santa Fe, NM1996: 751Google Scholar). However, much more information can be deduced by digesting the protein with specific endopeptidases and analyzing the digestion products by MS (i.e. peptide mapping). These analyses can often define the parts of the protein sequences that agree with those predicted from nucleic acid data and thus identify the regions where the amino acid sequence differs from prediction.Still more detailed information can be obtained from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), in which a given proteolytic fragment ion is selected by one mass analyzer and is forced to collide with the molecules of a target gas. The resulting daughter ions are then characterized by a second mass analyzer. This increases the analytical power of MS and allows the rapid determination of amino acid sequences from multiple protein specimens, even if they are closely related.We have applied these approaches to investigate a number of plant viruses. Such viruses are of considerable economic importance, but in addition, the use of plant viruses as model systems for basic investigations has several advantages. (a) Propagation and maintenance are easier than for human and animal viruses, allowing faster experiment cycles. This is particularly important in experiments designed to investigate the link between altered virulence achieved by serial passage through alternative hosts and specific changes in viral coat protein amino acid sequence (see the example below). (b) Compared with many human and animal viruses, plant viruses pose little risk to humans. (c) There is little difficulty in meeting requirements for health and care of hosts to be infected, and experiments can accommodate high rates of host destruction if necessary. “Cruelty to plants” has not yet captured the attention of placard-waving demonstrators. (d) Most plant viruses are considerably less complex than most human, animal, and bacterial viruses, making it easier to generate well defined test materials for experiments.We have determined the ratio of m/z (∼27,000) for intact virions of brome mosaic virus (BMV) (15Chernushevich I.V.

Analyses of such variations may point to evolutionary relationships, whether the variations are caused by post-translational modifications, deletions, point mutations, or other mechanisms.As an illustration of how these methods can be applied to closely related virus isolates, we describe here TOFMS measurements on a group of geographic isolates of brome mosaic virus (BMV). This virus is the type member of the bromoviridae (23Brunt, A., Crabtree, K., Dallwitz, M., Gibbs, A., and Watson, L. (1996)Viruses of Plants: Descriptions and Lists from the VIDE Database, p. 1484.Google Scholar) and was one of the first multipartite-genome ssRNA plant viruses to have its genome completely sequenced (24DasGupta R.

It is found in the Great Plains of North America and has also been reported from Europe and western Asia (27Lane L.C. Adv. Virus Res. 1974; 19: 151-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In nature, BMV predominantly infects grasses and cereals and may cause sporadic crop losses (28Haber S. Hamilton R.I. Plant Dis. 1989; 73: 195-199Crossref Google Scholar). It is unusual in its ability to also infect an array of experimental broadleaf hosts (27Lane L.C. Adv. Virus Res. 1974; 19: 151-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).RESULTSPreliminary Characterization of the BMV IsolatesTypical MALDI and ESI spectra of the intact protein subunits are shown in Figs. 2 and3. The measured average masses for the coat proteins of the isolates (Table I) all differed from the value of 20,253 Da calculated from the published coat protein sequence of the type isolate (24DasGupta R.

Clearly a number of modifications in the coat proteins had occurred. To define these modifications, we carried out a series of MS and MS/MS measurements after proteolytic digestion of the proteins, as described above. These digests provided progressively more detailed information that finally made it possible to characterize the differences among the BMV isolates.Figure 3ESI/TOF m/zspectrum of the BMV-P coat protein.

However, a prominent singly charged ion could be observed at m/z = 679.4 in the ESI spectrum, although not in its MALDI counterpart, and we realized that its mass is 42 Da greater than the predicted mass of the fragment encompassing residues 2–8. This is consistent with acetylation at the N terminus, a common post-translational modification. The acetylation was confirmed by the MS/MS spectrum of this parent ion shown in Fig.6, which contains a complete set of acetylated b ions together with a complete set of y ions, of which only y7 (i.e. the parent ion [M+H]+) is acetylated. Moreover, the diagnostic ion atm/z = 679.4 is present in the ESI spectra from the digests of all samples tested, consistent with N-terminal acetylation of the BMV coat protein (and deletion of the N-terminal methionine) for all the BMV isolates. This observation proved to be the key that allowed us to determine the complete coat protein sequences of all the isolates examined.Figure 4MALDI/TOF m/zspectrum of a Lys-C digest of the BMV-P coat protein.

Plant Dis. 1983; 67: 1194-1196Crossref Google Scholar) is the simplest case. The N-terminal of its coat protein is acetylated, but its mass and the masses of its peptide digest fragments are otherwise identical with those deduced from the published type sequence (24DasGupta R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), consistent with the absence of any other modification. MS/MS measurements confirmed this result, as well as the absence of zero-sum mutations.BMV-PProminent ions at m/z = 445 are found in both ESI and MALDI spectra (Figs. 4 and 5) and in the ESI parent ion spectrum (Fig. 6), consistent with the predicted mass of residues 20–22, and thus reducing the unknown region to residues 23–26. The only alteration in that region consistent with the overall mass is a substitution of Arg for Trp at residue 23, and this interpretation is supported by the observation of ions atm/z = 347.0 (sequence 24–26,TAR), 503.2 (sequence 23–26, RTAR) and 601.4 (sequence 20–23, RNRR) (see also BMV-T measurements below). The modification is consistent with a single base change of the nucleic acid sequence (UGG to CGG). Together with acetylation at the N terminus, it then accounts fully for the observed mass differences (Tables I and II) between BMV-P and the published type sequence (24DasGupta R. Shih D.S. Saris C.

In addition, they appear in the BMV-T parent ion scan for m/z = 175, an Arg marker (Fig. 7). However, the most convincing evidence for the Trp → Arg modification was obtained when fragments from a Lys-C digestion of BMV-T (pv47) were analyzed in the MALDI-QqTOF instrument (Table III), enabling high mass accuracy to be obtained for both parents and daughters. The ion observed at m/z = 3685.106 has a mass 29.973 Da smaller than the value deduced from the published nucleotide sequence for fragment 9–41, consistent with the modification Trp → Arg (calculated mass difference Δm = 29.978 Da). MS/MS measurements confirmed that Trp had indeed mutated to Arg at residue 23 in BMV-T, as well as in BMV-P.Figure 7Parent ion scans ofm/z 175 on the triple quadrupole instrument for isolates of BMV-T (type pv47), BMV-W (Western wheatgrass), BMV-P (Portage), and BMV-V (Valverde), digested by Lys-C protease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIIPeptide mapping of the Lys-C digested BMV-T(pv47) coat protein by MALDI QqTOF MSFragment3-aValues listed are monoisotopic masses (Da).m/z(obs.)MH+ (calc.)Δ (mDa)Peptide sequence9–413685.1063685.1013-bModified peptide.+5(K) MTRAQRRAAARRNRWTARVQPVIVEPL AAGQGK (A) −29.973 Da (W⇒R)24–411834.0541834.055−1(W) TARVQPVIVEPLAAGQGK (A)27–411505.8711505.869+2(R) VQPVIVEPLAAGQGK (A)27–643868.1443868.122+22(R) VQPVIVEPLAAGQGKAIKAIAGYSISK WEASSDAITAK (A)45–53909.502909.505−3(K) AIAGYSISK (W)45–642069.0492069.056−7(K) AIAGYSISKWEASSDAITAK (A)54–641178.5681178.569−1(K) WEASSDAITAK (A)65–811828.9101828.911−1(K) ATNAMSITLPHELSSEK (N)74–81926.452926.458−6(L) PHELSSEK (N)82–1052659.6652659.650+15(K) NKELKVGRVLLWLGLLPSVAGRIK (A)84–1052417.5132417.512+1(K) ELKVGRVLLWLGLLPSVAGRIK (A)87–1031806.1101806.112−2(K) VGRVLLWLGLLPSVAGR (I)87–1052047.2932047.291+2(K) VGRVLLWLGLLPSVAGRIK (A)87–1112648.5782648.580−2(K) VGRVLLWLGLLPSVAGRIKACVAEK (Q)112–1301904.9781904.972+6(K) QAQAEAAFQVALAVADSSK (E)131–1653773.9613773.946+15(K) EVVAAMYTDAFRGATLGDLLNLQIYLYA SEAVPAK (A)166–1892886.5032886.4943-bModified peptide.+9(K) AVVVHLEVEHVRPTFDDFFTPVYR (<) +14.024 Da (V⇒I/L)3-a Values listed are monoisotopic masses (Da).3-b Modified peptide. Open table in a new tab Another anomalous fragment ion was observed atm/z = 2886.503 (Table III). This is 14.024 Da larger than the mass of the deduced fragment encompassing residues 166–189, suggesting the substitution of Leu or Ile for Val (calculated Δm = 14.016 Da). Comparison of BMV-T and BMV-P spectra in the ESI parent ion scans gave Δ(m/z) = 4.6 (962.8–958.2) for the triply charged ion and Δ(m/z) = 3.7 (722.5–718.8) for the quadruply charged ion (Fig. 7), consistent with this interpretation. It was confirmed and localized by MALDI-MS/MS measurements on the ion atm/z = 2886, and ESI-MS/MS measurements of the corresponding triply charged ion at m/z= 963 (Table IV). All of the observed b ions from b2 to b24 have masses of 14 Da greater than predicted, localizing the modification at residue 167. Consistent with this observation, the C-terminal ions up to y22 have m/z values that agree with calculations made for the unmodified protein, whereas y24(i.e. the parent ion [M+H]+) is modified. Substitution of Ile or Leu for Val at residue 167 is therefore the only solution consistent with the MS measurements. It corresponds to a single base change of the nucleic acid sequence (GUC to AUC or CUC; see below). As expected, similar results were obtained from the BMV-1 (pv47) isolate.Table IVCID fragmentation of the singly charged ion of m/z 2886.50 (MALDI) and the triply charged ion of m/z 963.6 (ESI) from the BMV-T (pv47) peptide (residues 166–189, AVVVHLEVEHVRPTFDDFFTPVYR)b ion4-aValues listed are monoisotopic masses (Da).m/z(obs.)m (calc.)

In eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, the addition of a formyl group gives its full functional identity to initiator Met-tRNAMet. In Escherichia coli, it has been shown that the specific action of methionyl-tRNA transformylase on Met-tRNAfMet mainly involves a set of nucleotides in the acceptor stem, particularly a C1A72 mismatch. In animal mitochondria, only one tRNAMet species has yet been described. It is admitted that this species can engage itself either in initiation or elongation of translation, depending on the presence or absence of a formyl group. In the present study, we searched for the identity elements of tRNAMet that govern its formylation by bovine mitochondrial transformylase. The main conclusion is that the mitochondrial formylase preferentially recognizes the methionyl moiety of its tRNA substrate. Moreover, the relatively small importance of the tRNA acceptor stem in the recognition process accounts for the protection against formylation of the mitochondrial tRNAs that share with tRNAMet an A1U72motif.

Abnormalities in 4.1R are associated with congenital red cell defects leading to severe membrane fragmentation and hereditary elliptocytosis (9Delaunay J. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1995; 19: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The major functions of erythroid 4.1R have been well described. In brief, the 30-kDa NH2-terminal domain interacts with transmembrane proteins including glycophorin C, calmodulin, p55, and band 3 (6Pasternack G.R. Anderson R.A. Leto T.L. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol.

Tchernia G. Jensen R.H. Chasis J.A. Mohandas N. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 319: 553-571PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the 10-kDa or SAB1 domain is required for the formation and stabilization of spectrin-actin complexes (10Horne W.C. Huang S.C. Becker P.S. Tang T.K. Benz Jr., E.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 2558-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Schischmanoff P.O. Winardi R. Discher D.E. Parra M.K. Bicknese S.E. Witkowska H.E. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21243-21250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the erythrocyte system, the SAB domain is encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 16 (63 nts/21 amino acids) and the majority of the constitutive exon 17 (135 nts/45 amino acids out of 177 nts) (12Correas I. Leto T.L. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3310-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Discher D.E. Parra M.K. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectrin/actin/4.1R interactions have been extensively studied in red blood cells, indicating that inclusion of exon 16 along with amino acid residues carried by exon 17 are critical for spectrin/4.1R binary association, actin/4.1R direct interaction, and spectrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex formation (11Schischmanoff P.O. Winardi R. Discher D.E. Parra M.K. Bicknese S.E. Witkowska H.E. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21243-21250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). During the past 10 years, it has been shown that the prototypical erythroid 4.1R is only one of the multiple isoforms that arise from the single 4.1R gene through extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing (14Tang T.K. Qin Z. Leto T. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol.

Blood. 1996; 87: 3934-3941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, discrete internal sequence motifs are preferentially included or omitted in different non-erythroid tissues and organs, giving rise to a complex family of 4.1R modular isoforms. Moreover, three novel 4.1-like genes were recently added to the already complex NF2/ERM/4.1 gene family, namely4.1G, 4.1N, and 4.1B(18Peters L. Weier H.U.G. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Parra M. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Genomics. 1998; 54: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 4.1G is widely expressed among different tissues and organs (19Parra M. Gascard P. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Genomics. 1998; 49: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas 4.1N and 4.1B appear to be confined in the peripheral and central neurons and the brain, respectively (19Parra M.

Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 248: 137-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A significant degree of homology within the 30-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa domains is shared by 4.1R and the three 4.1-like genes, whereas the NH2 terminus and intervening sequences appear diverse and highly specific. Specifically, a 73% identity is shared between 4.1R- and 4.1G-SAB domains (19Parra M. Gascard P. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Genomics. 1998; 49: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas a 36% similarity exists between the respective 4.1R and 4.1N domains (22Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins W.W. Weier H.U.G. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, brain 4.1B exhibits an ∼50% homology within the COOH-terminal 45 residues of 4.1R-10-kDa carried by exon 17 (23, 24). Spectrin is a major component of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton, where it plays an essential role in the maintenance of the mechanical stability and shape of the cell membrane (25Bennet V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 27-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Erythroid spectrin consists of two subunits, encoded by αI andβI genes, that are aligned side to side to form heterodimers, which in turn assemble by head to head association to form tetramers (αIβI)2. In 1981, however, Goodmanet al. (26Goodman S.R. Zagon I.A. Kulikowski R.R Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7570-7574Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of spectrin-like proteins in several non-erythroid cells and tissues. Up until this day, five distinct genes encoding non-erythroid spectrin-like molecules have been described in mammals, including αII, βII, βIII, βIV, andβV (27Davis J. Bennet V. J. Biol.

J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 2088-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Initial observations by Burns et al. (35Burns N.R. Ohanian V. Gratzer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) indicated that fodrin, F-actin, and erythroid-4.1R form a ternary complex, linking the fodrin tetramers into a hexagonal lattice. Furthermore, Tyler et al. (36Tyler J.M. Reinhardt R.N. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7034-7039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Liu et al. (37Liu S.C. Derick L.H. Palek J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) demonstrated that β-fodrin carries binding sites for protein 4.1R and actin at its NH2 terminus (reviewed in Ref. 38De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study we endeavored to decipher the minimal sequences within brain 4.1R-SAB domain required for fodrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex formation. Moreover, we assessed the ability of the respective domains of the 4.1-homologs, 4.1G, 4.1N, and 4.1B, to induce fodrin/actin association in vitro. Finally, we investigated the potential in vivo association of 4.1 proteins with fodrin tetramers and actin in the neuronal PC12 cell line. Our results suggest that brain 4.1R and 4.1G may be essential for the maintenance of the shape and membrane structural integrity of neural cells, through their involvement in the formation and/or stabilization of the fodrin-actin complexes. To the contrary, 4.1N and 4.1B appear to have distinct functional activities in neuronal tissues from stabilizing the cytoskeletal fodrin/actin network. Mouse and rat tissue samples were dissected after perfusion of the animals via the left ventricular ascending aorta with 1× PBS, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and ground to fine powder. Total RNA from several tissues and two cell lines (PC12 and MOLT4) was prepared using Trizol Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subsequently, 5 μg of total RNA were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following standard experimental protocols. The primers used in the PCR amplification reaction were chosen to flank the 4.1R-SAB domain and were as follows: primer a (within exon 13), nts 1815–1847, 5′-AAAGGTACCATCGATGCTGTCGATTCGGCAGACCGAAGTCCTCGGCCC-3′ (sense) and primer b (located in exon 17), nts 2321–2351, 5′-AAAGGTACCATCGATTCCTGTGGGGATTTGCCCATTGATGTTAAG-3′ (antisense) (17Baklouti F. Huang S.C. Tang T.K. Delaunay J. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3934-3941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-4Z (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA), and a number of clones obtained from separate PCR amplifications were analyzed by sequencing (T7 Sequenase version 2.0 kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). GST-4.1R-10-kDa peptides, shown in Fig. 2,A and B, were prepared by PCR amplification using a rat brain cDNA clone as template and the following sets of primers: (i) primers a and b; (ii) primer c, 5′-ATGGATCCAAGGATTTAGACAAGAGTCA-3′, and primer g, 5′-ATGAATTCGAAGGGTGAGTGTGTGGACA-3′; (iii) primer d, TAGGATCCAAGGTGGAAAAACCCCACAC-3′, and primer g; (iv) primer e, 5′-TAGGATCCAAGAAGCTTGCAGAAAAAGG-3′, and primer g; and (v) primer f, 5′-TAGGATCCAAGAAAAAGAGAGAGAGACT-3′, and primer g. Similarly, the 4.1R-SAB domain deletion peptides, shown in Fig. 3 A, were generated with the use of the sense primer d in combination with the antisense primers g and h, 5′-GTCCCACTCGCTGGGCCGTGGTT-3′; primer i, 5′-TGATTCCATAAAGTTCTTTTTCAG-3′; or primer j, 5′-GATGCTGGCATGATGCTTCTTGA-3′. A two-step PCR approach was used to generate the lysine deletion construct with the set of primers d and k, 5′-AGTTCTTCAGTTCACTGATGCTGGCATGATG-3′ (antisense), and primer l, 5′-AACTGAAGAACTTTATGGAATCAGT-3′, (sense) and primer g. To produce the respective 4.1G, 4.1N, and 4.1B SAB domains, RT-PCR of total RNA, obtained from rat brain, was employed using the following sets of primers: for amplification of 4.1G-10-kDa, 5′-ACGAATTCGGAAAGAAAAATACCTTGAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTCGACGAGAGGCAGAGGTGTGACCCG-3′ (antisense); for production of 4.1N-10-kDa, 5′-ACGAATTCACTAAGATCAAGGAGCTGAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTCGACTGAGGGCAGCCTGCGCTCCCG-3′ (antisense); and for generation of 4.1B-10-kDa, 5′-ACGAATTCGCAGCTGATGGAGAGACCAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACGTCGACCACGGGAGATGTAGAGAGCCT-3′ (antisense). Subsequently, the amplified fragments were subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and verified by sequencing (T7 Sequenase version 2.0 kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The recombinant polypeptides were overexpressed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and purified from bacterial lysate supernatant by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. A mixture of protease inhibitors (39Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J.

The GST fusion polypeptides were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and either visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting.Figure 3Sequences within the constitutive exon 17 are necessary to induce fodrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex formation.

The accession numbers of 4.1G, 4.1N, and 4.1B cDNAs are AF044312, AB019256, and AAD38048“>AAD38048, respectively. Synthetic peptides N-EKTHIEVTVPTSNGD-C, N-KLAEKTEDLIRMR-C, and N-KKKRERLDGENIYIR-C, corresponding to 4.1R-exons 14, 15, and 16, respectively, were used as immunogens for generation of polyclonal antibodies (Ab). The anti-Exon14, anti-Exon15, and anti-Exon16 antibodies were subsequently affinity-purified using the Sulfolink-kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The 4.1R anti-16-kDa antibody was produced and purified as described previously (14Tang T.K. Qin Z. Leto T. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-fodrin Ab was a generous gift from Dr. R. J. Bloch (University of Maryland) and was generated against purified bovine brain α-fodrin. It can recognize both α- and β-fodrin isoforms, whereas reactivity to erythrocyte α-spectrin was eliminated by pre-adsorption on Sepharose 4B coupled to erythroid α-spectrin (40Porter G.A. Scher M.G. Resneck W.G. Porter N.C. Fowler V.M. Bloch R.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Finally, the rabbit anti-4.1G and anti-4.1N and the goat anti-4.1B IgGs were kindly provided by Drs. P. Gascard, N. Mohandas, and J. Conboy (University of California, Berkeley, CA), and a monoclonal anti-β-actin Ab (clone AC-15) was purchased from Sigma. Fodrin purification was carried out as described previously (41Cheney R. Levine J. Willard M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, rat brains (∼10 g) were dissolved in homogenization buffer (10 mm imidazole HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mmNaN3, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.3) after removal of the meninges and major blood vessels. Fodrin was extracted in a high salt buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm NaN3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8.2), (NH4)2SO4-precipitated, and gel-filtrated through Sepharose 4B-CL, previously equilibrated with TKE/KCl (10 mm Tris-HCl, 700 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8.2). Subsequently, the fodrin-rich fractions, as assessed by 8% SDS-PAGE, were combined and followed by a second (NH4)2SO4precipitation, dialysis against a low salt precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8.2), and sedimentation through a linear sucrose gradient (5–20%) in TKE/KCl buffer. The pooled fractions from the sucrose gradient were dialyzed either against storage buffer (1 mmNa2HPO4, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8.0) or binding buffer (130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm DTT, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) (42Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ultrafiltration with Centriprep-100 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) was used to concentrate the fodrin preparation, and the purity of the protein was assayed by 8% SDS-PAGE. In all purification steps 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor was included. Iodination of brain fodrin was essentially carried out as described (43Hunter W.M. Grennwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (5837) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of purified fodrin (4 μg/μl) was incubated in an equal volume of reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.025% NaN3, pH 7.5) plus 10 μl of 0.2% chloramine T in the presence of 5 μl (0.5mCi) of 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 min on ice. To stop the reaction, 40 μl of in situ prepared 1% Na2S2O5 and 40 μl of 1% KI were added sequentially. Iodinated fodrin was extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against binding buffer to remove any unreacted label with the use of Dispo-Biodialyzers (Amika Corp., Columbia, MD). Commercially obtained muscle G-actin was polymerized at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO). Purified brain fodrin, recombinant GST fusion polypeptides, and F-actin were subsequently dialyzed against several changes of binding buffer at 4 °C. Co-sedimentation assays were performed in 50 μl of binding buffer in the presence of 0.2 μm fodrin, 5.7 μm F-actin, and 1.4 μm either of GST-4.1R, GST-4.1G, GST-4.1N, GST-4.1B, or GST-alone polypeptides. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g in a Beckman 42.2Ti rotor. Equivalent portions of supernatants and pellets were subsequently fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. For quantitative binding studies 0.2 μm radioiodinated fodrin was allowed to interact with 5.7 μm F-actin in the presence of increasing amounts of either recombinant GST-4.1R-10-kDa or GST-4.1G-10-kDa polypeptides (0.14–1.4 μm). The pelleted protein complexes were subsequently counted in a γ-counter, whereas correction for fodrin/F-actin sedimentation was made by subtracting the counts pelleted in the absence of GST-4.1R or GST-4.1G peptides. These experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated twice, producing values with a range difference of ≤5%. Rat PheoChromocytoma cells (PC12) (21Ye K. Compton D.A. Lai M.M. Walensky L.D. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10747-10756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C with 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. Adhered cells were washed 3× with PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Unreactive groups were blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. In single labeling experiments the following primary antibodies were utilized: anti-Exon16 (4.1R, 1:100), anti-4.1G (1:200), and anti-fodrin in PBS plus 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Following extensive washes in PBS, cells were counterstained either with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate or goat anti-rabbit Texas Red IgGs (1:50, Pierce) at 37 °C for 1 h and extensively washed with PBS. In double labeling experiments, after the first set of staining, PC12 cells were blocked for 8 h at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml unconjugated goat anti-rabbit Fab fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in PBS and then processed for the second set of immunolabeling. Subsequently, coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed either under a Nikon microphot FXA microscope (Garden City, NY) or a laser scanning confocal system (Noran Instruments, Middleton, WI) combined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Thornwood, NY) through a 100× oil immersion objective. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed using PC12 cell extracts as described previously (44Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Huang S.C. Benz Jr., E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 111: 3805-3817Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with some modifications. About 4 × 106 cells were collected by scraping with a rubber policeman, washed 3× in ice-cold PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmiodoacetamide, pH 7.5) plus protease inhibitors (39Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and given 20 strokes in a tight-fitting glass homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein content was determined using a standard Bradford assay (Pierce), and 750 μg of total lysate were precleared with 150 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose-6MB beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a 4 °C rocker for 2 h. Pre-immune serum, anti-Exon16, and anti-fodrin antibodies, containing 5 μg of IgGs, were allowed to interact with 150 μl of protein A-Sepharose-6MB in the presence of 1× PBS at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 4 h. Subsequently, the antibodies bound to the beads were incubated with the precleared PC12 extracts in a rocking platform at 4 °C for 6–8 h. Following the end of the incubation period, the samples were centrifuged for 15–20 s at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C, and the beads were extensively washed with several changes of lysis buffer by rocking at 4 °C. At the end of the washings the proteins were solubilized in 100 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies (see “Results”) using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To characterize the splicing patterns within the non-erythroid 4.1R-SAB domain, total RNA from several tissues of rat or mouse origin was subjected to RT-PCR analysis followed by sequencing. Three alternatively spliced cassettes encoded by exons 14 (57 nts), 15 (42 nts), and 16 (63 nts) along with the majority of the constitutive exon 17 (135 out of 177 nts) compose the non-erythroid 4.1R-10-kDa. These exhibited complex splicing patterns resulting in the generation of multiple combinatorial products that were expressed in variable amounts among different non-erythroid tissues and cell lines (Fig.1 A). Interestingly, adult rat brain and undifferentiated PC12 cells contained a substantial amount of a bigger size PCR product that included all three alternatively spliced exons 14–16, although additional PCR bands were also detected that corresponded to different exonic combinations. Sequence comparison of exons 14–16 from several species, including human, mouse, rat, and bovine, revealed extensive evolutionary conservation of these motifs with only few nucleotide changes (Fig. 1 B). To identify the exons within the 4.1R-SAB required for stimulation of fodrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex formation, we generated various GST-4.1R-10-kDa recombinant peptides that carried distinct combinations of the alternative spliced cassettes 14–16 (Fig.2 A). The authenticity of the resultant fusion polypeptides was verified by immunoblot assays with the use of appropriate anti-4.1R antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Subsequently, the ability of recombinant GST-4.1R-10-kDa variants to promote fodrin/actin association was tested in a series of co-sedimentation assays (Fig. 2 C). In all cases in which 4.1R-10-kDa peptides carried the alternatively spliced exon 16 along with the constitutive 45 residues carried by exon 17, a significant, almost complete, shift of fodrin from the supernatant to the pellet fraction was observed either in the presence or absence of exons 14 and 15. On the contrary, when the 63-nt cassette encoded by exon 16 was omitted, almost equivalent amounts of fodrin were detected in both supernatant and pellet fractions. These results were similar to control experiments in which the 4.1R-10-kDa was omitted. Thus, the 4.1R-SAB domain stimulates co-sedimentation of fodrin and F-actin in"
https://openalex.org/W2061267962,"Sequence similarity among and electrophysiological studies of known potassium channels, along with the three-dimensional structure of the Streptomyces lividans K+ channel (KcsA), support the tenet that voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv channels) consist of two distinct modules: the “voltage sensor” module comprising the N-terminal portion of the channel up to and including the S4 transmembrane segment and the “pore” module encompassing the C-terminal portion from the S5 transmembrane segment onward. To substantiate this modular design, we investigated whether the pore module of Kv channels may be replaced with the pore module of the prokaryotic KcsA channel. Biochemical and immunocytochemical studies showed that chimeric channels were expressed on the cell surface ofXenopus oocytes, demonstrating that they were properly synthesized, glycosylated, folded, assembled, and delivered to the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, surface-expressed homomeric chimeras did not exhibit detectable voltage-dependent channel activity upon both hyperpolarization and depolarization regardless of the expression system used. Chimeras were, however, strongly dominant-negative when coexpressed with wild-type Kv channels, as evidenced by the complete suppression of wild-type channel activity. Notably, the dominant-negative phenotype correlated well with the formation of stable, glycosylated, nonfunctional, heteromeric channels. Collectively, these findings imply a structural compatibility between the prokaryotic pore module and the eukaryotic voltage sensor domain that leads to the biogenesis of non-responsive channels. Our results lend support to the notion that voltage-dependent channel gating depends on the precise coupling between both protein domains, probably through a localized interaction surface.

Protein sequence information obtained from recombinant DNA technology has revealed that voltage-gated ion channels form a large superfamily of related proteins that include Na+, Ca2+, and K+channels. Voltage-gated K+ channels are involved in a host of cellular processes, from setting the resting membrane potential and shaping action potential waveform and frequency to controlling synaptic strength (1Rudy B. Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The first K+ channel cloned from theDrosophila Shaker locus (2Tempel B. Papazian D. Schwarz T. Jan Y. Jan L. Science. 1987; 237: 770-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) seemed to code for a unit similar to one of the four internal repeats of the more complex Na+ and Ca2+ channels, consisting of six α-helical transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and a pore-forming loop (P-loop) (3Noda M. Shimizu S. Tanabe T. Takai T. Kayano T. Ikeda T. Takahashi H. Nakayama H. Kanaoka Y. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Raftery M.A. Hirose T. Inayama S. Hayashida H. Miyata T. Numa S.

The sequence similarity between voltage-gated K+ channels and voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+channels suggested a modular architecture of the voltage-gated ion channel family. In this modular context, the N-terminal portion of the eukaryotic voltage-gated proteins up to and including the S4 segment may represent a sensor module, responsible for detecting changes in transmembrane potential (5Greenblatt R. Blatt Y. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This notion appears warranted since work in several laboratories combining mutagenesis and biophysics has demonstrated that perturbation of this domain selectively affects channel gating without altering the permeation properties (6Jan L.

Indeed, conduction can be abolished by a pore mutation without affecting channel gating (14Perozo E. MacKinnon R. Bezanilla F. Stefani E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 353-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Examination of the sequence of subsequently cloned potassium channels from diverse sources also substantiates the existence of modularity within the voltage-gated potassium channels (15Montal M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 31-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Montal M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17Nelson R. Kuan G. Saier M. Montal M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 1: 281-287Google Scholar). The genes coding for the inward rectifier class of potassium channels code for a protein analogous to the carboxyl-terminal portion of the voltage-gated potassium channels, the S5-P-S6 region (18Ho K. Nichols C. Lederer W. Lytton J. Vassilev P. Kanazirska V. Hebert S. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). These genes are sufficient to form potassium-selective pores, but with poor intrinsic voltage sensitivity. Further evidence for the modular organization of the potassium channels was provided by the identification of a class of channels consisting of two pore modules, with (19Ketchum K. Joiner W. Sellers A. Kaczmarek L. Goldstein S. Nature. 1995; 376: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or without (20Lesage F. Guillermare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J.

EMBO J. 1996; 18: 1004-1011Crossref Scopus (453) Google Scholar) an attached “sensor” module. More recently, a novel structural class of mammalian potassium channels has been discovered, with four transmembrane segments and two pore regions (TWIK-1, TREK-1, TRAAK, TASK, and TASK-2), and activated by different kind of stimuli such as membrane stretch and modification of pH (22Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honore E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The identification of the KcsA channel fromStreptomyces lividans has shown that this channel has the closest kinship to the S5-P-S6 region of the Kv channel family. Moreover, KcsA is most distantly related to eukaryotic inwardly rectifying channels with two putative predicted transmembrane segments (23Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kümmerlen R. Hinnah S. Müller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Single-channel recording, flux measurements, and ligand binding assays have shown KcsA to be a high-conductance, tetrameric, K+-selective channel with an externally located receptor site for charybdotoxin family peptides (24Cortes M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 25Heginbotham L. Le Masurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 26MacKinnon R. Cohen S. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In addition, the recent crystallization of the KcsA protein has provided a structure for such a pore module, enlightening our knowledge of the molecular basis of ion permeation (27Doyle D. Cabral J. Pfuetzner R. Kuo A. Gulbis J. Cohen S. Chait B. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5695) Google Scholar). The sequence similarity between KcsA and Kv channels has led to the notion that the prokaryotic channel may be the bacterial ancestor of the pore module present in eukaryotic channels (23Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kümmerlen R. Hinnah S. Müller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears reasonable that voltage-gated potassium channels are structurally modular. It has been recently demonstrated, in channel proteins consisting of the sensor module from mouse Kv1.1 (mKv1.1)1 and the pore module from fly Shaker with inactivation ball removed channel (Shaker), and vice versa, that these putative modules can operate outside their native context (28Patten C. Caprini M. Plannells-Cases R. Montal M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 17: 375-381Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To further substantiate the modular design of the Kv channel family, we examined whether it would be feasible to confer voltage sensitivity to the voltage-insensitive prokaryotic ancestor KcsA channel by linking its pore domain to the voltage sensor of eukaryotic Kv channels. Thus, we constructed chimeric channels by replacing the pore domain of mKv1.1 and Shaker with the pore module of the KcsA channel (23Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kümmerlen R. Hinnah S. Müller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Chimeric Kv channels appear to proceed via appropriate biogenesis pathways, as evidenced by their normal translation, glycosylation, folding, and delivery to the plasma membrane of the injected oocytes. Heterologously expressed chimeras did not show detectable voltage-gated ionic current, although they behaved as strong dominant-negative subunits, completely inhibiting the channel activity of wild-type mKv1.1 and Shaker channels. Taken together, these results lend support to the notion of structural compatibility of both protein domains. Our findings also suggest a higher degree of molecular adaptability for functional coupling of both protein modules. Standard molecular biological techniques were as described (29Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E., Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). Shaker (30Stefani E. Toro L. Perozo E. Bezanilla F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 996-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) was a gift of L. Toro (UCLA), and KcsA was from S. Choe (Salk Institute). Three versions of KcsA-containing chimeras were designed, and a hemagglutinin (HA) peptide tag was included at the carboxyl-terminal end of mKv1.1 and all chimeric coding regions for immunodetection of the expressed protein. The mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA chimera was constructed by replacing the region of mKv1.1 encompassing the S5 segment to the C-terminal end (amino acids 321–481) with the corresponding residues of KcsA (amino acids 27–160). Polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a silent ClaI site in mKv1.1 at amino acids 321 and 322. Two oligonucleotide primers were also used to amplify KcsA from amino acid 27 through the stop codon while simultaneously introducing aClaI site at amino acid 27 and a BamHI at amino acid 160, subsequently used to subclone KcsA into pGEMHE/mKv1.1. Note that this cloning strategy left a 14-amino acid segment from mKv1.1 (amino acids 482–495) at the C-terminal end of KcsA. The mKv1.1(S1–S4)-KcsA chimera was constructed by replacing the region encompassed by the S4–S5 loop up to the C-terminal end of mKv1.1 (amino acids 311–481) with the complete KCSA gene. Polymerase chain reaction was used to introduce a silentPstI site in mKv1.1 at amino acids 311 and 312. KcsA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, inserting PstI andBamHI sites at amino acids 1 and 160, respectively. The amplified fragment was then subcloned into a silentPstI site and the BamHI site into pGEMHE/mKv1.1. The Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA chimera was constructed by replacing the region of Shaker from amino acid 351 onward with KcsA. A silentClaI site was introduced in Shaker at amino acids 350 and 351. A fragment of KcsA from the first chimera cut at theClaI and EcoRV sites 3′ of the stop codon was subcloned into pBluescript/Shaker between the ClaI site and a blunted XhoI site 3′ of the stop codon. The sequences of the transferred segments were verified by both restriction analysis and dideoxy sequencing (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52414) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, chimeric and wild-type channel clones were linearized and used as templates with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). For expression in COS-7 mammalian cells, mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA, Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA, and wild-type mKv1.1 were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Promega). Enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP; gift of R. Tsien, University of California, San Diego) was also subcloned into pCIneo. COS-7 cells (gift of M. Canossa, University of Bologna) were cultured as described (32Ferroni S. Planells-Cases R. Ahmed C.M.I. Montal M. Eur. Biophys. J. 1992; 21: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The day prior to transfection, COS-7 cells were replated in 35-mm Petri dishes at a density of 2–5 × 104 cells/dish and maintained in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. COS-7 cells were transfected with the constructs and GFP by the DEAE-dextran method and assayed for electrophysiological measurements 48–72 h post-transfection (33Luthman H. Magnusson G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1295-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Protein analysis for the different clones was carried out by Western immunoblotting. Oocytes (8–10/sample) were collected and lysed as described (34Sun W. Ferrer-Montiel A. Schinder A. McPherson J. Evans G. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Soluble materials from homogenized oocytes were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose was blocked and probed with 4 μg/μl anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), anti-Shaker polyclonal antibody (gift of F. Tejedor, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas, Universidad Miguel Hernández), or anti-mKv1.1 antibody (Alomone), and proteins were detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). The bands were later visualized using the alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation was carried out with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (2.5 μg/ml) as described (35Ferrer-Montiel A. Canaves J. DasGupta B. Wilson M. Montal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18322-18325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Samples were then boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and electrophoresed as described above. Xenopus oocytes injected with transcripts of mKv1.1-HA or HA-tagged chimeras or water were selected 48 and 72 h post-injection, embedded in optimal cutting temperature resin (ProSciTech, Thuringowa, Australia), and quickly frozen. 12-μm-thick sections were cut and fixed in 2‥ formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Immunocytochemical labeling was carried out using an indirect alkaline phosphatase method. After blocking overnight 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2‥ bovine serum albumin and 0.2‥ Triton X-100, sections were incubated with 2.5 μg/μl anti-HA mAb for 90 min at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated for 90 min at room with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000;Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in phosphate-buffered saline. The reaction was detected using the Bio-Rad alkaline phosphatase kit. The coverslips were mounted in Eukitt (O. Kindler GmbH & Co., Freiburg, Germany), analyzed, and photographed using a Leica DMRB microscope. In vitro transcribed RNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes (∼10 ng/oocyte) as described (36Ferrer-Montiel A. Montal M. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 60-69Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ionic currents were recorded 2–4 days after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp (TEC 10CD, NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany) and PULSE Version 8.09 acquisition software (Heka Electronic, Lambrecht, Germany). The oocytes were continually perfused in barium-containing Ringer's solution (3.8 mmK+, 114.2 mm Na+, 2 mmBa2+, and 10 mm TES, pH 7.4). Electrodes were pulled from Corning 7052 glass (Garner Glass, Clairemont, CA) on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Electrodes were filled with 1 m KCl buffered with 10 mm TES and typically had a resistance of <500 kilo-ohms. The currents were sampled at 4–5 kHz after filtering at 1 kHz. Leak subtraction was accomplished with two inverted quarter amplitude prepulses that were scaled and subtracted from the test pulse. All recordings were made at room temperature (∼21 °C). Membrane currents were recorded in the whole-cell configuration as described in detail (37Hamill P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15098) Google Scholar). Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (Clark Electromedical, Pangbourne, United Kingdom) using a horizontal puller (P-87, Sutter Instrument Co.) and heat-polished (MF-83, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) to have a resistance of 2–4 megaohms when filled with the standard internal solution (144 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, and 5 mm EGTA, buffered with KOH to pH 7.2). All experiments were performed with an external solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm TES, and 5 mm glucose, buffered with NaOH to pH 7.4. Voltage stimulation and current recordings were obtained with a patch-clamp amplifier (Jens Meyer, Munich, Germany) interfaced (Labmaster TL-1, Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) with a microcomputer equipped with pClamp Version 5.5.1 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The currents were low pass-filtered at 3 kHz (−3 dB) and acquired at different sampling rates according to the stimulation protocols. Capacitive transients and series resistance were minimized with the analog circuits of the amplifier. In some experiments, membrane currents were leak-subtracted by using a P/4 protocol (38Armstrong C. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). An agar bridge electrode, filled with 150 mm NaCl, was used as the reference electrode. All experiments were performed at room temperature (∼21 °C). Given that KcsA exhibits significant sequence similarity to the S5-P-S6 region of Kv channels, it was hypothesized that a chimeric construct consisting of the ancestor KcsA linked to the putative eukaryotic voltage sensor would exhibit voltage-dependent gating properties. For this task, we constructed chimeric channels that combined the S1–S4 domain of mKv1.1 or Shaker and the S5-P-S6 domain of the KcsA channel (Fig.1, A–C, left panels). These chimeras are referred to as mKv1.1(S1–S4)-KcsA, mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA, and Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA, where S1–S4 denotes the N-terminal domain of the Kv channels up to and including the S4 transmembrane segment and S1–S4,5 additionally incorporates the S4–S5 loop from the eukaryotic channels. We considered the intracellular S4–S5 loop because of its contribution to pore properties (39Slesinger P. Jan Y. Jan L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of all chimeras was tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope to facilitate the biochemical and immunological analyses. We first assessed whether the designed chimeras exhibit voltage-dependent channel gating. As illustrated in Fig. 1(A–C, right panels), at variance with wild-type mKv1.1 and Shaker, heterologous expression of the mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA, mKv1.1(S1–S4)-KcsA, and Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA chimeras did not elicit voltage-activated outward currents from oocytes held at −80 mV and depolarized from −70 to +100 mV (n= 32). The lack of functional expression was not overcome by larger hyper- or depolarizing steps, by injecting increasing amounts of cRNA, or by co-injecting the α- and β-subunits (data not shown). At variance with homomeric wild-type Shaker-expressing oocytes, chimera-injected cells did not display gating currents (data not shown). The absence of functional expression was not due to lack of protein synthesis, as evidenced by immunodetection of the heterologously expressed chimeras (Fig. 1 E). The immunoblot displays the presence of two bands with molecular masses of ∼60 and ∼62 kDa in oocytes injected with mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA (Fig.1 E, lanes 2 and 6) and Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA (lanes 3 and 7) chimeras, respectively. mKv1.1-injected oocytes exhibited a band of ∼67 kDa (Fig. 1 E, lanes 1 and 5). These proteins were selectively immunopurified with anti-HA mAb (Fig.1 E, lanes 5–7) We next addressed the question of whether the heterologous expression system was inadequate for expression of chimeras. cDNAs encoding chimeric channels were then cotransfected in COS-7 cells with GFP to facilitate detection of transfected cells. Fluorescent cells were selected for electrophysiological measurements (Fig.2 A). As for oocytes, transfection of chimeras did not result in the expression of voltage-dependent ionic currents in response to either depolarizing steps up to +60 mV or hyperpolarization to −130 mV (n = 23) (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, cells transfected with mKv1.1 or Shaker channels expressed sustained outward currents with kinetic properties overlapping those obtained in oocytes (data not shown). Since strong acidification (pH < 5) favors KcsA channel gating (25Heginbotham L. Le Masurier M. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we investigated whether extra- and intracellular acidification (pH 4) could promote the appearance of voltage-gated channel activity in chimera-transfected cells. The data indicate that neither extracellular (n = 4) (Fig. 2 D) nor intracellular (n = 5) (data not shown) acidification evoked channel activity in response to voltage steps. These observations indicate that the linkage of the putative voltage sensor of Kv channels to KcsA does not endow the prokaryotic channel with voltage-dependent channel gating activity. To investigate if the translated chimeric subunits have the ability to interact with wild-type channel subunits, we examined whether the chimeras disturbed the channel activity exhibited by wild-type mKv1.1 and Shaker channels in a coexpression experiment.Xenopus oocytes were co-injected with both types of subunits, and the channel activity of the presumed heteromeric proteins was compared with that displayed by homomeric proteins. Total cRNA injected was constant in all samples. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, oocytes injected with wild-type subunits showed robust voltage-dependent channel activity. By contrast, coexpression of wild-type and chimeric subunits resulted in a virtually complete suppression of wild type-like channel activity. This negative dominance of chimeric subunits was more effective with wild-type mKv1.1 subunits than with wild-type Shaker subunits, as evidenced by the lower amount of chimeric subunit required to inhibit the functional activity of mKv1.1 channels (Fig.3 A). The reduction of wild-type channel activity was not due to injection of lower wild-type subunit cRNA amounts since the magnitude of voltage-elicited ionic currents remained fairly invariant as the cRNA injected was decreased from 20 ng (8.2 ± 2.1 μA for mKv1.1 (n = 4) and 12.2 ± 3.0 μA for Shaker (n = 4)) to 5 ng (6.1 ± 1.9 μA for mKv1.1 (n = 4) and 11.2 ± 2.7 μA for Shaker (n = 4)). Therefore, these data indicate a dominant-negative phenotype of the chimeras on wild-type channels. The occurrence of a dominant-negative phenotype suggests the formation of stable, nonfunctional, heteromeric channels composed of chimeric and wild-type subunits. We used an immunology-based strategy to evaluate this hypothesis. Oocytes co-injected with different molar ratios of wild-type (mKv1.1 or Shaker) and chimeric (mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA or Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA) subunits were lysed 72 h post-injection, and chimeric subunits were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA mAb, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Coprecipitation of mKv1.1 and Shaker subunits was revealed by immunoblotting using either an anti-mKv1.1 antibody raised against the C-terminal domain or an anti-Shaker antibody raised against the N-terminal portion, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3 B (upper panel), immunoblots probed with anti-Kv1.1 mAb revealed a band of >62 kDa corresponding to mKv1.1 in oocytes co-injected with mKv1.1 and mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA. A band of ≤62 kDa was also evident as the ratio of mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA was increased, indicating that the chimeric channels were also recognized by anti-mKv1.1 antibody, consistent with the presence of a small portion of the epitope in the chimeric subunit (Fig. 1 D). As expected, these protein bands were absent in mKv1.1-injected and non-injected oocytes. The intensity of the coprecipitated mKv1.1 subunit declined as the amount of mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA increased. In contrast, probing the same immunoblots with anti-HA mAb exposed a band of ≤62 kDa only in oocytes injected with mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA, which was augmented as the ratio of the chimeric subunit was increased (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). These data are consistent with the formation of stable hetero-oligomers composed of wild-type mKv1.1 and the mKv1.1(S1–S4,5)-KcsA chimera. Similarly, immunoblots probed with an anti-Shaker antibody raised against the N-terminal domain unmasked the presence of two major bands of ∼75 kDa corresponding to Shaker in oocytes injected exclusively with Shaker and Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA subunits and a band of ∼62 kDa corresponding to Shaker(S1–S4,5)-KcsA in oocytes containing chimeric subunits (Fig. 3 C). The intensity of the ∼75 kDa band became more faint while that of the ∼62 kDa band increased as the amount of chimeric transcripts was augmented in the coexpression system, indicating that the composition of the assembled heteromeric channels is a function of the subunit concentration. The presence of higher molecular mass bands (≥115 kDa) in the immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 C), which may correspond to fully N-glycosylated subunits in agreement with other reports (40Santacruz-Tolosa L.

Vav1 and PKCθ also cooperated to induce transcription of reporter genes controlled either by AP-1 binding sites or the CD28RE/AP composite element contained in the IL-2 promoter by stimulating the binding of transcription factors to these two elements. Dominant negative versions of Vav1 and PKCθ inhibited CD3/CD28-induced activation of JNK, revealing their relative importance for this activation pathway.

Several experimental approaches showed that Vav1 is located upstream from PKCθ in the control of the pathway leading to synergistic JNK activation. Vav1-derived signals lead to the activation of JNK by at least two different pathways.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Full activation of T-cells by T-cell antigen receptor/CD28 costimulation initiates a series of intracellular signaling events. A hallmark of costimulated T-cells is the synergistic activation of JNK,1 NF-κB, and IL-2 expression (2Jung S. Yaron A. Alkalay I. Hatzubai A. Avraham A. Ben-Neriah Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Receptor clustering leads to the activation of protein tyrosine kinases of the Src and Syk families, which phosphorylate numerous substrate proteins, thus leading to dynamic formation (3Myung P.S. Boerthe N.J. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or disruption (4Dienz O. Hehner S.P. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24547-24551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) of multi-protein signaling complexes. These complexes and the T-cell antigen receptor itself associate with lipid rafts, which form a structural scaffold and promote further signaling events (5Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Activated protein tyrosine kinases phosphorylate multiple target proteins including phospholipase Cγ, which controls the phosphatidyl inositol lipid metabolism, thereby producing inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerols (6Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Whereas inositol triphosphate results in a rapid and sustained calcium increase, diacylglycerol mediates activation of PKC family members (6Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 17: 155-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among those, the novel Ca2+-independent PKC isoform PKCθ is of special importance for T-cells, because it is rapidly recruited to the site of contact between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (8Monks C.R. Kupfer H. Tamir I. Barlow A. Kupfer A. Nature. 1997; 385: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Another protein tyrosine kinase-induced signaling route is mediated by the Vav1 protein family member Vav1, which is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells (9Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). T-cell costimulation induces the membrane recruitment of Vav1 via indirect, adaptor protein SLP-76-mediated binding to the membrane protein LAT (linker for activation of T-cells) (10Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dienz O. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18160-18171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine kinase-induced phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate binding of Vav1 activate its GDP/GTP exchange factor activity for the Rho family of GTPases such as Rac and Cdc42 (11Crespo P.

T-cell costimulation also leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. However, the synergistic activation appears to be unique for the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK and p38 (13Salojin K.V. Zhang J. Delovitch T.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 844-853PubMed Google Scholar), because neither extracellular signal-regulated kinase nor transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells require coreceptor-derived signals. JNK phosphorylates various transcription factors including ATF2, ELK-1, and components of the AP-1 heterodimer, namely JunB, JunD, and c-Jun (14Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). Because AP-1 contributes to the induced expression of numerous target genes including IL-2and IL-4, the JNK pathway has been implicated in various functions including cell proliferation, effector T-cell function (15Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), T-cell activation (16Sabapathy K. Hu Y. Kallunki T.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar). However, these functions are dependent on the inducing signal and the cell type (15Dong C. Yang D.D.

JNK is activated by the dual specificity JNK kinases (JNKKs) MKK4/JNKK1/SEK1 and JNKK2/MKK7 (17Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). A variety of different kinases can activate the JNKKs, but the cell type and the nature of the JNK-inducing stimulus determines which of these kinases is operational (14Davis R.J.

Li-Weber M. Giaisi M. Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3829-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because both DNA elements are bound by AP-1 family members, we tested the effects of Vav1 and PKCθ on the activation of JNK. A variety of experimental approaches revealed cooperative activation of JNK and AP-1-dependent gene expression by Vav1 and PKCθ. Jurkat T leukemia cells expressing the large T antigen were grown in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mg/ml G418, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were electroporated using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V/950 microfarads. In all transfections, the amount of total DNA (20 μg) was kept constant by the addition of empty expression vector. Stimulations were performed in a volume of 400 μl by adding agonistic αCD3 (final concentration of 10 μg/ml) and/or αCD28 (final concentration of 10 μg/ml) antibodies. The following antibodies were obtained from the indicated suppliers: αPhospho-p38, New England Biolabs; αFlag (M2), Sigma; αMyc (9E10), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; αVav1, Upstate Biotechnology; αPKCθ, Transduction Laboratories; αHA antibody (12CA5), Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Dröge W. Krammer P.H. Schmitz M.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3829-3836Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear protein were tested for protein binding to oligonucleotides containing either an AP-1 binding site or a CD28RE/AP element. The coding strands of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′; CD28RE/AP, 5′-TCTGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAG-3′. The free and the oligonucleotide-bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis the gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film (Amersham Hyperfilm). Luciferase activity in cell extracts was measured in a luminometer (Duo Lumat LB 9507, Berthold) by automatically injecting 50 μl of assay buffer and measuring light emission for 10 s after injection according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega Inc.). To ensure comparable transfection efficiencies, results were normalized to β-galactosidase produced by a cotransfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellets were resuspended on ice for 15 min in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Cell debris was pelleted upon centrifugation, and the supernatant was either directly analyzed by Western blotting or used for the determination of JNK activity as described below. After separation of cell extracts on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then incubated in a small volume of TBST buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 137 nm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing various dilutions of the primary antibodies. After extensively washing the membrane, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the instructions of the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Western blots were quantitated using the Lumi-ImagerTM from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Two days posttransfection, cell lysates were prepared and precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose. The HA-tagged JNK proteins contained in the cell lysate were precipitated by the addition of 1 μg of αHA antibody and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. The precipitate was washed three times in lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2). The kinase assay was performed in a final volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun-(5–89), 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× SDS loading buffer, followed by reducing SDS-PAGE, gel fixation, and quantification of the results in a PhosphorImager. The analysis of cellular multi-protein complexes was performed on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total cell extracts from 3 × 108Jurkat cells contained in 75 μl of octylglycoside lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmdithiothreitol, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), 1% (v/v) octylglycoside, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) were analyzed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and fractions of 500 μl were collected. Aliquots from the respective fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the occurrence of Vav1 and PKCθ. The washed columns were calibrated with pre-made molecular weight standards (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A possible synergism between Vav1 and PKCθ for the activation of JNK was tested by transfecting T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells with expression vectors for HA-tagged JNK together with vectors encoding constitutively active PKCθ (PKCθ A/E) and/or wild type Vav1. The tagged JNK protein was immunoprecipitated, and its kinase activity was determined by immune complex kinase assays (Fig.1 A). JNK activation triggered by expression of Vav1 and PKCθ alone was synergistically stimulated upon coexpression of both proteins. Costimulation with agonistic αCD3/αCD28 antibodies further triggered JNK activity elicited by Vav1, PKCθ A/E, or both. To determine whether the synergy between Vav1 and PKCθ also occurs for the activation of p38, Jurkat T-cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for Flag-tagged p38 together with different combinations of vectors encoding Vav1 and PKCθ A/E. The tagged p38 protein was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for its activation (as seen by Thr-180/Tyr-182 phosphorylation) in Western blot experiments (Fig. 1 B). These experiments showed that Vav1 and PKCθ activated p38 only in an additive, non-synergistic manner, thereby revealing that the cooperation only occurs for the activation of JNK. To test whether this synergism is also apparent at the level of induced AP-1 binding to its cognate DNA, different combinations of expression vectors for Vav1, PKCθ A/E, or the empty expression vector as a control were expressed in Jurkat cells. Analysis of AP-1 DNA binding activity by EMSAs showed that either Vav1 or PKCθ A/E alone induced DNA binding of AP-1, albeit to different extents. Coexpression of both proteins synergistically stimulated the DNA binding activity of AP-1 (Fig.2 B). The impact of Vav1/PKCθ expression on the activation of AP-1-dependent transcription was tested in reporter gene assays. An AP-1-dependent luciferase gene was transfected into Jurkat cells together with increasing amounts of Vav1 and/or PKCθ A/E expression vectors (Fig. 2 B). The slight induction of AP-1-dependent transcription mediated by Vav1 was strongly enhanced even by moderate amounts of coexpressed PKCθ A/E. These experiments revealed that the synergism also occurs at the level of DNA binding and gene expression.Figure 2Synergistic activation of AP-1 by Vav1 and PKC θ. A, Jurkat cells were transfected either with empty expression vector or with plasmids encoding Vav1 (10 μg) and/or PKCθ A/E (10 μg) at the indicated combinations. The next day, nuclear cell extracts were prepared, and the DNA binding activity of AP-1 was determined by EMSAs. An autoradiogram is displayed; the arrow indicates the location of the DNA-AP-1 complex, and the circle indicates the position of the unbound oligonucleotide. B, Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct together with increasing amounts of PKCθ A/E and/or Vav1 at the indicated combinations.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we asked whether Vav1/PKCθ-mediated JNK activation also targets gene expression directed from this sequence element. A construct controlled by four repeats of the CD28RE/AP element fused to the luciferase reporter gene (4xRE/AP-Luc) was cotransfected with increasing amounts of Vav1 and/or PKCθ expression vectors (Fig.3 A). Both proteins cooperatively boosted CD28RE/AP-dependent transcription. To test whether the Vav1/PKCθ-derived JNK activity targets the CD28RE or the AP-1 half-site within the composite element, reporter constructs with mutations in either or both half-sites were tested for their inducibility. Mutation of either half-site completely prevented Vav1/PKCθ-mediated transcription (Fig. 3 B), revealing a strong interdependence of both half-sites. The effects of Vav1 and PKCθ on protein binding to the CD28RE/AP element were investigated by EMSAs using the labeled CD28RE/AP element (Fig. 3 C). Neither Vav1 nor PKCθ alone were able to induce DNA binding, but coexpression of both proteins caused DNA binding of transcription factors contained in the inducible DNA-protein complexes Ia and Ib. Formation of both complexes, which are known to contain predominantly c-Fos and c-Jun proteins (31McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar), could be further triggered upon CD3/CD28 stimulation. In contrast to complex I, DNA-protein complexes II and III were already present in extracts from the untransfected, nonstimulated cells and showed no inducibility upon Vav1/PKCθ A/E coexpression and T-cell activation. The relatively moderate effects of Vav1/PKCθ on induced binding of proteins to the CD28RE/AP element can be attributed to the limited transfection efficiency of Jurkat cells. To investigate the relative importance of Vav1 and PKCθ for the CD3/CD28-mediated activation of JNK, the costimulation-induced activation of this mitogen-activated protein kinase was tested in the presence of DN versions of both signaling proteins. Coexpression of the kinase-deficient point mutant PKCθ K/R prevented JNK activation induced either by CD3/CD28 ligation or by treatment of cells with the pleiotropic PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate together with CD28 or the ionophore ionomycin (Fig.4 A). Similarly, two Vav1 variants with a mutation or a deletion in the Dbl homology domain (Vav1 LLL/QIF and Vav1Δ319–356), which is responsible for the activation of Rac, efficiently prevented CD3/CD28-triggered 32P incorporation into GST-c-Jun by JNK (Fig. 4 B). Vav1 and PKCθ are constitutively associated in unstimulated T-cells (18Kong Y.Y. Fischer K.D. Bachmann M.F. Mariathasan S. Kozieradzki I. Nghiem M.P. Bouchard D. Bernstein A. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2099-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) but can also interact with a battery of further proteins, as revealed by various experimental approaches (9Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 32Meller N. Altman A. Isakov N. Stem Cells ( Basel ). 1998; 16: 178-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Whereas T-cell costimulation leads to the recruitment of Vav1 into an inducible multi-protein complex (10Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dienz O. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18160-18171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the association partners of Vav1 in unstimulated cells are not well characterized. To directly address this question, unstimulated Jurkat cells were lysed, and proteins contained in the lysates were separated according to size by gel filtration. The analysis of fractions for the distribution of Vav1 and PKCθ revealed an identical elution profile for both proteins, as revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 5 A). The two fractions (22 and 23) containing most of Vav1 and PKCθ correspond to a molecular mass of ∼170 kDa, suggesting that both proteins exist predominantly as heterodimers. Because previous studies showed that T-cell costimulation leads to the disruption of the Vav1/PKCθ heterodimer (4Dienz O. Hehner S.P. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24547-24551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we investigated the distribution of Vav1 and PKCθ in extracts from CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. These experiments revealed the majority of Vav1 in high molecular weight complexes of various sizes up to very large aggregates of more than 1 MDa (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, most of the PKCθ protein coeluted with the 158-kDa marker protein, and only a minor fraction was found in larger complexes (Fig.5 B). The signaling pathways were characterized by monitoring the effect of coexpressed DN forms of protein kinases from the JNK activation pathway on the activation signals derived from Vav1, PKCθ, or both (Fig.6 A). A kinase-dead form of MEKK1 affected Vav1-mediated AP-1 activity only moderately but significantly inhibited PKCθ- and PKCθ/Vav1-generated signals. A comparison between DN forms of the JNKKs MKK4 and MKK7 revealed that Vav1-derived activation signals were only moderately blocked by expression of DN forms of each of these kinases. In contrast, simultaneous expression of kinase-inactive forms of MKK4 and MKK7 completely prevented Vav1-mediated AP-1 activation, indicating that both kinases can mutually compensate the functions of each other. PKCθ- and Vav1/PKCθ-derived signals were only partially impaired in the presence of DN MKK4 but efficiently blocked by MKK7 K/L, indicating the special importance of MKK7 for this pathway. We also tested the impact of pathway-specific inhibitory compounds on Vav1- and/or PKCθ-induced AP-1-dependent transcription (Fig. 6 B). Vav1-derived signaling, but not PKCθ- and Vav1/PKCθ-mediated AP-1 activation, was preferentially inhibited by cyclosporin A, a compound that blocks the Ca2+-dependent activation of the phosphatase calcineurin. The PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide blocked Vav1- and PKCθ-mediated AP-1 activity, raising the possibility that Vav1 acts upstream from PKCθ. To address this question directly, Jurkat cells were transfected with various combinations of active and inactive variants of Vav1 and PKCθ prior to stimulation with αCD3/αCD28 antibodies and subsequent analysis of JNK activity. Vav1-induced JNK activation was efficiently prevented by kinase-dead PKCθ K/R, but PKCθ A/E-mediated JNK activation was not affected by DN Vav1 LLL/QIF (Fig. 7 A). To investigate whether directional signaling also occurs at the level of AP-1-dependent transcription, an analogous experimental approach was taken by monitoring AP-1-dependent luciferase activity. Similarly, Vav1-induced transcription of the AP-1-dependent luciferase gene was inhibited upon coexpression of PKCθ K/R (Fig. 7 B) or the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (data not shown). In contrast, gene activation induced by PKCθ A/E was not affected by the DN Vav1 variant Vav1Δ319–356. In summary, these data clearly indicate that PKCθ acts downstream from Vav1 in a pathway leading to the activation of JNK. Here we show that Vav1 and PKCθ synergize for the induction of JNK. Because these two proteins also cooperate for the up-regulation of NF-κB, the simultaneous activation of several pathways may be important for the efficient transcription of target genes, because many promoters (e.g. the IL-2 and IL-4 promoter) depend on the coordinated activation of several transcription factors. Interestingly, PKCθ does not only synergize with Vav1 (this study) but also with calcineurin for the activation of JNK (22Werlen G. Jacinto E. Xia Y. Karin M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The Vav1 protein cooperates with SLP-76 and Syk family kinases for the activation of IL-2 transcription and nuclear factor of activated T-cells activation, respectively (33Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 34Deckert M. Tartare Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). One could speculate that the synergistic behavior of signaling proteins for the initiation of T-cell signaling pathways may be an important regulatory principle, especially early in infection when only low doses of antigen are present, but an efficient cellular response is required. In that respect it will be interesting to analyze signaling pathways and the immune response in Vav1/PKCθ double knockout mice in future experiments. In this study we show that at least the abundant fraction of PKCθ and Vav1 proteins is present as heterodimers in unstimulated cells under the conditions used here. Given the importance of both proteins for the initiation of various signaling pathways (10Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dienz O. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18160-18171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Meller N. Altman A. Isakov N. Stem Cells ( Basel ). 1998; 16: 178-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the necessity to keep activation pathways in nonstimulated T-cells silent (35Rudd C.E. Schneider H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R344-R347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Sosinowski T. Pandey A. Dixit V.M. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this heterodimerization might serve the purpose of keeping both proteins in an inactive state. T-cell activation leads to the transient dissociation of Vav1 and PKCθ by an unknown mechanism (4Dienz O. Hehner S.P. Dröge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24547-24551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the incorporation of Vav1 into temporally regulated and highly dynamic and semi-stable multi-protein signaling complexes (37Pacini S. Valensin S. Telford J.L. Ladbury J. Baldari C.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2620-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used here, only a minor fraction of the PKCθ protein is incorporated into high molecular weight complexes in stimulated T-cells. It will be interesting to investigate the composition, stability, and spatial and temporal regulation of these multi-protein complexes. Our results indicate that Vav1 is located upstream from PKCθ in the JNK activation cascade. This finding is in good agreement with a previous study that demonstrated a Vav1-dependent membrane and cytoskeleton translocation of PKCθ (20Villalba M. Coudronniere N. Deckert M. Teixero E. Mas P. Altman A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 151-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The same study shows that the effects of Vav1 on PKCθ are mediated by Vav1-induced actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that Vav1 exerts its function by at least two mechanisms. One pathway leads to the release of Ca2+ and the subsequent activation of the serine phosphatase calcineurin, which stimulates nuclear entry and transactivation of transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells. This pathway is independent from the GDP/GTP exchange factor function of Vav1 (38Kuhne M.R. Ku G. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2185-2190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and cannot be inhibited by the regulatory protein Cbl-b (39Krawczyk C. Bachmaier K. Sasaki T. Jones R.G. Snapper S.B. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Ohashi P.S. Alt F.W. Penninger J.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The second pathway is Ca2+-independent, can be inhibited by Cbl-b, and relies on the GDP/GTP exchange factor function of Vav1, thus leading to actin polymerization, cytoskeletal reorganization, and further processes (39Krawczyk C. Bachmaier K. Sasaki T. Jones R.G. Snapper S.B. Bouchard D. Kozieradzki I. Ohashi P.S. Alt F.W. Penninger J.M. Immunity. 2000; 13: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We favor a model where Vav1 and PKCθ activate JNK via overlapping and distinct pathways. The PKCθ-derived signals are Ca2+-independent and cannot be inhibited by calcineurin, because PKCθ is located downstream from it. Accordingly, a DN form of PKCθ inhibits JNK activation mediated by ionomycin, which causes the release of intracellular Ca2+ (compare Fig. 4 A). Similarly, the pathway shared by both signaling proteins and mediating the synergistic activation of JNK is Ca2+/calcineurin-independent. In contrast, the Vav1-mediated JNK activation pathway contains a Ca2+-dependent component that can be inhibited by cyclosporin A. This model would also explain earlier results that showed only moderate JNK activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin alone, whereas the simultaneous administration of both compounds strongly activated JNK activity (23Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Bauer B. Villunger A. Baier-Bitterlich G. Altman A. Utermann G. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This study suggests that Vav1-derived signals target MKK4 and MKK7. In contrast, PKCθ- and Vav1/PKCθ-derived signals are transmitted preferentially via MKK7, which seems to be of special relevance for this pathway. The importance of MKK4 for the CD3/CD28-induced activation of JNK is still not clear. One group describes a defective JNK activation in thymocytes obtained from MKK4-deficient mice but normal JNK activation in peripheral T-cells (40Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveira dos Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I. Fischer K.D. Odermatt B. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Takimoto H. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Another study demonstrates normal activation of JNK in response to CD3/CD28 stimulation in lymph node cell suspensions from MKK4−/− mice (41Swat W. Fujikawa K. Ganiatsas S. Yang D. Xavier R.J. Harris N.L. Davidson L. Ferrini R. Davis R.J. Labow M.A. Flavell R.A. Zon L.I. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1998; 8: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to resolve these differences, which may also depend on the developmental stage of the lymphocytes and the cell types studied. In accordance with the predominant role of MKK7 described here, peripheral T-cells from mice lacking MKK7 show only low levels of JNK activity after CD3/CD28 stimulation (15Dong C. Yang D.D. Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Xu J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The PKCθ-mediated signaling pathways are only incompletely understood. Furthermore, it is currently not known whether the competence of PKCθ to deliver activation signals is controlled by its intracellular localization, interaction with binding partners, or both. Because overexpression of the PKCθ-interacting protein, PKC-interacting cousin of thioredoxin, inhibits PKCθ-mediated activation of JNK and NF-κB (42Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), this protein seems to be involved in the first signaling step prior to the separation of the two signaling pathways. Given the importance of PKCθ for the activation of NF-κB and JNK, selective inhibition of this kinase might be a useful strategy to interfere with several activation pathways and thereby modulate T-cell costimulatory signals in inflammatory diseases.

Mutagenesis of Asn631 to Gln in the juxtamembrane stalk region of ACE resulted in more efficient secretion of the mutant protein (ACENQ) as determined by pulse-chase analysis. In contrast to the wild-type ACE, the cleavage of ACENQ was not blocked by the metallosecretase inhibitor batimastat but by the serine protease inhibitor, 1,3-dichloroisocoumarin. Incubation of the cells at 15 °C revealed that ACENQ was cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, and mass spectrometric analysis of the secreted form of the protein indicated that it had been cleaved at the Asn635–Ser636 bond, three residues N-terminal to the normal secretase cleavage site at Arg638–Ser639. These data clearly show that a point mutation in the juxtamembrane region of an integral membrane protein can invoke the action of a mechanistically and spatially distinct secretase. In light of this observation, previous data on the effect of mutations in the juxtamembrane stalk of shed proteins being accommodated by a single secretase having a relaxed specificity need to be re-evaluated.

It exists primarily as a type I integral membrane glycoprotein, although a soluble form is present under normal conditions in blood plasma and other body fluids and is derived from the membrane-bound form through proteolytic cleavage in the juxtamembrane stalk region (2Hooper N.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The secretase responsible for the cleavage and secretion of ACE is a zinc metalloproteinase located at the cell surface (3Oppong S.Y. Hooper N.M. Biochem.

It is inhibited by hydroxamate-based compounds such as batimastat and displays a remarkably similar inhibition profile to that of the α-secretase that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (7Parvathy S.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The precise site of cleavage in ACE has been determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry following enzymic fragmentation of the purified protein (9Woodman Z.L. Oppong S.Y. Cook S. Hooper N.M. Schwager S.L.U. Brandt W.F. Ehlers M.R.W. Sturrock E.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that the soluble somatic forms of human and porcine ACE were cleaved between Arg1203 and Ser1204, some 27 residues on the extracellular side of the transmembrane domain. ACE is just one of several proteins that are post-translationally shed from the membrane through the action of secretases (also called sheddases or convertases) (10Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 11Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Primakoff P. Myles D.G.

Other proteins proteolytically cleaved from the membrane include tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-α, amyloid precursor protein, andl-selectin. The secretases that cleave and release such proteins from the membrane have several properties in common including up-regulation by phorbol esters and inhibition by hydroxamate-based zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors. Numerous studies have investigated the sequence/structural requirements for recognition of an integral membrane protein by its cognate secretase (for example see Refs.13Maruyama K. Kametani F.

This usually has been investigated by mutating residues in the extracellular juxtamembrane stalk region and monitoring their effect on secretion of the expressed protein. Such studies, in which numerous mutations failed to abrogate cleavage and secretion of the membrane protein, have concluded that for each substrate protein there is a single secretase with a relaxed sequence specificity and that the critical parameter for cleavage efficiency is the relative conformation (possibly α-helical) of the stalk region. However, an alternative explanation for these observations is that the mutations in the juxtamembrane stalk invoked the action of other distinct secretases. The involvement of multiple secretases was suggested by Zhong et al. (19Zhong Z. Higaki J. Murakami K. Wang Y. Catalano R. Quon D. Cordell B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 627-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) when numerous point mutations in the stalk region of the amyloid precursor protein resulted in that protein being cleaved at multiple sites, although there was no experimental evidence (inhibition profile, cellular location) to support this suggestion. Here we report that a single point mutation in the juxtamembrane stalk region of ACE invokes the action of a mechanistically and spatially distinct secretase. Asn631 in the single domain form of ACE (20Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (corresponding to Asn1196 in human somatic ACE), 7 residues N-terminal to the normal secretase cleavage site, was mutated to Gln (Fig. 1). The mutant protein (ACENQ) was transport-competent and enzymatically active, indicating that the mutation has no general effects on the folding of ACE. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that ACENQ was more readily cleaved and secreted into the medium than the wild-type protein. Mass spectrometric analysis of the secreted protein and temperature block and inhibitor studies indicated that ACENQ was being cleaved between Asn635 and Ser636 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a serine protease and not between Arg638 and Ser639 at the cell surface by the batimastat-sensitive metallosecretase. In light of this observation, the conclusions of earlier studies investigating the sequence requirements of various secretases through analysis of the effect of mutations on the secretion of the substrate protein require re-evaluation and should not be interpreted solely in the context of a single protease activity having a relaxed specificity. The expression vector pECE containing a C-terminal fragment of human ACE in which the N-terminal signal peptide was fused with the C-terminal domain (pECE hACE) (20Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. In this construct the membrane-proximal stalk region, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains are identical to those in human somatic ACE. Asn631 (Fig.1) in this construct, which corresponds to Asn1196 in human somatic ACE, was the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis with the Quick ChangeTM in vitro mutagenesis system (Stratagene) using the following oligonucleotides: ACENQup (5′-TGG CCG CAG TAC CAA TGG ACG CCG AAC-3′) and ACENQdo (5′-GTT CGG CGT CCA TTG GTA CTG CGG CCA-3′).

Transiently transfected IMR-32 cells were labeled 48–60 h post-transfection with 80 μCi of [35S]Met in Met-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2‥ fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (denoted Met-free medium). In pulse-chase experiments, labeling was performed for 1 h at 37 °C followed by a chase with nonlabeled Met for different periods of time. The labeled cells were rinsed twice with PBS prior to harvesting. Cells were subjected to phase separation in Triton X-114 essentially as described by Wilson et al. (22Wilson J.M. Whitney J.A. Neutra M.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 691-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized with 1 ml/dish cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5‥ Triton X-100, and 0.5‥ sodium deoxycholate), and the cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei and debris. Thereafter, the supernatants were incubated with the rabbit anti-ACE polyclonal antibody (RP183) (23Williams T.A. Barnes K. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. After immunoprecipitation, the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed three times with washing buffer A (0.5‥ Triton X-100 and 0.05‥ sodium deoxycholate in PBS) and three times with washing buffer B (500 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, and 0.5‥ Triton X-100 in 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) prior to analysis of the samples by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described previously (24Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The digestion of 35S-labeled immunoprecipitates with endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Endo) H and Endo F/glycopeptidase F was performed as previously described (24Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). ACE activity in the medium and membrane samples was determined by incubation with 5 mmbenzoyl-Gly-His-Leu in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 0.3m NaCl, and 10 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C. The released benzoyl-Gly was separated from the substrate and quantitated by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (25Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The medium was collected from IMR-32 cells transiently transfected with either pECE hACE or pECE hACENQ, centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min and then concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane. The samples were then dialyzed overnight against 10 mmHepes/NaOH, 0.3 m KCl, and 0.1 mmZnCl2, pH 7.5. ACE was then isolated by affinity chromatography on lisinopril-Sepharose as described previously (26Hooper N.M. Keen J. Pappin D.J.C. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The enzyme was eluted from the affinity column with 0.1m sodium borate, pH 9.5, dialyzed, and concentrated using Centricon 10-kDa cut-off filters (Vivascience, Cambridge, U.K.). Purified secreted wtACE and ACENQ proteins were reduced and protected with vinyl pyridine prior to digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C. The total digest was analyzed directly by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or the digest was first fractionated by HPLC and the C-terminal peptide was identified by automated N-terminal peptide sequencing, before mass spectral analysis (27Schwager S.L.U. Chubb A.J. Scholle R.R. Brandt W.F. Mentele R. Riordan J.F. Sturrock E.D. Ehlers M.R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10388-10397Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Schwager S.L.U. Chubb A.J. Scholle R.R. Brandt W.F. Eckerskorn C. Sturrock E.D. Ehlers M.R.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15449-15456Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). IMR-32 cells, which previously have been shown to cleave and release ACE in a batimastat-sensitive manner (8Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), were transfected with cDNA encoding either wtACE or ACENQ. Both constructs were expressed in the cells as determined by metabolic labeling with [35S]Met followed by immunoprecipitation from the cell lysate with the anti-ACE antibody (Fig.2). wtACE was present in the medium, consistent with its release from the cell surface by the batimastat-sensitive secretase (Fig. 2). ACENQ was also detected in the medium from the cells, and indeed the relative ratio of ACE protein in the medium compared with the cell lysate appeared greater for the mutant as compared with the wild-type protein. Deglycosylation with Endo F revealed that both wtACE and ACENQ were N-glycosylated (Fig. 2). Deglycosylation revealed that there was a distinct difference in size between wtACE in the cell lysate as compared with that secreted into the medium, consistent with removal of the C-terminal transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the protein by the secretase (9Woodman Z.L. Oppong S.Y. Cook S. Hooper N.M. Schwager S.L.U. Brandt W.F. Ehlers M.R.W. Sturrock E.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such a size difference was not apparent between the cell lysate and medium samples of ACENQ (Fig. 2). The rate at which ACENQ was secreted into the medium compared with that of wild-type ACE was assessed by pulse-chase labeling (Fig. 3). wtACE appeared in the medium after 4 h of chase, consistent with previous reports using other cell lines (27Schwager S.L.U. Chubb A.J. Scholle R.R. Brandt W.F. Mentele R. Riordan J.F. Sturrock E.D. Ehlers M.R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10388-10397Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 6 h of chase a considerable amount of wtACE was still present in the cell lysate. In contrast, ACENQ was detected in the medium from the cells after 30 min of chase. After 4 h of chase the majority of ACENQhad been secreted from the cell and was no longer present in the lysate sample. The apparent larger size of the medium form of the mutant protein compared with that in the lysate is because of complex glycosylation of the protein as it traffics along the secretory pathway. The ACENQ detected in the cell lysate is mannose-rich glycosylated as assessed by its complete sensitivity toward Endo H, whereas the ACENQ species secreted into the medium was Endo H-resistant, indicating that it has acquired complex-type glycans in the Golgi apparatus (data not shown). The ability of the secretase inhibitor batimastat to block the release of wtACE and ACENQ from the IMR-32 cells was assessed (Table I). As compared with untreated cells, batimastat significantly inhibited (81‥) the release of wtACE into the medium with a concomitant increase in the amount of activity detected in the membrane fraction, consistent with previous results (8Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no ACE activity could be detected in the membranes from the cells expressing ACENQ, and batimastat failed to significantly inhibit the release of this mutant form of the protein into the medium. No ACE activity was detected in the total cellular membrane fraction from the untreated cells expressing ACENQ even after an eight-times longer incubation period with the substrate benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu (data not shown). Incubation of the cells expressing ACENQ with the serine protease inhibitor DCI reduced the secretion of the protein into the medium by 75‥ with a concomitant increase in activity detected in the membrane sample. Interestingly, DCI seemed to stimulate the release of wtACE into the cell medium with a concomitant decrease in the membrane fraction. This is consistent with a previous observation (27Schwager S.L.U. Chubb A.J. Scholle R.R. Brandt W.F. Mentele R. Riordan J.F. Sturrock E.D. Ehlers M.R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10388-10397Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although the mechanism responsible for this increased shedding is not known.Table IEffect of inhibitors on the shedding of ACE and ACE NQSampleInhibitorSpecific activityMembranesMediumnmol/benzoyl-Gly/min/mg of proteinwtACENone174.2 ± 34.1184.8 ± 15.5Batimastat248.2 ± 14.534.9 ± 4.4DCI32.4 ± 2.2273.6 ± 12.3ACENQNone0.0299.2 ± 8.5Batimastat0.0284.0 ± 16.9DCI171.9 ± 6.873.9 ± 12.0IMR-32 cells transfected with either wtACE or ACENQ cDNA were incubated for 7 h in the absence of inhibitor or in the presence of either 20 μm batimastat or 100 μm DCI.

Open table in a new tab IMR-32 cells transfected with either wtACE or ACENQ cDNA were incubated for 7 h in the absence of inhibitor or in the presence of either 20 μm batimastat or 100 μm DCI. The medium was then harvested, and membranes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the samples assayed for ACE activity with benzoyl-Gly-His-Leu as substrate. Results are the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. The failure to detect ACENQ enzymic activity in the total cellular membrane fraction (Table I) suggested that this mutant form of ACE may be cleaved soon after synthesis in the ER. To investigate this, IMR-32 cells expressing ACENQ were incubated at 15 °C to prevent transport of the proteins beyond the ER (Fig.4 A). ACENQ was susceptible to deglycosylation with Endo H, indicating that it was in the high mannose form. Phase separation in Triton X-114 was used to determine whether ACENQ retained in the ER by the temperature block lacked the hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain (Fig. 4 B). Although a significant amount of newly synthesized ACENQ was detected in the detergent-rich pellet, possibly because the 15 °C treatment impaired the activity of the DCI-sensitive protease, a significant amount of a smaller form was also present in the detergent-poor supernatant, consistent with removal of the C-terminal membrane-anchoring and cytosolic domains by an activity within the ER. The cleaved forms of both wtACE and ACENQ were purified from the conditioned medium of transfected cells by chromatography on lisinopril-Sepharose (25Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometric analysis of wtACE secreted from the IMR-32 cells revealed a peak at m/z 1690.8 (Table II), identical to the calculatedm/z for the peptide Leu625–Arg638. This is consistent with the normal secretase cleavage site between Arg638 and Ser639 and is in agreement with the site of cleavage seen in ACE secreted from other cells and in serum (9Woodman Z.L. Oppong S.Y. Cook S. Hooper N.M. Schwager S.L.U. Brandt W.F. Ehlers M.R.W. Sturrock E.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, analysis of the HPLC fractionated Lys-C digest of ACENQrevealed a major peak at m/z 1406.3 (Table II), which likely represented the peptide Leu625–Asn635 (m/z1406.3, calculated m/z 1390.5: the increase in mass is caused by the oxidation of Trp632). The identity of this peptide was confirmed by partial N-terminal sequencing. Thus, the major site of cleavage was at the Asn635–Ser636 bond, three residues on the N-terminal side of the normal Arg638 and Ser639cleavage site (see Fig. 1). There was also evidence for secondary trimming of the C terminus of the soluble form of ACENQ to Trp632.Table IIObserved [M + H+] ions of Lys-C peptides in wtACE and ACE NQPeptide no.Amino acid residueMass M + H+(calculated)ACENQ mass M + H+(observed)wtACE mass M + H+ (observed)9–10129–1482345.62344.810130–1482217.42215.92215.612186–1991868.01866.91867.713200–2101264.51263.815319–3281307.61306.721407–4363075.53074.63074.722437–4602695.02695.12696.424466–4892946.42946.125490–5021766.91766.21766.21782.62-aMass increase due to the oxidation of Trp.1798.62-aMass increase due to the oxidation of Trp.1799.92-bThe C-terminal peptide was also identified by partial N-terminal sequencing after HPLC fractionation of a Lys-C digest.29568–5781176.41175.631609–6241951.11951.41950.932625–6321078.21076.9532625–6351390.51406.32-aMass increase due to the oxidation of Trp.2-bThe C-terminal peptide was also identified by partial N-terminal sequencing after HPLC fractionation of a Lys-C digest.1422.32-aMass increase due to the oxidation of Trp.2-bThe C-terminal peptide was also identified by partial N-terminal sequencing after HPLC fractionation of a Lys-C digest.32625–6381690.81690.812-a Mass increase due to the oxidation of Trp.2-b The C-terminal peptide was also identified by partial N-terminal sequencing after HPLC fractionation of a Lys-C digest. Open table in a new tab The Asn to Gln point mutation in the juxtamembrane stalk of ACE clearly results in more efficient cleavage and secretion of the protein. At first sight this could be attributed to the mutation making ACENQ a better substrate for the batimastat-sensitive cell surface metallosecretase. However, closer inspection clearly shows that the shedding of ACENQ is caused by the action of a spatially and mechanistically distinct secretase. The serine protease cleaving ACENQ is acting in the ER and cleaves ACE at a different bond in the stalk region to the normal secretase. Interestingly a mutant form of ACE, ACE-JGL, in which the stalk region had been replaced with a Ser/Thr-rich sequence that was partiallyO-glycosylated, was observed to be secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells more rapidly than wtACE, and its shedding was not blocked by the hydroxamic acid-based compound TAPI (27Schwager S.L.U. Chubb A.J. Scholle R.R. Brandt W.F. Mentele R. Riordan J.F. Sturrock E.D. Ehlers M.R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10388-10397Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar to ACENQ, the shedding of ACE-JGL was blocked by DCI; however, it was not determined whether cleavage of this mutant occurred intracellularly. The major serine proteases in the secretory pathway are the family of proprotein convertases, including furin, which are involved in the proteolytic processing of a variety of secreted and membrane-bound proteins (30Seidah N.G. Day R. Marcinkiewicz M. Chretien M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 839: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, this family of proteases shows a specificity for cleaving after dibasic or monobasic sequences, and the cleavage site in ACENQ does not fit this specificity (see Fig. 1). Also, the active forms of the proprotein convertases are located primarily in the trans-Golgi network rather than in the ER. The effect of the Asn631 to Gln mutation invoking a distinct secretase is in contrast to a recent report in which a different point mutation in the juxtamembrane stalk of somatic ACE, associated with a variation in the levels of soluble ACE in plasma, resulted in enhanced cleavage by a metallosecretase (31Eyries M. Michaud A. Deinum J. Agrapart M. Chomilier J. Kramers C. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In that case mutation of Pro1199 in human somatic ACE (equivalent to Pro634 in the ACE construct used in the present study; see Fig. 1) to Leu resulted in more efficient cleavage/secretion of the mutant protein. Although the cleavage of the P1199L mutant was blocked by the hydroxamate-based metallosecretase inhibitor compound 3, the precise site of cleavage was not determined. Those authors, Eyrieset al. (31Eyries M. Michaud A. Deinum J. Agrapart M. Chomilier J. Kramers C. Soubrier F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5525-5532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), proposed that a local conformational modification caused by the Pro to Leu mutation leads to better accessibility of the stalk region to the normal ACE secretase, resulting in the enhancement of the cleavage/secretion process. Secondary structure predictions of wild-type ACE using the on-line JPred server indicated that the region from Leu620to Asp657 is predicted to be a flexible loop, bounded by an α-helix on the N-terminal side and the transmembrane α-helix on the C-terminal side. The mutation of Asn631 to Gln had no affect on the secondary structure prediction, suggesting that the observed difference in cleavage of ACENQ is not caused by a dramatic change in secondary structure. However, it is possible that the mutation promotes binding to the serine protease either directly (Gln is a larger side chain and may be able to make more favorable contacts with the enzyme) or indirectly (by allowing the loop to adopt a more favorable conformation for binding). The residue mutated in the present study, Asn631, lies in a potential N-glycosylation sequon (Asn-Trp-Thr-Pro), raising the possibility that this residue is glycosylated such that its mutation to Gln prevents glycosylation and exposes a site, that is normally obscured by the glycan chain, to cleavage by a serine protease within the ER. However, this explanation seems unlikely on four counts. 1) Trp in the middle position of the N-glycosylation sequon has been shown to severely reduce the efficiency of glycosylation of the preceding Asn, whereas a Pro following the sequon preventsN-glycosylation altogether (32Kaplan H.A. Welply J.K. Lennarz W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 2) Consistent with this, there is no evidence for glycosylation of this Asn residue in the mature form of either human somatic or testicular ACE (Refs. 27Schwager S.L.U. Chubb A.J. Scholle R.R. Brandt W.F. Mentele R. Riordan J.F. Sturrock E.D. Ehlers M.R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10388-10397Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 34Yu C.X. Sturrock E.D. Wu Z. Biemann K. Ehlers M.R.W. Riordan J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3511-3519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholarand Table II). 3) In rabbit ACE this potential glycosylation site is absent, yet the enzyme is cleaved by a hydroxamic acid-sensitive metallosecretase (6Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 4) Attempts to mimic the effect of the Asn to Gln mutation in wild-type ACE by incubation of cells with tunicamycin, which blocks formation of the core dolichol-linked oligosaccharide thus preventing N-glycosylation from taking place, failed to lead to secretion of wtACE in a batimastat-insensitive manner (data not shown). An interesting feature of ACENQ is the dramatic increase in its transport kinetics and maturation rate along the secretory pathway as compared with the membrane-bound wild-type protein. In fact, attainment of complex glycans on ACENQ occurs at a rate that is almost three orders of magnitude greater than that of wtACE. In general it is unlikely that nonanchoring of a protein leads per se to a higher efficiency in its intracellular transport relative to its anchored counterpart. This view is supported by several examples of proteins from which the transmembrane domains have been eliminated. Membrane-bound intestinal sucrase-isomaltase, for instance, exhibits similar transport kinetics as its soluble anchorless isoform (35Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Likewise, deletion of the transmembrane domain in the neurotrophin receptor has no implications on the intracellular transport of the mutant protein (36Yeaman C. Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is no general rule that anchorless proteins are transported more rapidly along the secretory pathway than membrane-bound ones. Indeed, with certain proteins the reverse seems to be the case. For example, deletion of the membrane-anchoring domain from the murine prion protein results in the secreted form of the protein reaching the cell surface at a 4-fold slower rate than the wild-type protein (37Walmsley A.R. Zeng F. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the soluble form of the trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein is also trafficked at a slower rate than the membrane-bound form (38McDowell M.A. Ransom D.M. Bangs J.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The main rate-limiting step in the transport of membrane and secretory proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus is their acquisition to a correct folding and transport-competent quaternary structure in the ER (for a review see Ref. 39Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this respect, oligomerization in the ER constitutes for many proteins a crucial criterion before they exit this organelle. This event has been shown to involve the transmembrane domains (40Doyle C. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Gething M.J.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Wild-type membrane-bound ACE does not dimerize in the ER (47Naim H.Y. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thus excluding a possible influence of dimerization and the transmembrane domain on its transport kinetics as compared with soluble ACE. One may speculate that the delayed intracellular transport of membrane-bound ACE versusACENQ is caused by the existence of a structural motif in the cytosolic tail that promotes an interaction of ACE with soluble and/or membrane-bound factors in the cytosol and thus regulates its transport kinetics. As such, cleavage of ACENQ in the ER eliminates this motif and results in a more efficiently transported protein. In conclusion, in previous studies the results of mutations at or near the secretase cleavage site in a membrane protein have usually been interpreted in the context of a single protease activity having a relaxed sequence specificity. However, the results of the present study reveal another explanation: such mutations may invoke the action of other distinct proteases. In the light of this and in the absence of such additional data, the conclusions of earlier studies investigating the sequence requirements of various secretases through analysis of the effect of mutations on the secretion of the substrate protein must be interpreted with caution and require re-evaluation. We thank Mhairi Nimick for help in purifying the secreted forms of ACE and David Westhead for assistance in the secondary structure predictions."

While their exact functions are largely unknown, BAR adaptor proteins appear to integrate signal transduction pathways that regulate membrane dynamics, F-actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear processes, roles that are highlighted in the nomenclature of two recently identified members of the family (bridging integrators or BIN proteins). Both genes encoding BAR adaptor proteins in S. cerevisiaewere initially identified in a genetic screen for mutants that lost viability upon nutrient starvation (1Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Dulau L. Aigle M. Yeast. 1991; 7: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 2Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5070-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent work revealed that Rvs167p and Rvs161p form a physiological complex that regulates F-actin localization, cell polarity, bud formation, and endocytosis (2Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M.

Rvs161p is also important for karyogamy, the nuclear fusion process which follows mating (8Brizzio V. Gammie A.E. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 567-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A variety of Rvs-interacting proteins were identified that are consistent with Rvs161p and Rvs167p functions in F-actin regulation, lipid metabolism, cell cycle integration, and nuclear processes (9Amberg D.C.

Despite the importance of Rvs161p and Rvs167p in these diverse functions, the RVS161 andRVS167 genes are not required for viability. Three genes encoding BAR adaptor proteins have been described in human cells. Two of these genes, AMPH and BIN1, encode structural orthologs of RVS167, whereas the third gene,BIN2, encodes a structurally unique protein. The expression patterns of each gene suggest different physiological roles:BIN1 is widely expressed whereas AMPH andBIN2 are tissue-restricted in their expression. Amphiphysin, the product of the AMPH gene, was identified by virtue of its biochemical properties (14Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kilimann M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and encodes a neuronal adaptor protein that regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis (15Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The restricted pattern of AMPH expression argues that the physiological function of this gene is limited to the specialized processes of synaptic vesicle recovery. In a similar way, BIN2 expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells. BIN2 function is undefined but appears to be nonredundant with other mammalian BAR proteins (16Ge K. Prendergast G.C. Genomics. 2000; 67: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TheBIN1 gene has a complex function(s) suggested by its diverse patterns of alternate splicing. BIN1 splice isoforms have been identified by virtue of interaction with the c-Myc oncoprotein, structural similarity to amphiphysin, interaction with the nuclear tyrosine kinase c-Abl, and characterization of the BIN1 gene itself (17Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Butler M.H. David C. Ochoa G.-C. Freyberg Z. Daniell L. Grabs D. Cremona O.

Brain-specific isoforms, alternately termed amphiphysin II or amphiphysin-like isoforms, are exclusively cytosolic and can influence endocytosis (15Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, only brain isoforms include regions required for interaction with key components of the endocytosis machinery (24Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear whether BIN1 proteins participate in endocytosis outside the brain. Nuclear functions are suggested by the ability of muscle-specific and ubiquitous isoforms to localize to the nucleus and to functionally associate with the c-Myc and c-Abl proteins (17Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 19Kadlec L. Pendergast A.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In particular, c-Myc-interacting isoforms have tumor suppressor and transcriptional properties that impact cell differentiation and cell death decisions (17Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R.

To further investigate the function of BAR adaptor proteins, we identified a mammalian homolog of RVS161, termedBin3 (bridgingintegrator-3), and a Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of RVS161, termed hob3+ (homolog of Bin 3). Analysis of hob3Δ mutants revealed an important role for Hob3p in regulation of F-actin localization, as was found for Rvs161p. The F-actin localization defect of hob3Δ mutants was completely rescued by human BIN3and partially rescued byRVS161, raising the possibility that BIN3 regulates F-actin localization in mammalian cells. The S. pombe hob3+ gene was identified through BLAST (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) searches of the S. pombe genome using theS. cerevisiae RVS161 gene as query. Thehob3+ gene was cloned by PCR from a stationary-phase,S. pombe single-stranded cDNA library (Library-In-A-TubeTM, QBiogen), using oligonucleotide primers derived from the hob3+ locus. Sequences encoding the human BIN3 protein were similarly identified by TBLASTN (32Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) searches of the translated EST data base using the S. cerevisiaeRvs161p as a query. Human BIN3 cDNA was cloned by PCR from single-stranded Library-In-A-TubeTM cDNA libraries (QBiogen). Information obtained from the EST data bases was used to construct a full-length cDNA clone. Sequence determinations included the full-length IMAGE EST clones obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville AL). Human BIN3 cDNA was subcloned as an untagged or hemagglutinin-tagged insert into pcDNA3/neo (Invitrogen) and these plasmids were used for PCR to amplify BIN3 cDNA for insertion into yeast vectors. cDNAs were digested with NdeI and PspAI orBamHI and cloned into the S. pombe expression plasmid pREP2 (33Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 30-127Crossref Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Gene deletions in S. pombe were performed as described (34Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar) using plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6-hemagglutinin as a template for the construction of a disrupted allele. BAR protein-encoding cDNAs were cloned between the XbaI andBamHI or SmaI sites of the 2 μ based budding yeast expression vector YEp195-ACN (courtesy J. Toyn). Yeast transformations were performed by standard methods (35Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P.

Strain ELR6 (ade6-M210, leu1–32, ura4-D18, hob3Δ::kanMX6) is a derivative of diploid strain KGY246/249 (37Breeding C.S. Hudson J. Balasubramanian M.K. Hemmingsen M. Young P.G. Gould K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3399-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), obtained by one-step gene disruption. Integration of the altered allele by homologous recombination was verified by Southern blotting using a 32P-labeled PCR product derived from the 5′-untranslated region of the hob3+locus, extending from 280 to 986 base pairs from the putative start codon of hob3+ (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with the High Prime DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). S. cerevisiae strains BY4741 (MATa, ura3, leu2, his3, met15) and BY4741–3489 (MATa, ura3, leu2, his3, met15, rvs161Δ::kanR) were obtained from J. Toyn, Applied Biotechnology Group, DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company. S. pombe strains were grown in YE medium or EMM2 containing appropriate nutritional supplements when necessary (39Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Expression from pREP2 plasmids was achieved by growing cells to early log phase in medium containing 0.06 mm thiamine, washing the cells 3 times in thiamine-free medium, and resuspending the cells in the same medium. Budding yeast were grown in YPAD or SC medium lacking the appropriate nutritional supplements, in some cases with the addition of 6%(w/v) NaCl (40Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol.1st Ed.

Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 27-32Google Scholar) using AlexaFluor 488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope fitted with a Nikon Plan Fluor ×100 objective using a Toshiba 3CCD camera. Images were manipulated using Image ProPlus version 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics). Exponential phase cultures of S. pombe cells were assayed for uptake of the lipophilic styryl dye FM4–64 (Molecular Probes) as described (42Brazer S.-C. Williams H.P. Chappell T.G. Cande W.Z. Yeast. 2000; 16: 66-149Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MTNI and MTNII human multiple tissue Northern blots obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto CA) were hybridized to 32P-labeled probes forBIN3, BIN1, and AMPH generated by the random priming method as per the vendor's instructions. TheBIN1 and AMPH probes have been described (14Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kilimann M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,27Ge K. DuHadaway J. Du W. Herlyn M. Rodeck U. Prendergast G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9689-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The BIN3probe was a 32P-labeled 600-base pair BamHI-BglII fragment of the human BIN3 cDNA. Hybridization of a Northern blot of RNA isolated from a panel of tumor cell lines, cultured and processed as described previously (17Sakamuro D. Elliott K. Wechsler-Reya R. Prendergast G.C. Nat.

Cancer. 2000; 85: 376-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was performed using the BIN3 probe and a β-tubulinprobe to normalize the blot. Sequences encoding BIN3, a novel human BAR adaptor protein, were identified using Rvs161p to search the EST data base with the TBLASTN algorithm. Sequence analysis of full-length cDNA clones identified in this manner revealed that BIN3 was a protein of 253 residues in length and was comprised solely of a BAR domain, like Rvs161p (Fig. 1, a andb). The BIN3 BAR domain was 27%identical to Rvs161p but less than 24%identical to other BAR domains (TableI). Northern analysis of human tissue RNAs was performed to compare the BIN3 expression pattern to that of other mammalian BAR adaptor genes. A single mRNA species of ∼2.2 kilobase was detected at similar levels in all embryonic and adult tissues examined, except for brain where BIN3 mRNA was undetectable (Fig. 2 a). This wide expression pattern of BIN3 was similar toBIN1, which was widely expressed, but contrasted withAMPH, which was expressed primarily in brain, andBIN2, which was expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells. Since BIN1expression was frequently decreased in malignant cells, BIN3 expression was determined in a panel of human tumor cell lines. All cell lines tested expressed BIN3 (Fig.2 b). We concluded that BIN3 was a widely expressed BAR adaptor protein that was structurally most similar to S. cerevisiae Rvs161p.Table IRelationships between known BAR-encoding polypeptides% SimilarityHob3pRvs161pBin3Bin1Rvs167pAmphBin2Hob3p562924312726Rvs161p2823282624Bin327202224Bin1256561Rvs167p2529Amph53Bin2The BAR domains of known BAR-containing polypeptides were aligned using the GCG program GAP (59Devereaux J.

Polypeptides were truncated to 253 N-terminal amino acids for comparison. Sequences encoding Hob3p (homolog ofBin 3) were identified using Rvs161p to search the S. pombe genome (Fig. 1 a). Hob3p was 264 residues in length, 56%identical to S. cerevisiae Rvs161p, and 29%identical to BIN3 throughout its entire sequence (Fig.1 b). In contrast, the Hob3p BAR domain sequences were less than 26%identical to the BAR domain sequences in BIN1, BIN2, and AMPH (Table I). Like Rvs161p and BIN3, Hob3p was comprised solely of a BAR domain, without the additional C-terminal sequences found in Rvs167p or known mammalian BAR adaptor proteins (Fig. 1 b). The similarity of BAR sequences and lack of non-BAR sequences suggest that Rvs161p, BIN3, and Hob3p comprise a subfamily within the family of BAR adaptor proteins. The other BAR adaptor protein encoded by the S. pombe genome was identified. The structure and characterization of this predicted protein, which was most similar to Rvs167p, will be described elsewhere. 2E. L. Routhier, C. F. Albright, and G. C. Pendergast, manuscript in preparation. We began by studying S. pombe hob3+ since fission yeast genetics allowed us to rapidly characterize Hob3p function. Using standard methods, haploid S. pombe strains were made where the entire coding region of hob3+ was replaced with the kanMX6cassette, conferring resistance to G418 (34Bahler J. Wu J. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie III, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Southern analysis confirmed construction of a strain with the hob3Δ allele (Fig. 3 a). Examination ofhob3Δ mutants revealed a fraction of cells that were longer than hob3+ cells and contained more than two nuclei (Fig. 3 b). In particular, about 9%of hob3Δcells from an actively growing culture contained more than two nuclei, with most of these elongated cells containing four nuclei (n = 108). In contrast, no cells with more than two nuclei were observed in a parallel culture of hob3+ cells (n = 125). Calcofluor staining showed that septal material separated most of the nuclei in hob3Δ cells (Fig.3 b). Furthermore, the hob3Δ cells contained increased amounts of calcofluor-stained material, relative tohob3+ cells (Fig. 3 b). Consistent with their multinucleated phenotype, exponentially growing hob3Δcells exhibited a continuum of >4N ploidies when analyzed by flow cytometry (data not shown). The division of cell populations based on nuclear content by flow cytometry of hob3Δ andhob3+ cells mirrored results obtained by microscopic observation. Both hob3+ and hob3Δ null cells grew and mated with kinetics indistinguishable from wild type cells; however, hob3Δ cells tended to grow in clumps of 5–15 cells (data not shown) and stopped dividing at lower cell density thanhob3+ cells (Fig. 3 c). Overexpression ofhob3+ had no effect on hob3+ cells (data not shown). Hence, hob3+ had a role in cell division in fission yeast at the level of septation, with some proportion of cells failing to separate following septum formation and accumulating increased levels of septal material. S. cerevisiae rvs161Δ mutants were defective in F-actin localization (3Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 42-1721Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 6Balguerie A. Sivadon P. Bonneu M. Aigle M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bauer F. Urdaci M. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 84-5070Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Since S. pombe mutants with F-actin localization defects disrupt septation, cytokinesis, and cell separation (44McCollum D. Feoktistova A. Morphew M. Balasubramanian M. Gould K.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 46-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 45Feoktistova A. McCollum D. Ohi R. Gould K.L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 895-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Morrell J.L. Morphew M. Gould K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4201-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), F-actin localization in hob3Δ mutants was determined using fluorescent phalloidin. In hob3+S. pombe, F-actin was normally localized to cortical patches during interphase and medial contractile rings during mitosis (Fig.4) (41Marks J. Hyams J.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 39: 27-32Google Scholar). In contrast, hob3Δmutants displayed two significant F-actin localization defects (Fig. 4, Table II). First, F-actin patches were frequently mislocalized in hob3Δ cells with one nucleus. In particular, F-actin patches were found equally distributed along the entire length of mononuclear cells, with 86%of such mononuclear cells (n = 88) exhibiting this staining patternversus 4%of cells from a hob3+ strain (n = 115). Second, medial F-actin rings and patches were rarely observed in hob3Δ mutants with two nuclei. Inhob3Δ mutant cells with 2 nuclei, 41%had medial F-actin patches in both compartments with an F-actin ring, 32%had delocalized F-actin patches in both compartments, and 27%had medial F-actin patches in one compartment with delocalized F-actin patches in the other compartment (n = 22). These findings contrast with hob3+ cells where 100%of cells containing two nuclei exhibited medial F-actin staining (n = 29). Hence, Hob3p plays an important role in the localization of F-actin in interphase and mitotic cells. Consistent with loss of cell polarity and consequent abnormally shaped cells observed in mutants of the S. pombe F-actin-encoding act1+ gene (47McCollum D. Balasubramanian M. Gould K.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 6-321Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we observed such misshapen cells in hob3Δ cultures (Fig. 4). Specifically, 13%of cells (n = 116) in Fig. 4 lost their cylindrical appearance and took on a rounded appearance,versus 0%of cells in a matched hob3+ culture (n = 163). Loss of shape was not limited to mononuclear cells; 48%of misshapen cells possessed two or more nuclei. F-actin delocalization was observed in all misshapen cells. We concluded thathob3+ was necessary for F-actin regulation and completion of septation, the process of cytokinesis in fission yeast cells.Table IIQuantification of F-actin distribution in hob3Δ mutants expressing BAR-containing polypeptidesCortical patches Medial patches/ringsF-actin distribution1n2n>2nYesNoN/ANoPartialNoMediumStrainN/A2-aN/A, not applicable.N/AYesNoYesNoYesWild type77%(111)3%(4)20%(29)Yeshob3Δ10%(12)61%(76)7%(9)6%(7)5%(6)8%(9)Yes/57 mm NaClWild type79%(73)7%(6)13%(12)1%(1)Yes/57 mmNaClhob3Δ21%(17)22%(18)19%(15)10%(9)12%(10)15%(12)Yes/125 mm NaCl>Wild type63%(10)6%(1)25%(4)6%(1)Yes/125 mmNaClhob3Δ20%(10)44%(22)8%(4)16%(8)2%(1)10%(5)EMM2Wild type77%(56)7%(5)16%(12)EMM2hob3Δ26%(19)59%(43)7%(5)2%(1)7%(5)EMM2-NWild type86%(64)3%(2)7%(6)3%(2)EMM2-Nhob3Δ21%(8)31%(12)13%(5)21%(8)8%(3)7%(3)EMM2hob3Δ/pREP231%(27)49%(43)8%(7)6%(5)5%(4)EMM2hob3Δ/pREP2-hob3+49%(19)10%(4)26%(10)8%(3)EMM2hob3Δ/pREP2-RVS16112%(8)63%(42)15%(10)7%(5)1%(1)EMM2hob3Δ/pREP2-RVS1679%(6)60%(39)3%(2)14%(9)5%(3)5%(3)EMM2hob3Δ/pREP2-BIN330%(24)19%(15)32%(25)9%(7)8%(6)Cells were grown to exponential phase in the medium indicated, fixed, and stained with AlexaFluor 488-phalloidin and DAPI.

Yeast. 1991; 7: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In these experiments, rvs161Δ mutants had a 35%reduction in cell viability after 48 h in N005 low nitrogen medium.

Many of these inhibitors require the presence of phosphate anions for maximum activity against GGPTase Iin vitro. Inhibitors with a strong anion dependence were competitive with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), rather than with the peptide substrate, which had served as the original template for inhibitor design. One of the most effective anions was ATP, which at low millimolar concentrations increased the potency of GGPTase I inhibitors up to several hundred-fold. In the case of clinical candidate l-778,123, this increase in potency was shown to result from two major interactions: competitive binding of inhibitor and GGPP, and competitive binding of ATP and GGPP. At 5 mm, ATP caused an increase in the apparent K d for the GGPP-GGPTase I interaction from 20 pm to 4 nm, resulting in correspondingly tighter inhibitor binding. A subset of very potent GGPP-competitive inhibitors displayed slow tight binding to GGPTase I with apparent on and off rates on the order of 106m−1s−1 and 10−3s−1, respectively. Slow binding and the anion requirement suggest that these inhibitors may act as transition state analogs.

Four isoforms of Ras are found in mammalian cells, Kirsten-Ras (Ki-Ras) 4A and 4B, Harvey-Ras (Ha-Ras), and N-Ras. Ki4B-Ras is the most frequently mutated isozyme in human cancer, ranging from 20% up to 90% in pancreatic cancers, whereas Ha-Ras mutations are found in a small percentage of bladder cancers. Most oncogenic mutations in Ras result in the elimination of the GTPase activity, locking Ras in its active, GTP-bound conformation. All Ras proteins undergo multiple post-translational modifications on their carboxyl termini that are required for membrane localization and biological activity. The COOH-terminal CAAX motif (where C is cysteine, A stands for aliphatic, and X for any amino acid) is recognized by farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase),1 which transfers a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to the cysteine thiol. This prenylation step is followed by proteolytic clipping of the three terminal amino acids by a farnesyl-CAAX specific protease and subsequent methylation of the cysteine residue by a carboxymethyl transferase. Ha-Ras and N-Ras are further modified by palmitoylation which provides additional membrane interactions. A polylysine stretch in Ki-Ras near the COOH terminus serves the same purpose. However, the prenylation step has been shown to be the single most critical modification for function of all Ras proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Heimbrook D.C. Oliff A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Initial efforts at inhibiting Ras function by many groups focused exclusively on FPTase, the enzyme normally responsible for prenylation of all four Ras isozymes. Specific inhibitors of FPTase showed dramatic efficacy in Ha-Ras-dependent mouse xenograft tumor models (2Kohl N.E. Omer C.A. Conner M.W. Anthony N.J. Davide J.P. deSolms S.J. Giuliani E.A. Gomez R.P. Graham S.L. Hamilton K. et al.Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and were also effective in Ki-Ras-driven mouse tumor models (3Omer C.A. Chen Z.

However, it was soon realized that FPTase inhibitors did not block prenylation of Ki- and N-Ras isozymes because of cross-prenylation by the related enzyme geranylgeranyl-protein transferase type I (GGPTase I) (4James G.

It thus became clear that pure FPTase inhibitors were not acting by blocking Ras signaling but by inhibiting farnesylation of one or more as yet unidentified proteins. Blocking Ki-Ras signaling through inhibition of both prenyltransferases remains a viable option, however (8Mazet J.L. Padieu M. Osman H. Maume G. Mailliet P. Dereu N. Hamilton A.D. Lavelle F.

To further explore the feasibility of preventing Ki4B-Ras signaling in vivo, we developed and characterized potent inhibitors of GGPTase I, FPTase, and of both enzymes (dual inhibitors).GGPTase I was originally purified from bovine brain (11Yokoyama K. Goodwin G.W. Ghomashchi F. Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5302-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); the human enzyme was subsequently cloned and purified (12Zhang F.L. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Giros B. Casey P.J. Omer C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3175-3180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GGPTase I is an α/β heterodimer with the same α subunit as FPTase. The enzyme transfers the prenyl moiety of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to the cysteine of carboxyl-terminal CAAX sequences, with a preference for leucine in the X position. It is also capable of prenylating the COOH-terminal CVIM sequence of Ki-Ras, albeit with aK m 500-fold higher than that of FPTase (13Roskoski Jr., R. Ritchie P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The enzyme mechanism of mammalian GGPTase I has been characterized with enzyme purified from bovine brain as well as from recombinant sources (14Zhang F.L. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

The reaction was reported to follow a random Bi Bi pathway with steady-state kinetics, although GGPP binding is the kinetically preferred first step. The order of addition of substrates is reflected in their relative K m values of low nanomolar for GGPP and micromolar for peptide substrate, although the absolute numbers vary dramatically with the particular CAAX sequence and length of the peptide substrate (7Zhang F.L. Kirschmeier P. Carr D. James L. Bond R.W. Wang L. Patton R. Windsor W.T. Syto R. Zhang R. Bishop W.R. J. Biol.

The reaction mechanism thus appears identical to that of FPTase (17Pompliano D.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Omer C.A. Shafer J.A. Gibbs J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8341-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the yeast enzymes yGGPTase I and yFPTase have been reported to proceed through an ordered Bi Bi mechanism (18Stirtan W.G. Poulter C.D.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16687-16694Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, and in contrast to FPTase, GGPTase I does not require Mg2+ for GGPP binding or catalysis. However, Zn2+ is required for peptide binding and catalysis (15Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J.

Chem. 1998; 6: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Compounds in both categories show activity in cell-based assays. Some inhibitors of FPTase have been observed to be more potent in the presence of certain anions (27Scholten J.D. Zimmerman K.K. Oxender M.G. Leonard D. Sebolt Leopold J. Gowan R. Hupe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10881-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Increases in potency of up to 50-fold were observed, with phosphate and chloride being the most effective anions. This anion effect was limited to FPP-competitive inhibitors and was not seen with GGPTase I. We report here the identification of GGPTase I-specific and dual inhibitors with a similar requirement for phosphates for maximal potency. As in the case of the FPTase inhibitors (27Scholten J.D. Zimmerman K.K. Oxender M.G. Leonard D. Sebolt Leopold J. Gowan R. Hupe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10881-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the anion effect is limited to prenylpyrophosphate-competitive compounds; however, with our current dual-specificity compounds, the anion effect is only seen when assayed with GGPTase I. Utilizing an equilibrium binding assay, we show that the anion effect is primarily due to competitive binding between phosphates and GGPP, which results in a dramatic increase in the apparent K d for GGPP. Consistent with this mechanism, a significant anion effect is only observed with GGPP-competitive, but not CAAX-competitive, inhibitors. Although the addition of phosphates increased inhibitor potency, it did not change the mechanism of inhibition in equilibrium binding studies. However, the unexpectedly tight binding of GGPP in the absence of phosphates resulted in an apparently CAAX-competitive mode of inhibition in enzyme activity experiments.To determine the significance of these observations for the inhibition of GGPTase I in vivo, we evaluated the inhibition of prenylation of the GGPTase I substrate Rap1a in PSN-1 cells. IC50 values measured in vitro in the absence of phosphates did not predict potency of GGPTase I inhibitors in cell-based assays. However, after accounting for anion requirement, slow binding, and mechanism of competition, the structure-activity relationship determined in vitro correlated well with the inhibition of processing in vivo.DISCUSSIONPrenylation and membrane localization of Ki-Ras are essential for its oncogenic potential. In vivo Ki-Ras is normally predominantly farnesylated on its COOH-terminal cysteine, but in the presence of FPTase inhibitors the 21-kDa protein is prenylated by GGPTase I. Geranylgeranylated Ki4B-Ras is biologically active, implying that inhibition of both enzymes would be required to down-regulate Ki-Ras signaling. Interestingly, however, inhibition of either FPTase or GGPTase I alone can result in tumor growth inhibition in nude mouse tumor models, although it is not clear which prenylated protein(s) is responsible for the observed efficacy. In the case of FPTase, inhibition of RhoB farnesylation, followed by geranylgeranylation, has been suggested as the critical step (29Du W. Prendergast G.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5492-5496PubMed Google Scholar, 30Prendergast G.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Inhibition of farnesylation subsequently leads to induction of p21 and a cell cycle block at G1 (31Sepp Lorenzino L. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20243-20251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or G2-M (Ref. 32Miquel K. Pradines A. Sun J.Z. Qian Y.M. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Favre G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1846-1850PubMed Google Scholar and unpublished data). The G2-M block may be the result of a block of prenylation of the mitotic kinesin CENP-E (33Ashar H.R. James L. Gray K.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6962-69670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, inhibition of either prenyltransferase alone does not block signaling via Ki-Ras. Since we wished to examine the effects of inhibition of Ki-Ras in vivo and to conduct tumor efficacy studies with combinations of FPTase and GGPTase I inhibitors, we synthesized and evaluated specific GGPTase I inhibitors and dual inhibitors.While analyzing FPTase inhibitors for their ability to inhibit prenylation of Ki-Ras in cell-based assays, we found that some compounds with little activity against GGPTase I were capable of completely blocking farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This apparent paradox led to the discovery that we were underestimating the potency of GGPTase I inhibitors in vitro because of a specific anion requirement for maximum inhibition. Many different phosphate-based anions could satisfy this anion requirement, including inorganic phosphates, nucleotides, and phospholipids. The fact that some anions were effective at significantly lower concentrations than others immediately suggested that this effect was not due to nonspecific ionic interactions but rather to a direct effect on inhibitor or substrate binding.Despite being closely related and derived from the same basic structural motif, our GGPTase I inhibitors separated into CAAX-competitive and GGPP-competitive classes. Only the latter compounds showed a significant gain in potency in the presence of anions, suggesting that the anion effect was directly related to the GGPP-competitive mode of inhibition. A similar phenomena has been reported for certain inhibitors of FPTase, which also became much more potent in the presence anions (27Scholten J.D. Zimmerman K.K. Oxender M.G. Leonard D. Sebolt Leopold J. Gowan R. Hupe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10881-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Increases in potency of up to 50-fold were observed in the presence of phosphate. As is the case for the GGPTase I inhibitors described here, this anion effect was limited to prenylpyrophosphate-competitive inhibitors. In contrast, however, the anion effect was only seen with FPTase and not with GGPTase I. Furthermore, the rank order of anions differed substantially from that described in the present report for GGPTase I inhibitors. For example, chloride, one of the best anions for FPTase, was completely ineffective for GGPTase I inhibitors.What is the basis of the anion effect? Scholten and co-workers proposed a model in which anions would compete with the pyrophosphate moiety of FPP for binding to the enzyme. To test this hypothesis for the case of GGPTase I, we developed an equilibrium binding assay to directly measure binding of GGPP and other ligands. Using carefully controlled conditions with picomolar enzyme concentrations, we found that GGPP binds to GGPTase I with a much lower K d than expected, 15–30 pm in the absence of phosphates. Previous reports had found K d values in the low nanomolar range (3–16 nm), a result that may be explained at least in part by the presence of phosphate in some of the buffer systems used (15Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 37Yokoyama K. Zimmerman K. Scholten J. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3944-3952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We show that phosphates behave as competitive ligands with respect to GGPP. Although our data do not prove that the two ligands bind to physically overlapping sites, anion binding to the pyrophosphate site on GGPTase I would be the simplest explanation. ATP, our anion of choice, raises the apparent K d of the GGPP-enzyme interaction ∼200-fold into the low nanomolar range at physiological concentration.Equilibrium binding experiments were also used to analyze the extent to which GGPTase I inhibitors compete with GGPP binding. In the presence of phosphates (i.e. ATP), the results were entirely consistent with the data from enzyme assays. GGPP-competitive inhibitors such as compound 1 were able to displace GGPP completely without significant formation of the ternary enzyme-GGPP-inhibitor (E-GGPP-I) complex (interaction factor α > 50). In contrast, CAAX-competitive inhibitors, including compounds6 and 7, did not affect GGPP binding at all. Several compounds showed partially competitive behavior where the ternary E-GGPP-I complex was observable but energetically unfavorable (interaction factors of greater than 1). These data are consistent with a model in which the inhibitor primarily occupies the CAAX binding site but, depending on the particular compound, partly overlaps with the GGPP binding site. Inhibitor binding in the CAAX site is expected since the design of all compounds described here (with the exception of the phosphonate 8) evolved from the CAAX peptide structure. In the case of FPTase, compound 1 was shown by x-ray crystallography to bind in the CAAX pocket alongside FPP. 2S. B. Long and L. S. Beese, manuscript in preparation. Whether or not a given inhibitor overlaps with the GGPP binding site seems to depend on minor structural alterations, as demonstrated by the orthogonal behavior of closely related compounds 1 and 7. In contrast to GGPP, ATP does not compete with inhibitor binding; instead, anion and inhibitor binding are cooperative, at least in case of compounds1 and 3 (interaction factor <1). The overlap between GGPP and these inhibitors thus appears to be limited to the prenyl binding pocket, whereas the triphosphate moiety of ATP occupies the pyrophosphate binding site. Consistent with this model, a reverse anion effect is observed with the GGPP analog 8. In this case anions directly compete with inhibitor binding in the pyrophosphate pocket.In the absence of phosphate, equilibrium binding and enzyme assays gave apparently contradictory results, in that compounds that competed with GGPP in binding studies behaved as CAAX-competitive inhibitors in enzyme assays. This discrepancy has probably two underlying reasons: (i) kinetic uncoupling in the enzymatic assays at high concentrations of GGPP (in contrast to equilibrium binding experiments where GGPP concentrations could be lowered into the low picomolar range to show competition by less potent inhibitors, steady-state reactions needed to be run in the mid-nanomolar range), and (ii) the ability of most, if not all, GGPP-competitive compounds to form the energetically unfavorable ternaryE-GGPP-I complex at high enough concentrations (i.e. interaction factor α ≫ 1, but not infinite). The resulting inhibition would be weak but CAAX-competitive, as exemplified by compound 1. It follows from this explanation that the less favorable the formation of the E-GGPP-I complex, the greater the expected anion effect. This prediction is in fact borne out in that the extent of GGPP-competition correlates with the magnitude of the anion effect (Fig. 3). In the presence of phosphates, which compete with GGPP and thus facilitate the formation of E-Icomplexes even at higher GGPP concentrations, equilibrium binding and enzyme assays gave consistent results.Several potent GGPP-competitive inhibitors displayed slow binding to the enzyme even in the absence of GGPP. On-rates 2 orders of magnitude below diffusion limited on rates were observed, and enzyme-inhibitor complexes showed half-lives of up to 1 h. Synergistic inhibition of enzymes in the presence of anions has been reported in several cases and has been discussed in the context of FPTase inhibitors (27Scholten J.D. Zimmerman K.K. Oxender M.G.

The observation of slow tight binding in combination with anion dependence furthermore suggests the formation of inhibition complexes that may be mimicking the transition state of GGPTase I. For FPTase, as well as for the related reactions catalyzed by squalene synthase, isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase, and prenyltransferase, the reaction mechanism has been shown or proposed to proceed through an allylic carbonium-pyrophosphate intermediate (38Dolence J.M.

Nitrogen-containing phosphates and phosphonates have been reported to be transition state analogs of isopentenyl-pyrophosphate isomerase (44Muehlbacher M. Poulter C.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7315-7328Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 45Martin M.B. Arnold W. Heath H.T. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Most of our slow-binding GGPTase I inhibitors have at least one electrophilic nitrogen that may play the role of the carbonium cation, whereas the anion (ATP) would take the place of the pyrophosphate leaving group.We have identified closely related compounds with either GGPP or CAAX-competitive mode of inhibition in vitro. This difference in mechanism was reflected in cell-based assays, where GGPP and CAAX-competitive compounds fall into different categories, resulting in the need for a correction factor when predicting cell potency from in vitro IC50values. This is not entirely surprising since the effective concentrations ([S]/K m ) of the two GGPTase I substrates differed ∼10-fold for experimental reasons; GGPP was used at 100 nm (20-fold over K m ), and the CAAX peptide was used at 1.6 μm (2-fold overK m ). After correction of the IC50 values of CAAX-competitive compounds by a factor of 30, enzyme assays predicted cell potency fairly reliably, implying that the effective concentrations of GGPP and Rap1a in cells are in fact very similar.Interestingly, none of the dual inhibitors in this study showed a significant anion-dependence when assayed with FPTase. Although the two prenyltransferases are analogous in terms of function and general reaction mechanism, their differences obviously extend beyond the different substrate preferences. Crystal structures of the enzyme-inhibitor-anion complexes will eventually shed light on some of these idiosyncrasies and should help further refine inhibitor specificity and potency. We show here that relative subtle structural changes affect the mechanism of inhibition of GGPTase I, which may positively impact drug development. The rank order of inhibition of prenylation of various GGPTase I protein substrates depends on their relative K m values. Since this rank order is affected differently by CAAX and GGPP-competitive inhibitors, it should allow for the design of inhibitors with different substrate profiles within the same structural class.Compound 1 (l-778,123) is a dual-specificity inhibitor with a 50-fold preference for FPTase over GGPTase I in enzyme assays. In cell culture this compound shows a 35-fold preference for FPTase, as measured by the inhibition of prenylation of Rap1a and FPTase substrate HDJ2. Inhibition of geranylgeranylation of Rap1a in PSN-1 cells is detectable at low micromolar concentrations. Preliminary pharmacodynamic analysis of Phase I clinical data shows thatl-778,123 partially inhibits Rap1a prenylation in patients at the highest dose tested. 3R. B. Lobell, D. Liu, and N. Kohl, unpublished data. The potential consequences and therapeutic benefits of inhibition of both FPTase and GGPTase I in the clinic are still uncertain; however, we have created a solid basis for selecting compounds for further development. Inhibition of prenylation of Ras oncoproteins has long been considered an attractive approach to anti-cancer therapy of Ras-dependent tumors. Four isoforms of Ras are found in mammalian cells, Kirsten-Ras (Ki-Ras) 4A and 4B, Harvey-Ras (Ha-Ras), and N-Ras. Ki4B-Ras is the most frequently mutated isozyme in human cancer, ranging from 20% up to 90% in pancreatic cancers, whereas Ha-Ras mutations are found in a small percentage of bladder cancers. Most oncogenic mutations in Ras result in the elimination of the GTPase activity, locking Ras in its active, GTP-bound conformation. All Ras proteins undergo multiple post-translational modifications on their carboxyl termini that are required for membrane localization and biological activity. The COOH-terminal CAAX motif (where C is cysteine, A stands for aliphatic, and X for any amino acid) is recognized by farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase),1 which transfers a farnesyl group from farnesyl pyrophosphate (F"

We investigated the role played by chromatin infrastructure in enabling an acute response of the XenopusTRβA gene to thyroid hormone receptor (TR), an extensively studied member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. We found that in addition to the known TR response element (TRE) in the promoter, full range regulation required an upstream enhancer that contained multiple nonconsensus TREs and augmented ligand action at high receptor levels. An array of translationally positioned nucleosomes formed over the TRβA locus in vivo; unliganded TR engaged this array in linker DNA between two nucleosomes and via TREs on the surface of histone octamers. Remarkably, assembly of enhancer DNA into mature chromatin potentiated binding by TR to its target response elements and enabled a greater range of regulation by TR than was observed on immature chromatin templates. Because assembly of enhancer DNA into chromatin increased TR binding to the nonconsensus TREs, we hypothesize that chromatin disruption targeted by liganded TR to the enhancer may lead to receptor release from the template and to an attenuation of response to hormone.

This useful approach has two limitations. (i) Bona fide targets of eukaryotic transcription factors are assembled into chromatin, whereas nonreplicating episomes are not (1Jeong S. Stein A.

The Xenopus oocyte offers an attractive experimental system for studies of transcription; evolutionarily molded to contain sufficient histone protein and chromatin assembly machinery for several thousand somatic cells, it efficiently assembles microinjected DNA into physiologically spaced chromatin (14Almouzni G.

The power of this model system is illustrated by data from our laboratory on action by the thyroid hormone receptor (TR); this extensively studied member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily is exquisitely sensitive to nanomolar quantities of its ligand, thyroid hormone (T3) (21Collingwood T.N.

By using the oocyte system, we showed that unliganded TR represses transcription via a chromatin-dependent pathway (20Wong J. Patterton D. Imhof A. Guschin D. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 520-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that involves the targeting of a complex between the corepressor N-CoR and histone deacetylase 3 (19Urnov F.D. Yee J. Sachs L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300 to activate transcription (27Li Q. Imhof A. Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5634-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Significant progress in revealing the biochemical accomplices of the NHRs in effecting transcriptional control (25Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 28Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) is in striking contrast to the paucity of structural data regarding their action on chromatin templates. In agreement with earlier chromatin-wide studies (29Samuels H.H. Perlman A.J. Raaka B.M. Stanley F. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1982; 38: 557-599PubMed Google Scholar), our in vitro data showed that unliganded TR can engage a response element on the surface of a histone octamer (30Wong J. Li Q. Levi B.Z. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7130-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). How TR, and other class II NHRs, accesses its binding sites within chromatinin vivo is unknown; we had earlier shown that TR can bind to a fully chromatinized, replicatively inert template in vivo(31Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but whether such access is contingent on DNA assembly into a specific nucleoprotein architecture in vivo remains unresolved both for the promoter we studied and for every other class II NHR-responsive gene. Because the regulatory properties of NHRs are significantly affected by the DNA sequence to which they bind (32Lefstin J.A. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2842-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 33Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3375-3380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we studied TR signaling on one of its naturally occurring target sites in theXenopus genome, the promoter for the TRβA gene (36Shi Y.B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TR effects a >300-fold range of regulation on its own promoter (31Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and this enables an autoregulatory loop that coordinates titers of hormone and receptor during Xenopus development (24Tata J.R. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1999; 81: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we set out to map the structural determinants of primary DNA sequence of the TRβA gene promoter and of its assembly into chromatin that allows for such robust synergy with TR. Our data reveal an upstream enhancer in the TRβA gene locus that contains several unusual TREs and is required for full range regulation of this gene by T3. We describe an array of translationally positioned nucleosomes over the promoter and enhancer in vivo that accommodates at least 4 TR/RXR heterodimer molecules both in linker DNA between adjacent nucleosomes and on the surface of histone octamers. In contradiction with commonly held notions that chromatin prevents access to DNA by regulatory factors, we show that chromatin assembly potentiates both binding to and action by TR/RXR on the enhancer. We hypothesize that structural distortion of the DNA assembled into a nucleosomal fiber creates a template that has a higher affinity for TR than naked DNA would be, and we suggest that chromatin disruption by liganded TR enables a novel mechanism of attenuating response to hormone by causing receptor release from the template. Plasmid pTRβA (31Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P.

The pTRβA-(Δsite 1) construct was generated by replacing the TRE at +276 with a unique NsiI recognition site using a combination of published techniques (39Du Z. Regier D.A. Desrosiers R.C.

BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 376-378PubMed Google Scholar) and used in a polymerase chain reaction with Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primers (the NsiI site is underlined; these primers anneal immediately outside the TRE at +276): forward primer, 5′-AAAATGCATGCCCAGCGCCCTGGTGCACGATCAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AAAATGCATGCCTAGGGAGGACGAACAAGGATAG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction settings were as follows: 94 °C (2 min) −10 cycles of 94 °C (15 s), 62 °C (30 s), 72 °C (3 min) −20 cycles with the same parameters, except 5 s added at each cycle extension step. This reaction generated a spurious 2.2-kb and a full-length 5-kb product that contained the entire starting plasmid with the 14 bp of the TRE replaced with the NsiI site; the 5-kb product was gel-purified, digested to completion withNsiI, recircularized with a Rapid Ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and transformed into E. colifollowing standard procedures. Clones were sequenced to confirm successful TRE replacement. Plasmid pTRβA-Δenhancer (gift of Dr. Dmitry Guschin) contains a fragment of the TRβA locus (positions −154 to +313) subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). Data identical to those shown here were obtained with a plasmid in which a more parsimonious deletion (a 350-bp NdeI-FseI fragment, positions −800 to −450]) eliminated just the TRE sequences from the TRβA enhancer (data not shown). Clones of TR and RXR were described previously (19Urnov F.D. Yee J. Sachs L. Collingwood T.N. Bauer A. Beug H. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P.

Oocytes were injected with 5 ng of RXRα mRNA and 5 ng of TR mRNA; following incubation for 10 h, 1 ng of double-stranded pTRβA DNA was injected. After 16 h of incubation, the oocytes were rinsed in MBSH medium, and 20 oocytes per experimental sample were homogenized in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm DTT (42Zaret K.S.

The homogenate was placed in a 37 °C water bath for 1 min, and DNase I (DPRF grade; Worthington) was then added to 110–132 Worthington units/ml. Aliquots of 100 μl were removed from each sample at 1 and 3 min following addition of the enzyme and mixed vigorously with an equal volume of stop buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% SDS). Proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to 700 μg/ml, and after incubation overnight at 37 °C, the DNA was extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:48:2, v/v/v), once with chloroform, precipitated with sodium acetate, and 0.7 volumes of isopropyl alcohol for 1 h on ice, and resuspended in TE buffer. RNA was removed by treatment with 100 μg/ml RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the DNA was digested to completion withEcoRI, followed by brief treatment with proteinase K, phenol/chloroform extraction, and precipitation with isopropyl alcohol as described above. The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer and fractionated (1 oocyte equivalent per sample) on a 2% high resolution blend (Amresco; Solon, OH) agarose gel in 1× TAE. Southern blotting with random prime-labeled probes was performed by transferring the DNA to 0.2 μm pore size Nytran Plus nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), hybridizing, and washing as per the manufacturer's instructions. The final wash was performed in 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 65 °C. In Figs. 1 C and 4 A, the probe used for Southern blotting hybridized to the 3′-most portion of the TRβA gene construct and in Fig. 4 B to the 5′-most portion.

Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1–2 μg poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10 min on ice; 5 or 10 pmol of unlabeled competitor double-stranded oligonucleotide and 0.2 pmol 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe were then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 35 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE at room temperature, drying, and autoradiography. All oligonucleotides used in the study were designed to have identical 4-bp 5′ overhangs and to yield 28-bp fragments once the overhangs were filled in. The malic enzyme TRE (44Petty K.J. Desvergne B. Mitsuhashi T. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7395-7400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has the sequence GGGTTAggggAGGACA. A large group of oocytes was injected with 0.5 ng of single-stranded pTRβA DNA (gift of Dr. Trevor Collingwood); after 8 h, 5 ng eachXenopus TRβ and RXRα mRNA was injected. After culture for 16 h in the presence or absence of 100 nmT3, chromatin was treated with methidiumpropyl EDTA as described (45Cartwright I.L. Hertzberg R.P. Dervan P.B. Elgin S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 46Belikov S. Gelius B. Almouzni G. Wrange O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with the following modifications: 7 oocytes were homogenized in 350 μl of room temperature 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 0.15 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm spermine. Methidiumpropyl EDTA (Sigma) was diluted to a final concentration of 5 mm in water and stored at −20 °C in single-use aliquots. Immediately prior to use, one such aliquot was diluted with water to a final concentration of 1.25 mm and mixed with an equal volume of 1.25 mmferrous ammonium sulfate (Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (Sigma) prepared from a fresh 0.5 m aqueous stock. DTT was added to the MPE-Fe mixture to a final concentration of 10 mm from a 1 m stock prepared immediately prior to use. Freshly diluted hydrogen peroxide (Fisher) was added to the oocyte homogenate to 4 mm final, followed by the addition of 37.5 μl of the MPE-Fe-DTT reagent (final MPE concentration, 62.5 μm). The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 3 or 6 min and was stopped by addition of bathophenanthroline disulfonate (Fluka) to 5 mm final and 1/4th volume of stop buffer (2.5% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5). DNA was purified by treatment with proteinase K and phenol extraction and analyzed by Southern blotting as described above. An outline of the experiment is shown in Fig.1 A; we first microinjected mRNAs for TR and RXR into the oocyte cytoplasm, and following receptor synthesis, we injected reporter DNA, the XenopusTRβA promoter (36Shi Y.B. Yaoita Y. Brown D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 733-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), into the nucleus. After an incubation period to allow chromatin assembly (14Almouzni G. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2033-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we measured transcriptional activity of the reporter by primer extension. Because the oocyte lacks endogenous TR (31Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), high levels of basal transcription driven by the reporter were insensitive to T3 in the absence of added TR (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, when TR/RXR was introduced into the oocyte, the promoter was very efficiently silenced (Fig. 1 B, compare lane 5 and lanes 3and 4), and addition of T3 to the medium activated transcription above basal levels (Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 3 and 4 with lane 6). These data agree with published observations from our laboratory (31Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2696-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Like other NHRs (4Zaret K.S. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), liganded TR targets disruption of histone-DNA contacts to the immediate vicinity of its bona fide binding sites in chromatin (26Wong J. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We used DNase I footprinting coupled with indirect end labeling (47Nedospasov S. Georgiev G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 29: 532-539Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 48Wu C. Nature. 1980; 286: 854-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar) to map cis acting elements that allow the TRβA promoter to respond to receptor and hormone. As expected (30Wong J. Li Q. Levi B.Z. Shi Y.B. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7130-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), TR-dependent binding and TR/T3-dependent disruption was observed over the previously characterized (49Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) TR response element (TRE) located at +276 relative to the transcription start site (open ellipsein Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 2–5 with lanes 6–9). In the presence of TR and T3, we reproducibly observed a disruption of histone-DNA contacts ∼500 bp upstream of the transcription start site (zigzag between lanes 5and 6 in Fig. 1 C). In the absence of TR, this stretch of chromatin did not respond to T3 (comparelanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and5 in Fig. 1 C), indicating such disruption to be TR-dependent. Importantly, identical induction of this DNase I-hypersensitive site by T3 was observed in the presence of α-amanitin (data not shown), which abrogates all RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription in the oocyte, indicating such chromatin disruption to be a direct, rather than a secondary, consequence of TR-T3 action. Within this ∼300-bp DNA segment, at least 3 receptor footprints were reproducibly visualized both in the presence (open circlesin Fig. 1 C, compare lane “6 light” withlanes 4 and 5) and absence (lanes 8and 9) of hormone, indicating that unliganded TR can access its binding sites within unremodeled chromatin. In multiple experiments (data not shown), even in the absence of T3 we observed three TR-dependent, α-amanitin-insensitive footprints in this area. We therefore conclude that in addition to the previously characterized TRE downstream of the transcription start site (49Ranjan M. Wong J. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24699-24705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the TRβA promoter contains an upstream TR- and T3-responsive segment of chromatin that can be bound by TR in vivo via 3 target sites. Furthermore, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that chromatin structure alterations we describe (Fig.1 C) are due to secondary effects of unliganded TR, our data argue very strongly against this notion. The DNA sequence of the upstream stretch of the TRβA promoter bound by TR in vivo (Fig. 1 C) is shown in Fig.2 A, and it contains three matches to a consensus TR response element (22Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). We used indirect end labeling with custom size markers and nucleotide resolution DNase I footprinting analysis to confirm that the footprints observed in vivo (Fig. 1 C) coincide with these TREs (data not shown). The TRE located at −515 matched the canonical response element arrangement of a direct repeat of two hexameric half-sites spaced by 4 bp (“DR4”), whereas the TRE at −690 had a half-site spacing of 3 bp (“DR3”), and the TRE at −780 of 2 bp (“DR2”). The primary sequences of the half-sites diverged from the canonical “AGG(T/A)CA” consensus in precise agreement with in vitro data on TR/RXR binding to DNA (43Chen H. Smit-McBride Z. Lewis S. Sharif M. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2366-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 50Judelson C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). We used an electromobility shift assay (EMSA) to confirm that these DNA sequences can bind TR/RXR. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a 25- or 50-fold molar excess of these putative TREs competed with a canonical response element for binding by TR (lanes 5–11). Consistent with their divergence from a 4-bp half-site spacing, elements 2 and 3 bound TR/RXR with lower affinity than element 4 (compare lanes 8–11 with lanes 6 and 7) or a well defined TRE from the human genome (lanes 4 and 5). A “TRE” with point mutations in all DNA residues crucial for binding (50Judelson C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10800-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (lanes 12 and 13) or a DNA segment of equal length but random sequence (lanes 14 and 15) both"
https://openalex.org/W2018898144,"A single nucleotide exchange in a promoter region located immediately upstream of the CAAT box of the spinach photosynthesis gene AtpC (gene product is subunit γ of the chloroplast ATP synthase) prevents the formation of a secondary structure and causes an unregulated, constitutive high level of expression (Kusnetsov, V., Landsberger, M., Oelmüller, R. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36009–36014). We have isolated cDNAs for ATPC-2, a new polypeptide with homologies to pro- and eukaryotic helicases, which specifically binds to this promoter region. Binding of ATPC-2 competes strongly with that of a CAAT box binding factor (CBF), consistent with the idea that both complexes cannot be formed simultaneously because of sterical reasons. In gel mobility shift assays, high binding activities of ATPC-2 and low binding activities of CBF were observed with nuclear extracts from tissue with low AtpC expression levels, and the opposite was observed with extracts from tissues with high AtpCexpression levels. Binding of ATPC-2 to the mutant sequence, which directs a constitutively high level expression in vivo and prevents the formation of a secondary structure in vitro,is significantly weaker than binding to the wild-type sequence. Again, the opposite results were obtained for the CBF. Thus, we conclude that the assembly of the CBF·DNA complex stimulates transcription of AtpC and that CBF binding is prevented if ATPC-2 is bound to the promoter region. The novel mechanism of gene regulation and the role of the helicase-like protein ATPC-2 as a potential transcriptional repressor is discussed in relation to its modular structure. A single nucleotide exchange in a promoter region located immediately upstream of the CAAT box of the spinach photosynthesis gene AtpC (gene product is subunit γ of the chloroplast ATP synthase) prevents the formation of a secondary structure and causes an unregulated, constitutive high level of expression (Kusnetsov, V., Landsberger, M., Oelmüller, R.

The novel mechanism of gene regulation and the role of the helicase-like protein ATPC-2 as a potential transcriptional repressor is discussed in relation to its modular structure. CAAT box binding factor glutathione S-transferase The plastid ATP synthase of higher plants and algae consists of nine different subunits, and three of them are encoded by the nuclear genes AtpC, AtpD, and AtpG (the gene products are the subunits γ and δ of the CF1 moiety and CFoII) (2Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Bichler J. Schneiderbauer A. Steppuhn J. Wedel N. Tyagi A.K. Westhoff P. Herrmann R.G. Larkins B.A. Plant Molecular Biology. 2. Plenum Press, New York1991: 411-427Google Scholar). Comparable with other nuclear-encoded genes for plastid proteins, expression of the spinach ATP synthase genes and chimeric promoter::reporter gene fusions in transgenic tobacco is strongly regulated by light, phytohormones, in particular cytokinins, or the stage of the plastids in cells in which these genes are expressed (cf.

However, unusually for photosynthesis genes, the essential cis-elements determining the regulated expression of AtpC are positioned in close vicinity to the respective transcription start sites (4Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and crucial nucleotides for the regulated expression appear to be located immediately upstream of the CAAT box (4Bolle C. Kusnetsov V.V. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Plant J. 1996; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This region also forms a complex with a CAAT box binding factor, CBF1 (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to many CBFs from metazoa (8Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 9McNabb D.S.

A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) the binding activity inin vitro assays is regulated, and the binding activities correspond to the promoter activities in vivo (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a single nucleotide exchange uncoupled the promoter activity from regulatory pathways and resulted in a high constitutive expression. This indicates that low promoter activities (e.g. in darkness or in photobleached tissue) are caused by an inhibitory effect that is no longer active under conditions of high promoter activities, e.g. in light or after cytokinin treatments. Here we describe the isolation of a DNA that codes for a protein with sequence-specific binding characteristics to this promoter region. We demonstrate that the binding activity is high in tissue with low AtpC expression levels and, vice versa, that this behavior is opposite to the binding features described previously for CBF (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and that the recombinant protein competes with CBF for binding. The data are consistent with a model in which this protein functions as a repressor by preventing the assembly of CBF at the CAAT box and thus repressing AtpC transcription. Tobacco seeds were surface-sterilized, planted on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2% sucrose in the presence or absence of Norflurazon (10−6m) and kept in a cold room in darkness for 2 days to synchronize germination. Seedlings were either kept in darkness for 10 days at 22 °C or they were transferred to white light for 40 h prior to harvesting in the absence or presence of Norflurazon. Alternatively, etiolated seedlings were transferred to cytokinin-containing plates (N 6-benzylaminopurine, 10−5m) in darkness 40 h prior to harvest. Oligonucleotides for wild-type and mutant sequences were annealed (11Lübberstedt T. Oelmüller R. Wanner G. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 602-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cloned into the SmaI site of pBSC+ (Stratagene, San Diego) prior to sequencing. Plasmids were chosen in which the 5′-end of the promoter fragment was orientated toward the BamHI site of pBSC+. Thus all promoter fragments had the following 5′- and 3′ extensions: 5′-GATCCCCC[Insert]GGGCTGCA-3′ and 3′-GGGG[Insert]CCCG-5′. After digestion of the plasmids with PstI and BamHI, the BamHI site was filled-in with all four radiolabeled nucleotides and the Klenow enzyme, and the fragments were gel-purified on agarose gels. For the binding studies in the presence of CBF-C (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), nuclear protein extracts were isolated from six-week-old tobacco orArabidopsis plants grown in the greenhouse. For physiological studies, seedlings were grown as described above, and the nuclear protein fractions were prepared as described (12Oelmüller R. Bolle C. Tyagi A.K. Niekrawietz N. Breit S. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Approximately 190,000 phages of an Arabidopsis thalianacDNA expression library were screened with the radiolabeledAtpC promoter region (−68 to −39; see below). Two positive phage were plaque-purified, and pBSC+ was excised according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) prior to sequencing. “Southwestern” hybridization was performed at 4 °C. The filters were first blocked with blocking buffer by gentle shaking for 3 h (SW buffer, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA; SW buffer = 25 mmHEPES-NaOH, pH 7, 6, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% v/v glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After three washing steps (10 min each) with HS buffer (SW buffer with 1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA), the filters were incubated overnight with SW buffer in the presence of the radioactive DNA fragments. After washing with SW buffer, the signals were visualized on a PhosphorImager (Storm 820, Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). The isolated cDNA as well as the cDNA encoding CBF-C (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were N-terminally fused to GST according to the manufacturer's instructions (pGEX vector system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DES)pLysS. Cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in the presence of 40 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin, diluted 100-fold, and grown at 30 °C to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, with a final concentration of 0.5 mm at 27 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) 4 h after induction, resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated. After centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), aliquots of the supernatant were applied directly onto freshly prepared glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns and further processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified GST and GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Southwestern analysis was performed as described previously (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the radiolabeled DNA fragments. For gel mobility shift assays, equal amounts of the purified proteins were used. Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,12Oelmüller R. Bolle C. Tyagi A.K. Niekrawietz N. Breit S. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CBF-C was incubated with nuclear protein extracts (1 μg/μl) in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7, 6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the DNA was added and the mixture incubated at 37 °C for 2 h prior to gel electrophoresis. For competition studies, the purified ATPC-2·GST fusion protein, the CBF-C·GST fusion protein, or GST alone was added to the preformed radiolabeled protein·DNA complex and treated as described in the figure legends. In all of the studies the CBF-C fusion was preincubated with nuclear extract as described above, whereas the ATPC-2 fusion was added directly. A double-stranded oligonucleotide from the −69 to −39AtpC region (5′-TTTACCTCCAAAATTCAATGGCCAAAATCT-3′) harboring the expression-relevant AAAAT (bold) and the CAAT (italics) motifs was used initially to screen an expression library fromArabidopsis. Positive signals were obtained only when the screen was performed in the presence of 1 mg/ml nuclear extract. The four isolated cDNAs encoded CBF-C, the subunit C of a new CAAT box binding complex isolated from plants (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, a second screen was initiated with an oligonucleotide in which the CAAT sequence was replaced by GTTA, an oligonucleotide that fails to bind to CBF-C (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two positive phages with significantly lower binding strength were obtained. Both of them also bind to the wild-type sequence harboring the CAAT motif but not to a mutant sequence with a single nucleotide exchange (A → G) in the AAAAT sequence (data not shown; see below). DNA sequence analysis revealed that both phages carried identical DNA insertions that code for the C-terminal part of a novel protein named ATPC-2. After the complete nucleotide sequence of this gene became available in the data banks, we polymerase chain reaction-amplified the complete cDNA from our library and confirmed that the protein is encoded by a genomic sequence without introns (Fig.1). A homologous cDNA was also isolated from our tobacco cDNA library; however, it is not full-length (data not shown). Data bank searches revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence exhibits homologies to DNA helicases from pro- and eukaryotic organisms (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the strongest homologies were observed to the immunoglobulin S Mu-binding protein 2 from mouse, a DNA helicase from human, and a putative DNA-binding protein from yeast (GenBankTM accession numbersP40694, L24544, and Z98951, respectively), whereas anArabidopsis protein (GenBankTM accession numberAB026643) with an unknown function exhibits less sequence similarities. Interestingly, the isolated protein also exhibits striking similarities to various bacterial proteins (amino acid sequence identity > 30%); however, the function of these proteins has not yet been determined. Motif searches did not reveal any obvious functions of ATPC-2 except that the protein harbors 29 (partially overlapping) putative phosphorylation sites for signal transduction components (Fig. 1). Closer inspection uncovered that the similarities to the mouse, human, and yeast proteins include the N-terminal five well characterized motifs known from DNA helicases (boxes I, Ia, II, III, and IV, Fig. 2). The protein as well as eight homologues with unknown function that are present in the data banks end behind box IV (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the C-terminal parts of the latter protein group contain a segment of ∼60 amino acids exhibiting between 65 and 85% amino acid sequence identity to each other (data not shown). This suggests that the Arabidopsispolypeptide belongs to a novel class of proteins present in various species and that this class of proteins exhibits striking similarities to the N termini of some DNA helicases (Fig. 2; cf. “Discussion”). In addition, a phylogenetic tree indicates that the eukaryotic proteins are closely related to each other, whereas the bacterial proteins appear to be more distantly related (data not shown). To test the DNA sequence requirement for the formation of the ATPC-2·DNA complex, a series of mutant sequences for which the transcriptional activity is known from chimeric promoter::uidA gene fusions in transgenic tobacco (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was tested for its ability to bind to ATPC-2 and CBF-C. Both proteins were overexpressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins, isolated first by glutathione 4B-Sepharose chromatography and then by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig.3 A). The isolated proteins were separated on a gel before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Filter binding assays (Fig. 3 B) in the absence (left panels) or presence (right panels) of nuclear extracts demonstrate that the wild-type sequence (AAAATTCAAT, top panels) binds to ATPC-2 in both instances. As previously described (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), binding of CBF-C requires the addition of nuclear extracts (Fig.3 B, right top panel). The mutant sequence with an A → G exchange (AAGATTCAAT) fails to bind to ATPC-2, whereas CBF-C is still capable of binding in the presence of nuclear extracts (middle panels). In contrast, the CAAT mutant sequence (AAAATTGTTA) fails to bind to CBF-C, whereas it does bind to ATPC-2 (bottom panels). This was confirmed by gel mobility shift assays. Fig. 4demonstrates that the binding activity is not affected by the CAAT box mutation (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 4 and 5) and that the binding activity of ATPC-2 to the oligonucleotide with the A → G exchange is completely lost (lanes 6 and 7). A shorter oligonucleotide, which contains the AAAATT sequence but lacks the CAAT box sequence, also fails to bind to ATPC-2 (lanes 8 and 9); this indicates that ATPC-2 binding to the AtpC promoter is sequence-specific and requires additional nucleotides located 3′ to the AAAATT motif. Furthermore, we performed competition experiments between purified ATPC-2 and CBF with the wild-type oligonucleotide sequence (Fig. 5). A 10-fold molar excess of the ATPC-2·GST fusion protein cannot displace CBF-C·GST from the oligonucleotide, whereas the same molar excess of CBF-C·GST is sufficient for self-competition (Fig. 5, top panel). The same is true for the opposite experiment, if DNA preloaded with ATPC-2·GST is used for competition studies; again the binding activity cannot be competed with a 10-fold molar excess of CBF-C/GST, whereas ATPC-2/GST is effective (Fig. 5, bottom panel). This indicates that both binding activities are tight and that either ATPC-2 or CBF can bind to this promoter region. The assembly of both complexes simultaneously is not possible for sterical reasons (cf. “Discussion”).Figure 4Gel mobility shift assays with the ATPC-2· GST fusion protein (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) and GST alone (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) to the wild-type (lanes 2 and 3) and mutant (lanes 4–9) AtpC promoter sequences.

Nuclear extracts from light-grown seedlings showed little binding activity to the wild-type oligonucleotide, whereas extracts from dark-grown seedlings showed substantially higher retardation signals. The same correlation between a low binding activity and a high promoter activity was observed with nuclear extracts from etiolated seedlings treated with cytokinin (high promoter activity (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) and from light-grown seedlings treated with the herbicide Norflurazon to block chloroplast development (low promoter activity (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). This is exactly opposite to the result that we obtained previously for CBF binding activity with the same oligonucleotides (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, low retardation signals were always observed when the A → G mutant sequence was used for the retardation assay regardless of the physiological treatment of the seedlings; this is consistent with the idea that ATPC-2 prevents the assembly of the CBF at theAtpC promoter and thus functions as a transcriptional repressor. All of the experiments presented so far were performed with ATPC-2 and/or CBF-C from Arabidopsis with nuclear extracts from tobacco. To test whether the AtpC promoter segment is regulated in a similar fashion in an Arabidopsis background and to confirm that the ATPC-2 repressor exhibits a comparable function in both species, the experiments shown in the Figs. 5 and 6 were repeated with nuclear protein fractions from Arabidopsis. Essentially the same results were obtained, except that the retardation signals were significantly weaker (data not shown), which might be caused by a contamination of the nuclear protein fraction with extranuclear proteins. In many eukaryotic class II promoters, CCAAT motifs are often found between 50 and 100 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site (13Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D.

These motifs are recognized by CCAAT-binding proteins. The CAAT box sequences in metazoa, which are believed to influence the frequency of transcriptional initiation, can be the target site for regulation, and the assembly of CBF at the CAAT motif occurs in response to cell-internal or -external signals (8Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B.

Here we demonstrate that the binding activity of the CBF to the CAAT motif in the AtpC promoter is controlled by ATPC-2. Whenever the promoter is active, we observed a low binding activity of ATPC-2 and a high binding activity of CBF and vice versa (Figs. 5 and 6). ATPC-2 exhibits striking similarities to the N-terminal half of DNA helicases belonging to superfamily I (29Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These helicases couple the binding and hydrolysis of nucleotides, mostly ATP, to conformational changes that in turn alter the affinity of the enzymes for different forms of DNA. These helicases contain a modular structure and sequence comparison of more than 100 members from viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic organisms have revealed seven conserved amino acid motifs, the boxes I, Ia, and II–VI. Motif I contains a hydrophobic stretch known as a nucleoside triphosphate-binding domain, and motif II is responsible for Mg2+-ATP binding. Motif III is homologous to the conserved sequence of a viral DNA polymerase, and the function of the residual motifs is unknown. Sequence analyses indicate that the greatest variation in the primary structure is found in the regions between motifs Ia and II and between IV and V, as well as at the N and C termini (29Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 30Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, however, demonstrates that 9 of the 12 polypeptides with the greatest similarities to ATPC-2 are significantly shorter than the well characterized helicases and lack motifs V and VI. In addition, these proteins including ATPC-2 exhibit the highest degree of similarities in the C-terminal region following motif IV, a segment that is not characteristic of all DNA helicases but found in some of them, as shown in Fig. 2. This suggests that the shorter polypeptides including ATPC-2 belong to a novel class of proteins that are either ancestors of some helicases or derive from helicases that have lost their C-terminal segment with boxes V and VI. Although the shorter proteins are found in various pro- and eukaryotic species, no functional analysis has yet been performed on any of them. Because of their striking similarities and identical modular structure, it is likely that they perform similar functions. Although all helicases of superfamily I share common biochemical properties and their biochemical reactions are quite similar, multiple mechanisms of helicase-catalyzed nucleic acid unwinding may have evolved to support specific roles in various biological processes, such as DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle control, or transcription. They recognize different DNA motifs and DNA ends as well as single-stranded and double-stranded DNA segments (29Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol.

Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) in a sequence-specific manner, discriminates between AAAATT and AAGATT. We have demonstrated previously that the former sequence forms a secondary structure in vitro, such as a partially unwound DNA region, whereas the latter does not (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, one might speculate that the sequence-specific recognition has a structural basis and might provide an ideal recognition site for a polypeptide with helicase features. Although the function of the missing helicase boxes V and VI is not clear, it is unlikely that a truncated helicase is capable of unwinding DNA. Therefore, a simple model could describe the role of ATPC-2 in AtpC gene regulation. The AAAAT sequence forms a stable protein·DNA complex and thus prevents the assembly of CBF, resulting in a diminished AtpC transcription. Both factors cannot bind simultaneously because of their overlapping binding regions (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by crystal structural data from the yeast CBF, which protects a DNA region of at least 20 nucleotides (8Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Activators of AtpC transcription, such as light or cytokinin, prevent repressor binding and thus allow for the assembly of CBF;. this is consistent with the observation that the A → G mutation, which prevents binding of the repressor but allows the assembly of CBF (Fig. 3), results in a constitutive promoter activityin vivo (1Kusnetsov V. Landsberger M. Oelmüller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36009-36014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This novel mechanism of gene regulation might add a new facet to the observations that etiolation is caused by processes that actively prevent the development observed in light (38Fankhauser C. Chory J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We thank H. Renz and F.

While PDK 1 is clearly an important component of the cell survival machinery, the potential for phospholipid-independent activation of the AKT/PKB survival pathway has not been extensively examined at the molecular level. We have identified a second form of PDK 1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that we have termed PIAK (phospholipid-independent AKT/PKBkinase). PIAK is highly homologous to C. elegans and mammalian PDK 1 with the exception that the novel kinase lacks a phospholipid binding pleckstrin homology domain. The domain structure of PIAK suggests that it might be a phospholipid-independent kinase, and PIAK phosphorylates mammalian AKT/PKB at the activating Thr308 residue in the presence of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibitors as well as in the absence of growth factors. In addition, PIAK is capable of inducing the phospholipid-independent, AKT/PKB-induced phosphorylation of the AFX-type forkhead transcription factor, resulting in its cytoplasmic localization. Because the nuclear localization of this transcription factor induces an apoptotic state, this PIAK-mediated cytoplasmic sequestration allows for cell survival. Finally, PIAK activity appears to be induced by various inhibitors of cell cycle G1progression.

The PDK 1-activated AKT/PKB can subsequently phosphorylate a number of substrates involved with cell survival, including BAD (13Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.A. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

The phosphorylation of a number of sites in these forkhead transcription factors results in their transport from the nucleus (14Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J.

This cytoplasmic localization is an important aspect of PI 3-kinase-mediated cell survival, as nuclear localization of the forkhead transcription factors in cultured cells rapidly results in cell death, which is in part mediated by the activation of caspases (15Dudek H.

Lasky, unpublished observations.2T. Tang and L. Lasky, unpublished observations. This survival pathway can be down-regulated by the catalytic activity of PTEN/MMAC, a lipid phosphatase with specificity for the 3 position of PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (16Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). The importance of the PI 3-kinase pathway to oncogenesis is emphasized by the finding that PTEN/MMAC is a tumor suppressor gene, which is homozygously lost in a high percentage of a variety of tumors (17Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R.

Hu R. Swedlund B. Teng T. Swedlund D.H.F. Tavtigian S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar). Examination of tumors and cell lines lacking PTEN/MMAC has demonstrated increased AKT/PKB activity, which presumably results in pro-survival signals (19Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 20Haas-Kogan D. Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1195-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of AKT/PKB is likely to be a major component of cell survival in both normal as well as oncogenic situations. The significance of the PI 3-kinase pathway to cell survival as well as to the regulation of metabolic processes is emphasized by genetic and molecular studies in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. The dauer larval stage is a reversible larval arrest pathway where worms do not feed, and their metabolism is shifted toward energy storage rather than energy production. Genetic analysis of this pathway, together with molecular analysis of the genes involved with dauer formation, have demonstrated that it appears to be the worm homologue of the mammalian insulin signaling pathway. Activation of a membrane-associated homologue of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor (DAF-2) appears to be the initiator of an inhibitory cascade that blocks dauer formation. Importantly, a worm homologue of the PI 3-kinase is found downstream of this receptor tyrosine kinase (21Morris J. Tissenbaum H. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1996; 382: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of this kinase also inhibits dauer formation. Interestingly, two different AKT/PKB kinases are found to be downstream of the PI 3-kinase, and it appears that mutation of these AKT/PKB kinases results in constitutive dauer formation, suggesting that the role of these kinases is to block dauer formation in response to activation of the PI 3-kinase by the DAF-2 receptor (22Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). The dauer pathway appears to converge upon the DAF-16 transcription factor, which is the worm homologue of the mammalian forkhead proteins known to be phosphorylated by AKT/PKB (22Paradis S. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2488-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 23Lin K.D.J. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Recently, this pathway has been further elucidated with the discovery that DAF-18 mutations result in a constitutive block in dauer formation. Examination of the DAF-18 gene revealed that it is the worm homologue of mammalian PTEN, consistent with the interpretation that loss of PTEN results in irreversible activation of the worm AKT/PKBs and inhibition of the activity of the worm homologue of mammalian forkhead proteins (24Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Finally, recent data have shown that a worm homologue corresponding to mammalian PDK 1 appears to be downstream of the DAF 2 receptor and PI 3-kinase but upstream of the AKT/PKB kinases, consistent with biochemical observations in the mammalian system (24Paradis S.

An important finding is that this pathway also appears to be conserved in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where it appears to regulate cell number and cell size (25Huang H. Potter C. Tao W. Li D.M. Brogiolo W. Hafen E. Sun H. Xu T. Development ( Camb .). 1999; 126: 5365-5372PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the dauer pathway is a homologue of the mammalian insulin pathway. In addition, because worms with mutations in components of this pathway show body size, egg laying, and neurological phenotypes, the results also suggest that other aspects of cell regulation mediated by the PI 3-kinase/PDK 1/AKT pathway may also be conserved between worms and mammals. While the majority of literature suggests that the AKT/PKB pathway is regulated by phospholipids, a number of reports suggest that other mediators, such as isoproteronol (26Moule S.K. Welsh G.I.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), may also be involved with the activation of this pathway in a PI 3-kinase-independent fashion. In addition, during periods of cellular quiescence, for example when nutrients are limiting and the PI 3-kinase pathway is down-regulated, it seemed likely that additional protective mechanisms might be operative. Examination of the C. elegansgenome revealed a kinase, which was homologous to PDK 1, but which lacked the phospholipid-binding PH domain. Here we report that this novel PDK 1-related enzyme is capable of activating the AKT/PKB kinase in a manner that is consistent with a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway. LY 294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma. Olomoucine and roscovitine were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories. IGF-1 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The anti-AKT, anti-phospho-AKT (Thr308), and anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) antibodies were from New England Biolabs. The anti-GFP, anti-V5, and anti-phospho-AFX (Ser193) were obtained from CLONTECH, Invitrogen, and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Dr. M. Yan and Dr. T. Tang (Genentech, Inc.) kindly provided the FLAG-tagged AKT in PRK5 and the EGFP-AFX vector, respectively. The FLAG-Δ PH-AKT encodes amino acid residues 118–480 of AKT, thus excluding the NH2-terminal PH domain. Plasmids for expression of GST-AKT in 293E cells were constructed in the vector pEBG-2T. Using standard polymerase chain reaction protocols, full-length cDNA encoding PIAK or CEPDK1 was cloned from a C. elegans cDNA library (Stratagene), and hPDK1 was cloned from a human fetal brain cDNA library. Expression vectors for PIAK, CEPDK1, and hPDK1 were constructed in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The V5-Δ PH-CEPDK1 encodes amino acid residues 1–480 of CEPDK1, thus excluding the COOH-terminal PH domain. The PIAK K59m, CEPDK1 K98m, and hPDK1 K111mmutants were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickchangeTM kit from Stratagene. The presence of the introduced mutation and fidelity of polymerase chain reaction reactions were confirmed by sequence analysis. The 293E human epithelial cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). The MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected using the FuGENETM 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The T98G human glioblastoma cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), antibiotics, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids. The 293E cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding GST-AKT using the FuGENETM 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 12 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. The cells were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, 0.27 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the supernatant was incubated for 2 h with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 3000 × g and then washed three times in buffer A. The beads were further washed five times in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.03% Brij-35, 0.27 m sucrose to remove Triton X-100, which might interfere with the activation of AKT by PIAK. GST-AKT was eluted from the beads with buffer B containing 20 mm glutathione, pH 8.0. 293E cells were seeded in six-well dishes at the density of 5 × 105 cells/well and then transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, 0.27 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer, resolved by 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subsequently analyzed by protein immunoblotting. 1 × 107 293E cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild type or kinase dead (KA) mutant of V5-PIAK. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection and lysed in buffer A. V5-PIAK proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysate proteins with V5antibody. The precipitated proteins were washed twice in kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm protein kinase C inhibitor, 1 μmmicrocystin-LR, 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 100 μm ATP. The resulting PIAK proteins were resuspended in the kinase assay buffer plus 100 μmphosphatidylserine, 100 μmphosphatidylcholine in the presence or absence of 10 μm PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μg of purified GST-AKT. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by 1% SDS. The assay was performed in a similar manner using PDK 1. While examining the C. elegansgenome for a homologue of the PDK 1 kinase that might be involved with the phosphorylation of the second (Ser473) activation site on AKT/PKB, we observed a kinase that was highly related to bothC. elegans (24Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and mammalian (3Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N.

Fig.1 illustrates that this kinase (PIAK) contained a kinase domain that was conserved with the kinase domains of mammalian (41% identity, 57% similarity) and C. elegans(32% identity, 56% similarity) PDK 1. In addition, this figure illustrates that the novel kinase lacked the lipid-binding PH domain, which is found in both the PDK 1 as well as the AKT/PKB kinases. In addition, scrutiny of the C. elegans genome did not reveal any phospholipid-binding PH encoding exons 3′ of the gene encoding this novel kinase. Examination of the non-kinase sequences in the novel protein did not demonstrate any known membrane association motifs. These data suggested that the novel C. eleganskinase could have substrate specificity that was similar to PDK 1, but might be regulated in a phospholipid-independent manner. To determine whether the C. elegans PDK 1 can phosphorylate AKT/PKB at the activating Thr308 residue in a heterologous system, we cotransfected the novel kinase together with human AKT/PKB into 293 cells in the presence of serum and examined the phosphorylation of this residue using a phospho-specific antibody. Fig.2 A illustrates that theC. elegans PDK 1 is capable of phosphorylating human AKT/PKB at Thr308, thus confirming the genetic data suggesting a role for this kinase in AKT/PKB activation in the dauer pathway (24Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Importantly, removal of the PH domain of this kinase resulted in a loss of Thr308 phosphorylation, suggesting that the AKT/PKB phosphorylating activity of C. elegans PDK 1 kinase requires an interaction with cellular 3′-phospholipids mediated by this domain. This figure also illustrates that the novel kinase is capable of phosphorylating the Thr308 residue as efficiently as the known PDK 1 kinase, despite the fact that the novel kinase lacks a PH domain. In addition, the figure illustrates that the kinase activity of the novel enzyme is required for this phosphorylation event, since the ATP binding mutant (KA) shows little, if any, activity. Finally, Fig. 2 B shows that, while the PDK 1 kinase of C. elegans requires a PH domain on the AKT/PKB substrate for Thr308 phosphorylating activity, the novel kinase does not require this domain. These data suggest that, while the C. elegans PDK 1 appears to have fastidious requirements for phospholipid interaction domains, the novel kinase is capable of phosphorylating the activation site of AKT/PKB in the absence of a phospholipid-binding domain on either protein. The above data were consistent with the hypothesis that the novel C. elegans PDK 1-like kinase might be active in the absence of the 3′-phospholipids produced by PI 3-kinase activity. To examine this possibility, human andC. elegans PDK 1 as well as the novel C. eleganskinase were analyzed for AKT/PKB Thr308 phosphorylating activity in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Fig.3 illustrates that, in contrast to human and C. elegans PDK 1, PIAK is able to phosphorylate AKT at Thr308 in the absence of the IGF-1 growth factor. The figure also illustrates that the IGF-1-mediated activation of human andC. elegans PDK 1 is strongly inhibited by wortmannin, while the constitutive activity of PIAK is not. Fig. 3 B further shows that in the presence or absence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, purified GST-AKT can be phosphorylated by PIAK in vitro. Fig. 4 illustrates that, as expected, LY 294002 strongly inhibits the ability of both human as well as C. elegans PDK 1 kinases to phosphorylate human AKT/PKB at the Thr308 residue in response to serum. Importantly, this figure also depicts that the activity of the PIAK kinase is not inhibited by LY 294002, but is instead enhanced, suggesting that the activity of this kinase is independent of PI 3-kinase. To further examine the possible mechanism for this enhanced activity, we analyzed the ability of the PDK 1 kinases to interact physically with AKT/PKB in a coprecipitation assay. Fig. 4 illustrates that both human andC. elegans PDK 1 can be coprecipitated with human AKT/PKB, and this interaction appears to depend upon the presence of serum-induced PI 3-kinase activity. One interpretation of these results is that membrane association of the two kinases via PH-mediated binding to 3′-phospholipids is in part responsible for their physical interaction (2Franke T.F.

Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In contrast to this result, the association between the human AKT/PKB and the novel kinase appears to be strengthened by the inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity. A possible explanation for this result is that loss of 3-phospholipids after inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by LY 294002 releases the membrane-associated AKT/PKB, thus allowing for an interaction with the presumably nonmembrane-associated novel kinase (29Astoul E. Watton S. Cantrell D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly suggest that the novel kinase is able to phosphorylate AKT/PKB in a phospholipid-independent manner. Thus, we have chosen to name the novel kinase PIAK (phospholipid independentAKT/PKB kinase).Figure 4PIAK interacts with AKT more efficiently in the presence of LY 294002. 293E cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-AKT with V5-hPDK1, V5-CEPDK1, or V5-PIAK. 12 h after transfection, the cells were left untreated or treated with 20 μm LY 294002 for 16 h. Cell lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-AKT antibody and then immunoblotted with anti-V5 antibody, anti-phospho-AKT (Thr308) antibody, or anti-AKT antibody. 10% of the lysate used in the immunoprecipitation was blotted with anti-V5 antibody showing the input proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While these data suggested that PIAK was capable of inducing the phosphorylation of the AKT/PKB activating site, they did not address the functional implications of this phosphorylation event. Both genetic and biochemical data suggest that the phosphorylation of a subset of forkhead transcription factors by AKT/PKB mediates the cytoplasmic localization of these factors (14Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar, 15Dudek H.

In addition, it has been established that the nuclear localization of these transcription factors induces cell death via apoptosis in cultured cells, presumably because the transcription factors bring about the expression of genes that precipitate the apoptotic cascade (14Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar).2 Thus, a major activity of AKT/PKB is to sequester these death-inducing transcription factors in the cytoplasm, where they are inactive. We therefore sought to examine the phosphorylation of one of these transcription factors, AFX, in response to human and C. elegans PDK 1 as well as to PIAK in the absence and presence of another specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin. Fig. 5 A illustrates that both human as well as C. elegans PDK 1 are able to stimulate the AKT/PKB-dependent phosphorylation of AFX as detected by a phospho-specific antibody. In addition, this figure shows that this phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of wortmannin and is dependent upon serum, again consistent with the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of AKT/PKB by these kinases is contingent upon phospholipids produced by PI 3-kinase. Analysis of the ability of PIAK to induce AFX phosphorylation reveals that this occurs both in the absence of serum as well as in the presence of wortmannin, consistent with the suggestion that PIAK is able to induce the activation of AKT/PKB in the absence of phospholipids produced by PI 3-kinase. To examine whether the AFX phosphorylation was of functional importance, we analyzed the subcellular localization of a green fluorescent protein chimera of AFX (AFX-GFP). Fig. 5, B and C, illustrate that AFX-GFP is found to be cytoplasmically localized in the presence of both human and C. elegans PDK 1 as well as PIAK. However, when transfected cells are exposed to wortmannin, the AFX-GFP is found in the nucleus of the human and C. elegans PDK 1-transfected cells, but is still sequestered predominately in the cytoplasm of PIAK-transfected cells. Because nuclear localization of AFX is lethal (15Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R.J. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar),2 these results suggest that PIAK is capable of inhibiting AFX-induced apoptosis in the absence of PI 3-kinase activity. Because LY 294002 is capable of inducing G1 arrest (30Casagrande F. Bacqueville D. Pillaire M. Malecaze F. Manenti S. Breton-Douillon M. Darbon J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we next decided to examine whether inhibitors of cell cycle progression could induce the AKT/PKB phosphorylating activity of PIAK. Fig.6 A illustrates that olomoucine and roscovitine, specific inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (31Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strand M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), are able to increase the level of AKT/PKB phosphorylation in response to transfected PIAK, but not to either human or C. elegans PDK 1. This increase in AKT/PKB activity was not observed with other types of inhibitors such as nocodazole or aphidicolin (data not shown), suggesting that it may be a specific effect of inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. Interestingly, the enhancement of phosphorylation by olomoucine was similar to that observed with the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor okadaic acid (data not shown), confirming the suggestion that protein phosphatase 2A dephosphorylates the Thr308 site on AKT/PKB in vivo (32Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) and suggesting that the observed olomoucine-induced enhancement was significant. Finally, Fig. 6 B shows that these CDK inhibitors also activate endogenous AKT/PKB in T98G human glioblastoma cells. Together, these data suggest that PIAK may be activated by inhibition of cell cycle progression, particularly by the arrest of G1 progression. The results reported here are consistent with the proposal that a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway can activate the AKT/PKB survival kinase, at least in the nematode C. elegans. This conclusion is important, because it provides the first detailed molecular evidence that this critical cytoprotective pathway can be regulated by nonphospholipid-dependent mechanisms. Importantly, the results are completely consistent with the domain structure of PIAK, which lacks the phospholipid binding PH motif found in PDK 1. The results also suggest that the activation of PIAK induces the cytoplasmic localization of the apoptotic transcription factor, AFX. This latter result is significant, because it suggests that the activation of this novel kinase is functionally important to the maintenance of cell survival. Finally, the activation of this kinase by induction of cell cycle arrest, particularly in the G1phase of the cell cycle, suggests that PIAK may be functionally important during periods of cellular inactivity induced by growth factor starvation. While these results argue for a significant role for PIAK in cytoprotection, a number of questions remain. The mechanism by which PIAK interacts with and activates AKT/PKB remains unresolved. The fact that the two proteins can be efficiently coprecipitated, especially in the absence of PIP3 phospholipids, suggests that these proteins are directly associated. In addition, while previous data suggested that the AKT/PKB kinase maintains a structure that is resistant to Thr308 phosphorylation in the absence of 3-phospholipids (2Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 3Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B.

A second question concerns the conservation of this kinase in other species. While examination of mammalian data bases has not revealed an obvious homologue of PIAK, examination of theD. melanogaster genome revealed that the inaC(33Hardie R.C. Peretz A. Suss-Toby E. Rom-Glas A. Bishop S.A. Selinger Z. Minke B. Nature. 1993; 363: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) protein kinase, a homologue of protein kinase C, was the kinase most closely related to PIAK. While it is unlikely that theinaC kinase is a functional homologue of PIAK, it is of course possible that a more distantly related kinase is in fact the functional homologue of the nematode kinase. No apparent homologue of PIAK in Homo sapiens has yet been found, although a definitive answer awaits the release of the complete human genome sequence. In one human glioblastoma cell line, T98G, the phosphorylation of endogenous AKT at Thr308 was found to be stimulated by Cdk and the inhibitors olomoucine and roscovitine (Fig. 6 B). Because only PIAK, but not PDK 1, was found to be stimulated by Cdk inhibitors, this observation suggests that there is at least a functional homologue of PIAK in humans. Alternatively, it is possible that PIAK functions in a pathway that is specific for C. elegans. For example, PIAK might be activated during the dauer stage of the larval nematode to enable cytoprotection under low nutrient conditions where cells are presumably quiescent. It will of course be important to examine the effects of mutations of PIAK in worms to more accurately elucidate its functional significance. In addition, it will be of significant interest to examine the ability of PIAK to phosphorylate other PDK 1 substrates, such as SGK, P70S6K, P90RSK, and various PKC isoforms (8Toker A. Newton A. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Finally, while the exact mechanism by which PIAK is itself activated remains to be elucidated, the fact that inhibitors of GI progression result in PIAK-induced Thr308 phosphorylation is also consistent with the hypothesis that this activation pathway may be operable during periods of cell quiescence. One possibility is that low PIP3 levels during cellular quiescence might release membrane-associated AKT/PKB, thus allowing for an enhanced interaction with PIAK. Together, these data suggest that disparate mechanisms may operate to ensure that the apoptotic cascade initiated by forkhead transcription factors is inhibited under diverse stressful conditions.

Human MSP is a disulfide-linked heterodimer comprising an α and β chain with molecular masses (not including N-linked carbohydrate) of 53 and 25 kDa, respectively. It is a member of a plasminogen-related family of proteins characterized by multiple copies in the α chain of a highly conserved triple disulfide loop structure (kringle). The kringle protein family includes plasminogen (12Sottrup-Jensen L. Zajdel M. Claeys H. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2577-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), prothrombin (13Park C.H. Tulinsky A.

Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). These proteins are secreted as single-chain precursors, which have no biological activity until the protein is cleaved into α and β chains by specific serine proteases at an Arg-X bond (17Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Williams W.J. Beutler E. Erslev A.J. Lichtman M.A. Hematology. McGraw-Hill, New York1990: 1313-1321Google Scholar), in which X is most frequently Val. The αβ chain junction of MSP is Arg483-Val484 (18Yoshikawa W. Hara H. Takehara T. Shimonishi M. Sakai H. Shimizu N. Shimizu S. Wang M.-H. Hagiya M. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The β chain of MSP is homologous to the β chain catalytic domain of the serine protease members of the kringle family. However, MSP and HGF/SF are devoid of proteolytic activity, because of amino acid substitutions of the three β chain protease active site residues His, Asp, and Ser. They are thought to have evolved from an ancient coagulation protein (19Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to become growth and motility factors, while retaining the protease-dependent activation mechanism of the zymogens of the family. Like kringle proteins of the coagulation system, MSP is constitutively synthesized by hepatic parenchymal cells and is secreted into the circulating blood as biologically inactive pro-MSP. The mean concentration of pro-MSP in the plasma of a series of normal human subjects is 5 nm (20Nanney L.B. Skeel A. Luan J. Polis S. Richmond A. Wang M.-H. Leonard E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The level is not changed in the course of an acute phase reaction (21Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To act on target cells in extravascular sites, pro-MSP must diffuse into tissues and be proteolytically cleaved to the biologically active disulfide-linked αβ chain heterodimer (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The EC50 for the action of the MSP heterodimer on macrophages is 0.25 nm (1Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Showalter S. Tanaka S. Appella E. Leonard E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The Arg483-Val484 scissile bond of pro-MSP is a typical cleavage site for trypsin-like serine proteases. Several such proteases of the coagulation system, including factors XIa and XIIa and serum kallikrein cleave pro-MSP to active MSP in vitro (23Wang M.-H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cleavage is minimal when blood clots, indicating that pro-MSP is not a preferred substrate for these enzymes (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have described two pro-MSP convertase activities in extravascular sites, one in wound fluid exudates (20Nanney L.B. Skeel A. Luan J. Polis S. Richmond A. Wang M.-H. Leonard E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the other associated with murine resident peritoneal macrophages (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cleavage of pro-MSP by resident peritoneal macrophages involves a minimum of two surface proteolytic activities: one, a pro-MSP convertase, cleaves pro-MSP to active MSP; the other degrades pro-MSP (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When pro-MSP is added to macrophages in culture wells in serum-free medium, the activity of the degrading enzyme predominates. However, if soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) is present, the degrading enzyme is preferentially inhibited, and the pro-MSP convertase cleaves the protein to active MSP, as shown by SDS-PAGE of the products and by induction of characteristic shape changes in the macrophages. The effect of STI could be reproduced by adding human or mouse serum to the cultures. A number of human serum protease inhibitors, including α1-antitrypsin, C1-inhibitor, anti-thrombin III, and α2-macroglobulin, had no effect on macrophage cleavage of pro-MSP (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Identification of the serum inhibitor and approaches to determining its physiological role are the subjects of this article. Recombinant human pro-MSP and MSP were supplied by Drs. W. Yoshikawa and T. Takehara of Toyobo, Osaka, Japan. STI was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN. AEBSF and bovine albumin, Fraction V, fatty acid-poor, nuclease- and protease-free were from Calbiochem, Palo Alto, CA. α1-Antichymotrypsin was from Athens Research and Technology, Athens, GA. 125I-Labeled Bolton-Hunter Reagent (NEX120) and Enlightning were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Serotonin was from Sigma-Aldrich. [3H]Dextran, 70,000 kDa, was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Affi-Gel blue gel was from Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA. Immobilon-P transfer membranes (polyvinylidene fluoride) were from Millipore/Waters, Bedford, MA. LeukoStat stain was from Fisher Scientific. HPLC-DEAE, Protein Pak DEAE5PW was from Millipore/Waters. HPLC TSK-3000, TSK gel, Type G3000SW was from TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA. Ten micrograms of pure recombinant human pro-MSP in 30 μl of 0.1m borate buffer, pH 8.5, were added to 250 μCi of125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent and equilibrated on ice for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 300 μl of borate buffer containing 0.5 m glycine. After 10 min on ice the reaction mixture was applied to an Excellulose GF-5 desalting column (Pierce, Rockford, IL) that had been equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% gelatin. The iodinated protein was eluted with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline-gelatin buffer, and counted in γ-counter (Gamma 5500, Beckman). The specific activity of the labeled protein was ∼400 Ci/mmol. Partial degradation of iodinated pro-MSP occurred during storage at −20 °C, as shown by the appearance on SDS-PAGE of a band that migrated to about the same position as the MSP α-chain and a band corresponding to small fragments (Fig. 2, lane C). To detect the capacity of the macrophage pro-MSP convertase to cleave pro-MSP to the αβ chain heterodimer, we used 125I-pro-MSP stored for a limited time (Fig. 4) or freshly prepared (Fig. 5).Figure 4Effect of STI and ACT on cleavage of pro-MSP by macrophages.

Cells were washed twice and resuspended in DMEM without serum at a concentration of 8 × 105 total cells/ml. Wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (Costar 3596, Corning, Inc., Corning, NY) were loaded with 200-μl volumes of cell suspension. After 30 min for cell settling and adherence, well fluid was replaced with 50 μl of DMEM containing 1 mg/ml nuclease-protease-free bovine serum albumin, about 150 fmol of 125I-pro-MSP, and fractions being tested for inhibition of pro-MSP cleavage by macrophages. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 h. Proteins of the well fluids were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on a polyacrylamide gel. MSP, pro-MSP, and Bio-Rad pre-stained protein standards were also applied to the gel as reference markers. Radioautographs of the dried gel were made to determine the presence of 125I-pro-MSP cleavage products. For determination of morphological effects of pro-MSP cleavage products, murine resident peritoneal cells in DMEM were distributed into wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate (400,000 cells/well). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, well fluids were replaced by 400 μl of DMEM containing 3 nm MSP as a positive control or 5 nm pro-MSP with protease inhibitors being tested. The plate was incubated for 3–4 h, and then the adherent cells were stained with LeukoStat for microscopic evaluation and photography. Into the peritoneal cavity of a series of mice, we injected 4 ml of 0.15m NaCl with or without 4 × 10−5m serotonin (5HT). After an interval of 1 min for the NaCl mice and 30 min for the 5HT mice, the animals were killed by cervical dislocation and fluid was aspirated from the peritoneal cavity. The recovered peritoneal cavity washout fluids were concentrated by ultrafiltration. A 280 was measured before and after ultrafiltration, and fluids were tested for capacity to affect the pattern of 125I-pro-MSP cleavage by mouse peritoneal macrophages. After incubation, reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by radioautography. To estimate the volume of fluid in the peritoneal cavity of normal mice or 30 min after intraperitoneal serotonin, we injected 0.5 ml of 70,000-kDa [3H]dextran into a series of 3 mice each. After massage of the abdomen, the mice were killed and peritoneal fluid was aspirated and counted in a scintillation counter. From a comparison of the aspirate counts/min and the injected counts/min, we calculated that the mean peritoneal fluid volume was 140 ± 30λ (S.E.) for normal mice and 900 ± 30λ 30 min after intraperitoneal serotonin. The 900λ figure for the serotonin-treated mice was obtained after subtraction of the injected serotonin volume. From the recovered A 280 in the peritoneal cavity washouts and the pre-washout peritoneal fluid volumes, we calculated values for pre-washout A 280. To 200 ml of pooled outdated human blood plasma were added 53 g of (NH4)2SO4 to make a molarity of 1.5. The slurry was stirred at 20 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The precipitate was discarded. To precipitate albumin from the supernatant, 0.3 n HCl was added until the pH was 4.1. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was ultrafiltered on an Amicon YM-10 filter from a volume of about 250 to 150 ml. The solution was dialyzed at 4 °C against water to remove the (NH4)2SO4 and then against 0.02m, pH 7.1, sodium phosphate buffer. The 150 ml of albumin-free inhibitor solution was applied to a 3 × 23-cm column containing 75 ml of Affi-Gel blue gel. After unbound protein was washed through the column, bound protein was eluted with 1.4m NaCl. Total A 280 of the pooled eluate was 26% of the applied A280. The 100-ml eluate was dialyzed against 0.02 m, pH 8.0, Tris buffer, and concentrated on an Amicon YM 10 and Centricon 10 filter to a volume of about 3 ml, and an A 280 of 42. A 2.5-ml volume of this solution was applied to an HPLC DEAE column, and bound proteins were eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.3 m in starting buffer over a period of 60 min. Fractions with inhibitor activity were pooled, ultrafiltered to a volume of 2.5 ml, dialyzed against 0.02 m, pH 8.0, Tris buffer, and rechromatographed on the HPLC DEAE column under the same conditions. In the final chromatography step, the peak DEAE inhibitor fraction was dialyzed against DMEM and applied to an HPLC TSK 3000 gel filtration column. A flow chart that outlines the initial steps in purification of the inhibitor is shown in Fig.1. The rationale was to separate the bulk of the plasma proteins from the inhibitor prior to final purification. In the first step, about 70% of the total A 280was precipitated at a concentration of 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4, leaving the inhibitor and plasma albumin in the supernatant. Exploratory experiments showed that in two different high resolution fractionation trials, Affi-Gel blue dye-ligand chromatography and ion exchange chromatography, albumin, and the inhibitor behaved similarly. Therefore, albumin was removed by precipitation near its isoelectric point at pH 4.1, leaving the inhibitor in the supernatant. The inhibitor was then purified by sequential chromatography on Affi-Gel blue and HPLC DEAE columns as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A relatively large amount of protein was eluted from the HPLC DEAE column just prior to the inhibitor. To minimize admixture of this protein, pooled inhibitor fractions were equilibrated with starting buffer and re-run on the HPLC-DEAE column (DEAE-2). Proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. A range of fractions from 38 to 54, corresponding to a portion of the NaCl gradient from 0.15 to 0.23 m was assayed for capacity to inhibit proteolysis of 125I-pro-MSP by macrophages. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography after incubation with macrophages showed that proteolysis of pro-MSP was inhibited by fractions in the 44–48 range (Fig.2). SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions of fractions 44–48 showed a major band at about 66 kDa and a number of less intense bands over the 14–97-kDa marker range (data not shown). To determine if the major band was the inhibitor, we applied DEAE-2 fraction 44 to an HPLC TSK-3000 gel filtration column. Fig. 3shows maximal inhibitor activity in fractions 35 and 36, which corresponded to a protein peak that eluted at the position of serum albumin (68 kDa). After SDS-PAGE of the peak fractions, the gel was lightly stained with Coomassie Blue to locate the 68-kDa band (data not shown). This was repeated with a pool of fractions 35–37, the protein band was transferred to Immobilon P, and a piece of membrane corresponding to the 68-kDa band was cut out for N-terminal sequencing. The sequence of the first 15 N-terminal residues (NSPLDEENLTXENXD) had 87% identity to a 15-residue sequence of human α1-antichymotrypsin. Travis et al. (24Travis J. Garner D. Bowen J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) reported that the apparent molecular mass of purified human α1-antichymotrypsin on SDS-PAGE gels was 68 kDa. The inhibition of macrophage pro-MSP cleavage by α1-antichymotrypsin is shown in Fig.4. After a control incubation of125I-pro-MSP without cells for 180 min, SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions shows by autoradiography a predominant 78-kDa band that represents uncleaved pro-MSP (Fig. 4, lane 6). The small band below it reflects a pro-MSP degradation product that occurs on storage of the iodinated protein. In all other lanes, which are autoradiographs of pro-MSP after incubation with macrophages, the two bands of interest are at 53 and 46 kDa. The 53-kDa band corresponds to the α chain of MSP, generated by the macrophage pro-MSP convertase; the 46-kDa band is a fragment generated by the macrophage pro-MSP degrading enzyme (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Without inhibitors of the macrophage enzymes, the 46-kDa degradation product band is more intense than the 53-kDa MSP α-chain band (Fig. 4, lane 1). STI, a selective inhibitor of the degrading enzyme, allows exclusive cleavage by the macrophage pro-MSP convertase to MSP (Fig. 4, lane 2, 53 kDa band). The action of 3 different concentrations of α1-antichymotrypsin is shown in Fig. 4, lanes 3–5. Lane 3 shows detectable inhibitor action at a concentration of 0.07 μm as shown by an increase, compared with lane 1, in the 78- and 53-kDa bands and a decrease in the 46-kDa band and small fragments (F). These changes are more pronounced for 0.4 μm α1-antichymotrypsin (lane 4). At a concentration of 5 μm, α1-antichymotrypsin almost completely inhibited both enzymes, as shown by the large amount of uncleaved pro-MSP (lane 5) and a band pattern comparable to the incubation control (lane 6). The above data show that over the concentration range from 0.07 to 5 μm α1-antichymotrypsin preferentially inhibited the macrophage pro-MSP degrading enzyme at the low end of the range and completely inhibited both the degrading enzyme and the convertase at 5 μm, a value that approaches the mean human serum concentration of 7 μm (25Berninger R.W. J. Med. 1985; 16: 101-128PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of this inhibitor on macrophage proteolytic activity in extravascular sites will be critically dependent on its concentration. Using the peritoneal cavity as an accessible extravascular site, we assayed inhibitor activity of peritoneal fluid from normal mice and from mice treated with intraperitoneal serotonin to induce a moderate increase in vascular permeability. The results are shown in Fig.5. Lane 1 shows almost complete degradation of 125I-pro-MSP by macrophages in medium alone. Three percent mouse serum (A 280 = 1.2) is in the partial inhibition range, which reveals cleavage by the convertase to MSP (53 kDa line) and by the degrading enzyme to the 46-kDa product (lane 2). Fluid washed out of the peritoneal cavity and ultrafiltered to an A 280 of 2.2 (lane 3) also allowed partial cleavage to MSP (53 kDa line).Lane 4 shows the effect of concentrated (A 280 6.1) peritoneal fluid from serotonin-treated mice. It minimized activity of the pro-MSP degrading enzyme (note low amount of the fragment band) and favored the action of the convertase as shown by the relative sizes of the 53- and 46-kDa bands. Pro-MSP, with or without protease inhibitors, or MSP as a positive control, was added to murine peritoneal macrophages in tissue culture wells, and the cells were periodically observed by phase microscopy during a 4-h incubation at 37 °C. In the presence of pro-MSP without protease inhibitors (Fig.6 A), macrophages did not change their rounded morphology, characteristic for cells in DMEM alone or DMEM and protease inhibitors without pro-MSP (not shown). MSP induced macrophages to become elongated in shape (Fig. 6 B). Similar macrophage morphology was observed in wells with pro-MSP in the presence of STI (Fig. 6 C) or α1-antichymotrypsin (Fig. 6 D). These findings correlate with the data in Fig. 4, showing that inhibition of the degrading enzyme by STI or α1-antichymotrypsin resulted in conversion of pro-MSP to MSP. We reported that murine resident peritoneal macrophages have two cell surface proteolytic activities that can cleave pro-MSP. One cleaves pro-MSP to active MSP, the other degrades pro-MSP (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The degrading protease was inhibited by STI and by normal human or mouse serum. It was not inhibited by a number of plasma protease inhibitors, including α1-antitrypsin, C1-inhibitor, anti-thrombin III, and α2-macroglobulin (22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the inhibitor in human plasma is α1-antichymotrypsin. It is therefore probable that the macrophage pro-MSP degrading enzyme is a serine protease with chymotrypsin or cathepsin-G-like substrate preferences, which cleaves at sites with aromatic or large aliphatic residues. Inasmuch as the initial major macrophage inactivating cleavage product of pro-MSP is a 46-kDa fragment (Ref. 22Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and Fig. 4,lane 1), our results suggest that this fragment is formed by cleavage at Phe418, which would yield a polypeptide with a calculated mass of 45.7 kDa. Phe418 is located within the triple disulfide loop structure of kringle 4, and therefore release of the fragment would require reduction. Consistent with this prediction, the amount of 46-kDa fragment was minimal after SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). Inhibition of the macrophage pro-MSP degrading enzyme by STI (Fig. 4,lane 2) led to the expectation that the degrading enzyme would be a trypsin-like serine protease. It was thus a surprise to find that the serum inhibitor of the enzyme is α1-antichymotrypsin. A review of the literature showed that STI can bind and inhibit chymotrypsin as well as trypsin. In fact, the inhibitor has two binding sites, one for trypsin or chymotrypsin and another for chymotrypsin (26Bosterling B. Quast U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 657: 58-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since the macrophage pro-MSP convertase generates active MSP, the cleavage site is expected to be Arg483-Val484, the αβ chain junction (18Yoshikawa W. Hara H. Takehara T. Shimonishi M. Sakai H. Shimizu N. Shimizu S. Wang M.-H. Hagiya M. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This is a preferred cleavage site for trypsin-like serine proteases. However, the inhibitor profile for the macrophage pro-MSP convertase is unusual, in that it is not inhibited by various inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, including leupeptin, aprotinin, FPR-chloromethylketone, FFR-chloromethylketone (data not shown), and STI. And it is completely inhibited, along with the pro-MSP degrading enzyme, by 5 μmα1-antichymotrypsin, a preferential inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteases. Purification and characterization of the macrophage pro-MSP convertase would therefore be of interest. It is possible that the convertase and the degrading activities reflect dual specificities of a single protein. An example is human cathepsin G, which has both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like specificities (27Hof P. Mayr I. Huber R. Korzus E. Potempa J. Travis J. Powers J.C. Bode W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5481-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and binds both trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors (28Polanowska J. Krokoszynska I. Czapinska H. Watorek W. Dadlez M. Otlewski J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to its well known location in leukocyte azurophilic granules, cathepsin G with dual specificity has been detected on cell membranes isolated from the U-937 human promonocytic cell line (29Avril L.E. Martino-Ferrer M. Pignede G. Seman M. Gauthier F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These cells, with or without the maturational stimulus of phorbol esters, had no protease activity for pro-MSP (data not shown). Like the coagulation factors from which MSP is thought to have evolved (19Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), regulation of its activity depends on proteolytic cleavage of the single chain precursor pro-MSP, which is present in human circulating blood at a concentration of 5 nm (20Nanney L.B. Skeel A. Luan J. Polis S. Richmond A. Wang M.-H. Leonard E.J. J. Invest.

If pro-MSP and α1-antichymotrypsin diffuse from the circulation into the extravascular space, inhibition of pro-MSP degradation by tissue macrophages might allow the macrophage pro-MSP convertase to generate active MSP, which could act on cells expressing the RON MSP receptor, including macrophages themselves as well as epithelial cells (30Leonard E.J. Danilkovitch A. Vande Woude G. Klein G. Advances in Cancer Research. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 139-167Google Scholar). Using the murine peritoneal cavity as an example of extravascular space, we showed that peritoneal fluid from normal or serotonin-treated mice could preferentially inhibit the macrophage pro-MSP degrading enzyme and allow cleavage by the convertase to MSP (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). From the A 280 of peritoneal washouts and determination of pre-washout peritoneal fluid volume by radioactive dextran dilution (as described under “Experimental Procedures”), we estimated that the meanA 280 in peritoneal fluid of normal and serotonin-treated mice was 6.8 ± 0.6 and 4.4 ± 0.3, respectively, for a series of three mice each. TheA 280 of the fluids tested in the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5 was 2.2 for lane 3 and 6.1 forlane 4. These data suggest that in both normal mice and mice with a moderate increase in vascular permeability, the concentration of inhibitor in this extravascular space is in the range that can inhibit proteolytic degradation of pro-MSP by macrophages, and allow generation of MSP by the pro-MSP convertase. In contrast, since the concentration of plasma proteins in acute, severe inflammatory exudates approaches that of proteins in the circulation, the mean α1-antichymotrypsin concentration of 7 μm (25Berninger R.W. J. Med. 1985; 16: 101-128PubMed Google Scholar) is in the range that completely inhibits macrophage pro-MSP convertase activity (Fig. 4, lane 5). Mature MSP is present in these exudates (20Nanney L.B. Skeel A. Luan J. Polis S. Richmond A. Wang M.-H. Leonard E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), generated by a unique fluid phase pro-MSP convertase, purification of which is in progress. In contrast to the exudate fluid phase convertase, the potential significance of the macrophage pro-MSP convertase may be to generate MSP locally to act on cells expressing the RON receptor under physiological conditions, in the absence of inflammation. We are grateful to Dr. David Leonard for useful discussions about estimations of peritoneal fluid volume and protein concentration, Dr. Philip Askenase for suggesting the use of serotonin for increasing vascular permeability in the mouse, and Dr. Alla Danilkovitch for her computer software wizardry."
https://openalex.org/W1596126504,"The plastic deformation of polycrystalline materials from rocks to metal foils has been difficult to understand because experimental data could only be obtained before and after but not during deformation. But as [Heidelbach][1] explains in his Perspective, a new method reported by [ Margulies et al. ][2] enables deformation of single crystals inside a polycrystalline matrix to be monitored in situ while the deforming stress is applied. The method should lead to important advances in understanding plastic deformation behavior.
