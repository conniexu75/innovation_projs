https://openalex.org/W2080795403,"Genes encoding yeast RNA polymerase II subunits were cloned. Efficient isolation of these genes was accomplished by probing a phage lambda gt11 recombinant DNA expression library with polyvalent antibodies directed against purified yeast RNA polymerase II. The identity of genes that specify the largest RNA polymerase II subunits, the 220,000- and 150,000-dalton polypeptides, was confirmed by competitive radioimmune assay. Both of these genes exist in single copy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2120479947,Rat cells transformed by the highly oncogenic adenovirus 12 lack at least two cellular proteins which are present in cells transformed by the non-oncogenic adenovirus 5 and in untransformed cells. One protein has been identified as the heavy chain of the rat class I major histocompatibility complex. This finding may explain the difference in oncogenicity between adenoviral species.
https://openalex.org/W1997562369,A fragment of plasmid NAH7 from Pseudomonas putida PpG7 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. Growth of the recombinant Escherichia coli in nutrient medium results in the formation of indigo. The production of this dye is increased in the presence of tryptophan or indole. Several bacteria that oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons to cis-dihydrodiols also oxidize indole to indigo. The results suggest that indigo formation is due to the combined activities of tryptophanase and naphthalene dioxygenase.
https://openalex.org/W1982690685,"We have used pedigree analysis to investigate the mitotic segregation of circular and linear DNA plasmids in Saccharomyces cerevisae. Circular ARS plasmids, which bear putative chromosomal replication origins, have a high segregation frequency and a strong blas to segregate to the mother cell at mitosis. The segregation blas explains how the fraction of plasmid-bearing cells can be small despite the high average copy number of circular ARS plasmids. Linear ARS plasmids do not show strong segregation bias, nor does the 2μ ori-containing plasmid YEp13, when it is present in strains containing intact 2μ circles. In the absence of endogenous 2μ, circles, YEp13 behaves like an ARS plasmid, showing a strong maternal segregation bias. The presence of a centromere on circular ARS plasmids eliminates segregation bias. We discuss a model for plasmid segregation, which explains these findings and the possible biological significance of mother-daughter segregation bias."

https://openalex.org/W1482278291,"Using nondegradative isolation procedures, we purified and characterized a glycoprotein from fetal calf bone that is rich in sialic acid. This bone sialoprotein (BSP) has an apparent Mr = 70,000-80,000 and stains with Alcian blue and Stains All on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels but does not stain with Coomassie blue without prior treatment with neuraminidase. This glycoprotein contains 50% protein, 12% sialic acid, 7% glucosamine, and 6% galactosamine. Fetal calf BSP is rich in glutamate (19%), aspartate (15.4%), and glycine (11.8%) but, in contrast to osteonectin and the bone proteoglycan, has relatively low amounts of leucine (4.3%). Antisera raised against fetal calf BSP localized the glycoprotein by indirect immunofluorescence to developing bone trabeculae with an overall tissue distribution identical with that of osteonectin. On competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis, BSP was 11.5% (+/-2.4%, S.E.) of mineral-bound (guanidine-EDTA-soluble) calf bone protein. Immunoreplicas (Western blots) of calf bone extracts suggest that more than 95% of the antigenicity resided in the Mr = 70,000-80,000 region with the remaining cross-reactivity in Alcian blue positive, Mr = approximately 20,000 and approximately 30,000 bands. Brief treatment of the Mr = 70,000-80,000 species with trypsin produced lower molecular weight, Alcian blue-staining products of similar size. No BSP was detected in guanidine extracts of various soft or unmineralized connective tissues, but dentin contained small amounts (0.4%) of the protein. Rat and fetal human bone were also observed to contain a sialoprotein with similar properties and a certain degree of cross-reactivity with the bovine BSP."
https://openalex.org/W1594136944,"The ligand reactions of three binding proteins involved in bacterial transport and chemotaxis have been examined by stopped flow, rapid mixing techniques. The processes measured were: L-arabinose, D-galactose, and D-fucose binding to the Escherichia coli L-arabinose-binding protein; L-histidine binding to the Salmonella typhimurium L-histidine-binding protein; and D-maltose, maltotriose, cyclic maltohexaose, and cyclic maltoheptaose binding to the E. coli D-maltose-binding protein. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence were monitored, and the resultant time courses were analyzed quantitatively in terms of a simple one-step binding process. The fitted association rate constants for sugar binding are all about 1-3 X 10(7) M-1 s-1; variation in the affinity constants is expressed primarily by changes in the dissociation rate constants, 1-100 s-1. The sugar-binding proteins react at equal rates with the alpha and beta anomeric forms of their substrates. The ligand dissociation rates measured in vitro are consistent with the corresponding Vmax values observed for in vivo active transport. The association rate constant for the L-histidine-binding protein is 5-10 times greater than the corresponding rate constants for the sugar-binding proteins. A similar, large bimolecular rate, approximately 1 X 10(8) M-1 s-1, has been observed for the E. coli L-glutamine-binding protein (Weiner, J. H., and Heppel, L. A. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6933-6941) and appears to reflect favorable electrostatic interactions between the charged amino acid and the surface of the protein molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2035418514,"Three mutations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the cloned Escherichia coli gene. The mutations--at residue 27, aspartic acid replaced with asparagine; at residue 39, proline replaced with cysteine; and at residue 95, glycine replaced with alanine--were designed to answer questions about the relations between molecular structure and function that were raised by the x-ray crystal structures. Properties of the mutant proteins show that Asp-27 is important for catalysis and that perturbation of the local structure at a conserved cis peptide bond following Gly-95 abolishes activity. Substitution of cysteine for proline at residue 39 results in the appearance of new forms of the enzyme that correspond to various oxidation states of the cysteine. One of these forms probably represents a species cross-linked by an intrachain disulfide bridge between the cysteine at position 85 and the new cysteine at position 39."

https://openalex.org/W1564898844,"The thermodynamics of the binding of L-arabinose and of D-galactose to the L-arabinose-binding protein of Escherichia coli have been studied by isothermal and scanning calorimetry. The binding reaction with arabinose is characterized by an enthalpy change of -15.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol-1 at 25 degrees C, and a large decrease in apparent heat capacity, amounting to -0.44 +/- 0.05 kcal K-1 mol-1, which is constant over the temperature range 8 to 30 degrees C. Very similar results were obtained with D-galactose. These calorimetric results have been combined with binding constants determined by equilibrium dialysis (Clark, A. F., Gerken, T. A., and Hogg, R. W. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 2227-2233) to obtain free energy and entropy changes over the range 5 to 30 degrees C, and by extrapolation to 60 degrees C. The protein undergoes reversible unfolding on being heated with an increase in enthalpy at 53.5 degrees C of 151.8 +/- 1.1 kcal mol-1 (169.2 +/- 1.2 kcal mol-1 at 59.0 degrees C) and in apparent heat capacity of 3.16 +/- 0.07 kcal K-1 mol-1. In the presence of arabinose, the unfolding enthalpy is increased to 200.7 +/- 1.8 kcal mol-1 at 59.0 degrees C, the increase being due to the enthalpy of dissociation of the ligand which amounts to 31 kcal mol-1 at the unfolding temperature. The unfolding temperature is increased by the presence of excess arabinose or galactose, an effect which is due solely to displacement by the added ligand of the unfolding-dissociation equilibrium. The thermodynamic data are discussed in connection with the detailed structural information available for this system from x-ray crystallography (Newcomer, M. E., Gilliland, G. L. and Quiocho, F. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13213-13217, and references cited therein)."
https://openalex.org/W1531108159,"Abstract Chronic treatment of 3T3-C2 fibroblasts with insulin causes the slow (t1/2 = 3-4 h) down-regulation of cellular insulin receptor to a new steady state level by accelerating receptor decay (Knutson, V.P., Ronnett, G.V., and Lane, M.D. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 2822-2826). In the present investigation, the synthesis and turnover of the receptor during the transition to the state was examined by the heavy isotope density-shift method. It was observed that within two h after insulin addition, receptor decay increased abruptly for several hours then gradually declined until the down-regulated rate was achieved. The abrupt increase in receptor decay induced by insulin was preceded by a more rapid (t1/2 less than or equal to 10 min) translocation of cell surface receptor to an trypsin-resistant compartment. Thus, upon exposure to ligand, insulin receptor rapidly redistributes from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment, without an initial net loss of cellular receptors. The translocation process was rapidly reversed (t1/2 less than or equal to 20 min) upon removal of insulin. With prolonged exposure to insulin, the initial rapid translocation of receptor was followed by a slower inactivation of receptor apparently in the intracellular compartment. Cycloheximide, which lengthens receptor half-life by blocking a step in receptor inactivation, had no effect on receptor internalization. Internalization of insulin receptor and its bound ligand were, however, rapidly (less than 10 min) blocked by phenylarsine oxide. These results support the following sequence of events. Upon exposure to ligand, insulin receptors are translocated from the cell surface to an intracellular site which results in accelerated receptor decay and ultimately to a lower steady state cellular receptor level."
https://openalex.org/W2022006319,Three new reagents that react against human T cells were synthesized by covalently linking the toxin ricin to monoclonal antibodies recognizing differentiation antigens on the surface of T lymphocytes. Each of these immunotoxins selectively inhibited T-cell proliferation when the cells were incubated in the presence of lactose. Multipotent human stem cells were inhibited only at much higher concentrations. Mixtures of all three immunotoxins were more effective than any one alone. These reagents have the potential for preventing graft-versus-host disease in man.
https://openalex.org/W2081760095,"The mitochondrial genome of maize contains a DNA sequence homologous to the chloroplast gene coding for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (LS gene). The presence in mitochondrial DNA of both coding and flanking sequences of this gene has been demonstrated first, by cross hybridization between the purified organelle DNAs and between cloned mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA sequences and second, by in vitro transcription-translation of cloned mitochondrial DNA in an E. coli cell free system where a 21,000 dalton polypeptide is synthesized that can be precipitated with antibodies to wheat ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. In contrast to the 12 kb chloroplast homologous sequence found in the mitochondrial genome (Stern and Lonsdale, 1982), the sequence homologous to the LS gene is unaltered in mitochondrial DNA isolated from the male sterile cytoplasms of maize. The LS gene homologous sequence in the mitochondrial genome is located some 65 kb from the 18S mitochondrial rRNA gene and approximately 20 kb from the mitochondrial DNA sequence having homology to the chloroplast 16S rRNA gene."
https://openalex.org/W1512294064,"We have covalently attached a monoclonal antibody (11-4.1) against the murine major histocompatibility antigen, H-2Kk, on the surface of liposomes. The interaction of these antibody-coated liposomes (immunoliposomes) with target cells, RDM-4 lymphoma (H-2Kk), was investigated. About 90% of the immunoliposomes taken up by target cells at 4 degrees C could be removed by a mild protease treatment of the cells, whereas only 30% of the uptake at 37 degrees C was labile to the same treatment. Furthermore, the uptake of immunoliposomes at 37 degrees C was inhibitable by cytochalasin B or by a combination of 2-deoxyglucose and NaN3. These results suggest that immunoliposome binding to the target cell surface is the primary uptake event at 4 degrees C and that the surface-bound liposomes are rapidly internalized by the cells at 37 degrees C, probably via an endocytic pathway. Studies with fluorescence microscopy of target cells treated with immunoliposomes containing carboxyfluorescein also supported this conclusion. If endocytosis is the mechanism by which immunoliposomes gain entry into target cells, the efficacy of a cytotoxic drug encapsulated would depend on the resistance of the drug to lysosomal inactivation and its ability to escape from the lysosomal system. Consistent with this notion, we observed that methotrexate encapsulated in liposomes bearing 11-4.1 antibody specifically inhibited deoxy[6-3H]uridine incorporation into DNA in target RDM-4 cells but not in P3-X63-Ag8 myeloma cells (H-2Kd) at the same doses. The observed cytotoxic effect of encapsulated methotrexate could be reversed by the treatment of cells with a lysosomotropic amine, chloroquine, which has been shown to increase the intralysosomal pH of mammalian cells. On the other hand, cytosine-beta-D-arabinofuranoside encapsulated in immunoliposomes showed no target-specific killing, probably because the drug is readily inactivated in the lysosomal system. These results are discussed in terms of the drug carrier potential of immunoliposomes."
https://openalex.org/W2038745896,"The L11 ribosomal protein operon in Escherichia coli consists of the structural genes for proteins L11 and L1. Hybrid deletion plasmids were constructed carrying these two genes with decreasing amounts of the leader mRNA under lac transcriptional control. Measurements of mRNA and protein synthesis directed by these plasmids in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that the regulation of this operon is post-transcriptional and identifies a region of the mRNA, preceding the proximal L11 gene, important for successful feedback inhibition of L11 and L1 synthesis by L1. Additionally, deletions extending to the ribosome binding site of the L11 gene fail to synthesize both L11 and the downstream L1 protein although synthesis of the corresponding mRNA remains unchanged. These results directly demonstrate the presence of translational coupling in this bicistronic operon."
https://openalex.org/W1555196547,"A highly purified monophosphoryl lipid A, TLC-3 fraction obtained from the lipopolysaccharides of the heptoseless mutant Salmonella typhimurium G30/C21 was converted to the dimethyl pentatrimethylsilyl derivative and analyzed by proton NMR spectroscopy at 400 MHz. Substantial downfield shifts of the resonances for protons at the 3- and 3'-carbons of the glucosamine disaccharide to 5.06 and 5.15 ppm, respectively, occurred from the normal range of 3.5-4.1 ppm, indicating that these two positions on the sugar rings were acylated. Significant downfield shift of the resonances for protons at the 4- and 6'-carbons did not occur, indicating the absence of acyl groups at these two positions. Since positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry previously established the presence of hydroxymyristoyl and myristoxymyristoyl esters at the reducing end and distal subunits, respectively, these acyl groups must be attached to the oxygen of the corresponding 3- and 3'-carbons of lipid A. With these results, we can now describe the complete structure of the monophosphoryl lipid A, TLC-3 from S. typhimurium."

In previous experiments, we found that LexA protein may also be a repressor of the colicin E1 gene. We now present evidence that the purified LexA protein strongly repressed the in vitro transcription of the colicin E1 gene. As determined in DNase I protection experiments, LexA protein bound with a high affinity to the approximately 40-base pair long sequence between the Pribnow box and the start codon of the colicin E1 gene. The sequence of the binding site was composed of two overlapped SOS boxes to which the LexA protein bound in a cooperative manner."
https://openalex.org/W1603688682,"Lipopolysaccharides extracted from the heptoseless mutant of Salmonella typhimurium G30/C21 were hydrolyzed with either 0.1 N HCl at 100 degrees C or treated twice with 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, at 100 degrees C for 45 min and finally purified by preparative thin layer chromatography to yield a structural series of mono- and diphosphoryl lipid A, respectively. Positive ion fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of the diphosphoryl lipid A TLC-3 (a highly acylated major band) showed a major component with (M + H)+ ion of mass 1798, which fragmented to yield a (M - H2PO4)+ ion of mass 1700. Cleavage at the glycosidic bond gave rise to an oxonium ion fragment of mass 1087. In conjunction with other studies, this establishes the molecular formula and Mr of the major component to be C94H178N2O25P2 and 1797.2 (as the free acid), respectively. Similar analysis of monophosphoryl lipid A TLC-3 produced an (M + H)+ peak at m/z 1718, (M + Na)+ adduct peak at m/z 1740, and a fragment of mass 1087. The spectrum of monophosphoryl lipid A TLC-5 was devoid of the m/z 1087 peak and instead contained the phosphorylated oxonium ion of mass 876. This fragment ion is assigned as the distal subunit, and these results show that the distal subunit of the major lipid A TLC-3 contains two hydroxymyristoyl, one myristoyl, and one lauroyl residues, whereas the reducing end subunit contains two hydroxymyristoyl groups. A revised structure of the lipid A backbone in lipopolysaccharides of S. typhimurium is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1494522948,"MAT alpha cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce a polypeptide mating pheromone, alpha factor. MATa cells respond to the pheromone by undergoing several inducible responses: the arrest of cell division, the production of a cell surface agglutinin, and the formation of one or more projections on the cell surface commonly termed the shmoo morphology. Dose-response curves were determined for each of these inducible responses as a function of alpha factor concentration. It is shown that under conditions commonly employed in previous studies, the dose-response for cell division arrest is determined by the rate at which cells inactivate the alpha factor. In order to achieve conditions where inactivation would not be the dominant parameter, the cell division response to alpha factor was monitored at low cell densities. Under conditions of essentially no alpha factor destruction, the dose of alpha factor at which cells exhibit a half-maximal response for cell division arrest (2.5 X 10(-10) M) is nearly the same as that at which cells exhibit a half-maximal response for agglutination induction (1.0 X 10(-10) M). On the contrary, the half-maximal response for projection formation was obtained at doses of alpha factor 2 orders of magnitude higher (1.4 X 10(-8) M). These results are consistent with the same high affinity alpha factor receptor mediating both cell division arrest and agglutination induction. A different system of lower affinity must mediate projection formation. Alternatively, if the same system and receptor are used, then a much higher occupancy is required for the induction of projections compared to division arrest and agglutination induction."

https://openalex.org/W1534932106,"The structure and metal-binding properties of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from heptoseless mutants of Escherichia coli were studied by 13C and 31P NMR techniques. Carbon-13 NMR spectra were used to determine the linkages and configurations of the saccharide backbone and the types and locations of fatty acyl groups in E. coli LPS. Resonance assignments for native LPS were made by chemical shift correlation with model compounds, deacylated LPS, lipid A, deacylated lipid A, and fatty acids released from LPS by mild alkaline hydrolysis. The 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) disaccharide was tentatively assigned the structure KDO alpha 2 leads to 5KDO alpha 2 leads to. The presence of amide- and ester-linked 3-hydroxy and 3-acyloxy fatty acids in native LPS was confirmed directly from the 13C spectrum and evidence is presented for a labile acyl ester at C-3' (GlcNII) of the lipid A moiety. A significant finding was that the KDO disaccharide is linked to the C-6' position of the lipid A moiety, rather than C-3', as previously reported. The effects of binding Ca2+, Cd2+, Yb3+, Gd3+, and La3+ on the 31P NMR spectrum of LPS indicated that the glycosidic diphosphate moiety participates in a high affinity metal-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1487174454,"Insulin receptors were extracted from human erythrocytes contained in 100 ml of blood with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 with almost 100% yield. The solubilized receptor had binding characteristics similar to those of the intact cell. Using 125I-monoiodoinsulin as tracer and a computer-assisted statistical curve-fitting program, a cooperative model gave values of 1.7 X 10(9) M-1 for the Ke (affinity of the empty receptor) and of 1.6 X 10(8) M-1 for Kf (affinity of the filled receptor). Bovine desalanine-desasparagine insulin inhibited tracer binding with 3-6% the potency of porcine insulin. Serum (B-8) containing anti-insulin receptor antibodies inhibited binding by 70% at a dilution of 1:100. Receptor autophosphorylation reaction was studied by incubation of the Triton extract with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mn2+ in the presence or absence of insulin, and the receptor was identified by immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antibodies and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Porcine insulin stimulated 4- to 5-fold the incorporation of 32P in a protein of Mr = 95,000, corresponding to the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed phosphorylation of the tyrosyl residues exclusively. The dose-response curve for insulin stimulation was sigmoidal; some effect of insulin was observed at 1 ng/ml but maximal effect was observed at 10 micrograms/ml. Bovine desalanine-desasparagine insulin, a noncooperative analogue of insulin, was able to fully stimulate the phosphate incorporation, but the dose-response curve was shifted to the right and steeper, consistent with the intrinsic affinity of this analogue for the insulin receptor. When insulin binding was performed under the same conditions as the phosphorylation, half-maximal stimulation of phosphate incorporation occurred with 6-29% of the fractional occupancy of the receptor. These data suggest that the insulin receptor of the human erythrocyte, as in other cells, is a tyrosine-specific protein kinase. Coupling between the receptor occupancy and kinase activation is complex. Furthermore, sufficient quantities of receptor can be easily obtained from a single individual to study the binding and kinase properties of the receptor opening the opportunity to a wide field of applications in human pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1546663611,"The symptoms which immediately follow envenomation by many crotalid snakes include hypotension, hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, and shock. We have isolated and characterized two proteases (EI and EII) from the venom of Crotalus atrox which may be involved in the onset of these symptoms. EI and EII have molecular weights of 27,500 and 29,200 and isoelectric points of 4.7 and 4.3, respectively. Specific esterolytic activities of EI and EII on N alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester are 51.5 mumol min-1mg-1 and 48.1 mumol min-1 mg-1, respectively. Both enzymes are rather specific in their substrate requirements in that neither was demonstrated to have any proteolytic activity against either of the oxidized chains of insulin, or glucagon. Neither enzyme was shown to have plasmin or fibrinolytic activity. Both enzymes are able to cleave a kininogen analog to release bradykinin. This proteolytic activity is inhibited by aprotinin and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride but not by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. The enzymes are active upon the kallikrein substrates S2666 and S2302. The Km values of the enzymes with these substrates are similar to those reported for kallikrein. Structural similarity between the two enzymes was demonstrated by ultraviolet and circular dichroic spectroscopy, and amino acid analysis. Tryptic peptide mapping of the two native enzymes also suggested a large degree of structural similarity. Furthermore, sequence studies on the NH2-terminal regions of the enzymes indicate that they share a significant degree of sequence homology with porcine kallikrein and crotalase, a kallikrein-like enzyme from Crotalus adamanteus. The main physical difference between the two kallikreins reported here appears to be due to the carbohydrate moieties on the enzymes. At present the in vivo role of venom kallikreins in envenomation pathology is uncertain; however, it is possible that they play an important part in giving rise to the initial symptoms of hypotension and shock."

https://openalex.org/W170239507,"In primary cultured hepatocytes of adult rats epidermal growth factor (EGF) caused 2- to 3-fold induction of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.49, G6P dehydrogenase) within 2 days. The effect of EGF was additive with a similar effect of insulin. The half-maximum dose of EGF for the induction was 1 ng/ml. Induction of this enzyme by these hormones was shown by immunotitration to be due to increase of the amount of enzyme. Furthermore, this increase in the amount of enzyme was found to result from increase of syntheses of mRNA and enzyme protein. In contrast, the induction of malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40, L-malate:NADP+) oxidoreductase) by insulin plus triiodothyronine was strongly suppressed by the concomitant addition of EGF. Induction of G6P dehydrogenase by EGF, like that by insulin, was not suppressed by either glucagon or dibutyryl cAMP, whereas that of malic enzyme was suppressed additively by EGF and dibutyryl cAMP. EGF also suppressed stimulation of lipogenesis by insulin, measured as incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into triglycerides and phospholipids. Another difference between the inductions of G6P dehydrogenase and malic enzyme was in their dependence on cell density; G6P dehydrogenase induction by insulin and EGF was high at low cell density (3 X 10(4) cells/cm2) and less at higher cell density (13 X 10(4) cells/cm2), whereas induction of malic enzyme was high at higher cell density and less at lower cell density. These results are consistent with the dual role of G6P dehydrogenase in lipogenesis in resting cells and in synthesis of nucleic acid in growing cells. Malic enzyme plays a role only for lipogenesis in mature hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1657389305,"The oxidation-reduction midpoint potentials, Em, of the FAD and active site disulfide couples of Escherichia coli thioredoxin reductase have been determined from pH 5.5 to 8.5. The FAD and disulfide couples have similar Em values and thus a linked equilibrium of four microscopic enzyme oxidation-reduction states exists. The binding of phenylmercuric acetate to one enzyme form could be monitored which allowed solving the four microscopic Em values. The Em values at pH 7.0 and 12 degrees C of the four couples of thioredoxin reductase are: (S)2-enzyme-FAD/FADH2 = -0.243 V, (SH)2-enzyme-FAD/FADH2 = -0.260 V, (FAD)-enzyme-(S)2/(SH)2 = -0.254 V, and (FADH2)-enzyme-(S)2/(SH)2 = -0.271 V. Thus, at pH 7.0, the FAD and disulfide moieties have a 0.017-V negative interaction and Em values which are different by 0.011 V. The delta Em/delta pH of the FAD couples E2m and E3m are about 0.060 V/pH throughout the pH range studied, showing an approximately 2-proton stoichiometry of reduction of the enzyme FAD. The delta Em/delta pH of the disulfide couples E1m and E4m are about 0.052 V/pH from pH 5.5 to 8.5, showing an apparently nonintegral proton stoichiometry of reduction of 1.8 in this pH range. This proton stoichiometry suggests the presence of a base with an ionization behavior that is linked to the oxidation-reduction state of the disulfide. A novel method is presented for determining the pK values on oxidized and reduced enzyme which agrees with the less accurate classical method. The proton stoichiometry results are consistent with the presence of a thiol-base ion pair in which the pK of the base is elevated from 7.6 in disulfide containing enzyme to greater than 8.5 upon forming an ion pair with a thiol anion of pK 7.0 generated upon reduction of the disulfide. The fluorescence of the FAD in thioredoxin reductase decreases as the pH is lowered with a pK of 7.0, direct evidence for a base near the FAD probably distinct from the base interacting with the dithiol."
https://openalex.org/W1484866107,"Escherichia coli primase (dnaG protein), an essential DNA replication enzyme, synthesizes a primer at the unique origin sequence of the single-stranded circular phage G4 DNA (Rowen, L., and Kornberg, A. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 758-764). Kinetic analyses suggest that for each DNA molecule at least two primase molecules participate in the reaction. Binding of 3H-labeled primase is specific for the G4 complementary strand origin region and is saturated at approximately 2 primase molecules/DNA circle. Such complexes, isolated by gel filtration, function in the absence of additional primase to convert the phage DNA to the duplex form. Although the primase-DNA complex is stable to refiltration, the DNA-bound enzyme can dissociate and reattach to function at the origin sequence of another G4 DNA circle. An antibody to primase blocks the action of primase in the free form or within a DNA complex and even interferes with extension of the primer by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. These kinetic and binding studies of G4 priming, the least complicated of the primase systems, suggest that 2 primase molecules form a complex at the origin region and remain bound even after transcribing a sequence to prime DNA replication."

The brain form, alpha gamma-spectrin (fodrin), is expressed constitutively in all neuronal cell bodies and processes during all stages of cerebellar morphogenesis. On the other hand, the erythrocyte form, alpha beta'beta-spectrin, accumulates exclusively at the plasma membrane of the cell bodies of Purkinje and granule cells and of neurons in cerebellar nuclei, but only after these cells have become postmitotic and have completed their migration to their final positions in the cerebellum. The appearance of alpha beta'beta-spectrin coincides temporally with the establishment of axosomatic contacts on these three neuronal cell types, which suggests that alpha beta'beta-spectrin accumulates in response to the formation of functional synaptic connections during cerebellar ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1519516670,"Abstract A lithium ion-selective electrode was constructed using N,N'-diheptyl-N,N'-5,5-tetramethyl-3,7-dioxanonandiamid as a Li+ ionophore. Lithium ion-sugar cotransport via the melibiose transport system was measured with this electrode. Influx of methyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside, methyl-alpha-D-galactoside, methyl-beta-D-galactoside, and D-galactose elicited uptake of Li+. This Li+ uptake was not observed when the melibiose carrier was not present in the cells or the carrier was inactivated. Melibiose caused a small amount of Li+ uptake, indicating that Li+-melibiose cotransport proceeds inefficiently. Raffinose, another substrate, did not cause detectable Li+ transport. In mutant cells which showed altered cation coupling (Niiya, S., Yamasaki, K., Wilson, T. H., and Tsuchiya, T. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8902-8906), Li+-melibiose cotransport was clearly demonstrated. Alteration in substrate specificity was also shown in the mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1584053432,"Chick aortas were extracted sequentially with phosphate-buffered saline, 6 M guanidine HCl, and 6 M guanidine HCl containing dithioerythritol. The proteins present in the guanidine HCl + dithioerythritol extract were separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and the fractions recovered were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five major glycoprotein components with apparent Mr = 205,000, 195,000, 150,000, 135,000, and 115,000 (gp 115) were identified. gp 115 was further studied since it was the only noncollagenous protein based on amino acid analysis. The protein was purified to homogeneity by preparative electrophoresis. Its amino acid composition was characterized by a high content of glutamic acid and arginine and a relatively high content of leucine, glycine, and alanine. The concentration of gp 115 in the guanidine HCl + dithioerythritol extract was about 15-fold that in the guanidine and saline extracts. Overall, about 80% of the protein was solubilized with guanidine HCl + dithioerythritol, suggesting that most of it formed large aggregates stabilized by disulfide bonds in vivo. Immunofluorescence studies with specific antibodies showed that gp 115 formed an extracellular fibrillar network in the aorta wall. One-dimensional finger printing with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and immunological studies indicated that the protein was unrelated to fibronectin and laminin. The data led us to conclude that gp 115 is a novel extracellular component of chick aorta."
https://openalex.org/W1679770227,"The incubation of the 50 S ribosomal subunits of Escherichia coli with 1.5 M LiCl yields 1.5c core particles depleted in 14 proteins and inactive in peptide chain termination. In codon-dependent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis the release factor 1 (RF-1)-induced reaction essentially depends on both L11 and L16 whereas the release factor 2 (RF-2)-induced reaction is depressed by L11 and stimulated by L16. Omission of L11 results in a several-fold increase in the specific activity of the RF-2. Functional complexes are formed with RF-2 at an apparent Km (dissociation constant) for the termination codon 5-fold lower than with reconstituted ribosomes containing L11; the Vmax for the hydrolysis is unchanged. L11 suppresses this effect when added to the core at close to molar equivalence. In contrast, RF-1 has a very low activity if ribosomes lack L11 and this can be restored by titration of L11 back to the core. This is the first example of a differential or an opposite effect of a ribosomal component on the activities of the two release factors, and the studies suggest that L11 has a critical role in the binding domain for the two factors."
https://openalex.org/W1524089950,"Recirculating organ perfusion in vitro was conducted with hearts from control rats, animals given a single dose of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) 48 h earlier, and streptozotocin-treated rats administered insulin (5 units), 2 h prior to organ perfusion. During 45-min perfusions, the lipolysis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride was significantly less in hearts from diabetics than in controls (41.9 +/- 7.3% of control). This was associated with significant reductions in heparin-releasable (functional) lipoprotein lipase and tissue lipoprotein lipase of perfused hearts. The decreases in VLDL triglyceride metabolism and the levels of myocardial lipoprotein lipase were completely reversed by treatment of diabetic rats with insulin 2 h prior to study. Similar improvement of VLDL triglyceride metabolism and increases in myocardial lipoprotein lipase activity were observed in hearts from diabetic rats by direct addition of 100 milliunits/ml of insulin to the recirculating perfusion media. Under these conditions, the increase in both fractions of lipoprotein lipase in response to insulin was completely inhibited, and utilization of VLDL triglyceride was partially inhibited by pre-perfusion with cycloheximide for 10 min. The data derived from either VLDL triglyceride lipolysis in organ perfusion or direct measurement of myocardial lipoprotein lipase demonstrate a direct effect of insulin on myocardial lipoprotein lipase activity, and suggest that the response to insulin may be due in part to effects on protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1540532087,"The six accessory proteins of the bacteriophage T4 specified by replication genes 32, 41, 44, 45, 61, and 62 were studied for their ability to enhance the accuracy with which phage T4 DNA polymerase (product of gene 43) replicates synthetic homopolymer duplexes in vitro. Two of these proteins, gene 32-protein (helix-destabilizing protein) and gene 45-protein, inhibited the selection of incorrect, but not correct, precursors, at the growing strand end. Gene 32-protein is shown to enhance replication fidelity by interacting with the DNA, whereas gene 45-protein exerts its fidelity-enhancing effect by interacting with the DNA polymerase. This is the first example to our knowledge of a DNA polymerase's accuracy being altered through interaction with another protein. Possible mechanisms by which gene 32- and gene 45-protein act to enhance replication fidelity are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2400223793,"In the present study, we investigated the ability of a monoclonal antibody to the insulin receptor to regulate the expression of the insulin receptor of IM-9 lymphocytes. Previously, this antibody was shown to be a competitive antagonist of insulin action on severe metabolic functions. In the present study, we report that preincubation of IM-9 cells with the monoclonal antibody caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the subsequent ability of these cells to bind 125I-insulin, a phenomenon termed down regulation. The antibody was approximately 100 times more potent than insulin at down regulating the receptor. In contrast, the antibody was 5 times less potent than insulin in competing for binding to insulin receptors and dissociated 4 times more rapidly than insulin from IM-9 cells. Three lines of evidence suggested that the mechanism of down regulation by the antibody was the same as the one used by insulin. First, both agents caused a rapid initial decrease in insulin binding to cells followed by a slower, gradual decrease in binding. Second, the down regulation caused by both was reversible, and this reversibility required new protein synthesis. Third, the antibody, like insulin, accelerated receptor degradation. Since the antibody does not mimic the other effects of insulin on metabolic processes, these results suggest that the mechanism of insulin receptor down regulation is different from the mechanism of insulin action on other cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1516245997,"A thioredoxin has been highly purified from rabbit bone marrow. This thioredoxin is heat-stable, has a molecular weight of approximately 13,000, and contains 4 half-cystines. It is a substrate for the NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase of rabbit bone marrow, catalyzes the reduction of insulin disulfides by dithiothreitol, and is a hydrogen donor for methionine sulfoxide reductase of yeast. Although active as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase of Lactobacillus leichmannii, this activity could not be demonstrated when the bone marrow thioredoxin was tested with the ribonucleotide reductases of rabbit bone marrow and Corynebacterium nephridii. A regulatory role for the bone marrow thioredoxin was investigated by determining its ability to activate two of the enzymes of spinach chloroplasts known to require thioredoxin for their activation. The bone marrow thioredoxin effectively activates spinach NADP-malate dehydrogenase but not spinach fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. These observations suggest that instead of serving as a hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reduction in bone marrow, this thioredoxin may be involved in the regulation of the activity of bone marrow enzyme(s)."

https://openalex.org/W1580330971,"Incubation of confluent cultures of mouse fibroblasts with cycloheximide caused a time-dependent increase in the binding of 125I-insulin. The increase was concentration-dependent between 0.05 and 3.5 microM cycloheximide and showed a high correlation (r = 0.97) between the increase in 125I-insulin binding and the inhibition of protein synthesis. In the presence of 3.5 microM cycloheximide, insulin binding increased to 236% of control and incorporation of [3H]valine into proteins fell to 10-20% of control. Scatchard analysis of the binding data indicated that cycloheximide-treated cultures had a total of 6.6 X 10(4) binding sites/cell compared to 3.9 X 10(4) sites/cell in untreated cultures. No significant changes in affinity were observed. Other protein synthesis inhibitors also caused an increase in 125I-insulin binding. With 25 mM ethionine and 2 mM sodium fluoride, binding was 155 and 245% of control and incorporation of [3H]leucine into proteins was decreased to 41 and 47% of control, respectively. These results suggest that the accumulation of insulin receptors at the cell surface following treatment with cycloheximide results from inhibition of synthesis of proteins involved in insulin receptor turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1553041447,"Thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate (TTPP) has been reported to be an effective transition state analogue for the thiamin pyrophosphate-dependent partial reaction of pyruvate dehydrogenase (Gutowski, J. A., and Lienhard, G. E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 2863-2866). The kinetics of the interaction of TTPP with transketolase are reported here. TTPP is a competitive inhibitor, with respect to thiamin pyrophosphate, of bakers' yeast transketolase but it is neither a tight binding inhibitor nor a slow binding inhibitor. TTPP decreases the kinetically observed negative cooperativity seen for thiamin pyrophosphate and also decreases the rate constant for the hysteretic activation of the enzyme by thiamin pyrophosphate. We conclude that thiamin thiazolone pyrophosphate is not an effective transition state analogue for the reaction catalyzed by bakers' yeast transketolase. This difference between transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase may be related to differences in the polarity of the active sites of the enzymes. It is conceivable that the active sites of the pyruvate decarboxylase subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase is hydrophobic, by analogy with the known hydrophobicity of the active site of brewers' yeast pyruvate decarboxylase. This hydrophobicity would stabilize a transition state with no charge on the thiazole portion of the coenzyme, similar to the thiazole portion of TTPP. In contrast, the active site of bakers' yeast transketolase, which is known to contain charged amino acid side chains, should be less favorable for such an uncharged transition state. A charge-separated canonical form related to TTPP could be preferentially stabilized in the active site of transketolase."
https://openalex.org/W1522148793,"The incubation of the 50 S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli with 1.5 M LiCl yields 1.5c core particles inactive in the peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis activity of in vitro termination. The omission of L16 alone from reconstitutions of the proteins into the core results in inactive ribosomes. The single omission of a number of other proteins, in particular L7/L12, L10, L25, L27, and L15, gives ribosomes with intermediate activity. L16 alone is unable to restore significant activity to 1.5c cores, but together L16 and the above stimulating proteins produce particles as active as those reconstituted with the full complement of proteins. The ribosomal proteins important for the expression of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis and peptidyl transferase activities are very similar. However, ribosomes lacking both L11 and L16, but not L16 alone, surprisingly can catalyze codon- and release factor 2-dependent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis. The addition of L16 dramatically increases the activity. L16 is, therefore, important but not essential for the expression of the release factor 2-dependent peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W85502753,"Abstract We have reproducibly grown crystals of L-tryptophan . trp aporepressor and indole-3-propionate . trp aporepressor complexes from Escherichia coli which are suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis. The active repressor, L-tryptophan . aporepressor, crystallizes in both trigonal (P3(1)21 or P3(2)21) and tetragonal (P4(1)22 or P4(3)22) forms which diffract to at least 2.0 and 2.5 A, respectively. The trigonal form has one-half of the functional dimer/asymmetric unit; therefore, the trp repressor molecule has an axis of 2-fold rotational symmetry corresponding to the lattice dyad. The inactive complex, indole-3-propionate . aporepressor, or pseudorepressor, forms tetragonal crystals that also diffract to at least 2.5 A and are isomorphous to those of the active repressor. Slight differences between their diffraction patterns indicate modest structural differences between active and inactive complexes that are presumably mediated by the alpha-amino group of L-tryptophan and account for operator-specific binding."
https://openalex.org/W1518767165,"The L-arabinose-binding protein of Escherichia coli is a periplasmic component of the L-arabinose transport system. Its three-dimensional structure has been determined by x-ray diffraction and shown to have two globular domains and a connecting hinge. These structural features enclose a cleft in which the L-arabinose-binding site is located. The flexibility of the protein hinge that allows hinge-bending motion is investigated here by theoretical analysis of the changes in conformational energy and molecular structure that accompany the opening and closing of the cleft. The hinge of the molecule is found to be quite permissive in that only moderate increases in the internal energy occur upon opening the cleft. Solvation changes of charged groups on the cleft-facing surfaces of the lobes are estimated to make important contributions to the overall energetics of the system. The results indicate that an open conformation for the unliganded protein is stabilized by the exposure and solvation of charged groups in the cleft, and that the cleft is induced to close upon ligand binding. This picture is consistent with experimental data on the structure and the binding kinetics of L-arabinose-binding protein, and provides a physical framework for interpreting such data."
https://openalex.org/W1564184114,"As a subunit of bacteriophage Q beta replicase, ribosomal protein S1 is required for tight binding of the enzyme to Q beta RNA and for the initiation of Q beta RNA transcription. To compare these properties of S1 with its functions in protein synthesis, we have reconstituted altered replicase enzymes by adding discrete fragments of S1 to Q beta replicase lacking S1 (R(-S1]. We show that the NH2-terminal region of S1 is required for S1 subunit interactions in replicase since a trypsin-resistant fragment (denoted S1-F1) lacking the NH2-terminal 31% of S1 is functionally inactive and does not seem to bind to R(-S1). Previous studies with S1-F1 indicated that this NH2-terminal region is required for S1 to bind to the ribosome. Our results also show that the COOH-terminal region of S1 is dispensable for S1's function in replicase because a mutant of S1 (m1-S1) lacking 21% of the COOH-terminal portion of the chain is as active as wild type S1 in replicase and binds to R(-S1) with comparable affinity. In protein synthesis, the mutant m1-S1 is known to substitute for S1 but is only about 75% as efficient as wild type S1."

Activation of aconitase by Fe(II) addition converts the RR spectrum to one characteristic of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. Analytical data on aconitase, as isolated, confirms the recent finding (Beinert, H., Emptage, M. H., Dreyer, J.-L., Scott, R. A., Hahn, J. E., Hodgson, K. O., and Thomson, A. J. (1983) Proc. Natl.

The RR spectra of 3Fe centers from aconitase, and the hydrogenase, as well as from several bacterial ferredoxins, conform to the pattern expected for a cube-derived [3Fe-4S] cluster. Perceptible differences are observed among the spectra, which can be explained in terms of differences among the terminal ligands, perhaps limited to their conformations. In the case of aconitase and hydrogenase, frequency shifts suggest additional alterations in the terminal Fe-S bond angles and/or slight differences in core geometry."

https://openalex.org/W1584465415,"Growth of a temperature-sensitive general fatty acid synthesis mutant of Escherichia coli K12 at its restrictive temperature in the presence of exogenous palmitate results in lysis of the bacterium. Under these conditions, palmitate is incorporated into membrane phospholipid to a high level. Mutants of bacteria restricting this incorporation (having a palmitate-resistant phenotype) have been isolated and one such mutant, strain L8-2/3, has been further characterized. This mutant has lowered acyl-CoA synthetase (fadD) activity (25-33% of normal) and consequently is defective in fatty acid uptake. This lowered uptake could explain the palmitate-resistant phenotype of strain L8-2/3. However, both in vivo (fatty acid composition and positional distribution data) and in vitro (acyltransferase activity measurements) experiments suggest that this mutant is also altered in its acyltransferase activities. The mutation(s) of strain L8-2/3 appears to allow increased (approximately 2-fold) incorporation of myristate (and possible unsaturated fatty acids) into position 2 of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate but normal palmitate incorporation into the same position. The incorporation of palmitate, myristate, and oleate into position 1 of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate by strain L8-2/3 is also higher than that observed with the parent, strain L8-2. Replacing the partially defective fadD gene of strain L8-2/3 with a wild type allele conferred on this strain the palmitate sensitivity and the acyltransferase activity of the parent strain L8-2. This finding, taken together with other data, suggests that acyl-CoA synthetase interacts with the acyltransferase(s) in some manner to influence the fatty acid specificity of the acyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W175168755,"The effects of aqueous organic cryosolvents on the structural and catalytic properties of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (liver alcohol dehydrogenase) have been investigated. The cosolvents studied were ethanol, methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylformamide. All show potential as cosolvents for cryoenzymological investigations of the catalytic action of liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Limitations due to the formation of abortive complexes, or the cosolvent acting as a substrate were considered. Possible adverse structural effects of the cosolvents were ascertained by utilizing the intrinsic fluorescent properties of the enzyme. Catalytic effects, as inferred from steady state kinetic studies, were determined from both the oxidation of ethanol and the reduction of p-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline, a chromophoric aldehyde analog. It is concluded that each of these solvent systems may be useful for studying certain aspects of the liver alcohol dehydrogenase catalytic mechanism at subzero temperatures. Thus, although the formation of ternary enzyme-cosolvent complexes may restrict the use of cosolvents in some experiments, no apparent adverse effects are observed on the enzyme structure, coenzyme binding, or catalytic reactions. A number of interesting features were observed. For example, fluorescence titration of the native enzyme near 0 degrees C in either aqueous solution or 50% dimethyl sulfoxide revealed pK values in the vicinity of 10.5 and 12.5, in contrast to the previously reported single pK of 9.2 observed in aqueous solution at 25 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1556668278,"Growth of a beta-oxidation-negative (fadE) strain of Escherichia coli in liquid culture with exogenous palmitate leads to the accumulation of 16:0/16:0 molecular species of phospholipid resulting in a temporary decrease in growth rate and lysis of a variable fraction of the cell population. Under the same growth conditions, this behavior is not seen in the closely related fadE+ parent strain which accumulates more modest levels of 16:0/16:0 together with 16:0/14:0. Based on differential scanning calorimetric measurements, 75.8 and 17.5% of the lipids from 16:0-enriched fadE and fadE+ cells, respectively, were found to be in the gel state at the growth temperature. Kinetic studies reveal the translocation of 16:0/16:0 molecular species from inner to outer membrane delays briefly the accumulation of this species in the inner membrane. This extreme and deleterious change in membrane-lipid composition precludes cloning of the fadE strain on solid media containing 16:0 and, therefore, these conditions provide the basis for selection of mutants altered in the mechanisms which determine the synthesis or accumulation of membrane lipid. Three such mutants are described which display alterations in the normal distribution of molecular species."
https://openalex.org/W1554655699,"Proteolysis of native aspartokinase-homoserine dehydrogenase by chymotrypsin, subtilisin, clostripain, and V8 protease yields active dehydrogenase fragments. Fluorescence and near-UV circular dichroism measurements demonstrate that the bulk of the spectroscopic signal observed in the native protein originates in the residual fragments. Kinetic studies and far-UV CD spectra further distribute the fragments into two groups. Even though the remaining dehydrogenase activity is no longer inhibited by L-threonine, ultrafiltration binding studies and far-UV CD spectra clearly demonstrate that one of the two sets of inhibitor-binding sites is still intact. Computer analysis of the far-UV CD data of the native protein and the isolated fragments in the presence and absence of L-threonine has been used to resolve contributions from helix, beta, turn, and aperiodic components. This analysis indicates that the binding of the inhibitor induces decreases in helix content and generation of aperiodic structure within the molecule. The changes observed are similar in the native molecule and the fragments."

The stability of the enzyme and its different forms was studied in exponentially growing, ammonium-starved and energy-depleted cultures using a dual-labeling, pulse-chase method. Labeled enzyme was isolated by standard purification techniques and by immunoprecipitation from crude extracts. The results demonstrated the following: 1) post-translational modification occurred in vivo, 2) modification occurred to the same extent in growing and ammonium-starved cells, 3) modification was dependent on a carbon-energy source for the cells, and 4) the enzyme was not degraded in growing or nongrowing cells. The pulse-chase data also indicated that one form of the protein (band 1) was the precursor of three other forms (bands 3-5) and that the relative amount of one form (band 2) remained constant."
