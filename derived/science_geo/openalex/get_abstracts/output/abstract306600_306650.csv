https://openalex.org/W2008992984,"A 5000-year regional paleoflood chronology, based on flood deposits from 19 rivers in Arizona and Utah, reveals that the largest floods in the region cluster into distinct time intervals that coincide with periods of cool, moist climate and frequent El Niño events. The floods were most numerous from 4800 to 3600 years before present (B.P.), around 1000 years B.P., and after 500 years B.P., but decreased markedly from 3600 to 2200 and 800 to 600 years B.P. Analogous modern floods are associated with a specific set of anomalous atmospheric circulation conditions that were probably more prevalent during past flood epochs."

The average C-Si-C angle is 117 degrees , only 3 degrees short of the planarity expected of a pure silylium ion(120 degrees ). This value compares to 114 degrees recently reported for a toluene-solvated silyl cation, [Et(3)Si(toluene)](+) by Lambert and co-workers. The greater silylium ion character of i-Pr(3)Si(Br(6)-CB(11)H(6)) versus [i-Pr(3)Si(toluene)](+) is also reflected in the larger downfield shift of the silicon-29 nuclear magnetic resonance, 109.8 versus </=94.0 parts per million. The unusual bonding of toluene to R(3)Si(+) in Lambert's compound is reinterpreted as a significant covalent pi interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2056411777,"Perfluoroalkylated nanospheres have been prepared by reaction of fullerenes with a variety of fluoroalkyl radicals. The latter are generated by thermal or photochemical decomposition of fluoroalkyl iodides or fluorodiacyl peroxides. Up to 16 radicals add to C(60) to afford easily isolable fluoroalkylated derivatives. The monosubstituted radical adducts were detected by electron spin resonance in the early stages of the fluoroalkylation reactions. These spheroidal molecules are thermally quite stable, soluble in fluoroorganic solvents, chemically resistant to corrosive aqueous solutions, and more volatile than the parent fullerenes. Films of the sublimed material display properties typical for a perfluoroalkylated material."
https://openalex.org/W2046870999,"Records of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in biogenic silica and carbon isotopes in planktonic foraminifera from deep-sea sediment cores from the Southern Ocean reveal that the primary production during the last glacial maximum was lower than Holocene productivity. These observations conflict with the hypothesis that the low atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were introduced by an increase in the efficiency of the high-latitude biological pump. Instead, different oceanic sectors may have had high glacial productivity, or alternative mechanisms that do not involve the biological pump must be considered as the primary cause of the low glacial atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations."

The largest fragments of the comet's original nucleus will be tidally disrupted shortly before they enter the Jovian atmosphere, and all fragments, from large rocks to small grains, will suffer ablation and disintegration as a result of interaction with the atmosphere. Even if atmospheric entry takes place on the planet's far side, secondary phenomena triggered by the terminal explosions of kilometer-sized fragments are likely to be observable from the Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2039420913,"Geomagnetic paleointensity determinations from radiocarbon-dated lava flows on the island of Hawaii provide an estimate of broad trends in paleointensity for Holocene time and offer a glimpse of intensity variations near the end of the last glacial period. When the data from Hawaii are compared with others worldwide, the intensity of the geomagnetic field seems to have been reduced from the Holocene average by about 35 percent between 45,000 and 10,000 years ago. A long-term reduction of this magnitude is compatible with reported increases in the production rate of cosmogenic nuclides during the same interval."

Tirrell “Putting a new spin on spider silk” ([5 Jan., p. 39][1]) ([1][2]) and in This Week in Science in the same issue ([p. 9][3]), comments are made about the “superior” and “unmatched” strength and toughness of spider silk. These comments have romantic interest, but they are not correct according to numbers published elsewhere. The following table, although not comprehensive, makes the point.

View this table:

The lowest tensile strength on this list is that of spider silk. The toughness (energy to break) of the silk is more competitive, but it is no match for the mighty fused silica. Furthermore, the chemical and thermal stabilities of spider silk are mediocre compared with the rest of the list. Finally, silica fiber is much, much cheaper to produce than commercial quantities of spider silk. So let's put the romance aside and pay some attention to the “video tape.”

Especially important are the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider and the Beijing Spectrometer. These two facilities have done important work related to charmed quarks and successfully measured the mass of the tau lepton. Plans for future projects are briefly described."
