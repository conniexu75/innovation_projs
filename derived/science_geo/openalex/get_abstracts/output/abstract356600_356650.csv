https://openalex.org/W2010986636,"Prokaryotes acquire virus resistance by integrating short fragments of viral nucleic acid into clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). Here we show how virus-derived sequences contained in CRISPRs are used by CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins from the host to mediate an antiviral response that counteracts infection. After transcription of the CRISPR, a complex of Cas proteins termed Cascade cleaves a CRISPR RNA precursor in each repeat and retains the cleavage products containing the virus-derived sequence. Assisted by the helicase Cas3, these mature CRISPR RNAs then serve as small guide RNAs that enable Cascade to interfere with virus proliferation. Our results demonstrate that the formation of mature guide RNAs by the CRISPR RNA endonuclease subunit of Cascade is a mechanistic requirement for antiviral defense."

In the particular case of block copolymers, the thermodynamic driving forces for self-assembly are small, and low-energy defects can get easily trapped. We directed the assembly of defect-free arrays of isolated block copolymer domains at densities up to 1 terabit per square inch on chemically patterned surfaces. In comparing the assembled structures to the chemical pattern, the density is increased by a factor of four, the size is reduced by a factor of two, and the dimensional uniformity is vastly improved."

Here, we report on the clinical activity of a bispecific antibody construct called blinatumomab, which has the potential to engage all cytotoxic T cells in patients for lysis of cancer cells. Doses as low as 0.005 milligrams per square meter per day in non–Hodgkin's lymphoma patients led to an elimination of target cells in blood. Partial and complete tumor regressions were first observed at a dose level of 0.015 milligrams, and all seven patients treated at a dose level of 0.06 milligrams experienced a tumor regression. Blinatumomab also led to clearance of tumor cells from bone marrow and liver. T cell–engaging antibodies appear to have therapeutic potential for the treatment of malignant diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2022710553,"CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are widespread security measures on the World Wide Web that prevent automated programs from abusing online services. They do so by asking humans to perform a task that computers cannot yet perform, such as deciphering distorted characters. Our research explored whether such human effort can be channeled into a useful purpose: helping to digitize old printed material by asking users to decipher scanned words from books that computerized optical character recognition failed to recognize. We showed that this method can transcribe text with a word accuracy exceeding 99%, matching the guarantee of professional human transcribers. Our apparatus is deployed in more than 40,000 Web sites and has transcribed over 440 million words."
https://openalex.org/W2006530737,"Negative refraction in metamaterials has generated great excitement in the scientific community. Although negative refraction has been realized in microwave and infrared by using metamaterials and by using two-dimensional waveguide structures, creation of a bulk metamaterial showing negative refraction at visible frequency has not been successful, mainly because of the significant resonance losses and fabrication difficulties. We report bulk metamaterials made of nanowires that show such negative refraction for all incident angles in the visible region. Moreover, the negative refraction occurs far from any resonance, resulting in a low-loss and a broad-band propagation at visible frequencies. These remarkable properties can substantially affect applications such as imaging, three-dimensional light manipulation, and optical communication."
https://openalex.org/W1984659595,"Self-assembling materials are the building blocks of bottom-up nanofabrication processes, but they need to be templated to impose long-range order and eliminate defects. In this work, the self-assembly of a thin film of a spherical-morphology block copolymer is templated using an array of nanoscale topographical elements that act as surrogates for the minority domains of the block copolymer. The orientation and periodicity of the resulting array of spherical microdomains are governed by the commensurability between the block copolymer period and the template period and is accurately described by a free-energy model. This method, which forms high-spatial-frequency arrays using a lower-spatial-frequency template, will be useful in nanolithography applications such as the formation of high-density microelectronic structures."
https://openalex.org/W2122413738,"Infection with the obligate intracellular protozoan Leishmania is thought to be initiated by direct parasitization of macrophages, but the early events following transmission to the skin by vector sand flies have been difficult to examine directly. Using dynamic intravital microscopy and flow cytometry, we observed a rapid and sustained neutrophilic infiltrate at localized sand fly bite sites. Invading neutrophils efficiently captured Leishmania major (L.m.) parasites early after sand fly transmission or needle inoculation, but phagocytosed L.m. remained viable and infected neutrophils efficiently initiated infection. Furthermore, neutrophil depletion reduced, rather than enhanced, the ability of parasites to establish productive infections. Thus, L.m. appears to have evolved to both evade and exploit the innate host response to sand fly bite in order to establish and promote disease."
https://openalex.org/W4213083133,"We report a low-cost, high-throughput scanning probe lithography method that uses a soft elastomeric tip array, rather than tips mounted on individual cantilevers, to deliver inks to a surface in a ""direct write"" manner. Polymer pen lithography merges the feature size control of dip-pen nanolithography with the large-area capability of contact printing. Because ink delivery is time and force dependent, features on the nanometer, micrometer, and macroscopic length scales can be formed with the same tip array. Arrays with as many as about 11 million pyramid-shaped pens can be brought into contact with substrates and readily leveled optically to ensure uniform pattern development."
https://openalex.org/W1987113787,"Osterix/Sp7, a member of the Sp1 transcription factor family, plays an essential role in bone formation and osteoblastogenesis. Although Osterix has been shown to be induced by BMP2 in a mesenchymal cell line, the molecular basis of the regulation, expression and function of Osterix during osteoblast differentiation, is not fully understood. Thus we examined the role of BMP2 signaling in the regulation of Osterix using the mesenchymal cell lines C3H10T1/2 and C2C12. Osterix overexpression induced alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin expression in C2C12 cells and stimulated calcification of murine primary osteoblasts. Considering that Runx2 overexpression induces Osterix, these results suggest that Osterix functions as downstream of Runx2. Surprisingly, BMP2 treatment induced Osterix expression and alkaline phosphatase activity in mesenchymal cells derived from Runx2-deficient mice. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad1 and Smad4 up-regulated Osterix expression, and an inhibitory Smad, Smad6, markedly suppressed BMP2-induced Osterix expression in the Runx2-deficient cells. Moreover, overexpression of a homeobox gene, Msx2, which is up-regulated by BMP2 and promotes osteoblastic differentiation, induced Osterix expression in the Runx2-deficient cells. Knockdown of Msx2 clearly inhibited induction of Osterix by BMP2 in the Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, microarray analyses using the Runx2-deficient cells revealed that the role of Osterix was distinct from that of Runx2. These findings suggest that Osterix is regulated via both Runx2-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and that Osterix controls osteoblast differentiation, at least in part, by regulating the expression of genes not controlled by Runx2.

Osteoblasts are differentiated from multipotent mesenchymal cells (1Yin T. Li L. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This differentiation process is regulated by several cytokines, including bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factor β, Wnt, and hedgehog (2Cohen M.M. Am. J. Med.

Among them, BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) is one of the most powerful cytokines that promote differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts in vitro and induce bone formation in vivo (2Cohen M.M. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 109: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). BMP2 exhibits this osteogenic action by activating Smad signaling and by regulating transcription of osteogenic genes such as ALP, type I collagen, osteocalcin, and bone sialoprotein (Bsp) 2The abbreviations used are: Bsp, bone sialoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; siRNA, small interfering RNA.

Osterix, an Sp1 transcription family member, is up-regulated by BMP2 during osteoblastic differentiation (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). Osterix has also been reported to inhibit chondrogenesis (14Kaback L.A. Soung do Y. Naik A. Smith N. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Drissi H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 214: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in the Osterix gene show no bone formation and complete absence of osteoblasts (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar), indicating the indispensable role of Osterix in osteoblastogenesis. Interestingly, Runx2 is expressed in mesenchymal cells of Osterix null mice (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of Osterix is not observed in Runx2-deficient mice (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Osterix may function as downstream of Runx2 during osteoblast differentiation. On the other hand, another study found that Runx2 is not involved in induction of Osterix (15Lee M.H. Kwon T.G. Park H.S. Wozney J.M. Ryoo H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To date, the target genes of Osterix, which are responsible for the osteogenic function of Osterix, have not been identified. Therefore, the regulation and functions of Osterix during osteoblast differentiation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression and functions of Osterix during osteoblast differentiation. We found that Smad signaling is required for induction of Osterix, and that Osterix expression is regulated via both Runx2-dependent and -independent mechanisms by BMP2 signaling. Furthermore, Osterix promotes osteoblast differentiation of Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells in association with up-regulation of several genes, which are not up-regulated by Runx2. Thus, we believe that our findings provide novel insights into osteoblastogenesis. Cells—C3H10T1/2 and C2C12 were purchased from RIKEN Cell Bank and cultured in α-modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. IGF-1 was purchased from R&D Systems. Isolation of Primary Osteoblasts—The calvariae were isolated from 2- or 3-day-old neonatal mice and digested with 0.1% collagenase (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 0.2% dispase (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) for 7 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation as mesenchymal cells. The digested calvariae were sequentially digested four times with 0.1% collagenase and 0.2% dispase for 7 min at 37 °C (16Hata K. Nishimura R. Ueda M. Ikeda F. Matsubara T. Ichida F. Hisada K. Nokubi T. Yamaguchi A. Yoneda T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The last three cell fractions were collected and used as primary osteoblasts (16Hata K. Nishimura R. Ueda M. Ikeda F. Matsubara T. Ichida F. Hisada K. Nokubi T. Yamaguchi A. Yoneda T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1971-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cells showed ALP activity. Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells were isolated from the calvariae of Runx2-deficient embryos as described previously (17Liu T. Gao Y. Sakamoto K. Minamizato T. Furukawa K. Tsukazaki T. Shibata Y. Bessho K. Komori T. Yamaguchi A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In brief, the anterior region of calvariae from an embryo at embryonic day 18.5 was minced and cultured for 10–14 days in three-dimensional collagen gel (Cellmatrix, Nitta Gelatin Co.) with α-modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells outgrowing from the explants were retrieved by incubation for 30 min with 0.2% collagenase in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C and then cultured with α-modified minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (17Liu T.

Osterix cDNA—As described previously (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar), C2C12 cells were incubated in the presence of BMP2 for 4 days. Because BMP2 showed maximum effect on induction of Osterix at 300 ng/ml (data not shown), we used that dose in this study. Osterix cDNA was isolated from the cells by reverse-transcribed PCR. The sequence of the cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The Osterix cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA4 expression vector tagged with a Myc epitope at the C terminus (Invitrogen). Generation of Adenovirus—Recombinant adenovirus carrying Osterix was constructed by homologous recombination between the expression cosmid cassette (pAxCAwt) and the parental virus genome in 293 cells (RIKEN) as described previously using an adenovirus construction kit (Takara) (11Nishimura R. Hata K. Harris S.E. Ikeda F. Yoneda T. Bone (Elmsford). 2002; 31: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15Lee M.H. Kwon T.G. Park H.S. Wozney J.M. Ryoo H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 2007; 211: 728-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses carrying Runx2, Msx2, Smad1, Smad4, Smad6, and FLAG-Dlx5 were used as described previously (11Nishimura R. Hata K. Harris S.E. Ikeda F. Yoneda T. Bone (Elmsford). 2002; 31: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Hata K. Nishimura R. Ueda M. Ikeda F. Matsubara T. Ichida F. Hisada K.

The viruses showed no proliferative activity because of a lack of E1A-E1B. Titers of the viruses were determined using a modified point assay (19Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Infection of recombinant adenoviruses with C3H10T1/2 cells, C2C12 cells, or primary osteoblasts was performed by incubation with adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 40, except where indicated otherwise. Western Blotting—The cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were boiled in SDS sample buffer containing 0.5 m β-mercaptoethanol. These samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted with corresponding antibodies, and visualized with horseradish peroxidase coupled to anti-mouse antibody or horseradish peroxidase coupled to anti-rabbit antibody with enhancement by ECL detection kits. Reverse-transcribed PCR and Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega). After denaturation of total RNA at 70 °C for 10 min, cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were performed using the specific primers for mouse Osterix (sense primer, 5′-GAAAGGAGGCACAAAGAAG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CACCAAGGAGTAGGTGTGTT-3′). PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR products were then subcloned into the TA cloning vector and the DNA sequences of the PCR products determined. To determine the expression levels of Osterix, osteocalcin, Msx2, ALP mRNA, Col1a1, Bsp, Col2a1, Col10a1, and Sox9, the cDNA samples were analyzed by real time PCR using an ABI PRISM 7300 unit (Applied Biosystems) and specific Taqman probes as follows: mouse Osterix (sense primer, 5′-AGCGACCACTTGAGCAAACAT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GCGGCTGATTGGCTTCTTCT-3′; probe, 5′-CCCGACGCTGCGACCCTCC-3′); mouse Msx2 (sense primer, 5′-CCATATACGGCGCATCCTACC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CAACCGGCGTGGCATAGAG-3′; probe, 5′-AGACCTGTGCTCCCCATCCCGCC-3′); mouse osteocalcin (sense primer, 5′-GCAATAAGGTAGTGAACAGACTCC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GTTTGTAGGCGGTCTTCAAGC-3′; probe, 5′-TGGAGCCTCAGTCCCCAGCCCA-3); mouse ALP (sense primer, 5′-ATCTTTGGTCTGGCTCCCATG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TTTCCCGTTCACCGTCCAC-3′; probe, 5′-TGAGCGACACGGACAAGAAGCCCTT-3′); mouse Col1a1 (sense primer, 5′-GCAACAGTCGCTTCACCTACA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CAATGTCCAAGGGAGCCACAT-3′; probe, 5′-CCTTGTGGACGGCTGCACGAGTCAC-3′); mouse Bsp (sense primer, 5′-AAGCAGCACCGTTGAGTATGG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCTTGTAGTAGCTGTATTCGTCCTC-3′; probe, 5′-CGGTAAGTGTCGCCACGAGGCTCCC-3′); mouse Col2a1 (sense primer, 5′-CCTCCGTCTACTGTCCACTGA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ATTGGAGCCCTGGATGAGCA-3′; probe, 5′-CTTGAGGTTGCCAGCCGCTTCGTCC-3′); mouse Col10a1 (sense primer, 5′-GCCAAGCAGTCATGCCTGAT-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GACACGGGCATACCTGTTACC-3′; probe, 5′-AGCACTGACAAGCGGCATCCCAGA-3′); and mouse Sox9 (sense primer, 5′-CCTTCAACCTTCCTCACTACAGC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-GGTGGAGTAGAGCCCTGAGC-3′; probe, 5′-CCGCCCATCACCCGCTCGCAATAC-3′). The expression levels of each sample were normalized against β-actin mRNA expression. Microarray Analysis—As we observed that expression of Osterix or Runx2 reached maximum after infection of the corresponding adenovirus and would like to examine the direct effects of Osterix or Runx2 on the target genes, we used total RNA isolated from C3H10T1/2 cells that were infected with or without Runx2 or Osterix adenovirus and incubated for 4 days. Total RNA was isolated from the cells using the SV total RNA isolation kit (Promega). An oligonucleotide microarray (Gene Chip Murine Genome U74Av2, Affymetrix) was used to monitor the relative abundance of transcripts as described previously (20Ishii M. Hashimoto S. Tsutsumi S. Wada Y. Matsushima K. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Genomics. 2000; 68: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Double strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT) primer, amplified with T7 RNA polymerase up to ∼100 μg of cRNA, and hybridized to the oligonucleotide microarray according to the manufacturer's instructions. For normalization, the average intensity for genes was made equal to 100 to reliably compare variable multiple arrays (20Ishii M. Hashimoto S. Tsutsumi S. Wada Y. Matsushima K. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Genomics. 2000; 68: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Determination of ALP Staining—The cultured C3H10T1/2 cells, C2C12 cells, or Runx2 null mesenchymal cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) and 5-bromo-4-chroro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) (18Ichida F. Nishimura R. Hata K. Matsubara T. Ikeda F. Hisada K. Yatani H. Cao X. Komori T. Yamaguchi A. Yoneda T. J. Biol.

Alizarin Red Staining—The cultured calvaria cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. The cells were then stained with 1% alizarin red solution for 5 min (18Ichida F. Nishimura R. Hata K. Matsubara T. Ikeda F. Hisada K. Yatani H. Cao X. Komori T. Yamaguchi A. Yoneda T. J. Biol.

Sirius Red Staining for Collagen—C3H10T1/2 cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. After washing the cells with distilled H2O, the cells were stained with 0.1% Direct Red 80 (Sigma) for 90 min (21Maniatopoulos C. Sodek J. Melcher A.H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 254: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical Analysis—C3H10T1/2 cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. After blocking with blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories), the cells were stained with anti-collagen antibody (Chemicon), followed by visualization with a VECTASTAIN® ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Knockdown Experiment—Cells were transfected with Stealth siRNA (Invitrogen) and Mission siRNA (Sigma) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two sets of Msx2 siRNA (5′-CCGCCAGAAACAGUACCUGUCCAUA-3′ and 5′-GAUAUGGCAUGUACCAUCUAUCCUA-3′) or Osterix siRNA (5′-CUUCGCAUCUGAAAGCCCA-3′ and 5′-CCUACUUACCCAUCUGACU-3′) were used for knockdown of Msx2 or Osterix, respectively. Control siRNA was purchased from Invitrogen. Osteoblastogenic Activity of Osterix—To understand the functional role of Osterix in osteoblast differentiation, we examined the effect of Osterix overexpression in C2C12 cells. Osterix overexpression induced ALP activity and osteocalcin expression in C2C12 cells (Fig. 1, A–C). Similar to BMP2 treatment or Runx2 overexpression, Osterix overexpression also induced ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1D). Consistently, knockdown of Osterix inhibited expression of osteocalcin, Bsp, and ALP stimulated by BMP2 in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1E). In contrast to BMP2 treatment, Osterix had very little effect on the expression of Col1a1 or collagen synthesis (Fig. 1, D and F). In addition, knockdown of Osterix did not suppress Col1a1 expression (Fig. 1E). Moreover, Runx2 overexpression showed marginal effects on Col1a1 expression and collagen synthesis (Fig. 1, A, D, and F). These results suggest that other transcription factors, which would be controlled by BMP2, might be involved in the regulation of Col1a1 expression and maturation. Furthermore, Osterix overexpression in mouse primary osteoblasts clearly stimulated calcification of the cells (Fig. 1G). These findings indicate that Osterix has osteoblastogenic activity. Interestingly, we observed that the osteoblastogenic activity of Osterix differed from that of Runx2 (Fig. 1, B, C, D, F, and G), suggesting that Osterix and Runx2 have distinct and separate roles during osteoblast differentiation. To verify this possibility, we compared the target genes of Runx2 and Osterix by performing microarray analyses. As shown in Fig. 2B, several genes, including Wnt4, Bglap1, and BMP7, were similarly induced by Runx2 or Osterix. However, we found that there were two groups of genes that were induced by either Runx2 or Osterix but not both (Fig. 2, A and C). Together, these findings suggest that Runx2 and Osterix have common roles in osteoblast differentiation but also possess distinct roles in gene regulation during osteoblastogenesis.FIGURE 2Genes up-regulated by Runx2 or Osterix.

As shown above (Fig. 1, B, C, D, F, and G, and Fig. 2), Osterix has distinct roles during osteoblast differentiation. Therefore, we examined whether Runx2 is necessary for induction of Osterix expression using mesenchymal cells isolated from Runx2-deficient mice. These cells were able to differentiate into ALP-positive osteoblastic cells upon BMP2 treatment or Runx2 overexpression within 3 days (Fig. 3, A and B) (16Hata K. Nishimura R. Ueda M. Ikeda F.

Although the cells had some ability to differentiate into chondrocytic cells, real time PCR analyses indicated that the cells preferentially differentiated into osteoblastic cells (Fig. 3C). As expected, Runx2 induced Osterix expression in these cells (Fig. 3, D and E). Surprisingly, BMP2 treatment induced Osterix expression in the Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3, D and E). These results suggest that Osterix expression is regulated by BMP2 through both Runx2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Regulation of Osterix Expression by Smad and Msx2 Signaling—To understand the molecular mechanism by which BMP2 induces Osterix expression in Runx2-deficient cells, we first examined whether Smad signaling is implicated in the regulation of Osterix expression, because Smad signaling plays a central role in BMP2-regulated osteoblast differentiation (22Nishimura R. Kato Y. Chen D. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1872-1879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, overexpression of Smad1 and Smad4 stimulated BMP2-induced ALP activity in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. Moreover, overexpression of Smad1 and Smad4 enhanced Osterix expression by BMP2 in these cells (Fig. 4C). To confirm the involvement of Smad signaling in Runx2-independent Osterix expression, we next examined the effect of Smad6 on Runx2-deficient cells. We found that overexpression of Smad6 abolished induction of Osterix and ALP activity by BMP2 in Runx2-deficient cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Collectively, these results indicate that Smad signaling is necessary for Osterix expression in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells and subsequent osteoblastic differentiation.FIGURE 5Inhibition of BMP2-induced Osterix expression by Smad6. A, Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells were infected with Smad6 adenovirus (40 m.o.i.) and cultured for a week in the presence of BMP2 (300 ng/ml) as indicated. The cells were determined by ALP staining. B, Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells were infected with Smad6 adenovirus (40 m.o.i.) and cultured for 4 days in the presence of BMP2 (300 ng/ml) as indicated. Total RNA was isolated from the cells and determined by real time PCR analysis for Osterix mRNA expression. Osterix expression was normalized by β-actin expression.

Nishimura R. Hata K. Matsubara T. Ikeda F. Hisada K. Yatani H. Cao X. Komori T. Yamaguchi A. Yoneda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34015-34022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Msx2 may function as upstream of Osterix. First, we determined whether Msx2 is induced by BMP2 treatment in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, BMP2 clearly up-regulated Msx2 expression even in the absence of the Runx2 gene. Importantly, Msx2 overexpression induced Osterix expression in the Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells (Fig. 6B). Moreover, knockdown of Msx2 clearly inhibited induction of Osterix by BMP2 in the Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Although IGF-1 and Dlx5 have been implicated in regulation of Osterix expression (15Lee M.H. Kwon T.G. Park H.S. Wozney J.M. Ryoo H.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochem. 2005; 95: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we did not observe any effect of IGF-1 or Dlx5 on Osterix expression in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells (Fig. 6, E and F). Our findings indicate that Msx2, which is regulated by BMP2, controls Osterix expression via a Runx2-independent mechanism. Osteoblastogenic Activity of Osterix in Runx2-deficient Mesenchymal Cells—We next examined whether Osterix was able to promote osteoblast differentiation in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. We exogenously introduced Osterix into Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells and found that Osterix overexpression induced ALP activity in these cells (Fig. 3, A, B and E). In addition, Osterix overexpression significantly stimulated osteocalcin and Bsp expression (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that Osterix itself has osteoblastogenic activity. Although a previous genetic study raised the possibility that Osterix functions as downstream of Runx2 (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which BMP2 regulates Osterix expression during osteoblast differentiation has been unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that Osterix expression is regulated by both Runx2-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Other researchers and we have previously demonstrated that BMP2 up-regulates Runx2 expression during osteoblast differentiation (10Hanai J. Chen L.F. Kanno T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Kim W.Y. Guo W.H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), and thus it is likely that BMP2 controls Osterix expression through Runx2. We observed that overexpression of Runx2 induces Osterix expression in mesenchymal cell lines. Notably, we demonstrated that BMP2 and Msx2 induced Osterix expression in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Msx2 blocked the induction of Osterix in the Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. Thus, these results indicate the novel paradigm that BMP2 controls Osterix expression independently of Runx2 through Msx2. The functional role of Msx2 in osteoblasts appears to be complex, as several studies have reported that Msx2 positively and negatively controls osteoblast differentiation (18Ichida F. Nishimura R. Hata K. Matsubara T. Ikeda F. Hisada K. Yatani H. Cao X. Komori T. Yamaguchi A. Yoneda T. J. Biol.

Biol. 2007; 27: 7947-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, genetic studies have indicated that Msx2 plays critical roles in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation (29Satokata I. Ma L. Ohshima H. Bei M. Woo I. Nishizawa K. Maeda T. Takano Y. Uchiyama M. Heaney S. Peters H. Tang Z. Maxson R. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 30Wilkie A.O. Tang Z. Elanko N. Walsh S. Twigg S.R. Hurst J.A. Wall S.A. Chrzanowska K.H. Maxson Jr., R.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The functional role of Msx2 in bone would be temporally and spatially regulated. Therefore, our present results suggest that Msx2 exhibits osteogenic function by up-regulating Osterix, at least in part, in a Runx2-independent manner. Because Osterix null mice show complete absence of bone formation and osteoblasts at the embryo stage, Osterix is considered to play an indispensable role in bone development and osteoblastogenesis (13Nakashima K. Zhou X. Kunkel G. Zhang Z. Deng J.M. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). However, whether Osterix itself is sufficient to stimulate osteoblast differentiation has been unclear. We found that Osterix has osteogenic activity in vitro and stimulates osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, Osterix exhibited osteoblastogenic activity in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells. This result suggests two possibilities. One is that Osterix functions as downstream of Runx2. This idea is well supported by our finding that Runx2 overexpression induced Osterix expression in Runx2-deficient mesenchymal cells as well as in C2C12 cells, in which the Runx2 gene is intact. The other possibility is that Osterix may have functions distinct from those of Runx2. Consistent with this idea, we observed that Osterix showed lesser osteoblastogenic activity than Runx2. To verify these possibilities, we compared the transcriptional target genes of Osterix and Runx2 by performing microarray analyses. Overexpression of either Runx2 or Osterix up-regulated common genes such as Wnt4, Bglap1, and BMP7 in Runx2-deficient cells, suggesting that Osterix and Runx2 possess common roles during osteoblastogenesis. Although deficiency of either the Osterix or Runx2 gene leads to complete absence of bone at the embryo stage, the phenotype of Osterix null mice in bone seems different from that of Runx2 null mice at birth (7Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that Osterix and Runx2 have distinct functions during bone formation. Indeed, we observed that Osterix and Runx2 also stimulate expression of distinct genes. Collectively, our data suggest that Osterix not only functions as downstream of Runx2 but also regulates osteoblastogenesis independently of Runx2 by controlling Osterix-specific target genes. Because the Runx2 null mice show no bone formation, the Runx2-independent pathway, which is partly regulated by Osterix, could be necessary but not sufficient for osteogenesis in vivo. In other words, both Runx2-dependent and -independent pathways could be required for bone formation. The target genes responsible for the bone phenotype seen in Osterix null mice have not yet been identified. Therefore, identification of the genes that are regulated by Osterix and that play critical roles in osteoblastogenesis may advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which BMP2 regulates bone formation and osteoblastogenesis and may contribute to developing therapeutic agents for bone diseases. It has been demonstrated that Osterix has two isoforms in humans (31Milona M.A. Gough J.E. Edgar A.J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We isolated the longer isoform, which potentially encodes 18 additional amino acids, from C2C12 cells but did not detect the shorter isoform in murine mesenchymal cell lines (data not shown). We generated the two types of Osterix expression vectors that encode Osterix proteins corresponding to the shorter and longer mRNA. However, the longer form of Osterix expression vector failed to show osteoblastogenic activity (data not shown). It is therefore necessary to identify the translational starting site(s) of the Osterix gene. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BMP2 regulates Osterix expression independently through two distinct transcription factors, Runx2 and Msx2. We also found that Osterix possesses osteogenic function during osteoblastogenesis. Thus, we believe that our findings contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis by which BMP2 conducts osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal cells."

We drove a transient charge density wave melting, excited collective vibrations in TbTe3, and observed them through their time-, frequency-, and momentum-dependent influence on the electronic structure. We were able to identify the role of the observed collective vibration in the transition and to document the transition in real time. The information that we demonstrate as being accessible with trARPES will greatly enhance the understanding of all materials exhibiting collective phenomena."

This is true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100 (refs 1-5). In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity, with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains 50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality, process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology of many infectious diseases."

Focusing on the Amazon, we show a smooth transition between two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds: the microphysical and the radiative. We show how a feedback between the optical properties of aerosols and the cloud fraction can modify the aerosol forcing, changing the total radiative energy and redistributing it over the atmospheric column."

Although SNARE complexes containing open syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 are essential for exocytosis, the function of closed syntaxin-1 is unknown. We generated knockin/knockout mice that expressed only open syntaxin-1B. Syntaxin-1B(Open) mice were viable but succumbed to generalized seizures at 2 to 3 months of age. Binding of Munc18-1 to syntaxin-1 was impaired in syntaxin-1B(Open) synapses, and the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool was decreased; however, the rate of synaptic vesicle fusion was dramatically enhanced. Thus, the closed conformation of syntaxin-1 gates the initiation of the synaptic vesicle fusion reaction, which is then mediated by SNARE-complex/Munc18-1 assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W2049259066,"Einstein called entanglement, a type of correlation found only in quantum physics, 'spooky action at a distance'. Experimental tests known as Bell inequalities have all but ruled out a classical explanation for such correlations, but the possibility remains that a first event could influence a second one, if the influence occurs faster than the speed of light. An impressive new experiment has been performed with a view to establishing a lower limit for the speed of such hypothetical influences. The experiment involved a Bell inequality test lasting more than 24 hours between two Swiss villages 18 km apart and approximately east–west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. Taking advantage of the Earth's rotation, the experiment allowed the determination of a lower bound for the speed of any such influence. The conclusion was that the minimal speed of hypothetical spooky action at a distance, under plausible assumptions for this experiment, is at least 10,000 times greater than the speed of light. The existence in nature of a real spooky action at a distance is therefore deemed implausible. Experiments have almost ruled out a classical explanation for entanglement, but it is possible that one event could influence a second if the influence occurs faster than the speed of light. The authors put experimental bounds on the speed of such hypothetical influences. Correlations are generally described by one of two mechanisms: either a first event influences a second one by sending information encoded in bosons or other physical carriers, or the correlated events have some common causes in their shared history. Quantum physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations, named entanglement. This reveals itself in correlations that violate Bell inequalities (implying that they cannot be described by common causes) between space-like separated events (implying that they cannot be described by classical communication). Many Bell tests have been performed1, and loopholes related to locality2,3,4 and detection5,6 have been closed in several independent experiments. It is still possible that a first event could influence a second, but the speed of this hypothetical influence (Einstein’s ‘spooky action at a distance’) would need to be defined in some universal privileged reference frame and be greater than the speed of light. Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical influences. We performed a Bell test over more than 24 hours between two villages separated by 18 km and approximately east–west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed two-photon interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the Earth’s rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine, for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of the influence. For example, if such a privileged reference frame exists and is such that the Earth’s speed in this frame is less than 10-3 times that of the speed of light, then the speed of the influence would have to exceed that of light by at least four orders of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W2015188565,"Diverse cell polarity networks require positive feedback for locally amplifying distributions of signalling molecules at the plasma membrane. Additional mechanisms, such as directed transport or coupled inhibitors, have been proposed to be required for reinforcing a unique axis of polarity. Here we analyse a simple model of positive feedback, with strong analogy to the 'stepping stone' model of population genetics, in which a single species of diffusible, membrane-bound signalling molecules can self-recruit from a cytoplasmic pool. We identify an intrinsic stochastic mechanism through which positive feedback alone is sufficient to account for the spontaneous establishment of a single site of polarity. We find that the polarization frequency has an inverse dependence on the number of signalling molecules: the frequency of polarization decreases as the number of molecules becomes large. Experimental observation of polarizing Cdc42 in budding yeast is consistent with this prediction. Our work suggests that positive feedback can work alone or with additional mechanisms to create robust cell polarity."

Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). As other RRM-containing, RNA-binding proteins (5Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar), the RRM1 of TDP-43 contributes primarily to its RNA-binding ability, whereas RRM2 is needed for correct complex formation (6Buratti E. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36337-36343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The C terminus of TDP-43 including the glycine-rich domain is necessary for formation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-rich complexes (7Buratti E. Brindisi A. Giombi M.

Genomics. 2004; 83: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Significantly, TDP-43 was later identified as the pathological signature protein for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with TDP-43(+), ubiquitin(+) inclusion bodies, or UBI, in the brain/neuron cell (9Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D. Tsuchiya K. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y. Oda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In particular, different miscleaved or modified forms of TDP-43 were trapped in these UBIs (9Arai T. Hasegawa M. Akiyama H. Ikeda K. Nonaka T. Mori H. Mann D. Tsuchiya K. Yoshida M. Hashizume Y.

Science. 2006; 314: 130-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (4595) Google Scholar). The recent analysis of the characteristics of TDP-43 in cultured rodent neurons suggested that the neurodegenerative diseases with TDP-43(+) UBIs likely resulted from the impairment/loss of a spectrum of neuronal functions of TDP-43 because of its trapping within the UBIs (4Wang I.F. Wu L.S. Chang H.Y. Shen C.K. J. Neurochem. 2008; 105: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The splicing of the transcripts from the survival of motor neuron gene (SMN) has been one of the systems for intensive studies of the mechanisms of alternative splicing. The human genome consists of two nearly identical copies of SMN genes (SMN1 and SMN2). The critical difference between SMN1 and SMN2 is a translationally silent C (in SMN1) → T (in SMN2) change at position 6 of exon 7 (11Monani U.R. Lorson C.L. Parsons D.W. Prior T.W. Androphy E.J.

A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the second most common autosomal recessive disorder caused by degeneration of the α-motor neurons, has been unequivocally shown to be caused by homozygous loss or rare intragenic mutations of the SMN1 gene. The SMN2 gene fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1 in SMA because the T nucleotide at position 6 causes predominant exon 7 skipping, resulting in an unstable protein (SMNΔ7) with reduced oligomerization ability (13Lorson C.L. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B. Le T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Two different models, loss of exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) (15Cartegni L. Krainer A.R. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and gain of exonic splicing silencer (ESS) (16Kashima T. Manley J.L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), have been proposed to explain for the differential splicing patterns of the SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNAs. Many trans-factors involved in SMN exon 7 splicing have been characterized (16Kashima T. Manley J.L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L.

Conway G.C. Kozak D. Cell. 1990; 62: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Among them, Htra2-β1, SRp30c, and hnRNP G act as positive regulators through the AG-rich ESE element in SMN exon 7 (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Young P.J. DiDonato C.J. Hu D. Kothary R. Androphy E.J. Lorson C.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 577-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas hnRNP A1 acts as a negative regulator by binding to the ESS element created by the C → T change in the SMN2 exon 7 (16Kashima T. Manley J.L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 21Kashima T. Rao N. David C.J. Manley J.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 3149-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is likely that apart from the above factors, other RNA-binding proteins might also promote SMN exon 7 inclusion through their direct or indirect association with the SMN pre-mRNAs and/or interactions with the ESE-associated splicing factors. In the following, we provide the first evidence that TDP-43, in addition to its exon exclusion activity on the CFTR transcript, could promote the inclusion of exon 7 during splicing of the human SMN2 pre-mRNA. Furthermore, the known structural/functional motifs of TDP-43 are required for this exon-inclusion activity of TDP-43 as well as its interaction with the human SMN RNAs and other splicing factors. Plasmid Constructs—The minigene reporter constructs pCI-SMN1 and pCI-SMN2 containing the genomic SMN sequences from exons 6–8 were generous gifts from Dr. Elliot J. Androphy (Tufts University School of Medicine). Site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of the SMN1 exon 7 at the SE1, SE2, and SE3 elements, respectively, was carried out as described by Hofmann et al. (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The construction of pSMN(E6)-CFTR 9-(E8), which contains the normal human CFTR intron 8-exon 9-intron 9 sequence flanked by the SMN exons 6 and 8, has been described by Wang et al. (8Wang H.Y. Wang I.F. Bose J. Shen C.K. Genomics. 2004; 83: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The (TG)12T7 sequence in the CFTR intron 8 of pSMN(E6)-CFTR 9-(E8) was changed to the patient genotype (TG)12T3 by site-direct mutagenesis, resulting in the derivative pSMN(E6)-CFTR 9-(E8)-T3. This T7 → T3 change facilitates the CFTR exon 9 skipping in the transfected cells (22Ayala Y.M. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression Vectors—The cDNA of TDP-43 (GenBank accession no. BC025544) was amplified from the mouse brain RNA and cloned into a pEF-based vector that contain an N-terminal FLAG tag (Invitrogen). The different domains of TDP-43 were deleted using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA of the wild-type Htra2-β1 (GenBank accession no. U61267), hnRNP G (GenBank accession no. Z23064), and Fyn-p59 (GenBank accession no. Z97989) were amplified from 293 cell RNAs and cloned into pEF-based vector that contains N-terminal FLAG tag or C-terminal Myc tag (Invitrogen). DNA Transfection and in Vivo Splicing Assay—293 cells (1 × 105 cells/60-mm-diameter culture plate) were cotransfected with different minigene reporter plasmids and expression plasmids by the calcium phosphate method. Total RNA was isolated 48 h after transfection using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis. cDNAs were then synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the Superscript II system (Invitrogen). To ensure amplification of plasmid-derived transcript, PCR was carried out using a vector-specific forward primer (pCI-Fwd, 5′-GGT GTC CAC TCC CAG TTC AA-3′) and SMN-specific reverse primer (SMN exon 8-Rev, 5′-GCC TCA CCA CCG TGC TGG-3′). The products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and quantitated using an Alpha Imager 2200 (Alpha Innotech Corporation). RNA Immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP)—293 cells without or with transfections (24 h after transfection) were collected and lysed in 500 μl of RNA-IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 10 units/ml RNAsin (Promega). The total lysate was incubated with 10μl of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science), incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) or anti-Myc (9E10, Roche Applied Science) antibodies at 4 °C for 3 h. Agarose beads (GE Healthcare) were added for further incubation of 1 h. The beads were washed five times, and the RNAs in the pull-downs were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 10% of the total lysate was processed in parallel to obtain the total input sample. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water, and 5 μl was used for RT-PCR analysis. The sequences of the primers are available upon request. For endogenous RNA-IP, antibodies against TDP-43 (rabbit polyclonal), hnRNP A1 (4B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (Chemicon), and RNA binding protein 4 (RBM4) (a kind gift from Dr. W.-Y. Tarn), respectively, were used instead of the anti-FLAG and anti-Myc. Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—293 cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40 with 1× protease inhibitor). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, precleaned with 50% protein A-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 4 °C, and then incubated with appropriate antibodies, e.g. anti-TDP-43, at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A-agarose beads were then added and incubated for another 1 h. The bound precipitates were washed five times and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies, e.g. anti-Htra2-β1 (S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For RNase treatment, RNase A (Sigma) was added to the lysate to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before the immunoprecipitation. Oligonucleotide Preparation by in Vitro Transcription—The method followed that described by Wyatt et al. (23Wyatt J.R. Chastain M. Puglisi J.D. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 764-769PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides corresponding to different regions of the wild-type and mutant SMN genes or CFTR genes were synthesized and annealed with a T7 promoter oligonucleotide, resulting in templates each having a double-stranded T7 promoter region and a single-stranded region that acted as a template for in vitro transcription. Using the biotinylated RNTP mix (Roche Applied Science) and T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), the in vitro transcription was performed at 37 °C for 4 h. After DNase digestion, the RNA transcripts were gel purified, precipitated, and quantified. The sequences of the different oligonucleotides are: T7 RNA pol, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′; ex 7 SMN1, 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCAAAGTCTGTTTTAGTTTTTCTTCCT-3′; ex 7 SMN2, 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCAAAATCTGTTTTAGTTTTTCTTCCT-3′; ex 6 SMN, 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCTATTAAGGGGGTGGTGGAGGGTATAC-3′; ex 7 SMN1 (SE2 MUT), 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCCCAAAGTCTGTTTTAGTTAATAATAAT-3′; 3 X SE2, 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCTTTCTTCCTTTTCTTCCTTTTCTTCCT-3′; (UG)12, 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCACACACACACACACACACACACAC-3′; tubulin, 5′-ATTATGCTGAGTGATATCAAGAGACATCCACCGTTTATACAAGGAGCACGGTAG-3′. In Vitro RNA-Protein Binding—293 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 2 μg of the expression plasmids pEF-FLAG-TDP-43, pEF-Myc-Htra2-β1, pEF-FLAG-hnRNP G, or pEF-FLAG-Fyn. The nuclear extracts were prepared 36 h after transfection and precleaned by incubation with 100 μl of streptavidin beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. 2.5 μg of the biotin-labeled RNA, prepared as described in the previous section, were reacted with 50 μl of streptavidin beads in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT supplemented with 10 units/ml RNAsin) for 1 h at 4 °C. These RNA oligonucleotide-conjugated beads were then incubated with the precleaned nuclear extract for 90 min at 4 °C with constant shaking. The bound fractions were washed five times with NET-2 buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and then analyzed by Western blotting. RNA Interference (RNAi) Assay—293 (1 × 105) cells/well were put on 6-well culture plates. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 50 pmol of duplex siRNAs (Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After another 48 h, the minigene reporter plasmids (1.0 μg/well) were transfected. Cells were collected 24 h after the second transfection for preparation of the total RNAs and total cellular proteins. For RNAi, the following RNA interference oligonucleotides (Ambion) were used: (sense strand) human TDP-43, 5′-GGUUGAAAUAUUGAGUGGU-3′; human Htra2-β1 (SFRS10), 5′-GGUCUUACAGUCGA GAUUA-3′; human hnRNP A1, 5′-CUACAAUG AUUUUGGGAAU-3′. Antibodies against TDP-43, Htra2-β1 (S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), hnRNP A1 (4B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and tubulin (Sig ma), respectively, were used to check the protein amounts before and after RNAi by Western blotting. TDP-43 Stimulated the Inclusion of Exon 7 during Splicing of SMN2 Pre-mRNA—To address the possible involvement of TDP-43 in SMN splicing, assays of the SMN2 exon 7-splicing in vivo were carried out by cotransfection experiments. The SMN minigenes used in the assay contained either SMN1 or SMN2 fragments from exons 6–8 cloned in the mammalian expression vector pCI (left maps, Fig. 1A). Expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged TDP-43 and Myc-tagged Htra2-β1, a RNA-binding protein known to cause exon 7 inclusion of SMN (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), were individually cotransfected with either pCI-SMN1 or pCI-SMN2. As shown by RT-PCR analysis, coexpression of TDP-43 did not change the splicing pattern of the SMN1 transcript containing exons 6/7/8 (compare lanes 1 and 2, left panel of Fig. 1B). For the SMN2 minigene, the splicing pattern resembled that of the endogenous SMN2 gene, with a more abundant level of the exon 7-skipped transcript (SMNΔ7) than the full-length one (FL-SMN) (lane 1 of the right panel of Fig. 1A and lane 3 of the left panel of Fig. 1B). Notably, coexpression of TDP-43 increased the relative amount of FL-SMN2 (lanes 2–5 of the right panel of Fig. 1A and lane 4 of the left panel of Fig. 1B). Thus, although TDP-43 has been known mainly as an exon-skipping factor (22Ayala Y.M. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Mercado P.A. Ayala Y.M. Romano M. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6000-6010Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it appeared to be an exon-inclusion factor for SMN splicing. Although the exon-inclusion effect of TDP-43 was not as high as that of Htra2-β1 (lanes 6–9, right panel of Fig. 1A and lane 5, left panel of Fig. 1B), the data of Fig. 1 provided the first evidence that, similar to the RNA-binding proteins such as Htra2-β1, SRp55, and SRp30c (25Jin W. Cote G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8901-8905Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Wang J. Gao L. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Andreadis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14230-14239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), TDP-43 also could play dual roles in alternative splicing. The functional requirement of the RRM domains for the enhancement of the SMN2 exon 7 inclusion by TDP-43 was assessed by cotransfection experiments. 293 cells were transfected with the pCI-SMN2 minigene along with the expression plasmids encoding FLAG-TDP-43 and its deletion mutants lacking the RRM1 or RRM2, respectively. As shown by the RT-PCR analysis of Fig. 2A, deletion of either RRM1 or RRM2 abolished the ability of TDP-43 to cause exon 7 inclusion of the SMN2 minigene transcript (compare lanes 2–4, middle panel of Fig. 2A). Both RRM1 and RRM2 were also required for the exon-skipping capability of TDP-43 to enhance exon skipping of the CFTR transcript (bottom panel, Fig. 2A), as initially demonstrated by Burrati and Barralle (6Buratti E. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36337-36343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). TDP-43 Interacted with the SMN Transcripts—In view of the above, we have examined whether TDP-43 is associated with the SMN transcripts by RNA-IP experiments. 293 cells were transfected with pEF-FLAG-TDP-43, pEF-Myc-Htra2-β1, pEF-FLAG-RBM4, pEF-FLAG-TDP-43 ΔRRM1, and pEF-FLAG-TDP-43 ΔRRM2, respectively. The total extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc, and the RNAs contained within the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B, similar to Myc-Htra2-β1 known to bind SMN RNA (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), FLAG-TDP-43 was bound to both FL-SMN and SMNΔ7 RNAs (lanes 3 and 4, top panel of Fig. 2B). However, FLAG-RBM4 could not bind these RNAs (lane 5, top panel of Fig. 2B). We have also used anti-TDP-43 to examine whether the endogenous TDP-43 interacted with the SMN transcripts. Indeed, TDP-43 as well as hnRNP A1, but not FMRP and RBM4, was bound to both FL-SMN and SMNΔ7 RNAs (middle panel of Fig. 2B). The RRM1, but not RRM2, was required for the TDP-43-SMN RNA interaction, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 2B. Taken together, the data of Fig. 2 demonstrated that both RRM domains are necessary for the splicing activities, exon inclusion as well exon skipping, of TDP-43, and that the two RRM motifs were differentially required for the binding of TDP-43 with the SMN transcripts. The AG-rich SE2 Element of the SMN Transcripts Was Required for TDP-43-stimulated Exon 7 Inclusion—To determine the region(s) of SMN RNA required for TDP-43 to enhance the exon 7 inclusion, we have adopted the splicing assay designed by Hofmann et al. (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis was carried out with RNAs isolated from cells transfected with SMN1 minigenes containing site-directed mutations within ESE in the SMN exon 7 (Fig. 3). Similar to that found by others in studies of the SMN exon 7 inclusion effect of Htra2-β1 (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), mutation in either SE1 or SE3 element of the ESE resulted in a decreased amount the full-length SMN transcript (compare lanes 1 and 5 with lane 7, Fig. 3), whereas the mutant SE2 minigene produced only the SMNΔ7 RNA (lane 3, Fig. 3). As with the wild-type SMN2 minigene, cotransfection of pEF-FLAG-TDP-43 with the SMN1 minigene containing the SE1 or SE3 mutation caused exon 7 inclusion (compare lanes 2 and 6 with lanes 1 and 5, respectively, Fig. 3). In contrast, overexpression of TDP-43 could not stimulate the generation of exon 7-containing transcript from cotransfected SMN1 minigene containing the disrupted AG-rich SE2 element (compare lane 4 with lane 3, Fig. 3). These data suggested that an intact SE2 element of ESE was needed for TDP-43 to promote the exon 7 inclusion of the SMN transcript. Previously, Htra2-β1 and hnRNP G have been shown to be positive regulators of the SMN exon 7 inclusion (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this property of Htra2-β1 correlated with its ability to bind to the intact, but not mutated, SE2 element (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In view of the similar requirement of SE2 for the SMN exon 7-inclusion activity of TDP-43 (Fig. 3), we have determined whether the TDP-43-SMN RNA interaction was also mediated through binding with the SE2 element. For this, an in vitro RNA-protein binding assay was carried out (Fig. 4). Biotinylated RNA fragments synthesized by in vitro transcription were incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from 293 cells transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-TDP-43, Myc-Htra2-β1, FLAG-hnRNP G, and FLAG-Fyn, respectively. Proteins associated with the biotin-labeled RNAs were pulled down by the streptavidin beads, washed, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG or anti-Myc as the probe. As shown in Fig. 4, consistent with the literature report (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann Y. Wirth B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Myc-Htra2-β1 bound specifically to the exon 7 of either SMN1 or SMN2 but not to exon 6 (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lane 3, second panel from top of Fig. 4). Furthermore, Myc-Htra2-β1 could not bind to the exon 7 of SMN1 containing mutated SE2 element (compare lane 4 with lane 1, second panel from top of Fig. 4). Interestingly, FLAG-hnRNP G behaved similarly to Myc-Htra2-β1(third panel from top, Fig. 4; see “Discussion”). FLAG-TDP-43 bound to all of the RNA oligonucleotides tested with approximately similar efficiencies, except for the (UG)12 oligonucleotide that was shown by Buratti et al. (2Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) to bind TDP-43 with high efficiency (compare lanes 1–5 and 7 with lane 6, top panel of Fig. 4). The data of the RNA oligonucleotide binding assay were consistent with the RNA-IP results of Fig. 2B. They further suggested that if complex formation between TDP-43 and the SMN transcripts was required for the protein to enhance exon 7 inclusion, no binding of TDP-43 to specific regions of the SMN RNA was involved. TDP-43 Interacted with Htra2-β1—Because both TDP-43 (Fig. 3) and Htra2-β1 (17Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) required an intact SE2 element to promote SMN exon 7 inclusion, we have examined whether there is an interaction between the two factors. Immunoprecipitation of the endogenous TDP-43 from 293 cell extract followed by Western blot analysis with anti-Htra2-β1 antibody as the probe showed that there was indeed an interaction between the two factors (compare lanes 1 and 2, Fig. 5A). Significantly, RNase treatment of the cell extract before immunoprecipitation abolished the anti-Htra2-β1 signal on the blot (lane 3, Fig. 5A), suggesting that the TDP-43–Htra2-β1 complex formation was augmented by the presence of RNA. Only full-length TDP-43 stimulated the SMN exon 7 inclusion, whereas the deletion mutants (ΔRRM1 and ΔRRM2) did not (Fig. 2A). We thus have examined whether the RRM domain-deletion mutants of TDP-43 could interact with Htra2-β1. For this, pCI-Myc-Htra2-β1 was cotransfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged TDP-43, TDP-43 ΔRRM1, and TDP-43 ΔRRM2, respectively, into 293 cells. As seen, both RRM1 and RRM2 were required for the interaction of TDP-43 with Htra2-β1 (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1, Fig. 5B).

https://openalex.org/W2012871310,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) produce numerous secondary metabolites with various therapeutic/antibiotic properties. Like fatty acid synthases (FAS), these enzymes are organized in modular assembly lines in which each module, made of conserved domains, incorporates a given monomer unit into the growing chain. Knowledge about domain or module interactions may enable reengineering of this assembly line enzymatic organization and open avenues for the design of new bioactive compounds with improved therapeutic properties. So far, little structural information has been available on how the domains interact and communicate. This may be because of inherent interdomain mobility hindering crystallization, or because crystallized molecules may not represent the active domain orientations. In solution, the large size and internal dynamics of multidomain fragments (>35 kilodaltons) make structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance a challenge and require advanced technologies. Here we present the solution structure of the apo-thiolation-thioesterase (T-TE) di-domain fragment of the Escherichia coli enterobactin synthetase EntF NRPS subunit. In the holoenzyme, the T domain carries the growing chain tethered to a 4'-phosphopantetheine whereas the TE domain catalyses hydrolysis and cyclization of the iron chelator enterobactin. The T-TE di-domain forms a compact but dynamic structure with a well-defined domain interface; the two active sites are at a suitable distance for substrate transfer from T to TE. We observe extensive interdomain and intradomain motions for well-defined regions and show that these are modulated by interactions with proteins that participate in the biosynthesis. The T-TE interaction described here provides a model for NRPS, PKS and FAS function in general as T-TE-like di-domains typically catalyse the last step in numerous assembly-line chain-termination machineries."
https://openalex.org/W2164398315,"Much of the genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC) in humans is unexplained. Studying a Caucasian-dominated population in the United States, we showed that germline allele-specific expression (ASE) of the gene encoding transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type I receptor, TGFBR1, is a quantitative trait that occurs in 10 to 20% of CRC patients and 1 to 3% of controls. ASE results in reduced expression of the gene, is dominantly inherited, segregates in families, and occurs in sporadic CRC cases. Although subtle, the reduction in constitutive TGFBR1 expression alters SMAD-mediated TGF-beta signaling. Two major TGFBR1 haplotypes are predominant among ASE cases, which suggests ancestral mutations, but causative germline changes have not been identified. Conservative estimates suggest that ASE confers a substantially increased risk of CRC (odds ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 29.1), but these estimates require confirmation and will probably show ethnic differences."

https://openalex.org/W2075947519,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS) found in bacteria, fungi and plants use two different types of thioesterases for the production of highly active biological compounds. Type I thioesterases (TEI) catalyse the release step from the assembly line of the final product where it is transported from one reaction centre to the next as a thioester linked to a 4'-phosphopantetheine (4'-PP) cofactor that is covalently attached to thiolation (T) domains. The second enzyme involved in the synthesis of these secondary metabolites, the type II thioesterase (TEII), is a crucial repair enzyme for the regeneration of functional 4'-PP cofactors of holo-T domains of NRPS and PKS systems. Mispriming of 4'-PP cofactors by acetyl- and short-chain acyl-residues interrupts the biosynthetic system. This repair reaction is very important, because roughly 80% of CoA, the precursor of the 4'-PP cofactor, is acetylated in bacteria. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of a type II thioesterase from Bacillus subtilis free and in complex with a T domain. Comparison with structures of TEI enzymes shows the basis for substrate selectivity and the different modes of interaction of TEII and TEI enzymes with T domains. Furthermore, we show that the TEII enzyme exists in several conformations of which only one is selected on interaction with its native substrate, a modified holo-T domain."
https://openalex.org/W1999278724,"Previous studies have established that phagocytes are key cells of the pulmonary innate immune defense against A. fumigatus, an opportunistic fungus responsible of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Macrophages detect A. fumigatus via Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and -4) and respond by the MyD88-NF-kappaB-dependent synthesis of inflammatory mediators. In the present study, we demonstrate that respiratory epithelial cells also sense A. fumigatus and participate in the host defense. Thus, the interaction of respiratory epithelial cells with germinating but not resting conidia of A. fumigatus results in interleukin (IL)-8 synthesis that is controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2. Using MyD88-dominant negative transfected cells, we also show that IL-8 production is not dependent on the TLR-MyD88 pathway, although the MyD88 pathway is activated by A. fumigatus and leads to NF-kappaB activation. Thus, our results provide evidence for the existence of two independent signaling pathways activated in respiratory epithelial cells by A. fumigatus, one that is MyD88-dependent and another that is My88-independent and involved in IL-8 synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2089244020,"Interaction of G-protein-coupled receptors with β-arrestins is an important step in receptor desensitization and in triggering “alternative” signals. By means of confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we have investigated the internalization of the human P2Y receptors 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 12 and their interaction with β-arrestin-1 and -2. Co-transfection of each individual P2Y receptor with β-arrestin-1-GFP or β-arrestin-2-YFP into HEK-293 cells and stimulation with the corresponding agonists resulted in a receptor-specific interaction pattern. The P2Y1 receptor stimulated with ADP strongly translocated β-arrestin-2-YFP, whereas only a slight translocation was observed for β-arrestin-1-GFP. The P2Y4 receptor exhibited equally strong translocation for β-arrestin-1-GFP and β-arrestin-2-YFP when stimulated with UTP. The P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptor internalized only when GRK2 was additionally co-transfected, but β-arrestin translocation was only visible for the P2Y6 and P2Y11 receptor. The P2Y2 receptor showed a β-arrestin translocation pattern that was dependent on the agonist used for stimulation. UTP translocated β-arrestin-1-GFP and β-arrestin-2-YFP equally well, whereas ATP translocated β-arrestin-1-GFP to a much lower extent than β-arrestin-2-YFP. The same agonist-dependent pattern was seen in fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments between the fluorescently labeled P2Y2 receptor and β-arrestins. Thus, the P2Y2 receptor would be classified as a class A receptor when stimulated with ATP or as a class B receptor when stimulated with UTP. The ligand-specific recruitment of β-arrestins by ATP and UTP stimulation of P2Y2 receptors was further found to result in differential stimulation of ERK phosphorylation. This suggests that the two different agonists induce distinct active states of this receptor that show differential interactions with β-arrestins. Interaction of G-protein-coupled receptors with β-arrestins is an important step in receptor desensitization and in triggering “alternative” signals.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 3The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GRK, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase; MRS2179, 2′-deoxy-N6-methyladenosine 3′,5′-bisphosphate; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. can be stimulated by diverse signals such as light, smell and taste, small molecules, peptides, and proteins. Their stimulation is transduced across the plasma membrane by conformational changes and leads to the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). This receptor signal is turned off by desensitization and internalization of GPCRs. These processes are triggered through receptor phosphorylation either by second messenger-activated kinases or by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (2Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation by GRKs leads to binding of β-arrestins to the receptors causing uncoupling from their G-proteins (3Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In recent years it has become evident that the recruitment of β-arrestins also leads to the activation of alternative signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling (4Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Differential affinities of GPCRs for β-arrestin-1 or -2 were first described by Oakley et al. (5Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) employing fluorescently tagged β-arrestins and the use of confocal microscopy. This work classified GPCRs as class A if the receptor bound β-arrestin-2 with higher affinity than β-arrestin-1, or class B receptors if β-arrestin-1 and -2 were bound with similar affinities. Although class A receptors are prone to rapid recycling to the plasma membrane, class B receptors often undergo endosomal degradation or slow recycling to the plasma membrane (6Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Because of this behavior and because β-arrestin-1 or -2 has been suggested to have differential effects in downstream signaling (6Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar), it has become important to know the potential β-arrestin binding profile of individual members of the GPCR family. Purine receptors are pharmacological targets in processes as diverse as platelet aggregation and treatment of cystic fibrosis (7Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 58-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 8Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Boeynaems J.M. Barnard E.A. Boyer J.L. Kennedy C. Knight G.E. Fumagalli M. Gachet C. Jacobson K.A. Weisman G.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 281-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). The P2Y receptor family is composed of currently eight members that are all GPCRs, termed P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, P2Y13, and P2Y14 (9von Kugelgen I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The first five members compose a subgroup that principally uses Gq/G11 to activate the phospholipase-β/1,4,5-myoinositol trisphosphate pathway, whereas the other three represent a second subgroup and almost exclusively couple to the Gi/o family of G-proteins (8Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Boeynaems J.M. Barnard E.A. Boyer J.L. Kennedy C. Knight G.E. Fumagalli M. Gachet C. Jacobson K.A. Weisman G.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 281-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Although in the recent past a lot has been learned about signaling and tissue distribution of P2Y family members (10Burnstock G. Knight G.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 240: 31-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), much less is known about their desensitization or internalization (11Mundell S.J. Jones M.L. Hardy A.R.

J. 2008; 409: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the internalization and β-arrestin translocation behavior of members of the P2Y receptor family. All receptors were individually fused at their C termini with various color variants of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and their internalization was monitored by confocal microscopy. For all receptors, we investigated the internalization and β-arrestin translocation behavior in an identical cellular background, thus allowing a comparison of individual receptor subtypes and a classification into classes A and B with respect to their β-arrestin interaction profiles. Materials—ADP, ATP, UDP, UTP, 2-methylthio-ADP hexokinase, poly-d-lysine, and glucose were purchased from Sigma. MRS2179 was purchased from Tocris (Northpoint, UK). Cell culture reagents were supplied from PAN-Biotech GmbH (Aidenbach, Germany). Effectene was purchased from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Lipofectamine-2000 was purchased from Invitrogen. 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were purchased form ECACC (Porton Down, Whiteshire, UK). The cDNA for the human P2Y1 receptor has been described previously (14Hoffmann C. Soltysiak K. West P.L. Jacobson K.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). cDNAs for human P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptors were purchased from the on-line cDNA Resource Center (University of Missouri-Rolla). All PCR primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotec GmbH (Ebersberg, Germany). Sequencing reactions were done by Eurofins Medigenomix GmbH (Martinsried, Germany). Rabbit polyclonal p44/42 MAPK antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Dianova. All other chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers at the highest purity grade available. Construction of P2Y Receptors Tagged with Fluorescent Proteins (XFP)—Each of the six P2Y receptors was fused to the enhanced variants of cyan (CFP) or yellow (YFP) fluorescent protein (Clontech) by the standard PCR extension overlap technique (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). In each case the C-terminal stop codon of the receptor and the initial codon for methionine of the fluorescent protein were deleted. Hence, no linker sequence exists between the receptor and the fluorescent protein. All resulting constructs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. β-Arrestin Constructs—Throughout all confocal microscopic analyses described in this study, we used bovine β-arrestin-1 fused C-terminally to enhanced GFP and bovine β-arrestin-2 fused C-terminally to enhanced YFP as described previously (16Krasel C. Bunemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). GFP and YFP were used to distinguish data from both subtypes easily by color. The selection of the fluorescent protein had no influence on the translocation behavior (data not shown). For measurements of FRET, we used bovine β-arrestin-1 or -2 fused to CFP or the cerulean variant (17Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) generated following procedures as described previously (16Krasel C. Bunemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells, COS-1 cells, and 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C, 7% CO2. All cells were routinely passaged every 2-3 days. Culture medium for cells stably expressing the P2Y2-YFP receptor was additionally supplemented with 200 μg/ml G-418. Characterization of Receptor Constructs—The P2Y receptor-XFP fusion constructs were functionally tested in cell types lacking the respective endogenous receptor measuring inositol phosphate production. For P2Y1 and P2Y6 receptor constructs, inositol phosphate production was determined in COS-1 cells. COS-1 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method and were assayed as described previously (14Hoffmann C. Soltysiak K. West P.L. Jacobson K.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 18Hoffmann C. Moro S. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14639-14647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To minimize contaminations of UTP, UDP was preincubated with hexokinase and glucose for 1 h; this method quantitatively converts contaminating UTP into UDP (19Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). The P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y11 receptor were determined in 1321N1 cells as described (19Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). 1321N1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine. The functionality of the P2Y12 receptor construct has been described previously (20Baurand A. Eckly A. Hechler B. Kauffenstein G. Galzi J.L. Cazenave J.P. Leon C. Gachet C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transfection of HEK-293 Cells for Microscopic Analysis—Individual 24-mm glass coverslips were placed in 6-well plates and coated for 30-60 min using 300 μl of poly-d-lysine (1 mg/ml). Poly-d-lysine was aspirated, and the glass coverslips were washed once with sterile phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+. HEK-293 cells were seeded onto these coverslips to result in ∼50% confluence. After attachment of the cells (4-6 h), cells were transfected using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following amounts of DNA were used per well: 300 ng for receptors, 200 ng for β-arrestins, 300 ng for dynamin Ia or DynK44A mutant (21Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and 200 ng for GRK2. All constructs were in pcDNA3, except dynamin and DynK44, which were in pCMV5 vector; the amount of DNA was adjusted using empty pcDNA3 vector. Medium was exchanged 12-16 h later, and cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. Confocal Microscopy—All confocal microscopy experiments were performed on a Leica TCS SP2 system. Coverslips with transfected HEK-293 cells were mounted using an “Attofluor” holder (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Images were taken with a 63× objective. CFP was excited with a 430 nm diode laser using a DCLP455 dichroic mirror. Fluorescence intensities were recorded from 470 to 550 nm. GFP was excited using the 488 nm line of an argon laser and a DCLP500 dichroic mirror. Fluorescence intensities were recorded from 500 to 550 nm. YFP was excited with the 514 nm line of the argon laser and a dual beam splitter 458/514 nm. Fluorescence intensities were recorded from 525 to 600 nm. Settings for recording images were kept constant: 512 × 512 pixel format, line average 4, 400 Hz, resulting in an image acquisition time of 7 s. Time series were recorded using the standard Leica software package (version 2.5). Pictures were taken at 1-min intervals. Quantification of β-arrestin translocation was done with the Leica software package (version 2.5.). Regions of interest were defined in the cytosol and quantified over the time recorded. Care was taken that slight movements of the cells did not result in misplacement of the defined region of interest either onto the membrane or into the nuclear region. To correct for possible photobleaching, control regions were defined that included whole cells and were used to correct the images in the cytosolic regions of interest. The resulting fluorescence intensity values were then normalized to the initial value and plotted against time to quantify β-arrestin translocation from the cytosol. Movies of the individual images were produced using ImageJ software (NIH Image software). Solely for display reasons, but not for quantitative analyses, individual images were corrected for auto-contrast using Photoshop software version 6.0. FRET Measurements—FRET was recorded between P2Y receptors tagged with YFP and bovine β-arrestin-1 tagged with cerulean or β-arrestin-2 tagged with CFP, respectively. The measurements were performed as described previously (16Krasel C. Bunemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells transfected as described above were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution and maintained in buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3) at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on an Attofluor holder and placed on a Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert135) equipped with an oil immersion 63× objective and a dual emission photometric system (Till Photonics). Samples were excited with light from a polychrome IV (Till Photonics). To minimize photobleaching, the illumination time was set to 10-40 ms, applied with a frequency of 10 Hz. The fluorescence signal was recorded from a single whole cell. FRET was monitored from the emission ratio of YFP to CFP, F535/F480 (emission intensities at 535 ± 15 and 480 ± 20 nm, beam splitter DCLP 505 nm), upon excitation at 436 ± 10 nm (beam splitter DCLP 460 nm). The YFP emission upon excitation at 480 nm was recorded at the beginning of each experiment to subtract direct excitation of YFP (YFP emission at 436 nm excitation/YFP emission at 480 nm excitation was 0.065). The emission ratio was corrected by the spillover of CFP into the 535 nm channel (spillover of YFP into the 480 nm channel was negligible) to give a corrected ratio F*535/F*480. To determine agonist-induced changes in FRET, cells were continuously superfused with buffer A, and agonist was applied using a computer-assisted solenoid valve controlled rapid superfusion device ALA-VM8 (ALA Scientific Instruments; solution exchange 5-10 ms). Signals detected by avalanche photodiodes were digitized using an AD converter (Digidata1322A, Axon Instruments) and stored using Clampex 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). Detection of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—ERK1/2 phosphorylation was assessed in serum-starved (0.5% for 24 h) HEK-293 cells stably expressing the P2Y2-YFP receptor at 80% confluence. 100 μm UTP or ATP (final concentration) was added for the indicated times, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was assessed by Western blotting with phosphor-ERK-specific antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody, Cell Signaling). Total ERK was quantified as a reference using a rabbit polyclonal p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling). Quantification was done by chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody (Dianova) and a chemiluminescence reader (FujiFilm LAS-1000). β-Arrestin Translocation in Control HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells have been described to express endogenously various P2Y receptors subtypes (10Burnstock G. Knight G.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2004; 240: 31-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 22Fischer W. Franke H. Groger-Arndt H. Illes P. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2005; 371: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first investigated whether these receptors would interfere with our study by inducing β-arrestin translocation to the cell surface. To do so, we investigated HEK-293 cells transfected with β-arrestin-1-GFP or β-arrestin-2-YFP by confocal microscopy. None of the four endogenous purine receptor agonists ADP, ATP, UDP, and UTP (100 μm) caused any change in the cytosolic localization of either β-arrestin (supplemental Fig. 1). From these experiments we conclude that endogenous purine receptors did not interfere with the following experiments. Receptor Internalization upon Agonist Stimulation—To study the internalization of P2Y receptors, we tagged each receptor at the C terminus with YFP. Similarly to the GFP-tagged P2Y12 receptor (20Baurand A. Eckly A. Hechler B. Kauffenstein G. Galzi J.L. Cazenave J.P. Leon C. Gachet C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), all receptors were functional with respect to downstream inositol phosphate signaling. In each case, the maximal responses to agonist stimulation were similar, and the EC50 values for agonist-induced inositol phosphate production were shifted less than 3-fold to higher agonist concentrations when compared with the corresponding wild-type receptors (data not shown). Receptor internalization was then studied by confocal microscopy of the YFP-tagged receptors transfected into HEK-293 cells. Pictures were taken prior to agonist stimulation and at 1-min intervals after addition of the respective specific agonist (100 μm final concentration). Fig. 1A shows the results for all P2Y receptor subtypes tested. Prior to agonist stimulation, clear membrane localization was observed for all receptor subtypes. Upon stimulation with the appropriate agonists the P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors rapidly internalized (supplemental movies 1-3), but no internalization was observed for the P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptors (supplemental movies 4-6). However, the latter three receptors all internalized when G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was co-transfected, as seen by the appearance of a distinct punctate pattern (Fig. 1B, right and supplemental movie 7-9). The membrane localization in the absence of agonist was unaffected by GRK2 (Fig. 1B, left). Specificity of the internalization was shown by the selectivity for the respective agonists. For example, we found internalization of the P2Y4 receptor in response to UTP (Fig. 1A), but not to ATP (not shown), which is an antagonist at this receptor (23Kennedy C. Qi A.D. Herold C.L. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 926-931PubMed Google Scholar, 24Herold C.L. Qi A.D. Harden T.K. Nicholas R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11456-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin Translocation Induced by the P2Y Receptor Subtypes—To test for receptor-induced β-arrestin translocation, we co-transfected each individual P2Y receptor and β-arrestin-2-YFP in HEK-293 cells. Fig. 2A (left panels) shows the cytosolic distribution of β-arrestin-2-YFP prior to agonist stimulation. Upon stimulation with the appropriate agonist, the P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors caused rapid translocation of β-arrestin-2-YFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). In contrast, for the P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptor, we did not observe any β-arrestin-2-YFP translocation (data not shown). To control for correct receptor expression, we used P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptors C-terminally tagged with CFP. Although the P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptors were clearly localized at the cell surface (Fig. 2A, right panels), they did not result in β-arrestin-2-YFP translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A, center panels). However, when GRK2 was co-transfected, there was some degree of β-arrestin-2-YFP translocation by the P2Y6 and P2Y11 but not the P2Y12 receptor (Fig. 2B). Similar experiments with β-arrestin-1-GFP showed modest translocation for the P2Y1 receptor and strong translocation for the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors. In contrast, for the P2Y6 and P2Y11 receptors, only slight translocation was observed, and this required that the cells were co-transfected with GRK2, and no translocation was seen for the P2Y12 receptor even when the cells were additionally co-transfected with GRK2 (supplemental Fig. 2). Specificity of the observed β-arrestin translocation was again demonstrated by the use of specific antagonists. For example, MRS2179, a selective antagonist for the P2Y1 receptor (9von Kugelgen I. Pharmacol. Ther. 2006; 110: 415-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 25Camaioni E. Boyer J.L. Mohanram A. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), effectively and in a concentration-dependent manner blocked the ADP-mediated β-arrestin translocation by the P2Y1 receptor (supplemental Fig. 3). Quantification of β-Arrestin Translocation—A quantitative analysis of β-arrestin-1 and -2 translocation induced by the various P2Y receptors is presented in Fig. 3. According to the classification suggested by Oakley et al. (5Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar), GPCRs are classified as class A when they induce stronger translocation for β-arrestin-2 than for β-arrestin-1, and as class B when β-arrestin-2 and -1 translocation are similar. According to the results shown in Fig. 3, using the indicated nucleotide as the stimulus, the P2Y1, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors can be classified as class A, whereas the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors would be classified as class B. The P2Y12 receptor did not translocate either β-arrestin in our experiments and therefore cannot be classified. Dynamin-dependent Receptor Internalization—Because receptor internalization has been described to often be dependent on clathrin and dynamin (26Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), we decided to study the internalization of the P2Y receptor family with respect to dynamin dependence. YFP-tagged P2Y receptors were co-transfected with either rat dynamin 1a or a dominant negative dynamin mutant Dyn-K44A (21Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and studied for ligand-induced receptor internalization. In control experiments, co-transfection with dynamin 1a did not have negative effects on receptor internalization but rather seemed to enhance internalization (data not shown). Co-expression of P2Y receptors, GRK-2 when needed, and Dyn-K44A blocked receptor internalization for all P2Y receptors except the P2Y2 receptor (Fig. 4). Both ATP- and UTP-induced P2Y2 receptor internalization was unaffected by co-expression of Dyn-K44A mutant (data not shown). Differential Effects of the Two Endogenous P2Y2 Receptor Ligands—The P2Y2 receptor is a special receptor because it has two endogenous ligands of equal potency, ATP and UTP (19Nicholas R.A. Watt W.C. Lazarowski E.R. Li Q. Harden K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 224-229PubMed Google Scholar). This allowed an investigation of the question whether endogenous ligands might differ in their ability to induce specific translocation of β-arrestins. Thus, analogous experiments were performed using 100 μm ATP, and quantitatively analyzed and compared with the results obtained with UTP (Fig. 5). ATP stimulation of the P2Y2 receptor caused statistically significantly greater translocation of β-arrestin-1-GFP than of β-arrestin-2-YFP; in contrast, translocation was identical for the two β-arrestins when using UTP (Fig. 5A). When maximal translocation (15 min) was grouped according to the respective β-arrestin, UTP had significantly greater effects for β-arrestin-1-GFP (p < 0.01) but smaller effects for β-arrestin-2-YFP (p < 0.05; Fig. 5B). To confirm this ligand/β-arrestin selectivity with another approach, we performed FRET measurements between β-arrestins labeled with the CFP-like cerulean protein and YFP-labeled receptors. This approach has been utilized and validated previously for the β2-adrenergic receptor (16Krasel C. Bunemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It detects an increase in FRET between cerulean and YFP, when receptor and β-arrestin interact. A P2Y2-YFP construct and a β-arrestin-1-cerulean construct were expressed in HEK-293 cells, and FRET was measured in individual cells, which were stimulated alternating between 100 μm ATP and UTP (Fig. 5C). It can be seen that in the case of β-arrestin-1, ATP caused a smaller increase in FRET than was observed upon stimulation of the same cell with UTP. The contrary was true for β-arrestin-2; here, ATP caused larger changes in FRET than UTP (Fig. 5C, right panel). Therefore, these data confirm our findings, shown in Fig. 5B, of preferential interactions of the P2Y2 receptor with β-arrestin-1 and -2 induced by ATP and UTP, respectively. To analyze the potential consequences of such ligand-dependent β-arrestin interaction, we studied receptor-mediated ERK phosphorylation, a pathway that is known to be partially β-arrestin-mediated (6Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Because no selective radioligand for the P2Y2 receptor is currently available to confirm receptor expression, we decided to generate a stable cell line using the P2Y2-YFP receptor. Cells stably expressing the receptor construct were prepared for the experiments as described above and stimulated with ATP and UTP and analyzed for ligand-dependent ERK phosphorylation. Control experiments using nontransfected HEK-293 cells showed no ATP- or UTP-induced ERK-phosphorylation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5D, cells expressing the P2Y2 receptor stimulated with ATP or UTP showed clear ERK phosphorylation. ATP and UTP exhibited a different time profile for receptor-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Although UTP exhibited a transient p-ERK signal, with a peak at 10 min, ATP showed prolonged ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). Our study shows that the receptor internalization and β-arrestin translocation profiles of the various P2Y receptor subtypes are markedly different. All of these receptors internalized in an agonist-dependent manner, but some of them required co-expression with GRK2. All P2Y receptors also showed some degree of interaction with β-arrestins, again in several cases only after co-transfection of GRK2. The most interesting finding is the observations that different endogenous agonists for the P2Y2 receptor have distinct effects on the β-arrestin translocation and interaction profile. All six P2Y receptor subtypes investigated in this study were found to internalize upon agonist stimulation. Although the P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors internalized in normal HEK-293 cells (Fig. 1A), the P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptors required co-transfection of GRK2 for internalization (Fig. 1B). Agonist-dependent internalization has already been described for P2Y1 (12Mundell S.J. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Conley P.B. Poole A.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 11939-11948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the P2Y6 receptor has been described as slowly desensitizing (34Robaye B. Boeynaems J.M. Communi D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 329: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and resistant to internalization (33Brinson A.E. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11939-11948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas the P2Y11 receptors has been shown to internalize only as heterodimer with the P2Y1 receptor, but not alone (13Ecke D. Hanck T. Tulapurkar M.E. Schafer R. Kassack M. Stricker R. Reiser G. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conflicting data describe internalization of P2Y12 receptors as either very modest (20Baurand A. Eckly A. Hechler B. Kauffenstein G. Galzi J.L. Cazenave J.P. Leon C. Gachet C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or quite pronounced (12Mundell S.J. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Conley P.B. Poole A.W. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Hardy A.R. Conley P.B. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Poole A.W. Mundell S.J. Blood. 2005; 105: 3552-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The latter data may be explained by our observation that effective internalization of these receptors required co-expression of GRK2 (Fig. 1B). Divergent kinases have been implicated in the internalization process, including calmodulin-dependent kinase II (30Tulapurkar M.E. Zundorf G. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), PKCα- and δ-isoforms (11Mundell S.J. Jones M.L. Hardy A.R. Barton J.F. Beaucourt S.M. Conley P.B. Poole A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1132-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and GRK2 and -6, whereas other reports suggest that GRK2, GRK6 PKC, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II were not involved (12Mundell S.J. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Conley P.B. Poole A.W. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Hardy A.R. Conley P.B. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Poole A.W. Mundell S.J.

Stimulation of P2Y12 receptors was recently reported to recruit β-arrestin-1 and -2 into lipid rafts (39Savi P. Zachayus J.L. Delesque-Touchard N. Labouret C. Herve C. Uzabiaga M.F. Pereillo J.M. Culouscou J.M. Bono F. Ferrara P. Herbert J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11069-11074Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and to translocate β-arrestin-1-GFP to the cell surface (12Mundell S.J. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Conley P.B. Poole A.W. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, no β-arrestin-1-GFP translocation was observed for the P2Y1 (12Mundell S.J. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Conley P.B. Poole A.W. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our data contrast with these findings. As shown in Fig. 3 and supplemental Figs. 2 and 3, the P2Y1 receptor did translocate β-arrestin-1-GFP in an agonist-dependent and specific manner, but to a much lower extent than β-arrestin-2-YFP; this classifies the P2Y1 receptor as a class A receptor. For the P2Y12 receptor, we failed to observe β-arrestin translocation by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 2), but we were able to detect a direct, agonist-dependent interaction of the P2Y12-YFP receptor and β-arrestin-2-CFP by FRET (supplemental Fig. 5). This suggests that FRET is a more sensitive method to discover such receptor/β-arrestin interactions. For all other P2Y receptor subtypes included in this study, β-arrestin translocation was demonstrated by means of confocal microscopy, permitting a classification as either class A or class B. These experiments revealed that the P2Y1, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors can be classified as class A receptors, whereas the P2Y4 receptor can be classified as a class B receptor. To further investigate the mechanism of receptor internalization, we tested the involved pathway by co-expressing a dominant negative dynamin variant Dyn-K44A. This mutant has been described to block the dynamin-dependent internalization pathway (21Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, we observed dynamin-dependent receptor internalization in case of the P2Y1,4,6,11,12 receptor, whereas the P2Y2 receptor internalization was found to be independent of dynamin. The data for P2Y1 and P2Y12 are consistent with previous data (12Mundell S.J. Luo J. Benovic J.L. Conley P.B. Poole A.W. Traffic. 2006; 7: 1420-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the P2Y2 receptor would employ an alternative dynamin-independent internalization pathway (27Mayor S. Pagano R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the rat P2Y2 receptor has been described to co-localize with clathrin (30Tulapurkar M.E. Zundorf G. Reiser G. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which may imply that the rat and human receptor may be differently regulated. The most interesting finding of our study is the differential β-arrestin translocation pattern that was observed for the P2Y2 receptor. As shown in Fig. 5, UTP translocated β-arrestin-1 and -2 to the same extent, which would classify the P2Y2 receptor as class B. In contrast, ATP is much weaker in translocating β-arrestin-1 than β-arrestin-2, thus classifying the receptor as class A. The same differential pattern was found when we investigated the direct interaction between receptors and β-arrestins with FRET (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, a ligand-mediated differential signaling behavior was observed when we investigated ERK phosphorylation as the major signaling pathway, which is triggered by β-arrestins (6Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The ATP-induced ERK phosphorylation was prolonged compared with the transient stimulation induced by UTP (Fig. 5D), and it would nicely match the time pattern that has been described for β-arrestin-mediated ERK phosphorylation (6Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). This ligand-dependent regulation of ERK phosphorylation mediated by the human P2Y2 receptor not been described previously. Therefore, we conclude that we have found the first differential agonist behavior of ATP and UTP at the P2Y2 receptor. Classical receptor theory is based on the simple concept that receptors switch between an “off” and an “on” state and that agonists induce the on state. However, recent evidence along several lines suggests that this concept is insufficient and that there may be multiple agonist-induced “active” conformations (40Kenakin T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 41Galandrin S. Oligny-Longpre G. Bouvier M. Trends Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 2008; 153: 358-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on several lines of evidence, including differential agonist-specific changes in fluorescently labeled β2-adrenergic receptors (43Kobilka B.K. Deupi X. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2007; 28: 397-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), differential switching kinetics of partial versus full agonists (44Nikolaev V.O. Hoffmann C. Bunemann M. Lohse M.J. Vilardaga J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24506-24511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and agonist-selective signaling of receptors to G-proteins versus β-arrestins (28Drake M.T.

Endocrinol. 2008; 286: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our data are the first to suggest that such selective signaling can occur with different endogenous agonists for a single receptor. They further show that agonist selectivity may not only be found in G-protein versus β-arrestin signaling but also in β-arrestin-1 versus -2 interaction, leading to classification as class A versus class B. In summary, all six P2Y receptors investigated in this study internalized upon agonist stimulation. Although the P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors readily internalized in HEK-293 cells, the P2Y6, P2Y11, and P2Y12 receptors required co-expression of GRK2 for internalization. All receptors interacted with β-arrestin-2, and this interaction showed the same GRK2 dependence as receptor internalization. According to their arrestin interaction profile, the P2Y1, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors were classified as class A receptors, whereas the P2Y4 receptor was classified as a class B receptor. The P2Y12 receptor could not be classified, but interaction with β-arrestin-2 was demonstrated by FRET. Most importantly, the P2Y2 receptor exhibited an agonist-dependent β-arrestin translocation profile. Upon stimulation with ATP, this would be classified as class A, whereas stimulation with UTP would classify the receptor as class B. This suggests that the two agonists induced different active conformations of the P2Y2 receptor, which behaved differently with respect to β-arrestin recruitment and ERK phosphorylation. Such differences in response to two different endogenous agonists represent a new example of fine-tuning in receptor signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2042542670,"PTX3 (prototypic long pentraxin 3) is a fluid phase pattern recognition receptor, which plays nonredundant roles in the resistance against diverse pathogens, in the assembly of a hyaluronic acid-rich extracellular matrix, and in female fertility. Inflammatory signals induce production of PTX3 in diverse cell types, including myeloid dendritic cells (DC), fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (EC). The present study was designed to explore the effect of glucocorticoid hormones (GC) on PTX3 production in different cellular contexts. In myeloid DC, GC inhibited the PTX3 production. In contrast, in fibroblasts and EC, GC alone induced and, under inflammatory conditions, enhanced and extended PTX3 production. In vivo administration of GC augmented the blood levels of PTX3 in mice and humans. Moreover, patients with Cushing syndrome had increased levels of circulating PTX3, whereas PTX3 levels were decreased in subjects affected by iatrogenic hypocortisolism. In nonhematopoietic cells, GC receptor (GR) functioned as a ligand-dependent transcription factor (dimerization-dependent) to induce PTX3 gene expression. In contrast, in hematopoietic cells, GR repressed PTX3 gene transcription by interfering (dimerization-independent) with the action of other signaling pathways, probably NFkappaB and AP-1. Thus, divergent effects of GC were found to be due to different GR mechanisms. The results presented here indicate that GC have divergent effects on PTX3 production in hematopoietic (DC and macrophages) and nonhematopoietic (fibroblasts and EC) cells. The divergent effects of GC on PTX3 production probably reflect the different functions of this multifunctional molecule in innate immunity and in the construction of the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2128198109,"Renal tubulo-interstitial inflammation is frequently associated with polyuria and urine concentration defects. This led us to investigate the effects of the major pro-inflammatory nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway on aquaporin 2 (AQP2) expression by the collecting duct. Using immortalized collecting duct principal cells (mpkCCDcl4), we found that, acting independently of vasopressin, activation of NF-κBby lipopolysaccharide (LPS) decreased AQP2 mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner but did not decrease AQP2 mRNA stability. Consistently, constitutively active IκB kinase β decreased AQP2 expression. The LPS-induced decrease in AQP2 mRNA levels was confirmed in rat kidney slices and was reproduced both under conditions of elevated cAMP concentration and V2 receptor antagonism. Computer analysis of the AQP2 promoter revealed two putative κB elements. Mutation of either κB element abolished the LPS-induced decrease of luciferase activity in cells expressing AQP2 promoter-luciferase plasmid constructs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that LPS challenge decreased p65, increased p50 and p52, and had no effect on RelB and c-Rel binding to κB elements of the AQP2 promoter. RNA-mediated interference silencing of p65, p50, and p52 confirmed controlled AQP2 transcription by these NF-κB subunits. We additionally found that hypertonicity activated NF-κB in mpkCCDcl4 cells, an effect that may counteract the Tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP)-dependent increase in AQP2 gene transcription. Taken together, these findings indicate that NF-κB is an important physiological regulator of AQP2 transcription.

RNA-mediated interference silencing of p65, p50, and p52 confirmed controlled AQP2 transcription by these NF-κB subunits. We additionally found that hypertonicity activated NF-κB in mpkCCDcl4 cells, an effect that may counteract the Tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP)-dependent increase in AQP2 gene transcription. Taken together, these findings indicate that NF-κB is an important physiological regulator of AQP2 transcription.

Generally, dimers that contain p65 or c-Rel are transcriptional activators, whereas p50 and p52 homodimers act as repressors. The differential dimerization that occurs between NF-κB family members allows for cell-specific transcriptional modulation of target genes in response to a large number of stimuli. This accounts for the role played by NF-κB in the expressional regulation of genes involved in numerous physiological functions including the immune and inflammatory response, environmental stress response, cell survival, cell growth, proliferation and cycling, and neuronal signaling (14Gerondakis S. Grossmann M. Nakamura Y. Pohl T. Grumont R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6888-6895Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar). Rel-homology domain is also involved in NF-κB interaction with the family of IκB inhibitory proteins that prevent NF-κB from translocating to the nucleus. In the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, activation of IκB kinases (IKK), predominantly by IKKβ, leads to phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation of IκB (predominately IκBα), allowing translocation of released NF-κB (mostly p50-p65 and p50-c-Rel dimers) to the nucleus and transcriptional activation of target genes (15Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: 81-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar).Renal tubulo-interstitial inflammation is frequently associated with polyuria and urinary concentration defects (16Husted R.F.

Computer-assisted analysis of the first 2 kilobases of the AQP2 promoter revealed two putative κB binding elements. Taken together these observations may suggest that tubulo-interstitial inflammation leads to activation of NF-κB in CD principal cells and, thus, down-regulation of AQP2 expression. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the effects of altered NF-κB activity on AQP2 transcription. Results revealed that LPS treatment of cultured mouse CD principal cells or rat kidney slices decreased both basal and cAMP-stimulated AQP2 expression. Combined silencing of NF-κB subunits, site-directed mutagenesis of the AQP2 promoter, and the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that reduced AQP2 transcription under conditions of elevated NF-κB activity is largely mediated by decreased p65 and increased p50 and p52 binding to κB elements of the AQP2 promoter. These observations highlight the importance of down-regulated transcriptional AQP2 activity in the physiological control of AQP2 expression and suggest a role for AQP2 in polyuria associated with renal tubulo-interstitial diseases.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—mpkCCDcl4 or mCCDcl1 cells (passages 22–34) were seeded on permeable filters (Transwell®, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown in culture medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (11Hasler U.

Cells were grown to confluence and then in serum- and hormone-free medium for 48 h before performing experiments. Iso-osmotic medium (300 mosmol/kg) was made hypertonic (400 or 500 mosmol/kg) by replacing a fraction of apical and basal medium (75–150 μl/600 μl of apical medium and 150–300 μl/1200 μl of basal medium) with NaCl-enriched medium.

Both kidneys were removed, cut into 2–3-mm-thick slices using a razor blade, and quickly placed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 4 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm sodium Citrate, 6 mm d-glucose, 6 mm l-alanine, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 3 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4) at 37 °C equilibrated with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Slices 0.5-mm in thickness were cut with a Stadie-Riggs microtome (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) as previously described (27Breton S. Brown D. J. Am. Soc.

The slices (3 slices/experimental condition) were then incubated in Hanks' balanced solution at 37 °C for 6 h alone or in the presence of various stimuli. Bathing solutions were continuously bubbled and changed every 2 h. The slices were then placed overnight at 4 °C in RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). The following day, 25 mg of cortical tissue was excised, snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground with a mortar and pestle. The tissue powder was then homogenized, and total RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacture's instructions.Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of total cell lysate was performed as previously described (11Hasler U.

Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), nucleotides –517 to +109 of the mouse AQP2 gene in front of luciferase using pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI), nucleotides –2043 to +109 of the mouse AQP2 gene in front of luciferase using pGL3-Basic, mutant AQP2 promoter constructs made by changing TGGAA of TonE to TTTAA, mutant κB constructs made by changing GGGAGTTCCT of the κB binding site located at –666 to GCCAGTTCCT, and/or changing GGGGTTTTCC of the κB binding site located at –2030 to GCCGTTTTCC. The numbering was based on the genomic sequence from NCBI. We confirmed the transcription start site by primer extension and ribonuclease protection assay (data not shown). Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The light produced was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as previously described (32Ryser S. Fujita T. Tortola S. Piuz I. Schlegel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5075-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, after stimulation, cells were rapidly fixed in ice-cold cross-linking solution (1% formaldehyde, 9 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm HEPES, pH 8) before cell lysis (0.5% Non-idet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm Tris, pH 8). Nuclei were then isolated by centrifugation, lysed (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm Tris, pH 8), and pelleted chromatin was resuspended (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) before fragmentation (<1 kilobase) by sonication. For immunoprecipitation, chromatin extracts (100 μg) were precleared for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and salmon sperm DNA in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-p65, anti-p50, or anti-52 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Reversal of cross-link was achieved by overnight incubation at 65 °C with proteinase K and 1% SDS. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Real-time PCR was performed as described above. Primers flanking the κB site of the AQP2 promoter located 2030 bp upstream of the start codon were 5′-TCACCAAAGGTCACTCAGGA-3′ and 5′-ATCAAGATTGGGCCTTGATG-3′, and those flanking the κB site of the AQP2 promoter located 666 bp upstream of the start codon were 5′-AAGTTGACCTTGGTGACTCTATCA-3′ and 5′-GGAAGAGGATGGAAAACAACT-3′. Primers flanking the κB sites of the IκBα promoter were 5′-GCTTCTCAGTGGAGGACGAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCTGAAACATGGCTGT-3′.Statistics—Results are given as the mean ± S.E. from n independent experiments. Each experiment was performed on mpkCCDcl4 cells from the same passage. Statistical differences were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of two groups or more, respectively. A p value <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSNF-κB Decreases AQP2 Transcription—We first analyzed the effects of increased NF-κB activity on AQP2 expression by stimulating mpkCCDcl4 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli (O55:B5; Calbiochem). As previously described (5Hasler U. Nielsen S. Feraille E. Martin P.Y. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 10–10 m AVP increased AQP2 mRNA expression by 30-fold after 24 h of stimulation. LPS decreased AQP2 mRNA expression in both a dose- and time-dependent manner with a maximal effect achieved at 10 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 1A) after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 1B). The extent of decreased AQP2 mRNA expression induced by LPS was similar in the presence or absence of AVP. To determine whether down-regulated AQP2 mRNA expression in response to LPS was due to decreased AQP2 gene transcription or to decreased AQP2 mRNA stability, mpkCCDcl4 cells were incubated or not with 100 ng/ml LPS for 3 or 5 h in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 1C). As previously reported (11Hasler U. Vinciguerra M. Vandewalle A. Martin P.-Y. Feraille E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) AQP2 mRNA expression was reduced in cells treated with actinomycin D alone. Unexpectedly, whereas LPS had no effect on actinomycin d-induced IκBα mRNA degradation, it increased AQP2 mRNA stability (Fig. 1C), indicating that reduced AQP2 mRNA expression induced by LPS is not due to altered AQP2 mRNA stability. Western blot analysis revealed that reduced AQP2 mRNA expression after LPS stimulation was accompanied by reduced AQP2 protein expression (Fig. 1D). We have previously shown that long term (≥24 h) exposure of mpkCCDcl4 cells to hypertonic (≥350 mosmol/kg) medium increases AQP2 expression (11Hasler U. Vinciguerra M. Vandewalle A. Martin P.-Y. Feraille E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Enhanced AQP2 mRNA expression after 24 h of hypertonic (≥500 mosmol/kg) challenge (11Hasler U. Vinciguerra M. Vandewalle A. Martin P.-Y. Feraille E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was reduced to a similar extent in non-stimulated cells and in AVP-treated cells after 24 h of LPS stimulation (Fig. 2A). We compared our observations made in mpkCCDcl4 cells to those obtained in a recently established, physiologically relevant mouse cortical collecting duct cell line, mCCDcl1 (22Gaeggeler H.P. Gonzalez-Rodriguez E. Jaeger N.F. Loffing-Cueni D. Norregaard R. Loffing J. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 878-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Similar to mpkCCDcl4 cells, LPS reduced AQP2 mRNA expression to similar extents in non-stimulated and AVP- or hypertonic-challenged mCCDcl1 cells (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2LPS decreases both AVP-induced and hypertonicity-enhanced AQP2 expression in cultured collecting duct cells. Cultured mpkCCDcl4 (A) or mCCDcl1 (B) cells were preincubated 24 h or not with either 10–10 m AVP or hypertonic (NaCl, 500 mosmol/kg) medium and were then stimulated for an additional 24 h with 100 ng/ml LPS before RNA extraction.

In agreement with results obtained in cultured cells, 100 ng/ml LPS alone significantly decreased AQP2 mRNA levels after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 3A, 0.78 ± 0.11 as compared with control tissue standardized to 1). AQP2 expression was reduced by the addition of 10–6 m of the V2 receptor antagonist SR121463B alone (0.76 ± 0.06). Reduced levels of AQP2 mRNA expression, however, were greatest in tissue incubated with both LPS and SR121463B (0.56 ± 0.08). Conversely, increased AQP2 mRNA expression induced by 10–3 m 8-bromo-cAMP (3.43 ± 0.89) was reduced in tissue simultaneously incubated with 8-bromo-cAMP and LPS (2.12 ± 0.48). LPS was found to induce a similar increase of interleukin-1β mRNA expression when applied alone or together with SR121463B or 8-bromo-cAMP indicating that NF-κB activation by LPS was similar under all three conditions (Fig. 3B).FIGURE 3LPS decreases AQP2 expression independently of the V2 receptor and intracellular cAMP in rat kidney. Wistar rat kidney slices were incubated for 6 h in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml LPS with or without 10–6 m SR121463B (SR) or 10–3 m 8-bromo-cAMP before mRNA extraction.

Moreover, our results suggest that the effect of LPS is at least partly independent of V2 receptor activity.Characterization of Two κB Binding Elements Located in the AQP2 Promoter—Because LPS is a potent activator of the so-called classical NF-κB pathway, which relies on activation of IKKβ, we assessed the effect of overexpression of a constitutively active IKKβ mutant on AQP2 expression levels by mpkCCDcl4 cells. Cells transfected with constitutively active IKKβ mutant expressed significantly less AQP2 mRNA as compared with cells transfected with eGFP, and LPS did not further reduce AQP2 expression in cells expressing mutant IKKβ (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that decreased AQP2 transcription after LPS treatment at least partly relies on increased NF-κB activity.FIGURE 4Two κB binding elements located in the AQP2 promoter mediate the decrease of AQP2 transcriptional activity in response to NF-κB activation. A, cells transfected with an expression plasmid that contained either eGFP or constitutively active IKKβ and were stimulated or not for 3 h with 100 ng/ml LPS before RNA extraction. Real-time PCR was performed using primers specific for AQP2. Results are expressed relative to control values determined in cells transfected with eGFP-containing plasmid in the absence of LPS.

PMEPA1 protein is a NEDD4 (ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase)-binding protein, which negatively regulates prostate cancer cell growth. In this study we establish that PMEPA1 is a direct transcriptional target of the androgen receptor (AR). We also demonstrate that PMEPA1 negatively regulates AR protein levels in different cell culture models. Transient expression of PMEPA1 down-regulates AR protein levels and AR transcriptional targets in prostate cancer cells. Conversely, knockdown of PMEPA1 leads to elevated levels of AR protein, AR transcriptional targets (prostate-specific antigen), and increased cell cycle S phase. We define that the PMEPA1-dependent down-regulation of AR is because of AR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. The mutant PMEPA1 (PY1/2 motif mutation) that is impaired in NEDD4 recruitment shows attenuated AR ubiquitination and AR protein down-regulation. These data support the hypothesis that PMEPA1 negatively regulates the stability of AR protein by enhancing AR ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation through NEDD4. The effect of PMEPA1 on AR ubiquitination and degradation appears to be MDM2-independent. Thus, the PMEPA1-AR degradation pathway may represent a new androgen-dependent mechanism for regulating AR levels in prostate epithelial cells. These findings underscore that the decreased PMEPA1 expression frequently noted in prostate cancers may lead to increased AR functions and strengthen the biological role of PMEPA1 in prostate cancers.

AR dysfunctions may contribute to benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer (CaP) (1Richter E. Srivastava S. Dobi A.

Both non-nuclear and nuclear functions of AR have been described in prostate cancer cells (2Dehm S.M. Tindall D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 12: 2855-2863Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The mechanism of nuclear function of AR involves translocation of the dihydrotestosterone-bound AR to the nucleus, where it binds to AR-responsive elements (AREs) of target genes and regulates their transcription. AR transcriptional targets such as PSA, NKX3.1, ODC1, AMD1, CDK1–2, etc. carry out many of the downstream cellular functions of AR such as cell growth and differentiation in a context-specific manner (4Nieto M. Finn S. Loda M. Hahn W.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 1562-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Wu C.T. Altuwaijri S. Ricke W.A. Huang S.P. Yeh S. Zhang C. Niu Y. Tsai M.Y.

Although the physiologic functions of PSA are involved in reproductive biology, PSA is a marker of luminal epithelial cell differentiation in the prostate, and higher serum PSA levels have been instrumental in the early detection of prostate cancer (6Thompson I.M. Ankerst D.P. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 2007; 176: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). NKX3.1, a prostate cancer suppressor gene, is involved in prostate development and differentiation, and loss of NKX3.1 contributes to the development of pre-neoplastic stages of prostate cancer (7Shen M.M.

In animal models it was shown that Nkx3.1 plays an important role in blocking prostate cancer initiation by PTEN loss (9Lei Q. Jiao J. Xin L. Chang C.J. Wang S. Gao J. Gleave M.E. Witte O.N. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 367-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because androgen-dependent AR signaling plays key roles in the growth and differentiation of the prostate gland, tight control of AR signaling may be critical in maintaining the homeostasis of the prostate gland (4Nieto M.

Absence of physiologic levels of testosterone leads to degeneration of the prostate gland (11Wu C.P. Gu F.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1991; 370: 249-255PubMed Google Scholar). In clinical practice, androgen ablation is the cornerstone for the treatment of advanced CaP (12Mostaghel E.A. Montgomery R.B. Lin D.W. Curr. Urol. Rep. 2007; 8: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Abnormal functions of AR, such as functional activation because of mutations, amplification, and cross-talk with other pro-cancer signaling pathways, are increasingly recognized in prostate cancer development and progression (13Debes J.D.

Although AR protein synthesis has been extensively studied, only a few studies have addressed how AR protein turnover is regulated (16Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 17Lee D.K. Chang C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 4043-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These studies show that in LNCaP cells that harbor T877A mutant AR, the half-life of AR is around 3 h. In contrast, in the androgen-independent LNCaP-C4-2 cells and CWR-R1 cells, the half-life of AR is between 6 and 12 h (18Gregory C.W. Johnson Jr., R.T. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2892-2898PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that AR is stabilized by S26 proteasome inhibitor MG-132, suggesting that AR is targeted for degradation to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (19Sheflin L. Keegan B. Zhang W. Spaulding S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, down-regulation of AR by proteasome degradation occurs during prostate cancer cell mitosis (15Litvinov I.V. Vander Griend D.J. Antony L. Dalrymple S. De Marzo A.M. Drake C.G. Isaacs J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15085-15090Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).E3 ligases catalyze the ubiquitination of proteins. The abundance and specificity of the currently identified E3 ligases suggest that these molecules play central roles in determining the specificity of ubiquitination (20Crosetto N. Bienko M. Dikic I. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There are four classes of proteins with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity as follows: the HECT domain proteins (homology to E6-AP C terminus), U-box proteins, PHD finger-type, and RING finger ligases. The RING finger-containing proteins such as BRCA-1, Snurf-1, and ARA54 associate with AR and modulate AR activity (21Kang Z. Pirskanen A. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol.

Moreover, MDM2 has been shown to form a complex with Akt and AR, promoting phosphorylation-dependent AR ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (16Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This pathway requires the intact RING domain of MDM2 to function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase (16Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C.

Genomics. 1997; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Nedd4 is a HECT domain-containing protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity harboring three WW domains composed of two highly conserved tryptophan residues with binding preference for proline-rich sequences (PPXY) known as the PY motif (29Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Baraldi E. Schultz J. Sudol M. Saraste M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). NEDD4 (isoform 1) may also function as an oncogene by reducing cytoplasmic levels of PTEN in cancer cells (10Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Cell. 2007; 128: 141-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NEDD4 plays a direct role in reducing the levels of RNA polymerase II during cellular damage responses (31Anindya R. Aygun O. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, NEDD4-interacting proteins may play significant roles in controlling the availability of NEDD4 in cancer cells.PMEPA1 is a NEDD4-binding protein that was originally identified by our laboratory as a prostate-abundant, highly androgen-induced gene and was mapped to chromosome 20q13 (32Xu L.L. Shanmugam N. Segawa T. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Genomics. 2000; 66: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33Xu L.L. Shi Y. Petrovics G. Sun C. Makarem M. Zhang W. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Sun L. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4299-4304PubMed Google Scholar). Human PMEPA1 exhibits amino acid homology to the mouse Nedd4-binding protein Nedd4BP (33Xu L.L. Shi Y. Petrovics G. Sun C. Makarem M. Zhang W. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Sun L. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4299-4304PubMed Google Scholar). PMEPA1 protein has two PY motifs (PPPY and PPTY), which are required for binding to WW domains of NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase (34Jolliffe C.N. Harvey K.F. Haines B.P. Parasivam G. Kumar S. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We reported a decrease or loss of PMEPA1 mRNA expression in the tumor specimens of 62% of prostate cancer patients (33Xu L.L. Shi Y. Petrovics G. Sun C. Makarem M. Zhang W. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Sun L. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4299-4304PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of PMEPA1 in prostate cancer cell lines exhibits cell growth inhibitory functions (33Xu L.L. Shi Y. Petrovics G. Sun C. Makarem M. Zhang W. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Sun L. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4299-4304PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that PMEPA1 is a transforming growth factor-β-induced gene and a marker of terminal colonocyte differentiation (35Brunschwig E.B. Wilson K. Mack D. Dawson D. Lawrence E. Willson J.K. Lu S. Nosrati A. Rerko R.M. Swinler S. Beard L. Lutterbaugh J.D. Willis J. Platzer P. Markowitz S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1568-1575PubMed Google Scholar). By using the combination of in silico and experimental approaches, we have defined androgen-responsive elements within the PMEPA1 promoter upstream sequences (36Masuda K. Werner T. Maheshwari S. Frisch M. Oh S. Petrovics G. May K. Srikantan V. Srivastava S. Dobi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that DNA methylation may contribute to the down-regulation of PMEPA1 expression in prostate cancer cell culture models (44Richter E. Masuda K. Cook C. Ehrich M. Tadese A.Y. Li H. Owusu A. Srivastava S. Dobi A. Epigenetics. 2007; 2: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Taken together, accumulating data suggest that PMEPA1 is an androgen-inducible negative regulator of prostate cancer cell growth. The observation that PMEPA1 is an androgen-regulated gene together with the regulatory functions of AR in prostate cancer led us to investigate whether PMEPA1 is involved in the regulation of AR protein turnover, through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.In this study, we show that PMEPA1 is a direct AR transcriptional target and that PMEPA1 protein interacts with and mediates the down-regulation of AR protein. The down-regulation of AR is mediated by enhanced AR ubiquitination and degradation. Our findings also reveal a new MDM2-independent mechanism of AR ubiquitination and degradation pathway linked to the NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Thus, AR and PMEPA1 form a feedback loop, and frequent loss of PMEPA1 expression noted in prostate tumors (33Xu L.L. Shi Y. Petrovics G. Sun C. Makarem M. Zhang W. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Sun L.

PCR primer sequences are as follows: to amplify the –2134 distal PMEPA1 ARE between positions –2251 and –2068, forward 5′-CCCTGGCACATCTAGGGTTA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGGACTGCCAGCACTCATAG-3′; PMEPA1 ARE –230 proximal between positions –284 and –156, forward 5′-CAGGGAGGGGAGGTCTCTTA-3′ and reverse 5′-TCAAAAGGGGTATGAGCAGG-3′; PMEPA1 core promoter between +81 and +199, forward 5′-AACTGAAGGCGGACAGTCTC-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCTGAGGAGCACAAGGTCC-3′; PMEPA1 low affinity ARE –629 between –721 and –493, forward 5′-TCACTTCCCAAATTCCAGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCACACAGTGGTGGAGCC-3′ primers were used.RESULTSAndrogen Receptor Activates PMEPA1—We have reported earlier that PMEPA1 was among the highly induced genes in the androgen-regulated transcriptome of LNCaP cells (32Xu L.L. Shanmugam N. Segawa T. Sesterhenn I.A. McLeod D.G. Moul J.W. Srivastava S. Genomics. 2000; 66: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Here we show a dose-dependent induction of the PMEPA1 protein in response to androgen (R1881) treatment of LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A). To further define if PMEPA1 induction is AR-dependent, we provide evidence that endogenous PMEPA1 protein is up-regulated by ectopic expression of AR in COS-7 cells that do not express endogenous AR (16Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 18Gregory C.W. Johnson Jr., R.T. Mohler J.L. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2892-2898PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To establish AR as the direct transcriptional regulator of PMEPA1, we monitored the synthetic androgen, R1881, dose-dependent transcriptional activation of PMEPA1 relative to the expression levels in LNCaP cells grown in the absence of R1881 (Fig. 1C). Also, we monitored recruitment of AR to high affinity binding sites (–2134 and –230 relative to the transcription initiation site of PMEPA1) previously defined both by model prediction and by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1D) (36Masuda K. Werner T. Maheshwari S. Frisch M. Oh S. Petrovics G. May K. Srikantan V. Srivastava S. Dobi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 763-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As a control, we compared AR recruitment to a low affinity AR-binding site (position –629) predicted by single matrix match. In semi-quantitative ChIP assays, androgen-dependent binding of AR to the PMEPA1 cognate sequences were highest in 1–3 nm R1881-treated LNCaP cells. Histone H3 acetylation and RNA polymerase II recruitment to these sites also peaked at the same R1881 concentration. Importantly, recruitment of AR, RNA polymerase II, histone H3 acetylation, and PMEPA1 expression were observed 24 h after R1881 induction at the same time point. These experiments suggest that PMEPA1 is a direct transcriptional target of AR, and androgen induction of the PMEPA1 mRNA is consistent with the expression of PMEPA1 protein.PMEPA1 Protein Binds to and Down-regulates AR Protein—To investigate the functions of PMEPA1 protein, we assessed interactions between PMEPA1 and AR. We generated a Tet-Off inducible PMEPA1-GFP-expressing LNCaP cell line. Using the anti-AR antibody 441 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA), we demonstrate that Tet-Off-induced PMEPA1 protein interacts with endogenous AR protein in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A). These data support the hypothesis that PMEPA1 protein physically binds to the AR protein. When PMEPA1 expression was induced in this Tet-Off-PMEPA-LNCaP cell line, dramatic reduction in the AR protein levels was observed (Fig. 2B). In contrast, p27, a known E3 ligase-binding protein and proteasome target, did not show significant degradation in the presence of PMEPA1. This result suggests the selectivity of PMEPA1 for its target such as AR. Additionally, LNCaP cells with constitutive PMEPA1 overexpression also showed significant reduction of the newly synthesized AR as well as AR targets such as PSA (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2AR binds to PMEPA1 and PMEPA1 down-regulates AR protein. LNCaP-PMEPA1-GFP-tet stable transfectants, expressing PMEPA1-GFP fusion protein in response to tetracycline withdrawal (Tet-Off), were cultured in medium containing 2 μg/ml of tetracycline (+). PMEPA1-GFP expression was induced by changing to tetracycline-free media (–). AR, PMEPA1, PMEPA1-GFP (60 kDa), p27 (27 kDa), PSA (28 kDa), PSMA (100 kDa), and tubulin (58 kDa) proteins were detected by immunoblot assay. A, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with either anti-AR monoclonal antibody (441) or by normal mouse IgG and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-AR polyclonal antibody (N-20) or by anti-PMEPA1 monoclonal antibody 2A12. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse TrueBlot-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were used to visualize the proteins. B, LNCaP-PMEPA1-GFP (Tet-Off system) cells were cultured with or without tetracycline for 10 days. Thirty μg of the cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot assay with anti-AR (441), anti-GFP, anti-p27, and anti-tubulin antibodies. C, stable PMEPA1 expressing LNCaP cells were grown in hormone-depleted media (cFBS) for 5 days followed by the addition of 10 nm of R1881 and were incubated for 0, 12, or 24 h. Thirty μg of cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)AR, PSA, and Cell Cycle S Phase Are Increased in Response to PMEPA1 Expression Knockdown—Our earlier studies showed that ectopic expression of PMEPA1 in prostate cancer cell lines inhibited cell proliferation (34Jolliffe C.N.

IntroductionIn eukaryotes, DNA double strand break (DSB) 4The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; HR, homologous recombination; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GST, glutathione S-transferase. repair is essential for maintaining genetic stability. The major pathway of DSB repair in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is homologous recombination (HR), and the evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in this process are encoded by members of the RAD52 epistasis group, including RAD50, RAD51, RAD52, RAD54, RAD55, RAD57, RAD59, RDH54/TID1, RFA1, MRE11, and XRS2 (1Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, most DSBs are eliminated by the synthesis-dependent strand annealing pathway of HR (2Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step of this pathway involves resection of the ends at the DSB to produce a pair of 3′-single-stranded tails. Subsequently, one of these single-stranded tails invades an intact homologous double-stranded DNA sequence to produce a D-loop. DNA polymerase extends the invading end, hence acquiring DNA information that is complementary to the noninvading end. At this stage, the invading strand is dissociated from the invaded duplex and anneals to the noninvading end of the break. Repair is completed when the break is sealed via additional DNA synthesis and ligation.In vitro it has been shown that Rad51 can catalyze the DNA strand invasion reaction via a filamentous intermediate called the presynaptic filament (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Krejci L. Van K.S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The efficiency of this reaction is dependent on several accessory factors, including the heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (3Sung P.

A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). RPA minimizes intramolecular secondary structure in the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that would otherwise impede presynaptic filament assembly. Paradoxically, if an amount of RPA sufficient to saturate the ssDNA is added to the in vitro recombination reaction prior to or together with Rad51, it strongly inhibits strand invasion by limiting access of Rad51 to the ssDNA (1Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 8Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and cytological studies have also shown that RPA excludes Rad51 from the HR substrate (9Gasior S.L. Wong A.K. Kora Y. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K.

The inhibitory effect of RPA on the assembly of the Rad51 presynaptic filament is overcome by recombination mediator proteins, including S. cerevisiae Rad52, the Rad55-Rad57 complex, and the tumor suppressor BRCA2 (1Symington L.S.

Among the recombination mediator proteins, the mediator function is best understood for S. cerevisiae Rad52, which interacts with Rad51, RPA, and also ssDNA (1Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Krejci L. Van K.S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar).The analysis of HR proteins fused with GFP by fluorescence microscopy has revealed that they form repair centers at damaged DNA (19Lisby M. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments using chromatin immunoprecipitation or GFP-tagged proteins coupled with cytological analysis have demonstrated the temporal order of recruitment of the HR proteins to DSBs (10Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 11Wolner B. Van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 118: 699-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Specifically, the first HR factor to arrive at the DSB is the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex. Next, when the decision has been made to repair the DSB by HR, the ends at the break are resected, and the resulting single-stranded DNA tails become covered by RPA. Subsequently, Rad52 and then Rad51 and others are recruited to the DSB, with the concomitant exit of RPA. Upon successful repair of the DSB, the repair center is dissolved.Rad52 plays a central role in the assembly of the DNA repair center via its ability to recruit Rad51 and downstream HR factors. However, the signal that triggers the assembly of the Rad52-containing DNA repair centers is unknown. In the present study, we provide evidence that recruitment of Rad52 to a DNA lesion requires direct interaction with RPA via an acidic domain in the middle region of Rad52. Accordingly, alanine substitution mutations in this domain result in strains that fail to repair DNA damage by HR and display reduced HR rates. Based on our observations, we propose a model to explain the mechanism of the mediator function of Rad52.MATERIALS AND METHODSGenetic Methods, Strains, and Plasmids—All media were prepared as described previously (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) with minor modifications, since the synthetic medium contains twice the amount of leucine (60 mg/liter). Standard genetic techniques were used to manipulate yeast strains (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), and transformations were performed according to Ref. 21Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar. All strains are derivatives of W303 (22Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar), except that they are RAD5 and are listed in Table S1. RAD52 mutants fused to YFP were constructed using the cloning-free PCR-based allele replacement method previously described (23Erdeniz N. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 1174-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Primers for constructing rad52-Δ287-YFP and rad52-Δ307-YFP are listed in Table S2. Strains expressing the remaining Rad52 truncation YFP fusion proteins have been described previously (25Plate I. Albertsen L. Lisby M. Hallwyl S.C. Feng Q. Seong C. Rothstein R. Sung P. Mortensen U.H. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli Rosetta strain (Novagen) was used to express Rad52-GST fusion proteins.Vectors, expressing C-terminally YFP-tagged Rad52 species containing alanine substitution mutations, were derivatives of the CEN-based plasmid, pWJ1213 (26Feng Q. During L. de Mayolo A.A. Lettier G. Lisby M. Erdeniz N. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), harboring RAD52 fused to YFP and a HIS3 marker for selection. Specifically, the polylinker of pWJ1213 was removed by a blunt end ligation of ends obtained by cutting pWJ1213 with SacI, followed by removal of the 3′-overhang by T4 polymerase and with XmaI, where the 5′-overhang was filled in by T4 polymerase, to produce the plasmid pWJ1213-ΔXmaI-SacI. Next, the plasmid pRad52-9ala-yfp was made by inserting a fusion PCR fragment containing the rad52 mutations D299A/S300A, S304A/D305A/D306A, and Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A as well as silent point mutations, which create novel (unique) XbaI and PacI sites flanking the mutated RAD52 region, into the BbvCI-SphI vector fragment of pWJ1213-ΔXmaI-SacI. The plasmids pRad52-2ala-yfp, pRad52-3ala-yfp, and pRad52-4ala-yfp, harboring the mutations D299A/S300A, S304A/D305A/D306A, and Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A, respectively, were made by annealing pairs of oligonucleotides (see Table S2) containing the desired mutations directly into the XbaI-PacI vector fragment of pRad52-9ala-yfp. The 2 μm-based pYESS10Rad51 contains RAD51 under the control of the GAL1/10 promoter and URA3 for selection (27Jiang H. Xie Y. Houston P. Stemke-Hale K. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33181-33186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). pET-11d-RAD52-Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A-His6 was made from pET-11d-RAD52-His6 (37Seong C.

Plasmids pGEX-GST-Rad52-(169–327) and pGEX-GST-Rad52-(260–327) were made by inserting a BglII/BamHI fragment of RAD52 encoding residues 169–327 and a PCR fragment encoding residues 260–327 into BamHI-digested pGEX-2T, respectively. Stop codons were introduced into the RAD52 portion of the pGEX-GST-Rad52-(169–327) plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis as described above to generate two additional plasmids, pGEX-GST-Rad52-(169–260) and pGEX-GST-Rad52-(169–221), expressing GST fused to the Rad52 fragments 169–260 and 169–221. The two-hybrid plasmids pGBD-RAD51, pGBD-RAD52, and pGAD-Rad52 were kind gifts from R. Rothstein. The two-hybrid plasmids encoding fusion of Rfa1 (pSLH223), Rfa2 (pRB3), and Rfa3 (pRB5) to the Gal4 DNA binding domain were kind gifts from P. Berg (28Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Massey P. Banerjee R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4400-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The rad52-Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A mutation was introduced into pGAD-Rad52 by replacing a BglII-NdeI fragment in pGAD-Rad52 with the corresponding fragment from pRad52-4ala-yfp to produce pGAD-Rad52-Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A.Viability after γ-Irradiation and Exposure to Methyl Methanesulfonate (MMS)—γ-Irradiation was performed as previously described (29Mortensen U.H. Erdeniz N. Feng Q. Rothstein R. Genetics. 2002; 161: 549-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the γ-cell irradiator at the Radiation Research Department at Risø National Laboratory (Roskilde, Denmark). MMS (M4016 from Sigma) sensitivity was assayed by incubating cells for 0, 10, or 20 min in 0.5% MMS according to the method described by Prakash and Prakash (30Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures intended for γ-irradiation and cultures treated with MMS were spotted as 10-fold serial dilutions on YPD plates or, in the case of strains transformed with a plasmid, on the proper selective medium. Viability of strains was evaluated after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C.Epifluorescence Microscopy and Quantification of Focus Formation—Strains were grown in SC medium or, for strains transformed with a plasmid, in the SC medium variant that provided the proper selection to maintain the plasmid. In addition, galactose (2%) was used as the sole carbon source in Rad51 overexpression experiments. Cells were grown at 23 °C in 3-ml cultures to an A600 of 0.3. Cultures were either evaluated for the presence of foci directly (spontaneous foci) or after 15 min of exposure to 0.5% methyl methanesulfonate (MMS-induced foci). In the latter experiments, cells were washed twice with water, resuspended in the appropriate medium, and incubated at 23 °C for 30 min prior to epifluorescence microscopy. For all microscopy, cells were immobilized on a glass slide by mixing cells with a 37 °C solution of 1.2% (w/v) low melting agarose (NuSieve 3:1 from FMC) containing the appropriate medium. Live cell images were captured with a cooled Evolution QEi monochrome digital camera (Media Cybernetics Inc.) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse E1000 camera (Nikon). Images were captured using a Plan-Fluor ×100, 1.30 numerical aperture objective lens. The illumination source was a 103-watt mercury arc lamp (Osram, Germany). The fluorophore YFP was visualized using a band pass YFP filter (EX500/20, DM515, BA520 combination filter; Nikon). Exposure time for Rad52-YFP was 1.5 s with a 12.5% neutral density (ND8) filter in place to reduce photobleaching. For each field of cells, 9–11 fluorescent images were obtained at 0.4-μm intervals along the z axis to allow inspection of all focal planes of each cell. Small and large budded cells were defined as cells where the daughter cell was either less or more than 30% of the mother cell, respectively. Cells where the nucleus was located in the bud neck were considered large budded cells. “No budded cells” were cells that either did not have a bud or cells that were still together but where the two nuclei were fully separated. For each cell type, at least 150 cells were examined to quantitate the percentage of cells containing at least one focus in that particular population of cells.Determination of Spontaneous and Induced Mitotic Recombination Rates—Spontaneous intergenic mitotic HR between leu2-ΔEcoRI and leu2-ΔBstEII heteroalleles was measured in diploid strains as previously described (31Smith J. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmids encoding Rad52 derivatives were individually transformed into the E. coli Rosetta strain. Expression of Rad52 species was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and His6-tagged Rad52 species were purified to near homogeneity as described previously (32Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).DNA Binding Assay—The ability of Rad52 species to bind single-stranded DNA was evaluated using the oligonucleotide, 80-mer, and to bind double-stranded DNA by using a substrate obtained by annealing two 40-mer oligonucleotides (see Table S2). The oligonucleotides for the DNA binding assay were purified from a 15% polyacrylamide gel, as described previously (33Trujillo K.M. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). 80-mer and 40-mer oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Varying amounts of Rad52 or Rad52-Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A (29–450 nm) protein were incubated with 32P-labeled 40-mer (10 nm nucleotides) and 80-mer (10 nm nucleotides) at 37 °C in 10 μl of buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min. In the control experiment, the reaction mixture was deproteinized with 0.5% SDS and 500 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 5 min to release Rad52-bound DNA. The reaction mixtures (6 μl) were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C using 10% native polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer. Dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging.GST Pull-down Assay—RPA (7 μg) was preincubated with ϕX174 ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) in 29 μl of buffer P (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Igepal) at 37 °C for 10 min before the addition of 1 μl of GST-tagged Rad52 fragment (7 μg). Following a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the reactions were mixed with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose-4B beads and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the beads twice with 150 μl of buffer P, the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 3% SDS. A 10-μl sample of the supernatants, wash samples, and SDS eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Proteins were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue.Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The assay was performed as described by Bendixen et al. (34Bendixen C. Gangloff S. Rothstein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1778-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), using the method of Rose and Botstein (35Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) to quantitate β-galactosidase activity. Total protein concentration for each extract was determined by using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) to allow calculation of the specific β-galactosidase activity. At least three trials were performed to determine the β-galactosidase activity for each protein-protein interaction. For each value, background obtained from the empty plasmid, pGBD, in combination with either pGAD-Rad52 or pGAD-Rad52-Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A was subtracted. Student's t test was used to evaluate whether two values were significantly different.DNA Strand Exchange Reaction—In the standard reaction, Rad51 (10 μm) was incubated with ssDNA (30 μm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer R (35 mm K-MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm ATP, and 3 mm MgCl2) for 5 min at 37 °C. After the addition of RPA (1.2 μm) in 0.5 μl, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for another 5 min before the incorporation of double-stranded DNA (30 μm nucleotides) in 1 μl and 1 μl of 50 mm spermidine hydrochloride. After 100 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 1% SDS containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. The deproteinized samples (12 μl) were run in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer, stained with ethidium bromide for 30 min, and then destained for at least 4 h in a large volume of water. Images were recorded in a NucleoTech Gel documentation system and analyzed with the software provided. To examine recombination mediator activity, reaction mixtures containing Rad51 and RPA with or without the indicated amount of Rad52 or Rad52-Q308A/D309A/D310A/D311A were incubated on ice for 10 min before ϕX ssDNA was added. Following a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, linear double-stranded DNA and spermidine were incorporated. The reaction mixtures were incubated and analyzed as above. In the time course experiments, the reaction mixtures were scaled up accordingly, and 6-μl portions of these mixtures were withdrawn for analysis, as above.RESULTSIdentification of a Rad52 Region Required for DNA Repair Center Formation—An important aspect of Rad52 in recombinational repair is its recruitment to a repair focus at damaged DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle (19Lisby M. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 24Lisby M. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8276-8282Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). To understand this process, we have used a mutational strategy to identify the Rad52 domain required for its recruitment to DNA repair centers (Fig. 1). We have previously observed that a C-terminally truncated Rad52-YFP fusion protein, Rad52-Δ237-YFP, enters the nucleus (25Plate I. Albertsen L. Lisby M. Hallwyl S.C. Feng Q. Seong C. Rothstein R. Sung P. Mortensen U.H. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Visual inspection of a strain expressing this Rad52 species by fluorescence microscopy revealed that it rarely forms spontaneous or MMS-induced Rad52 repair foci (Fig. 2, A and B). Using Rad52-Δ237-YFP as a starting point for locating the region in Rad52 required for its recruitment to a repair focus, we initially constructed four additional mutant strains expressing YFP-tagged C-terminally truncated Rad52 species, of which the largest species terminates at residue 327 (Δ327) (see Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Identification of truncated Rad52 mutants unable to form MMS-induced repair foci.

The percentage of cells that contains at least one focus was determined, and the results are presented in a histogram for three different cell types. Gray bars, unbudded cells; blue bars, small budded cells; purple bars, large budded cells. B, quantification of the ability of rad52 mutant strains to form MMS-induced foci.

Interestingly, the percentage of cells containing spontaneous and MMS-induced foci is generally higher in rad52-Δ327-YFP strains compared with wild-type strains (Fig. 2, A and B), and the Rad51 interaction domain (36Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and a newly discovered DNA binding domain residing in the C terminus of Rad52 (37Seong C. Sehorn M.G. Plate I.

Chem. 2008; 283: 12166-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are apparently not important for DNA repair focus formation. In contrast, when strains expressing Rad52 species terminating at amino acid 237, 267, 287, or 307 were analyzed, cells containing mutant Rad52 protein foci were rarely observed after MMS treatment (Fig. 2, B and C). In fact, for each of the other rad52 truncation mutant strains, the percentage of cells with foci is reduced more than 10-fold compared with wild type, irrespective of the cell cycle stage investigated. In agreement with this, it has recently been reported that a C-terminal Rad52 truncation terminating at residue 284 does not form foci (38Thorpe P.H. Marrero V.A. Savitzky M.H. Sunjevaric I. Freeman T.C. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3752-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Strains that express C-terminally truncated Rad52 species terminating at residues in the range of 169–327 have previously been shown to be MMS-sensitive. However, the MMS sensitivity of these strains, except the one expressing a Rad52 species terminating at amino acid 169, can be fully or partially suppressed by Rad51 overexpression (36Milne G.T. Weaver D.T. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1755-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 39Asleson E.N. Okagaki R.J. Livingston D.M. Genetics. 1999; 153: 681-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, it was shown that the rad52-Δ292 and rad52-Δ327 truncation mutations are both efficiently suppressed. In this light, it is unexpected that we find that rad52-Δ327-YFP, but not rad52-Δ307-YFP strains, form foci, and it raises the question of whether the YFP moiety of Rad52-Δ307-YFP impairs one or more of the remaining Rad52 functions in this truncated Rad52 species. However, this possibility is eliminated by our finding that the γ-ray and MMS sensitivity of rad52-Δ307-YFP can also be suppressed by overexpression of Rad51 (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1). At first glance, this result implies that Rad52 repair focus formation may not be a necessary prerequisite for MMS damage repair. However, when MMS-treated rad52-Δ307-YFP cells overexpressing Rad51 were visually inspected, a high number of Rad52 foci were observed (Fig. 3B). Together, these results indicate that the region between or close to residues 307 and 327 is required for efficient Rad52 focus formation, but that this function can be compensated by the overexpression of Rad51.FIGURE 3Effects of Rad51 overexpression in rad52 truncation mutants. A, overexpression of Rad51 suppresses the γ-ray sensitivity of rad52-Δ327-YFP and rad52-Δ307-YFP strains. Strains transformed with a Rad51 overexpression plasmid (+Rad51 ↑) or empty vector (-) were spotted as serial 10-fold dilutions on SC-Ura plates containing galactose and irradiated with the indicated dose. Pictures were captured after 2 days of incubation. B, overexpression of Rad51 leads to formation of MMS-induced Rad52 foci in rad52-Δ307-YFP strains. Strains RAD52-YFP and rad52-Δ307-YFP transformed with a Rad51 overexpression plasmid (+Rad51 ↑) or the corresponding empty plasmid (-) were quantified for focus formation. The percentage of cells containing at least one focus was determined, and the results are presented in a histogram for three different cell types.

The EphA4 receptor plays important roles in the inhibition of the regeneration of injured axons, synaptic plasticity, platelet aggregation, and likely in certain types of cancer. Here we report the first crystal structure of the EphA4 ligand-binding domain, which adopts the same jellyroll β-sandwich architecture as shown previously for EphB2 and EphB4. The similarity with EphB receptors is high in the core β-stranded regions, whereas large variations exist in the loops, particularly the D-E and J-K loops, which form the high affinity ephrin binding channel. We also used isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, and computational docking to characterize the binding to EphA4 of two small molecules, 4- and 5-(2,5 dimethyl-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid which antagonize ephrin-induced effects in EphA4-expressing cells. We show that the two molecules bind to the EphA4 ligand-binding domain with Kd values of 20.4 and 26.4 μm, respectively. NMR heteronuclear single quantum coherence titrations revealed that upon binding, both molecules significantly perturb EphA4 residues Ile31-Met32 in the D-E loop, Gln43 in the E β-strand, and Ile131-Gly132 in the J-K loop. Molecular docking shows that they can occupy a cavity in the high affinity ephrin binding channel of EphA4 in a similar manner, by interacting mainly with the EphA4 residues in the E strand and D-E and J-K loops. However, many of the interactions observed in Eph receptor-ephrin complexes are absent, which is consistent with the small size of the two molecules and may account for their relatively weak binding affinity. Thus, our studies provide the first published structure of the ligand-binding domain of an EphA receptor of the A subclass. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the high affinity ephrin binding channel of the Eph receptors is amenable to targeting with small molecule antagonists and suggest avenues for further optimization.

Eph receptors and their ligands are both anchored onto the plasma membrane and are subdivided into two subclasses (A and B) based on their sequence conservation and binding preferences. Usually, EphA receptors (EphA1-A10) interact with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored ephrin-A ligands (ephrin-A1-A6), whereas EphB receptors (EphB1-B6) interact with transmembrane ephrin-B ligands (ephrin-B1-B3) that have a short cytoplasmic portion carrying both Src homology domain 2 and PDZ domain-binding motifs (7Cowan C.A. Henkemeyer M. Nature. 2001; 413: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24714-24720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Eph receptors have a modular structure, consisting of a unique N-terminal ephrin-binding domain followed by a cysteine-rich linker and two fibronectin type III repeats in the extracellular region. The intracellular region is composed of a conserved tyrosine kinase domain, a C-terminal sterile α-domain, and a PDZ-binding motif. The N-terminal 180-residue globular domain of the Eph receptors has been shown to be sufficient for high affinity ephrin binding (9Himanen J.P. Henkemeyer M. Nikolov D.B.

EphA subclass receptors remarkably differ from EphB receptors because they lack a 4-residue insert in the H-I loop of the ligand-binding domain. Previously, the structures of the EphB2 and EphB4 ligand-binding domains have been determined in both the free state and in complex with ephrins or peptide antagonists (10Himanen J.P. Saha N.

These studies have shown that the ligand-binding domains of EphB2 and EphB4 adopt the same jellyroll β-sandwich architecture composed of 11 antiparallel β-strands connected by loops of various lengths. In particular, the D-E and J-K loops have been revealed to play a critical role by forming the high affinity Eph-ephrin binding channel. Interactions between Eph receptors and ephrins initiate bidirectional signals that direct pattern formation and morphogenetic processes, such as axon growth, cell assembly and migration, and angiogenesis (1Adams R.H.

The roles of Eph receptors and ephrins in bone remodeling, immune function, blood clotting, and stem cells are also starting to be characterized. In general, although interactions between the Eph receptors and ephrins of the same subclass are quite promiscuous, interactions between subclasses are relatively rare. However, EphA4 is a receptor capable of interacting with ephrins of both subclasses to generate a diverse spectrum of biological activities (16Pasquale E.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 417-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Klein R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi Y. Pasquale E.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 288-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). EphA4 has important functions in the developing and adult nervous system and is expressed in brain regions characterized by extensive synaptic remodeling (19Bourgin C. Murai K.K. Richter M. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1295-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Richter M. Murai K.K. Bourgin C. Pak D.T. Pasquale E.B. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 14205-14215Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the adult, EphA4 is particularly enriched in the hippocampus and cortex, two brain structures important for learning and memory processes. Although EphA4 interacts with ephrin-A ligands to mediate a variety of critical biological processes, such as inhibiting integrin downstream signaling pathways (19Bourgin C. Murai K.K. Richter M. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1295-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and modulating sensory and motor projections (21Gallarda B.W. Bonanomi D. Müller D. Brown A. Alaynick W.A. Andrews S.E. Lemke G. Pfaff S.L. Marquardt T. Science. 2008; 320: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), this receptor is also able to bind all three ephrin-B ligands. For example, EphA4 interacts with ephrin-B1 expressed in human platelets to stabilize blood clot formation through an integrin-dependent mechanism (22Prevost N. Woulfe D.S. Jiang H. Stalker T.J. Marchese P. Ruggeri Z.M. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9820-9825Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). By interacting with ephrin-B2 and/or ephrin-B3, EphA4 regulates neuronal circuits important for coordinated movement and may inhibit the regeneration of injured spinal cord axons (23Goldshmit Y.

On the other hand, although the high affinity ephrin binding pocket of the Eph receptors appears to be an attractive target for design of small molecules capable of inhibiting the Eph receptor signaling by blocking ephrin binding, only now two small molecules have been identified by a high throughput screening, which are able to antagonize ephrin-induced effects in EphA4-expressing cells (see accompanying article, Ref. 54Noberini R. Koolpe M. Peddibhotla S. Dahl R. Su Y. Cosford N.D.P. Rothe G.P. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29461-29472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Hence, it is of significant interest to gain structural insight into the binding interactions between the two small molecules and the EphA4 ligand-binding domain, with the ultimate goal to develop small molecule antagonists capable of inhibiting Eph-ephrin binding with high affinity and specificity. So far, no structure has been published for the ligand-binding domain of any EphA subclass member. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the EphA4 ligand-binding domain and characterized its binding to two antagonistic small molecules, namely 4- and 5-(2,5 dimethyl-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid by using isothermal titration calorimetry, CD, NMR spectroscopy, and computational docking. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the EphA4 Ligand-binding Domain—The DNA fragment encoding the human EphA4 ligand-binding domain (residues 28-208) was amplified from a HeLa cell cDNA library by using two primers containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, 5′-GGATCCAATGAAGTTACCTTATTGGATTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGAGTCAGCGGACTGTGAGTGGACAC-3′ (reverse). The PCR fragment was cloned into a modified pET32a vector (Novagen), and the vector was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) cells (Novagen), as described previously (34Ran X. Qin H. Liu J. Fan J.S. Shi J. Song J. Proteins. 2008; 72: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), allowing more efficient formation of disulfide bonds and expression of eukaryotic proteins containing codons rarely used in E. coli. To enhance the solubility of the EphA4 ligand-binding domain for NMR studies, in this construct we also included a C-terminal tail (residues 175-181), which was found to be totally unstructured in all structures determined so far. The free Cys176 in this extra tail was mutated to Ala by use of the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to avoid the formation of non-native disulfide bridges. The cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼0.7. Then 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside was then added to induce EphA4 expression at 20 °C overnight. The harvested cells were sonicated in the lysis buffer containing 150 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, to release soluble His-tagged proteins, which were subsequently purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). In-gel cleavage of the EphA4 fusion protein was performed at room temperature by incubating the fusion protein attached to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose with thrombin overnight. The released EphA4 protein was further purified on an AKTA FPLC machine (Amersham Biosciences) using a gel filtration column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200) equilibrated with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, followed by ion-exchange chromatography on an anion-exchange column (Mono Q 5/50). The eluted fraction containing the EphA4 ligand-binding domain was collected and buffer-exchanged to a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, and 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8, for storage. The generation of the isotope-labeled proteins for NMR studies followed a similar procedure except that the bacteria were grown in M9 medium with the addition of (15NH4)2SO4 for 15N labeling and (15NH4)2SO4/[13C]glucose for 15N-/13C-double labeling (34Ran X.

The purity of the protein samples was verified by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the molecular weight of the recombinant EphA4 ligand-binding domain was verified by a Voyager STR matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The concentration of protein samples was determined by use of a previously described spectroscopic method in the presence of denaturant (36Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—The EphA4 ligand-binding domain was prepared at a concentration of 12 mg/ml and crystallized by setting up 2-μl hanging drops at room temperature in a well containing the reservoir solution (20% PEG 4000, 15% isopropyl alcohol, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5). Rock-like crystals formed after 4 days, and dehydration of the crystals was subsequently performed by moving the coverslips to a new well containing dehydration buffer (20% PEG 4000, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 10% glycol, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5). The x-ray diffraction images for a single crystal were collected by using an in-house Rigaku/MSC FR-E x-ray generator with an R-AXIS IV++ imaging plate detector at the Biopolis shared equipment facility. The crystal was protected by the cryoprotectant (20% PEG 4000, 15% isopropyl alcohol, 25% glycol, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5). The data were indexed and scaled using the program d∗Trek (37Shi J. Sivaraman J. Song J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4620-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). After an all-space-group search, the crystal was identified as belonging to the space group P22121 with a = 53.75, b = 71.12, and c = 127.00 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The Matthews coefficient was 2.91 with 57.68% solvent constant. The initial model of the EphA4 ligand-binding domain was generated by the program Phaser from the Phenix suite (39McCoy A.J.

Open table in a new tab Oligomerization Status Characterized by FPLC, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Analytic Ultracentrifugation—The oligomerization status of the EphA4 ligand-binding domain was assessed by FPLC gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, as well as analytic ultracentrifugation in solution. Briefly, as described previously (34Ran X. Qin H. Liu J. Fan J.S. Shi J. Song J. Proteins. 2008; 72: 1019-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the FPLC gel filtration experiments were conducted using a fast protein liquid chromatography AKTA instrument (Amersham Biosciences) with a gel filtration column (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200). The column was calibrated with a low molecular weight protein kit (Amersham Biosciences) including four proteins as follows: ribonuclease A (15.6 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (22.8 kDa), ovalbumin (48.9 kDa), and albumin (65.4 kDa). Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed at 20 °C on a DynaPro-MS/X instrument (Protein Solutions Inc.), and the apparent molecular mass values were calculated from 10 readings using the Protein Dynamics analysis software (43Shi J. Lua S. Du N. Liu X. Song J. Biomaterials. 2008; 29: 2820-2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were done at 20 °C using a Beckman Coulter XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge as described previously (37Shi J. Sivaraman J. Song J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4620-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Binding Characterization by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and Circular Dichroism—Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed using a Microcal VP isothermal titration calorimetry machine as described previously (44Liu J. Li M. Ran X. Fan J.S. Song J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7171-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Titrations were conducted in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, at 25 °C. The two small molecule antagonists were purchased from Matrix Scientific, with 4-(2,5-dimethyl-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid designated as compound 1 and 5-(2,5 dimethyl-pyrrol-1-yl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid designated as compound 2. The powders of the two compounds were weighed and then dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer with the final pH values adjusted to 6.3. The EphA4 receptor at a concentration of 70 μm was placed in a 1.8-ml sample cell, and the compounds at a concentration of 2 mm were loaded into a 300-μl syringe. The samples were degassed for 15 min to remove bubbles before the titrations were initiated. Control experiments with the same parameter settings were also performed for the two compounds without EphA4, to subtract the effects because of sample dilution. To obtain thermodynamic binding parameters, the titration data after subtracting the values obtained from the control experiments were fit to a single binding site model using the built-in software ORIGIN version 5.0 (Microcal Software Inc.).

https://openalex.org/W2159579377,"Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-abnormally elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy)-has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative dementia and mild cognitive impairment. This association suggests that HHcy might facilitate memory loss in the elderly. As memory loss can occur through a deteriorated neurogenic capacity, we have studied the effects of Hcy on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) both in vitro and in vivo. We show that Hcy exerts an antiproliferative effect on basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) -stimulated NPCs isolated from the postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ), accompanied by inactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk1/2) and inhibition of Erk1/2-dependent expression of cyclin E. Using a mice model we show that, under normal folate conditions, HHcy exerts an inhibitory effect on adult brain neurogenesis. This inhibition occurs in the caudal areas of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, a neurogenic area mainly involved in learning and memory performance, and in the SVZ, recently implicated in olfactory learning performance. In both areas reduced number of proliferative neuroblasts were found. Since neuroblasts are primarily bFGF-responsive progenitors already committed to a neuronal phenotype, our results strongly suggest that excess Hcy inhibits neurogenesis in the DG and SVZ by inhibiting the bFGF-dependent activation of Erk1/2 in these cells."

Here we studied these phenomena by mutating the two N-terminal N-glycosylation sites (Asn18 and Asn33) of the human δ-opioid receptor, and expressing the mutants from the same chromosomal integration site in stably transfected inducible HEK293 cells. Both N-glycosylation sites were used, and their abolishment decreased the steady-state level of receptors at the cell surface. However, pulse-chase labeling, cell surface biotinylation, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that this was not because of intracellular accumulation. Instead, the non-N-glycosylated receptors were exported from the endoplasmic reticulum with enhanced kinetics. The results also revealed differences in the significance of the individual N-glycans, as the one attached to Asn33 was found to be more important for endoplasmic reticulum retention of the receptor. The non-N-glycosylated receptors did not show gross functional impairment, but flow cytometry revealed that a fraction of them was incapable of ligand binding at the cell surface. In addition, the receptors that were devoid of N-glycans showed accelerated turnover and internalization and were targeted for lysosomal degradation. The results accentuate the importance of protein conformation-based screening before export from the endoplasmic reticulum, and demonstrate how the system is compromised when N-glycosylation is disrupted. We conclude that N-glycosylation of the δ-opioid receptor is needed to maintain the expression of fully functional and stable receptor molecules at the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W1985422069,"TreX is an archaeal glycogen-debranching enzyme that exists in two oligomeric states in solution, as a dimer and tetramer. Unlike its homologs, TreX from Sulfolobus solfataricus shows dual activities for alpha-1,4-transferase and alpha-1,6-glucosidase. To understand this bifunctional mechanism, we determined the crystal structure of TreX in complex with an acarbose ligand. The acarbose intermediate was covalently bound to Asp363, occupying subsites -1 to -3. Although generally similar to the monomeric structure of isoamylase, TreX exhibits two different active-site configurations depending on its oligomeric state. The N terminus of one subunit is located at the active site of the other molecule, resulting in a reshaping of the active site in the tetramer. This is accompanied by a large shift in the ""flexible loop"" (amino acids 399-416), creating connected holes inside the tetramer. Mutations in the N-terminal region result in a sharp increase in alpha-1,4-transferase activity and a reduced level of alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity. On the basis of geometrical analysis of the active site and mutational study, we suggest that the structural lid (acids 99-97) at the active site generated by the tetramerization is closely associated with the bifunctionality and in particular with the alpha-1,4-transferase activity. These results provide a structural basis for the modulation of activities upon TreX oligomerization that may represent a common mode of action for other glycogen-debranching enzymes in higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2052722906,"Reactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway represents a critical step in the growth and survival of androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer (CaP). In this study we show the DU145 and PC3 AI human CaP cell lines respond to androgens and require AR expression for optimal proliferation in vitro. Interestingly, AR gene transcripts in DU145 and PC3 cells harbored a large number of single base pair nucleotide transitions that resulted in missense mutations in selected AR codons. The most notable lesion detected in AR gene transcripts included the oncogenic codon 877T-->A gain-of-function mutation. Surprisingly, AR gene transcript nucleotide transitions were not genome-encoded substitutions, but instead the mutations co-localized to putative A-to-I, U-to-C, C-to-U, and G-to-A RNA editing sites, suggesting the lesions were mediated through RNA editing mechanisms. Higher levels of mRNA encoding the A-to-I RNA editing enzymes ADAR1 and ADARB1 were observed in DU145 and PC3 cells relative to the androgen-responsive LNCaP and 22Rv1 human CaP cell lines, which correlated with higher levels of AR gene transcript A-to-I editing detected in DU145 and PC3 cells. Our results suggest that AR gene transcripts are targeted by different RNA editing enzymes in DU145 and PC3 cells. Thus RNA editing of AR gene transcripts may contribute to the etiology of hormone-refractory phenotypes in advanced stage AI CaP."

It is unknown whether hsp90 influences the proteasome activity to produce T cell epitopes, although association of PA28 with the 20 S proteasome stimulates the enzyme activity. Here, we show that hsp90 is essential in assembly of the 26 S proteasome and as a result, is involved in epitope production. Addition of recombinant hsp90α to cell lysate enhanced chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26 S proteasome in an ATP-dependent manner as determined by an in-gel hydrolysis assay.

The majority of these 8–10-amino acid peptides are proteasome-degraded products of cellular proteins (1Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

Cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules can be down-regulated with loss of peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum through functional disruption of transporter associated with antigen-processing molecules or because of a diminished peptide pool in the cytosol via disruption of immunoproteasomal subunits (3Van Kaer L. Ashton-Rickardt P.G. Eichelberger M. Gaczynska M. Nagashima K. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Doherty P.C. Tonegawa S.

Therefore, generation of peptides by the proteasome is the first and indispensable step in the entire MHC class I antigen-processing pathway. The flow of polypeptides in the context of pre- and postproteasomal events is not fully understood, although polyubiquitinated proteins to be degraded by the 26 S proteasome seem to be mainly derived from defective ribosomal products (6Schubert U. Anton L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Recently, large proteolytic intermediates (>30 kDa) harboring MHC class I epitope were found to associate with hsp90α in living cells (7Kunisawa J. Shastri N. Immunity. 2006; 24: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although there is no direct evidence that the associated intermediates are physiologically relevant in terms of being T cell epitopes by proteasome-dependent processing. Because hsp90 binds E3 ligase CHIP (C terminus of hsc70-interacting protein) to polyubiquitinate those large fragments, we may speculate that hsp90 can serve as a bridge between the bound substrates and CHIP for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. In this case, hsp90 large intermediate complex is free from the proteasome complex, at least until the substrates are ubiquitinated. However, short peptides bound to hsp90 which are not to be ubiquitinated are efficiently processed to be T cell epitopes in a proteasome-dependent manner (8Binder R.J. Blachere N.E. Srivastava P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17163-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that hsp90 stimulates MHC class I epitope production from C-but not N-terminally extended short synthetic peptides (13 ∼ 22-mer) in a proteasome-dependent manner in vivo (9Yamano T. Murata S. Shimbara N. Tanaka N. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Yui K. Udono H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitination of those short peptides is unnecessary to be processed by the proteasome, how hsp90 is involved in proteasome-dependent epitope production has still remained elusive. There might be an additional mechanism of hsp90 involved in epitope processing. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a direct association between hsp90 and the 26 S proteasome through 19 S cap (10Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen J. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of such an association remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of hsp90α on the function and structure of the proteasome in terms of epitope production in vivo and in vitro, compared with those of PA28. Our results showed that hsp90α, by stimulating assembly of the 26 S proteasome, is directly involved in production of epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells. Cell Lines and Culture—P815 is a mastocytoma (DBA/2 mice), and EL4 is a methylcholanthrene-induced thymoma (C57BL/6). PA28α–/–β–/– cell is a fibrosarcoma induced by methylcholanthrene from PA28α–/–β–/– BALB/c mice. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific to each peptide were generated and maintained as described (11Udono H. Yamano T. Kawabata Y. Ueda M. Yui K. Int.

Geldanaycin (GA) and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Lactacystin (LC) and epoxomicin were purchased from Boston Biochem and BIOMOL, respectively. Recombinant Proteins—Plasmid expressing human hsp90α was kindly provided by T. K. Nemoto (Nagasaki University School of Dentistry). Protein expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Electrophoresis—Native-PAGE was performed using 3–10% gradient gels (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in electroporation buffer (0.18 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, with 0.2 mm ATP) as described (17Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein samples (lysate: 6μg for PA28α–/–β–/– cells, proteasome pulldown: 10μl derived from 25 μg of lysate) were mixed with xylene cyanol and run at 100 V until elution of the xylene cyanol from the gel. SDS-PAGE was performed on 5–20% gradient gels. Peptidase Assay—Peptidase activity was measured using suc-LLVY-amc (chymotrypsin-like activity). Substrate (0.1 mm) was incubated with whole-cell extracts (6 μg of PA28α–/–β–/– cells), and peptidase activity was estimated by fluorescence (excitation at 380 nm, emission at 460 nm). In-gel hydrolysis assays were performed by irradiation of the native-PAGE with 360-nm UV light and detection by the 460-nm filter as described (9Yamano T. Murata S. Shimbara N. Tanaka N. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Yui K. Udono H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Lysates and Pulldown of the Proteasome—EL4 cells or PA28–/–β–/– cells were lysed with the 26 S buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 with 0.2 mm ATP. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials, the supernatant was used as whole-cell extract. To inhibit the ATPase activity of endogenous hsp90, 12.5 μm GA was added to the cell extract followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. To chelate Mg2+, 0.1 mm EDTA was added. Whole-cell extract was also used for proteasome pulldowns. PA28α (5 μg) or hsp90α (5 μg) was mixed with whole-cell lysate (250 μg/100 μl) derived from 1 × 106 EL4 cells or 5 × 105 PA28α–/–β–/– cells and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Ni-NTA-agarose (100 μl, 30% volume) was added for the final hour. Ni-NTA-agarose was washed twice with 26 S buffer containing 25 mm imidazole by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min, and PA28α- or hsp90α-associated proteasome was eluted with 100 μl of 26 S buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Quantification of MHC Class I Peptide Produced by the Proteasome—C-terminally extended, MHC class I precursor peptides (4 nmol) were digested with the proteasomes (10 μl derived from 25 μg of lysate) pulled down by PA28α and hsp90α in 26 S buffer (total 100 μl), in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP, with or without 12.5 μm GA or 10 μm epoxomicin at 37 °C for 3 h. After the addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (10% volume) and centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the soluble material containing the digested peptide (10 μl) was used for pulsation on the target cells for CTL assay. Serum-free plain RPMI 1640 medium was used throughout the entire CTL assay to avoid serum peptidase activity that might induce peptide cleavage during the assay. MHC class I epitopes, OVA257–264 (Kb), TRP2180–188 (Kb), and CSP281–289 (Kd) (10–9 to 10–14 m) were used for pulsation on the target cells to determine the sensitivity of CTLs. Loading of Peptides and Antigen Presentation Assay—Cells (2 × 106) were incubated for 90 min in the presence or absence of 5 μm GA or 50 μm LC in serum-free RPMI. Osmotic introduction of peptides and proteins, followed by CTL assay, was performed as described (9Yamano T. Murata S. Shimbara N. Tanaka N. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Yui K. Udono H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Three Distinct Patterns Mediated by Hsp90 and PA28 in the Processing of Peptides in Vivo—For in vivo antigen presentation assay, we used osmotic shock introduction of antigenic peptides, as shown (9Yamano T. Murata S. Shimbara N. Tanaka N. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Yui K. Udono H. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To compare the function of hsp90 with PA28, we prepared six different T cell epitopes spanning the cognate C-terminal flanking regions. We osmotically loaded these synthetic peptides, OVA257–269 (Kb) and TRP2180–193 (Kb) into EL4 (H-2b) or pRL1b-C5 (Ld), JAK1355–368 (Kd), CSP279–296 (Kd), and influenza A NP147–160 (Kd) into P815 (H-2d) cells together with hsp90 or recombinant PA28α. The efficiency of the processing of each epitope was assessed by cytolysis of the loaded cells with specific CTLs. The processing of all peptides was completely inhibited by pretreatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor, LC (Fig. 1 and data not shown for JAK1355–368, pRL1b-C5 and influenza A NP147–160). We observed the following. First, the processing was enhanced by both PA28α and hsp90. This pattern could be applied to OVA257–264 (and JAK1355–363, pRL1a, an exact epitope of pRL1b-C5, data not shown) (Fig. 1, A and D). GA treatment of EL4 partially suppressed the processing (Fig. 1D). Second, the processing of TRP2180–188 depended solely on PA28α (Fig. 1, B and E), and neither hsp90 nor its specific inhibitor, GA, affected the processing (Fig. 1E). Third, like CSP281–289 (and influenza A NP147–155, data not shown), the processing was enhanced by hsp90, but not by PA28α, and it was profoundly inhibited in P815 cells treated with GA (Fig. 1, C and F). Thus, processing of antigen peptides can be categorized into three patterns based on PA28 and hsp90 dependence, either on one or the other or on both. There are apparently distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of hsp90 and PA28. Thus, hsp90 is a molecule independent of PA28 and actively participates in the processing, together with the proteasome. Interaction of Hsp90 with the Proteasome—Hsp90 is known to bind short peptides (8Binder R.J. Blachere N.E. Srivastava P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17163-17171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether hsp90 could bind the three peptides, OVA257–269, TRP2180–193, and CSP279–296 in vitro. We found that all peptides, even TRP2180–193, could associate with hsp90 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that peptide affinity to hsp90 did not account for antigen-processing specificity of hsp90. Next, interaction of hsp90 and PA28α with the proteasome was investigated. We used recombinant histidine-tagged hsp90α and PA28α throughout the following experiments. Hsp90α or PA28α was incubated for 30 min with extracts of PA28α–/–β–/– cells in which the effect of endogenous PA28 could be ignored, and the mixtures were applied to native-PAGE gel, followed by in-gel hydrolysis assay. The addition of hsp90α stimulated the hydrolysis of suc-LLVY-amc at singly capped 26 S proteasome regulatory particle-core particle (RC) and/or the doubly capped 26 S proteasome, regulatory particle-core particle-regulatory particle (RCR) level, and both EDTA and GA abrogated the stimulatory effect (Fig. 2B, lanes 3). PA28α stimulated the formation of the homo-PA28 as well as hybrid proteasome, which was not suppressed by EDTA and GA (Fig. 2B, lanes 2). The kinetics of the proteasome activity was also shown (Fig. 2C). The results indicate that the molecular mechanism through which hsp90α stimulates the proteasome might be quite different from that for PA28α. To visualize the migration of recombinant PA28α and hsp90α, mixtures of those proteins and PA28α–/–β–/– cell extracts were applied to native-PAGE followed by in-gel hydrolysis assay and Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies. Because of apparently distinct migratory positions, RC was clearly distinguished from the hybrid proteasome resulting from just association of PA28α to RC (Fig. 2D, upper left panel). PA28α migrated to the level of the hybrid and homo-PA28–20S proteasomes, recognized by histidine immunoreactivity (Fig. 2D, upper panels). Hsp90α migrating to the RC was visible also by histidine reactivity (Fig. 2D, lower panels, lanes 2 and 3), although the RCR level was not clear, probably because of the sensitivity limits of the Western blotting assay being reached. Western blotting with antibodies against the 20Sα2 or Rpt6 subunit of the 19S cap showed increased levels of RC and RCR after the addition of hsp90α, and the increment was suppressed in the presence of EDTA and GA (Fig. 2D, lower panels). EDTA did not affect the binding of hsp90α to RC, but it inhibited the quantitative increase of RC and RCR as revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 2D, lower panels, lanes 3). These results correlated well with the increased hydrolytic activity of the hsp90α-stimulated proteasome (Fig. 2D, lower left panel), indicating that hsp90α stimulates the assembly of the RC (and RCR) in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner. This is consistent with a previous study showing in yeast that reassembly of the heat-disrupted proteasome depended, at least in part, on hsp90 (19Ishii T. Udono H. Yamano T. Ohta H. Uenaka A. Ono T. Hizuta A. Tanaka N. Srivastava P.K. Nakayama E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1303-1309PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, GA inhibited the association of hsp90α and RC and forced it to migrate to the position of the 20 S proteasome or the lower (Fig. 2D, lower panels, lanes 4). Intriguingly, a significant portion of Rpt6 was apparently separated from proteasome by GA treatment (Fig. 2D, lower panels, lanes 4), suggesting association of this molecule with hsp90. Next, we pulled down the proteasome complex with recombinant proteins from cell extracts. From EL4 cell extracts, PA28α pulled down homo-PA28-20S and hybrid proteasome-containing endogenous hsp90 (Fig. 3A). Hsp90α isolated mainly the hybrid proteasome (and/or RC) containing endogenous PA28 (Fig. 3B). From extracts of PA28α–/–β–/– cells, hsp90α pulled down the RC (Fig. 3D), whereas PA28α pulled down homo-PA28-20S and hybrid proteasomes containing endogenous hsp90 (Fig. 3C). Because all of the hybrid proteasomes (and/or RC) contained hsp90 derived from either endogenous hsp90 (Fig. 3 A and C) or recombinant protein per se (Fig. 3 B and D), hydrolysis of suc-LLVY-amc by those proteasomes was examined in the presence or absence of GA. Intriguingly, GA down-regulated all activities of the hybrid proteasome (and/or RC, RCR) but not those of the homo-PA28-20S proteasome (Fig. 3, right panels). The GA-induced undermined activity was attributed to impaired structures of the proteasomes as determined by Western blotting with an anti-20Sα2 subunit antibody (Fig. S1). Generation of a Unique Epitope by Proteasome Pulled Down by Hsp90α—To answer a question about whether the proteasome complexes produce a suitable T cell epitope for sensitization of specific CTL, we performed peptide digestion assay using synthetic peptides used in Fig. 1. The peptides were incubated with the proteasome obtained from extracts of the PA28α–/–β–/– cells in Fig. 3 C and D, with or without GA and epoxomicin, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome. The proteasome pulled down by PA28α or hsp90α contained both active PA28 and hsp90 that could locate on the opposite sides of the 20 S proteasome; PA28α directly on one α-ring of the 20 S and hsp90α on the other, possibly in a complex with the 19 S cap regulatory particle. The digested peptides were diluted and then pulsed onto EL4 cells or P815 cells. The quantities of the produced epitopes were evaluated by cytolysis of target cells. The sensitivity of CTLs used in this study is also shown (Fig. 4 G–I). The proteasome pulled down by PA28α produced epitopes that could sensitize CTLs from all three peptides (Fig. 4 A, C, and E). GA completely inhibited the epitope production from CSP279–296 (Fig. 4E) but had no inhibitory effect on TRP2180–193 (Fig. 4C). The proteasome obtained by hsp90α produced epitopes from OVA257–269 (Fig. 4B) and CSP279–296 (Fig. 4F) but not from TRP2180–193 (Fig. 4D). GA again induced complete inhibition on CSP279–296 (Fig. 4F) and partial suppression on OVA257–269 (Fig. 4B). The results indicate that hsp90α associated with the proteasome contributes to the production of some but not all T cell epitopes from C-terminally longer precursors and that this is blocked by GA. GA Treatment of Cells Transiently Disrupted 26 S Proteasome Structures—To examine the role of hsp90 in vivo, we treated EL4 and PA28α–/–β–/– cells with GA for the indicated hours as in Fig. 5. Toxicity of GA was monitored by counting cell number and viability in each chase time (Fig. S2). Both RC and RCR expressions were significantly decreased, as indicated by in-gel hydrolysis assay and/or Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 A and B). The results indicated that inhibition of hsp90 transiently but significantly disrupted at least some, if not all, RC and RCR structure. The cell surface expressions of Kd, Dd, and Ld (PA28α–/–β–/– cells in BALB/c background) after a 10-h GA treatment were then examined by FACS analysis. GA down-regulated all MHC class I molecules, and pulsation of CSP281–289 restored the Kd expression (Fig. 5C). In the present study, we observed that epoxomicin, a highly specific proteasome inhibitor, abrogated the production of CTL epitopes from C-terminally extended peptides by the proteasome affinity-isolated by hsp90α, indicating no association of hsp90α with cytosolic peptidases such as tripeptidyl protease, which acts downstream of the proteasome to process certain peptides independently (18Seifert U. Maranon C. Shmueli A. Desoutter J.F. Wesoloski L. Janek K. Henklein P. Diescher S. Andrieu M. de la Salle H. Weinschenk T. Schild H. Laderach D. Galy A. Haas G. Kloetzel P.M. Reiss Y. Hosmalin A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recently, both C- and N-terminal extended large peptides harboring T cell epitope (to be processed by the proteasome) were found to be associated with hsp90 (7Kunisawa J. Shastri N. Immunity. 2006; 24: 523-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, N-terminal extended versions of T cell epitopes (peptides once processed by the proteasome) were shown to be associated with hsp90 in vivo (19Ishii T. Udono H. Yamano T. Ohta H. Uenaka A. Ono T. Hizuta A. Tanaka N. Srivastava P.K. Nakayama E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1303-1309PubMed Google Scholar, 20Callahan M.K. Garg M. Srivastava P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The peptide carrier effect of hsp90 at both pre- and postproteasomal events may be important in peptide traffic in the cytosol. Our results provide an additional function of hsp90 in MHC class I antigen processing; thus, hsp90α is linked with the assembly of the 26 S proteasome. We presented here evidence for the direct involvement of hsp90α in epitope production by the 26 S proteasome, whose structures were sensitive to GA. In vivo processing of CSP281–289 depends on hsp90 but not on PA28, whereas that of TRP2180–188 depends on PA28 but not hsp90. Furthermore, processing of OVA257–264 depends on both PA28 and hsp90 (Fig. 1). In vitro production of those epitopes exactly depends on the same protein combinations used for the proteasome pulldowns (Fig. 4). We do not know the reason why the processing pattern is different between hsp90 and PA28. Hsp90 binds short peptides, probably with some preference for particular amino acids, which might determine peptides to be processed. With this point of view, because hsp90 itself could bind OVA257–269, TRP2180–193, and CSP279–296 (Fig. 2A), the binding of peptides to hsp90 per se would not account for the independence of TRP2180–193 on hsp90. Alternatively, hsp90α-(in a complex with 19 S cap) or PA28α-driven proteasomal activity might be different and involved in their unique epitope production, which is our most preferred hypothesis. Indeed, peptide repertoires produced from Insulin-like growth factor by the 26 S and 26 S plus PA28 is definitely different, even though the 20 S proteasome is same (21Cascio P. Call M. Petre B.M. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recent observations suggest that the 26 S proteasome is a dynamic machine that disassembles into the 20 S and 19 S cap subcomplexes during the catalytic cycle rather than remaining as a stable complex (22Babbitt S.E. Kiss A. Deffenbaugh A.E. Chang Y.H. Bailly E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Buranda T. Sklar L.A. Baumler J. Gogol E. Skowyra D. Cell. 2005; 121: 553-565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on this scenario, the 26 S proteasome must reassemble immediately after substrate degradation. The observation gave us a view that the steady-state 26 S proteasome is net-balanced upon disassembly and reassembly in catalytic cycle in living cells. GA may impair the balance by suppressing the reassembly of the 26 S proteasome after proteolysis, which down-regulates the level of the proteasome. The down-regulated expressions of RC and RCR by GA treatment (Fig. 5) supported an idea that hsp90 is involved in maintaining the steady-state level of the 26 S proteasome. We must note the following possibility that the proteasome pulled down by hsp90α is an intermediate form assembling closely into the fully matured 26 S proteasome; therefore, its structure is relatively fragile and sensitive to GA. Hsp90 is clearly not the sole molecule that facilitates assembly of the 26 S proteasome because GA-induced down-regulation of the 26 S proteasome was transient up to 3–6 h after starting the treatment and thereafter observed a vigorous rescue of the activity, as determined by native-PAGE (Fig. 5A). Therefore, additional molecules must play critical roles in reassembly of the 26 S proteasome, which need to be clarified in the future experiments. We thank T. Hiroiwa and C. Kajiwara for excellent technical assistance in preparation of recombinant proteins. We also thank Dr. Nemoto for providing the expression vector encoding hsp90α.

https://openalex.org/W2000598899,"Proteoglycans (PGs) are composed of a protein moiety and a complex glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharide moiety. GAG chains are responsible for various biological activities. GAG chains are covalently attached to serine residues of the core protein. The first step in PG biosynthesis is xylosylation of certain serine residues of the core protein. A specific linker tetrasaccharide is then assembled and serves as an acceptor for elongation of GAG chains. If the production of endogenous GAG chains is selectively inhibited, one could determine the role of these endogenous molecules in physiological and developmental functions in a spatiotemporal manner. Biosynthesis of PGs is often blocked with the aid of nonspecific agents such as chlorate, a bleaching agent, and brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite, to elucidate the biological roles of GAG chains. Unfortunately, these agents are highly lethal to model organisms. Xylosides are known to prime GAG chains. Therefore, we hypothesized that modified xylose analogs may able to inhibit the biosynthesis of PGs. To test this, we synthesized a library of novel 4-deoxy-4-fluoroxylosides with various aglycones using click chemistry and examined each for its ability to inhibit heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate using Chinese hamster ovary cells as a model cellular system."
https://openalex.org/W2087493295,"We determined the crystal structures of the T cell receptor (TCR)-like antibody 25-D1.16 Fab fragment bound to a complex of SIINFEKL peptide from ovalbumin and the H-2K(b) molecule. Remarkably, this antibody directly ""reads"" the structure of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-bound peptide, employing the canonical diagonal binding mode utilized by most TCRs. This is in marked contrast with another TCR-like antibody, Hyb3, bound to melanoma peptide MAGE-A1 in association with HLA-A1 MHC class I. Hyb3 assumes a non-canonical orientation over its cognate peptide-MHC and appears to recognize a conformational epitope in which the MHC contribution is dominant. We conclude that TCR-like antibodies can recognize MHC-bound peptide via two different mechanisms: one is similar to that exploited by the preponderance of TCRs and the other requires a non-canonical antibody orientation over the peptide-MHC complex."

Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) and function as coreceptors for tyrosine kinase VEGF receptors (4Neufeld G. Kessler O. Herzog Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 515: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and possibly other growth factor receptors (5Hu B. Guo P. Bar-Joseph I. Imanishi Y. Jarzynka M.J. Bogler O. Mikkelsen T.

The role of the neuropilins as VEGF receptors added a new dimension to their functional importance and resulted in numerous studies that have implicated their involvement in angiogenesis and tumor progression (5Hu B.

Recently, NRP-specific antibodies (Abs), either alone or in combination with anti-VEGF therapy, have been shown to impede tumor growth and spread in mice by targeting tumor cells directly or the vasculature and lymphatics (5Hu B.

The potential contribution of the neuropilins as VEGF coreceptors or receptors that mediate key functions of tumor and endothelial cells such as migration, growth rate, and survival has been the focus of an increasing number of studies with an emphasis on NRP1 (5Hu B. Guo P. Bar-Joseph I. Imanishi Y. Jarzynka M.J. Bogler O. Mikkelsen T. Hirose T. Nishikawa R. Cheng S.Y. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5577-5586Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 8Bachelder R.E.

Pathol. 2004; 164: 2139-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Of note, NRP1 has been shown recently to promote the survival of endothelial cells by modulating a p53/caspase axis (9Wang L. Dutta S.K. Kojima T. Xu X. Khosravi-Far R. Ekker S.C. Mukhopadhyay D. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An important area that has not been investigated, however, is the contribution of metabolic stress conditions that are characteristic of the tumor microenvironment to the regulation of NRP expression and function. Hypoxia, for example, can be postulated to be a major influence on the neuropilins because it selects for the survival of more aggressive tumor cells and enhances metastatic dissemination (18Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5863-5870PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, hypoxia has been shown to regulate the expression of other receptors important for tumor progression such as c-Met (19Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Hypoxia also stimulates the expression of the NRP ligand VEGF and promotes angiogenesis (18Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5863-5870PubMed Google Scholar). Nutrient deprivation resulting from inadequate blood supply is another hallmark of the tumor microenvironment which also has profound effects on cellular metabolism and genomic stability (20Sutherland R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Given these considerations, we sought to assess the impact of metabolic stress on the expression and function of the NRPs in both tumor and endothelial cells. Cells and Culture Conditions—The human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-453, and the human prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SUM159 cells were obtained from Dr. Stephen Ethier (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit MI). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MDA-MB-453 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 5% FBS, SUM159 in Ham's F-12 with 5% FBS, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and PC-3 in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% FBS. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from CAMBREX Corp. (East Rutherford, NJ) and maintained on gelatin-coated plates in medium 199 with 10% FBS, 6 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, 0.5 mg/ml heparin, and 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich). Unless stated otherwise, all cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. In some experiments, cells were maintained in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4 g/liter glucose for the indicated times or treated with either MG132 (5 nm, Calbiochem), chloroquine (100 μm, Sigma-Aldrich), bafilomycin A1 (100 nm, Sigma-Aldrich), 3-methyladenine (5 and 10 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS containing glucose, or rapamycin (5 and 500 nm, Sigma-Aldrich), as indicated in the figure legends. Hypoxia Experiments—Cells were plated at a subconfluent density and incubated at 37 °C in a hypoxic work station (INVIVO2 200; Biotrace, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) for the times and [O2] indicated in the figure legends. Duplicate plates were maintained in “normoxia,” a standard tissue culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Immunoblotting—Cells were extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Boston Bioproducts, Worcester MA) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science), cleared by centrifugation, and protein content was quantified using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples containing equivalent amounts of protein were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 8% glycerol, 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue. Proteins were separated by standard SDS-8% PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Ready Gel Blotting Sandwiches, Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was prevented by incubation with 5% dried milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Blots were incubated at 4 °C overnight with Abs specific for either NRP1 (A12 and C19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), NRP2 (H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; AF2215, R&D Systems), or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, the proteins were detected using ECL (Pierce, Rockford, IL). When required, reblotting was done after standard stripping and blocking. Band intensities were quantified using Labworks 4.6 image acquisition and analysis software (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA) and normalized with the intensity of β-actin. Expression of NRP1 and NRP2 in MDA-MB-453 Cells—NRP1 and NRP2 constructs with the same cytomegalovirus promoter, which were provided by Drs. Jonathan Raper and Francoise Bono, respectively, were expressed in MDA-MB-453 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, 4 μg of each construct was introduced into 5 × 105 MDA-MB-453 cells, and after 1 day in fresh medium, the transfected cells were maintained in either normoxia or hypoxia (0.1% O2) for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested for analysis of NRP1 and NRP2 expression by immunoblotting. Flow Cytometric Analysis—HUVECs were detached with 5 mm EDTA in PBS, blocked with 3% FBS in PBS, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with anti-BDCA-4 (NRP1) monoclonal Ab (1 μg/ml; AD5–17F6, Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and anti-NRP2 (H300; 5 μg/ml) in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and stained at 4 °C for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse IgG for NRP1 and FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG for NRP2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Data were collected using a BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and a live (DAPI-negative) single-cell population was analyzed for examining the cell surface expression of NRPs. Generation and Use of AP-Sema3A and AP-Sema3F—Human Sema3A and Sema3F ligated to the 3′ end of the alkaline phosphatase gene (AP-Sema3A and AP-Sema3F) constructs were generously provided by Dr. Alex Kolodkin. To generate AP-Sema protein, 25 μg of each construct was introduced into human embryonic kidney 293 T cells by Lipofectamine 2000. Conditioned medium containing secreted recombinant proteins was harvested 72 h after transfection. The identity of each recombinant protein was verified by immunoblotting using an alkaline phosphatase Ab (GenHunter, Nashville, TN). The concentration of each recombinant protein was determined using an AP enzymatic assay kit (GenHunter) based on the specific activity of alkaline phosphatase (units/ml). HUVECs were plated on chamber slides and incubated with AP, AP-Sema3A, or AP-Sema3F conditioned medium containing equivalent amounts of AP activity for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The cells were then fixed with formalin solution for 15 min at room temperature after five washes with PBS. Endogenous phosphatase activity was inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 20 min in AP buffer (150 mm NaCl/20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5). All assays were done in duplicate. Cell surface expression of AP-Sema was visualized by incubation with AP assay reagent S (GenHunter) for 16 h at room temperature, and representative photomicrographs were taken under the microscope. NRP2 shRNA—Lentiviruses containing the following NRP2 shRNAs were generated and titrated according to the manufacturer's instructions: Oligonucleotide ID TRCN0000063308 and TRCN0000063312 for 8 and 12 of shNRPZ (shRNA for NRP2), respectively, and green fluorescent protein control in pLKO.1 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) and used to infect HUVECs following standard protocols. Endothelial Tube Formation Assay—HUVECs (5 × 105 cells) were infected with shRNA-expressing lentivirus (5 × 106 cfu) for green fluorescent protein and NRP2 in the presence of 6 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). At 72 h after infection, cells were plated on Matrigel as described (21Calvani M. Rapisarda A. Uranchimeg B. Shoemaker R.H. Melillo G. Blood. 2006; 107: 2705-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with modifications. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel (1 mg/ml, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was added to each well of a 96-well plate on ice, allowed to polymerize for 15 min at room temperature, and then placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. HUVECs (104 cells/well) were added to the Matrigel-coated plates. Cells were then incubated in hypoxia. After 24 h, photomicrographs of each well (magnification, ×40) were taken using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Optical Analysis Corp., Nashua, NH) equipped with a Retiga 1300 CCD digital camera (QImaging, Burnaby, BC Canada), and they were processed using IPLab software (Scanalytics, inc., Fairfax, VA). Tube formation was quantified by determining the number of branch points/field. The effect of the shRNAs on NRP expression before and after the Matrigel assays was assessed by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. Statistical Analysis—Values of results are expressed as means and S.D., and significance was established by Student's t test. In all analyses, the level of statistical significance was more than the 95% confidence level (p < 0.05). Hypoxia Suppresses NRP1 but Not NRP2 Expression—To assess the impact of hypoxia on NRP1 expression, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 breast carcinoma cells, PC-3 prostate carcinomas, and HUVECs were maintained in either hypoxic (0.1% O2) or normoxic conditions (21% O2) for 24 h. NRP1 expression was assayed in extracts from these cells by immunoblotting. Compared with normoxia, hypoxia suppressed NRP1 expression in all of these cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, hypoxia increased the expression of hexokinase II in SUM159 cells, a hypoxiainducible glycolytic enzyme (22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43407-43412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), providing a positive control for the hypoxic environment (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we examined the impact of a range of [O2] on NRP1 expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, NRP1 expression was suppressed up to 2.5% O2 but not at 5% O2. Given the striking suppression of NRP1 expression by hypoxia, we sought to determine the impact of hypoxia on the expression of NRP2, which is also expressed by endothelial cells and some breast carcinoma cells (12Bielenberg D.R. Pettaway C.A. Takashima S. Klagsbrun M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 23Guttmann-Raviv N. Kessler O. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. Cancer Lett. 2006; 231: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Exposure of SUM159 cells to hypoxia (0.1%) for time periods that ranged from 0 to 6 h repressed NRP1 expression but had no effect on NRP2 expression (Fig. 2A). Exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia resulted in significant repression of NRP1 expression within 3–6 h, similar to SUM159 cells (data not shown). This repression was sustained for at least 5 days in hypoxia (Fig. 2A). In marked contrast, NRP2 expression in HUVECs was not diminished significantly even after 5 days in hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Long term hypoxic stimulation did not induce a significant increase in apoptosis in these cells (data not shown). Additional evidence to support the differential regulation of NRP1 and NRP2 expression by hypoxia was obtained using MDA-MB-453 breast carcinoma cells. These cells lack expression of both NRP1 and NRP2 (Fig. 2B). For this reason, we transfected cDNAs for either NRP1 or NRP2 into these cells and assessed the impact of hypoxia (24 h) on the expression of these exogenous proteins. As shown in Fig. 2B, hypoxia stimulated a substantial reduction in NRP1 but not NRP2 expression. Analysis of NRP surface expression by flow cytometry revealed that exposure of HUVECs to hypoxia for 24 h stimulated a substantial reduction (∼70%) in NRP1 surface expression compared with cells maintained in normoxia (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the surface expression of NRP2 was not diminished significantly by exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 3A). To assess the impact of hypoxia on the NRPs further, we took advantage of the fact that Semaphorin 3A binds to NRP1 (24Miao H.Q. Soker S. Feiner L. Alonso J.L. Raper J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and Semaphorin 3F binds to NRP2 (25Chen H. Bagri A. Zupicich J.A. Zou Y. Stoeckli E. Pleasure S.J. Lowenstein D.H. Skarnes W.C. Chedotal A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). HUVECs were maintained in normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h and then incubated at 4 °C in the presence of either an alkaline phosphatase-tagged Semaphorin 3A (AP-Sema3A) or alkaline phosphatase-tagged Semaphorin 3F (AP-Sema3F) ligand. Subsequently, the cells were fixed, and in situ alkaline phosphatase reaction was carried out to visualize semaphorin binding. Both AP-Sema3A and AP-Sema3F bound robustly to HUVECs maintained in normoxia (Fig. 3B). No significant change in the binding of AP-Sema3F was detected in HUVECs maintained in hypoxia (Fig. 3B). In contrast, however, a marked decrease in AP-Sema3A binding was observed in hypoxia compared with normoxia (Fig. 3B). Hypoxia and Other Stress Conditions Induce the Degradation of NRP1 by a Mechanism Characteristic of Autophagy—One hypothesis to explain the rapid loss of NRP1 expression in hypoxia is protein degradation. Initially, we assessed the possibility that hypoxia induced the proteasomal-mediated degradation of NRP1 using MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor (26Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). This inhibitor did not impede the loss of NRP1 expression in hypoxia (data not shown). Subsequently, we investigated whether hypoxia stimulates the lysosomal degradation of NRP1. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of HUVECs with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (27Gerard K.W. Hipkiss A.R. Schneider D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18886-18890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) prevented the loss of NRP1 expression that occurs in hypoxia. In contrast, chloroquine had no significant effect on NRP2 expression, nor did it affect the expression of NRP1 in normoxia (Fig. 4A). These data were confirmed using another lysosomal inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (28Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 29Furuchi T. Aikawa K. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27345-27348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 prevented the loss of NRP1 expression in hypoxia, but it did not impact NRP2 expression significantly (Fig. 4B). However, chloroquine did not inhibit the loss of NRP1 surface expression as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that loss of NRP1 under hypoxia is caused by internalization and degradation of NRP1. Autophagy is one form of lysosomal degradation that is induced by stress conditions, including hypoxia and nutrient deprivation (30Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possibility that NRP1 is degraded by an autophagic mechanism, we maintained HUVECs in PBS supplemented only with glucose. As shown in Fig. 5A, NRP1 expression was depleted within 40 min in this medium, but no change was evident in the expression of NRP2. Analysis of NRP surface expression by flow cytometry revealed that nutrient deprivation for 2 h stimulated a significant reduction (∼40%) in NRP1, but not in NRP2, surface expression compared with unstarved cells (Fig. 5B). We also treated HUVECs in PBS/glucose with 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate kinase III that is reported to be an autophagy inhibitor in mammalian cells (31Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). This inhibitor prevented the loss of NRP1 expression that was induced by nutrient deprivation (Fig. 5C). Given that TORC1 has been shown to inhibit autophagy through inactivation of Atg13, one of the early autophagy genes, by phosphorylation (30Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar), we treated HUVECs with rapamycin, a TORC1 inhibitor, to induce autophagy. At concentrations as low as 5 nm, a significant decrease in NRP1 but not NRP2 expression was observed (Fig. 5D). Taken together, the data in Fig. 5 support the hypothesis that NRP1 is degraded by an autophagic mechanism in response to stress conditions. NRP2 Mediates Endothelial Cell Tube Formation in Hypoxia—One implication of our data is that NRP2 mediates distinct cellular functions in hypoxia which are independent of NRP1. HUVECs exhibit the ability to form tubes in hypoxia when plated on Matrigel (21Calvani M. Rapisarda A. Uranchimeg B. Shoemaker R.H. Melillo G. Blood. 2006; 107: 2705-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a form of branching morphogenesis (Fig. 6). To assess the involvement of NRP2 in this process, we generated NRP2-specific shRNAs and expressed them in HUVECs. These shRNAs depleted NRP2 expression but had no effect on NRP1 (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of these shRNAs on tube formation in hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 6B, loss of NRP2 abrogated the ability of HUVECs to form tubes in hypoxia. Quantification of branch point formation, a measure of branching morphogenesis, substantiated this conclusion (Fig. 6C). Analysis of NRP expression by flow cytometry in these cultures revealed that the tube-forming process itself did not affect their surface expression (data not shown), that NRP2 expression was diminished in cells that expressed the NRP2 shRNAs, and that NRP1 expression was lost in all cell populations in hypoxia (Fig. 6D). The key finding reported in this study is that metabolic stress conditions characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, including hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, stimulate the rapid loss of surface expression and degradation of NRP1 but not of NRP2 in both endothelial and carcinoma cells. More specifically, the data provided suggest that NRP1 is internalized and degraded by autophagy in response to metabolic stress and that NRP2 is resistant to such degradation. We also report that NRP2 can function in the absence of NRP1 to mediate endothelial tube formation in hypoxia. These findings argue for inherent differences in the regulation of NRP1 and NRP2 which could impact their contribution to endothelial and cancer biology. Our data support a mechanism for cellular response to metabolic stress that involves the rapid internalization of surface NRP1 and its degradation in lysosomes or autophagosomes, even in cells such as HUVECs that express both NRP1 and NRP2. This mechanism is supported by the recent finding that sulfated polysaccharides induce NRP1 internalization and degradation in lysosomes (32Narazaki M. Segarra M. Tosato G. Blood. 2008; 111: 4126-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An important issue that derives from these data is the nature of the mechanism that is stimulated by metabolic stress and that targets NRP1 but not NRP2 for degradation. Neither of these NRPs has a potential lysosomal targeting sequence (KFERQ), which is selectively recognized by the molecular chaperone HSC73 (33Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 6-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we were unable to coimmunoprecipitate HSC73 protein with either NRP1 or NRP2 (data not shown). The cytoplasmic domain of NRP1 does contain a PDZ-binding domain (SEA) at its COOH terminus which binds to synectin, also known as GIPC (34Pellet-Many C. Frankel P. Jia H. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Synectin/GIPC can bind to RGS19, a regulator of G protein signaling which has been implicated in endocytosis and membrane trafficking (35De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 36Abramow-Newerly M. Roy A.A. Nunn C. Chidiac P. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although this putative mechanism could account for the differences we observed between NRP1 and NRP2, it is challenged by the fact that the NRP2a isoform also contains the same PDZ-binding sequence at its COOH terminus, and our finding that exogenous expression of NRP1 and NRP2, which contained the SEA sequence, in MDA-MB-453 cells resulted in hypoxia-induced degradation of NRP1 but not NRP2 (Fig. 2). Subsequent studies should evaluate the relative PDZ-binding potential of NRP1 and NRP2 and assess other regions of their cytoplasmic domain sequences for involvement in internalization and degradation. Our finding that NRP1 is targeted for degradation in response to metabolic stress in vitro raises several important issues that bear on NRP function in vivo. Hypoxia and nutrient deprivation select for cells that can survive under such conditions and, as a consequence, facilitate tumor progression (18Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5863-5870PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sutherland R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Degradation of NRP1 may occur because its functions are not essential for survival or actually impede survival, e.g. apoptotic Semaphorin signaling (37Castro-Rivera E. Ran S. Thorpe P. Minna J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11432-11437Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 38Bielenberg D.R. Klagsbrun M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007; 26: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that the internalization and degradation of NRP1 could provide a positive signal that is associated with the regulation of growth factor receptors important for tumor survival and progression. In this context, there is evidence that NRP1 can facilitate not only VEGF signaling (23Guttmann-Raviv N. Kessler O. Shraga-Heled N. Lange T. Herzog Y. Neufeld G. Cancer Lett. 2006; 231: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) but also potentiate signaling mediated by other growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (5Hu B. Guo P. Bar-Joseph I.

Blood. 2008; 111: 2036-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The possibility that diminished NRP1 expression on tumor cells contributes to progression is tempered by reports that have demonstrated increased NRP1 expression in primary and metastatic tumors (for review, see Ref. 34Pellet-Many C. Frankel P. Jia H. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We are cautious of such studies, at least for breast cancer, because we were unable to detect significant NRP1 staining in breast tumor specimens using several commercially available Abs (data not shown), a finding that is consistent with the report that NRP1 expression in the breast is confined to myoepithelial cells of the normal gland (39Stephenson J.M. Banerjee S. Saxena N.K. Cherian R. Banerjee S.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 101: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that NRP1 facilitates tumor growth and progression (13Hong T.M. Chen Y.L. Wu Y.Y. Yuan A. Chao Y.C. Chung Y.C. Wu M.H. Yang S.C. Pan S.H. Shih J.Y. Chan W.K. Yang P.C.

J. 2008; 411: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), there are also data that NRP1 expression in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line impedes tumor growth and spread (40Gray M.J. Wey J.S.

The use of transgenic mouse tumor models in which either NRP1 or NRP2 have been deleted should provide more definitive insight into the relative contributions of these receptors within the context of the tumor microenvironment. Our data on HUVECs need to be considered with respect to the response of endothelial cells to metabolic stress. Ischemia, impaired blood flow caused by vasoconstriction and trauma, results in hypoxia and nutrient deprivation (20Sutherland R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 30Levine B. Kroemer G. Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar), conditions that can promote NRP1 degradation in vitro. Such conditions also stimulate VEGF expression and secretion. Interestingly, there is evidence that VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 are internalized in response to endothelial wounding and that internalization is necessary for wound recovery (41Santos S.C. Miguel C. Domingues I. Calado A. Zhu Z. Wu Y. Dias S. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, the hypothesis can be proposed that the induction of VEGF expression that occurs in response to metabolic stress also promotes the internalization and degradation of NRP1. It is also possible that wound recovery involves the reexpression of NRP1, as evidenced by the report that neovascularization in response to ischemia results in increased NRP1 expression (42Ishihama H. Ohbayashi M. Kurosawa N. Kitsukawa T. Matsuura O. Miyake Y. Muramatsu T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 1172-1178PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our data reveal that NRP1 is labile to internalization and lysosomal degradation in response to metabolic stress, a behavior that distinguishes it from NRP2. This property of NRP1 may be intrinsic to its functional regulation and that of other surface receptors with which it associates. At present, these data do not diminish ongoing programs aimed at using NRP1-specific Abs as adjuvant therapy for cancer and tumor angiogenesis (14Pan Q. Chanthery Y. Liang W.C. Stawicki S. Mak J. Rathore N. Tong R.K. Kowalski J. Yee S.F. Pacheco G. Ross S. Cheng Z. Le Couter J. Plowman G. Peale F. Koch A.W. Wu Y. Bagri A. Tessier-Lavigne M. Watts R.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 53-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), but they do suggest that further studies on NRP1 expression and function within the tumor microenvironment are warranted. Nonetheless, the data do support a potentially important role for NRP2 in cancer and angiogenesis, a possibility that is substantiated by recent studies (11Gray M.J. Van Buren G. Dallas N.A. Xia L.

Extracellular cAMP is a chemoattractant for Dictyostelium cells. Upon binding of cAMP to surface receptors, several signaling cascades are activated that cause cells to crawl toward the source of cAMP (1Jin T. Hereld D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 2Varez-Curto E. Weening K.E. Schaap P. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Some of the signaling molecules involved in chemotaxis are the second messengers phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, Ca2+, and the product(s) of PLA2, 2The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; GEF, guanine exchange factor; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; cNBD, cyclic nucleotide-binding domain; LRR, leucine-rich repeat. 2The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; GEF, guanine exchange factor; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; MAPKKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; cNBD, cyclic nucleotide-binding domain; LRR, leucine-rich repeat. as well as the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP (2Varez-Curto E.

These second messengers have important roles in transducing signals that lead to actin polymerization at the front of the cell (5Sasaki A.T. Firtel R.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 873-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of myosin in the back of the cell, which are vital for cells to move (6de la Roche M.A. Smith J.L.

Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One of the second messengers that have been implicated in myosin regulation is cGMP (8Goldberg J.M. Wolpin E.S. Bosgraaf L. Clarkson B.K. Van Haastert P.J. Smith J.L. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, the proteins that are involved in the formation and degradation of cGMP have been identified and characterized (4Veltman D.M. Bosgraaf L. Van Haastert P.J. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 69: 95-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 10Bader S. Kortholt A. Van Haastert P.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Binding of extracellular cAMP to the surface cAMP receptor cAR1 causes a G-protein-dependent activation of two guanylyl cyclases, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase (GCA). These two enzymes are responsible for the rapid synthesis of cGMP in cells, whereas three cGMP-degrading enzymes, PDE3, PDE5, and PDE6, cause a subsequent decrease of cGMP in the cells, back to basal levels. In Dictyostelium, the function of cGMP is transduced by the target protein GbpC. Disruption of the gene coding for GbpC yields a cell line that has impaired regulation of myosin II as well as defects in chemotaxis, comparable with cells that lack both guanylyl cyclases (9Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GbpC was shown to contain two cyclic nucleotide-binding domains that are able to bind cGMP with high affinity. Furthermore, this protein has many other domains: leucine-rich repeats and domains that have homology to Ras-GTPases (Roc for Ras of complex proteins), Cor (for C terminus of Roc), MAPKKK, RasGEF, GRAM (a domain in glucosyltransferases, myotubularins, and other putative membrane-associated proteins), and DEP (a domain found in Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin). Based on its domain topology, GbpC was categorized as a member of the Roco family of proteins that are characterized by conserved Roc and Cor domains, often in addition to LRR and MAPKKK (11Bosgraaf L. van Haastert P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1643: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). GbpC is an unusual member of the Roco family, because it also contains additional RasGEF and cNBDs. The Roco family gained attention recently, when the human Roco protein LRRK2 was found to be involved in Parkinson disease (12Zimprich A. Biskup S. Leitner P. Lichtner P. Farrer M. Lincoln S. Kachergus J. Hulihan M. Uitti R.J. Calne D.B. Stoessl A.J. Pfeiffer R.F. Patenge N. Carbajal I.C. Vieregge P. Asmus F. Muller-Myhsok B. Dickson D.W. Meitinger T. Strom T.M. Wszolek Z.K. Gasser T. Neuron. 2004; 44: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). Ras proteins switch between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state and can interact with downstream effectors only in the active GTP-bound state. Activation of Ras is mediated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP (13Bos J.L. Rehmann H. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2007; 129: 865-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized downstream effectors of Ras are MAPKKKs (14Chong H. Vikis H.G. Guan K.L. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For the human Roco protein LRRK2 it has been shown that GTP binding to Roc enhances kinase activity of the MAPKKK domain, which is the presumed output of LRRK2 and the homologous protein LRRK1 (15Guo L. Gandhi P.N. Wang W. Petersen R.B. Wilson-Delfosse A.L. Chen S.G. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3658-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Korr D. Toschi L. Donner P. Pohlenz H.D. Kreft B. Weiss B. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). So far, it is unclear whether GEFs are necessary to regulate GDP/GTP exchange on the Roc domain of LRRK2. In potential, GbpC has all the domains to provide a complete intramolecular signaling pathway. In this study, the activation mechanism of GbpC was investigated. The results lead to an activation model in which cGMP binding to the cNBDs causes activation of the GEF domain, the subsequent GDP/GTP exchange of the Roc domain, and activation of the MAPKKK domain. Strains and Cell Culture—We made a new gbpC null cell line in AX3 background, because this facilitates direct comparison with other null mutants in AX3 background. This new cell line was made with the same constructs and strategy as described before for the gbpC null strain in DH1 (9Bosgraaf L. Russcher H. Smith J.L. Wessels D. Soll D.R. van Haastert P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The clones were examined for correct integration of the knockout construct in the gbpC gene with Southern blotting and PCR (data not shown) and verified in a cGMP binding assay, as described before (17Goldberg J.M. Bosgraaf L. van Haastert P.J. Smith J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6749-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Wild-type AX3 cells and gbpC null cells were grown in HG5 medium to a maximum density of about 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells expressing GbpC-derived proteins were grown in the presence of the appropriate selection marker, which was G418 for most constructs but hygromycin for the GbpC-ΔcGMP construct. Cloning of gbpC Constructs—The complete gbpC cDNA was amplified as domain modules with the following strategy. The 7.9-kb gene was divided in eight DNA parts of approximately equal size, with borders to assure that the various domains of GbpC were completely covered in a specific DNA part. Unique restriction sites were introduced in the PCR primers at the border of two DNA parts (see Fig. 2A). This strategy had several advantages. First, the gene is almost 8 kb long, therefore making it difficult to PCR the complete gbpC cDNA at once. Second, using mutagenesis of one DNA module, it is relatively easy to study the function of specific domains within the complete GbpC protein. Third, another advantage comes from the possibility to express the smaller parts separately, so the various domains of GbpC can be studied by mutagenesis more easily. Primers were designed for each part, which include several sequence elements (see supplemental Table S1 and Fig. 2A). Most forward primers (from 5′to 3′) consisted of a BglII or BamHI site (for cloning in expression plasmids), followed by a Kozak sequence, a start codon, a unique restriction site in the gbpC cDNA (sometimes created by silent mutation), and gbpC cDNA. The reverse primers (from 3′to 5′) generally consisted of gbpC cDNA, a unique restriction site in the gbpC cDNA (sometimes created by silent mutation), a SpeI or XbaI site (for cloning in expression plasmids), and a stop codon. All PCR products were ligated in pGemTeasy (Promega). The separate parts were fused with each other in the correct order with the unique restriction sites. After joining parts 1-5, this 4.9-kb fragment was cut out of pGemTeasy with BamHI/SpeI and ligated into BglII/SpeI-digested MB74-derived plasmid. This resulting plasmid was subsequently digested with NruI/SpeI and joined with the 3-kb fragment of part 6-8 (cut with NruI/XbaI from pGemTeasy), yielding the full gbpC open reading frame. Different MB74-derived plasmids were used to obtain expression plasmids with different selection markers (G418 or hygromycin) or the presence of a C-terminal GFP tag. Mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis, and the DNA fragments were exchanged with gbpC cDNA using the appropriate unique restrictions enzymes and cloned in a similar way as the original gbpC construct. All PCR products were sequenced to assure mutation-free constructs. Expression and folding of all proteins was monitored using cGMP binding assays (see below), by fluorescent microscopy and Western blotting, using anti-GFP antibodies (Santa Cruz), and by assaying GTP binding, using the GTP-agarose pulldown assay. cGMP Binding Assay—The assay was performed essentially as described before (18Bosgraaf L. Waijer A. Engel R. Visser A.J. Wessels D. Soll D. van Haastert P.J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mg/ml crushed protease inhibitor mixture tablet; mini Complete-tablets, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and lysed using Nuclepore filters. The lysate was precleared by centrifugation for 3 min at 14,000 × g and an additional 5 min at 14,000 × g. Next, 200 μl of lysate was incubated with 200 μl of binding mix (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EGTA, 6 mm MgCl2, and 20 nm [3H]cGMP) for 20 min on ice and subsequently filtered through 0.45 μm of nitrocellulose. The filters were washed twice with 3 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA), dried, and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding of [3H]cGMP was determined in the presence of 1 mm cGMP. GbpC-binding sites were determined by subtracting the remaining binding to gbpC null cell lysates from cGMP binding to all other lysates and normalizing the numbers to the amount of binding sites in AX3. Chemotaxis Assay—Chemotaxis was measured with the small population assay (19Konijn T.M. Experientia. 1970; 26: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in the wells of a six-well plate with 1 ml of agar non-nutrient hydrophobic agar (11 mm KH2PO4, 2.8 mm Na2HPO4, 7 g/liter hydrophobic agar) containing 2 μm p-bromophenacyl bromide and 50 μm LY294002 to inhibit PLA2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively (20Veltman D.M. Keizer-Gunnik I. Van Haastert P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Droplets of about 0.1 μl of 7-h starved cells (6 × 106 cells/ml) were placed on the agar. Chemotaxis toward cAMP was tested after 30 min by placing a second 0.1-μl droplet, with 1 μm cAMP, next to the droplet of cells. The distribution of the cells in the droplet was observed about every 10 min for 90 min and scored positive when at least twice as many cells were pressed against the side of the population closer to higher cAMP concentration as against the other side of the droplet. Recorded is the fraction of droplets scored positive, averaged over three successive observations at and around the moment of the maximal response. The data presented are the means and standard error of the means of at least three independent measurements on different days. Purification of Proteins—The Roc-Cor fragment of GbpC (amino acids 326-880) was expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion protein from the pGEX4T-3 (GE Healthcare) vector in Bl21(DE3)codonplus-RIL Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene). The cells were grown in TB medium (Merck) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, induced at an A600 of 0.8 with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated overnight at 25 °C. After protein production, the cells were pelleted (15 min, 4000 × g, and 4 °C), and resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm dithioerythritol, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm GDP). To inhibit protein degradation, 1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The cells were lysed in a microfluidizer (Microfluidizer Inc.), and 0.1 mg/ml DNase was added. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation (45 min, 100,000 × g at 4 °C), and fusion proteins were purified using a GSH affinity column (GE Healthcare). The glutathione S-transferase tag was cleaved on the column using 200 units of thrombin (SERVA), followed by elution of the protein in lysis buffer and further purification by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 16/20; GE Healthcare). The RasGEF domain was cloned into a pRSETB vector and expressed in Rosetta DE3 bacteria (Merck) as an N-terminal His tag fusion protein. The 63-kDa protein was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 16/20; GE Healthcare). The Dictyostelium Ras proteins were purified as previously described (21Kortholt A. Rehmann H. Kae H. Bosgraaf L. Keizer-Gunnink I. Weeks G. Wittinghofer A. van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23367-23376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Isolated proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad). Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—For measuring GEF activity, the GTP-binding proteins were first incubated at room temperature with a 20-fold excess of the fluorescent GDP analog 2′/3′-O-(N′-methylanthraniloyl)-guanosine-diphosphate (mGDP), in the presence of 10 mm EDTA (22Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The mGDP-loaded GTPases were incubated at 25 °C in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm dithioerythritol), containing 200-fold excess of unlabeled GDP, with the indicated amounts of GEF protein. The stability of the protein was controlled by incubating the mGDP-loaded protein in assay buffer, under the same conditions. The intrinsic exchange activity was measured by incubating the mGDP-loaded G-protein with an excess of unlabeled GDP. The nucleotide exchange was measured in real time as decay in fluorescence using a Spex2 spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 450 nm, respectively. The obtained data were fitted to a single exponential decay, using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software). GTP Binding Assay—gbpC null cells expressing GbpC-GFP were washed with lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in lysis buffer, supplemented with 1 mg/ml of crushed protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysis occurred by passage through a 3.0-μm Nuclepore filter at 4 °C. The lysate was then cleared by a 15-min centrifugation step at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for the GTP-agarose pulldown assay. GTP-agarose beads (40 μl of slurry/reaction; Sigma) were preincubated with bovine serum albumin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min to prevent nonspecific binding, and after washing with lysis buffer, 400 μl of lysate was incubated with the beads in the absence or presence of the indicated amounts of cGMP and GTP for 45 min at 4 °C, under gently turning. Next, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed two times with lysis buffer. Elution of proteins occurred by incubation for 5 min at 80 °C in SDS loading dye, and the amount of eluted GbpC-GFP was visualized on a Western blot. Western Blotting—Boiled cells or cell extracts were loaded on 7.5% precast gels (Bio-Rad), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) that were soaked in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris-HCl, 0.037% SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3). After washing three times with TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 8.0), the membranes were blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (5% (w/v) milk powder in TBST), and subsequently incubated with B-2 anti-GFP antibody (Santa-Cruz, 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed three times again and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa-Cruz, 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The bound antibodies were visualized using a chemiluminiscence kit (Lumilight; Roche Applied Science). The RasGEF Domain of GbpC Specifically Activates the Roc Domain in Vitro—RasGEFs activate Ras proteins by catalyzing the exchange of GDP to GTP. In Dictyostelium, the RasGEF domain of GbpC is one of the at least 25 RasGEFs that were identified by computer analysis (23Wilkins A. Szafranski K. Fraser D.J. Bakthavatsalam D. Muller R. Fisher P.R. Glockner G. Eichinger L. Noegel A.A. Insall R.H. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: R68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GbpC, also referred to as gef-T, is the only protein in Dictyostelium known so far that possesses both a RasGEF domain and a Ras-like domain called Roc, making it an excellent candidate for intramolecular Ras-GEF-mediated Ras activation. To investigate the potential activation of Roc by the RasGEF domain, we performed in vitro fluorescence nucleotide exchange assays (Fig. 1A). For these experiments, the Roc-Cor fragment of GbpC was expressed in E. coli and isolated as a 63-kDa protein. The isolated Roc-Cor fragment was loaded with the fluorescence GDP analog mGDP and incubated with excess GDP in the presence or absence of a GEF. Nucleotide exchange was measured in real time as the decay of fluorescence, caused by the release of mGDP. As a control, the stability of the protein was measured by incubating the mGDP-loaded protein without GDP, and the subsequent release of mGDP followed, using the same conditions. In the presence of GDP but the absence of GEF, the fluorescence slowly decreases, indicating that the Roc domain has a slow intrinsic exchange activity, like many G-proteins. The RasGEF domain of GbpC, comprising amino acids 1410-2008, was expressed in E. coli and isolated as an N-terminal His-tagged protein. The addition of GbpC-GEF to mGDP-loaded Roc-Cor results in the rapid decrease of fluorescence, demonstrating that the RasGEF domain of GbpC possesses nucleotide exchange activity on the Roc domain. Next, we tested the specificity of this RasGEF/Roc interaction by performing the same assay with several other purified Ras proteins. The addition of GbpC RasGEF to mGDP-loaded Dictyostelium RasG and RapA, and human N-Ras and Rap1 did not result in a decrease in fluorescence (Fig. 1B). GbpC-GEF was also unable to accelerate nucleotide exchange on RasB, RasD, or RasS (data not shown). The Ras and Rap preparations used are activated by CDC25 and C3G, respectively, indicating that purified proteins are stable and functional (21Kortholt A. Rehmann H. Kae H. Bosgraaf L. Keizer-Gunnink I. Weeks G. Wittinghofer A. van Haastert P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23367-23376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). CDC25 and C3G did not activate nucleotide exchange of mGDP loaded Roc-Cor (data not shown). These results indicate that RasGEF of GbpC specifically activates Roc. Expression of GbpC Mutants—To characterize the activation mechanism of GbpC in vitro and in vivo, we cloned the complete 7.9-kb gbpC cDNA in MB74-derived Dictyostelium expression plasmids. Furthermore, we expressed several mutated and truncated GbpC-derived proteins in gbpC null cells (Fig. 2B). All of the strains expressing mutant GbpC proteins were tested for the presence of high affinity binding sites in a radio nucleotide binding assay, using 10 nm [3H]cGMP (Fig. 2C). Because GbpC is the only high affinity cGMP-target in Dictyostelium, comparison of the amount of these cGMP-binding sites between cell lines gives an accurate indication about the expression level of GbpC. Moreover, cGMP binding assures correct folding of at least the cNBDs of the protein. Expression and correct protein folding was further monitored with GFP fluorescence, Western blotting, and binding to GTP-agarose. Expression of GbpC in gbpC null cells results in a [3H]cGMP binding activity that is about 3-fold higher compared with wild-type AX3 cells (Fig. 2C). Expression of GbpC, fused to a C-terminal GFP tag, can also be monitored on a Western blot with anti-GFP antibodies: a ∼320-kDa band is visible, as well as a smaller band of ∼140 kDa, probably representing a degradation product (Fig. 3A). At extended starvation times, the presence of this product gradually decreases (Fig. 3B). The functional activity of GbpC and GbpC mutants was tested in vitro for their ability to bind GTP and in vivo to restore the chemotactic defects of gbpC null cells. cGMP Binding to GbpC Activates the Roc Domain—We hypothesized that cGMP binding to the cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (cNBDs) of GbpC could lead to the activation of GbpC. This activation could occur through direct activation of the kinase domain or via an intramolecular signaling cascade, involving Roc activation through RasGEF. In the latter case, this would mean that the GDP/GTP exchange activity of Roc should increase upon cGMP binding, resulting in an increased amount of Roc in the active GTP-bound state. To investigate the role of cGMP binding in protein function, we incubated lysates of gbpC null cells expressing GbpC-GFP with GTP-agarose beads. The amount of GbpC-GFP bound to these beads is a marker for the activation state of the Roc domain (16Korr D. Toschi L. Donner P. Pohlenz H.D. Kreft B. Weiss B. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 24Greggio E. Lewis P.A. van der Brug M.P. Ahmad R. Kaganovich A. Ding J. Beilina A. Baker A.K. Cookson M.R. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After incubation of the lysate with GTP-agarose beads, the beads were extensively washed, and bound GbpC-GFP was eluted and detected by Western blot (Fig. 3C). Similarly to LRRK1 and LRRK2, we observed that small but significant amounts of GbpC-GFP could be affinity-purified with GTP-agarose beads, but not in the presence of an excess GTP, suggesting a specific GTP-interaction. Interestingly, the addition of cGMP to the incubation mixture causes a 2-3-fold increase of GbpC binding to the GTP beads, suggesting that cGMP binding to GbpC-GFP causes activation of the Roc domain (Fig. 3C). GTP Binding to the Roc Domain Is Required for GbpC Activity—To assess the importance of the Roc domain in the activity of GbpC, we expressed in gbpC null cells a GbpC mutant that was predicted to be unable to bind GDP and GTP. In LRRK1, mutation of Lys650 caused a dramatic decrease in nucleotide affinity by the Roc domain, thus making the domain inactive (16Korr D. Toschi L. Donner P. Pohlenz H.D. Kreft B. Weiss B. Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 910-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Other GTPases with the same mutation were also shown to have the same defect, which is explained by the inactivation of the essential P-loop that is located in the nucleotide-binding pocket (25Praefcke G.J. Kloep S. Benscheid U. Lilie H. Prakash B. Herrmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). An alignment of the Roc domain of GbpC with these domains shows that the same conserved lysine is present at position 342, thus serving as a good candidate to inactivate the Roc domain (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we created a K342N mutation in GbpC and called this mutant GbpC-RocInactive. To verify the loss of nucleotide binding capacity, a Roc domain with this mutation was purified from E. coli, analogous to the purification of the Roc domain that we used for the exchange assay in Fig. 1. Contrary to the wild-type Roc domain, it was impossible to load the mutated Roc domain with GDP or GTP, confirming that the mutation indeed abolished the capacity of the Roc domain to bind these nucleotides (data not shown). To investigate the role of the Roc domain for binding to GTP beads, we performed the GTP-agarose pulldown assay with GbpC-RocInactive (Fig. 3D). Both GbpC-GFP and GbpC-Roc-InactiveGFP were expressed at similar levels in gbpC null cells. In contrast to GbpC-GFP, it was not possible to specifically pull down GbpC-RocInactiveGFP, confirming that GTP binding is mediated by the Roc domain. GbpC plays a critical role in cAMP-induced chemotaxis of Dictyostelium cells, which was measured by a small population/drop assay (19Konijn T.M. Experientia. 1970; 26: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this assay, starved cells are placed on NN-agar in small drops, close to drops containing cAMP, and observed for the ability to chemotax toward these cAMP drops. Chemotaxis of 7 h starved Dictyostelium cells is mediated by at least three signaling pathways: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PLA2, and a cGMP pathway (20Veltman D.M. Keizer-Gunnik I. Van Haastert P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells show around 50% chemotaxis, when assayed with 10-6 m cAMP, in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY and the PLA2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide. Recently, it was found that this remaining chemotaxis is abolished in cells that have disruptions in genes that encode guanylyl cyclases or GbpC (20Veltman D.M. Keizer-Gunnik I. Van Haastert P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here, we performed a rescue analysis by expressing GbpC or GbpC mutants in gbpC null cells (Fig. 4). Expression of GbpC in gbpC null cells restores chemotaxis to approximately wild-type levels. In contrast, expression of the GbpC-RocInactive mutant in gbpC null cells was unable to rescue the chemotaxis defect of gbpC null cells (Fig. 4), although the mutant was expressed at a similar level as GbpC (Fig. 2C). This suggests that a functional Roc domain is essential for a functional GbpC protein in vivo. A Functional Kinase Domain Is Essential for GbpC Activity—Active kin"
https://openalex.org/W2074810887,"Bit1 (Bcl-2 inhibitor of transcription) is a mitochondrial protein that induces caspase-independent apoptosis upon its release into the cytoplasm. Bit1 is primarily associated with anoikis (cell death induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix), because the apoptotic function of Bit1 is inhibited by integrin-mediated cell attachment but not by many other antiapoptotic treatments. Here, we show that protein kinase D (PKD) regulates Bit1 apoptotic function. Overexpression of constitutively active PKD or PKD activation by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser5 and Ser87) in a form of Bit1 that is confined to the cytoplasm and concomitantly increases the apoptotic activity of cytoplasmic Bit1. Conversely, suppressing PKD activity with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA approaches attenuates apoptosis induced by cytoplasmic Bit1. Furthermore, PKD regulates induction of cell death by wild-type Bit1 following loss of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Activation of PKD enhances Bit1 function in anoikis, whereas inhibiting PKD function with pharmacological inhibitors or small interfering RNA compromises the ability of Bit1 to induce anoikis. The induction of Bit1-mediated apoptosis by PKD is in part attributable to the release of Bit1 from mitochondria to the cytoplasm as a consequence of phosphorylation of Ser5 in the mitochondrial localization sequence of Bit1. Consistent with the regulatory role of PKD in the anoikis function of Bit1, we found that cell attachment to fibronectin inhibits PKD activity. These studies identify the PKD serine/threonine kinase as one of the signaling molecules through which integrin-mediated cell attachment controls Bit1 activity and anoikis."
https://openalex.org/W2008408998,"<i>Escherichia coli</i> membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase (mGDH), which is one of quinoproteins containing pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a coenzyme, is a good model for elucidating the function of bound quinone inside primary dehydrogenases in respiratory chains. Enzymatic analysis of purified mGDH from cells defective in synthesis of ubiquinone (UQ) and/or menaquinone (MQ) revealed that Q-free mGDH has very low levels of activity of glucose dehydrogenase and UQ<sub>2</sub> reductase compared with those of UQ-bearing mGDH, and both activities were significantly increased by reconstitution with UQ<sub>1</sub>. On the other hand, MQ-bearing mGDH retains both catalytic abilities at the same levels as those of UQ-bearing mGDH. A radiolytically generated hydrated electron reacted with the bound MQ to form a semiquinone anion radical with an absorption maximum at 400 nm. Subsequently, decay of the absorbance at 400 nm was accompanied by an increase in the absorbance at 380 nm with a first order rate constant of 5.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>. This indicated that an intramolecular electron transfer from the bound MQ to the PQQ occurred. EPR analysis revealed that characteristics of the semiquinone radical of bound MQ are similar to those of the semiquinone radical of bound UQ and indicated an electron flow from PQQ to MQ as in the case of UQ. Taken together, the results suggest that MQ is incorporated into the same pocket as that for UQ to perform a function almost equivalent to that of UQ and that bound quinone is involved at least partially in the catalytic reaction and primarily in the intramolecular electron transfer of mGDH."
https://openalex.org/W1978340655,"BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) is a multifunctional member of the transforming growth factor-beta family of growth factors. Disruption of BMP2 signaling results in developmental defects, cancers, and other diseases. BMP2 mRNAs are alternatively polyadenylated, resulting in mRNAs with distinct 3'-untranslated regions. The longer mRNA contains additional putative binding sites for post-transcriptional regulatory factors, including micro-RNAs. We combined functional assays with computational analyses of emerging genome data to define site- and species-specific polyadenylation determinants. In all mouse and human cell lines tested, shorter mRNAs resulting from using the first polyadenylation signal (PA1) were more abundant than mRNAs from the second signal (PA2). However, the PA1/PA2 usage ratios were 2-3-fold higher in human than in mouse cells. Expression of human BMP2 constructs in mouse cells and mouse constructs in human cells showed that cis-regulatory elements direct species-specific 3' processing of BMP2 transcripts. A 72-nucleotide region downstream of PA2 in the mouse sequence contains two novel cis-acting elements previously hypothesized to regulate polyadenylation in a bioinformatics analysis. Mutations that humanized the mouse-specific elements lowered the affinity for cleavage stimulation factor CstF64 and significantly weakened the PA2 signal relative to the PA1 signal. Thus, we have experimentally defined for the first time cis-regulatory elements that control a species-specific difference in the 3'-end processing of BMP2 and potentially of other genes."
