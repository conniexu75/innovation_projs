A simple three-stage analysis of flows to, from, and within the firm was used to facilitate comparisons. Even so, each of the generalizations is drawn from relatively small and unrepresentative samples. Case studies may continue to be a source of ideas and hypotheses for further research, but do not appear to offer a means for deeper understanding of the innovation process. The retrospective nature of nearly all of the sources discussed probably means that the process has been viewed as much more rational and well-ordered than it is in fact. This failing is partially overcome in firsthand accounts such as those of Suites and Bueche (63) and Frey and Goldman (64). Each of these accounts involves a successful innovation according to technical or commercial criteria, or both. However, many of the characteristics of innovations that have failed commercially (10) appear to be similar to those of successful cases. The few longitudinal studies, and studies comparing more and less successful cases, do support the main conclusions drawn above (10, 32, 38). More serious problems are raised by the distinctly nonrepresentative nature of the samples used. There are few cases (17, 33, 65) in which the contributions of more than one organization, or details of interactions over a significant period of time, are discussed. There is a wide variation in the importance of the innovations included, ranging from those affecting the economy as a whole to cases involving production in a single firm, albeit with significant commercial results (66). In addition to questions of comparability and sampling, a central problem for further research on innovation will be to devise an operational model to account for interfirm and interindustry differences. Polar definitions used in past studies, ""high technology"" and ""mature industry,"" for example, are insufficient. One possibility is to use the strategy for growth or competition evident in a firm or an industry, such as sales maximization (automotive), cost minimization (transportation, communications), performance maximization (aircraft, chemicals), or control of materials resources (mining, petroleum), as a basis for drawing distinctions (67). For example, in an industry that seeks to maximize sales, one would expect innovations that would be highly visible to consumers to be developed rapidly (68). In a cost-minimizing situation, production, as opposed to product technology, would be a major source of uncertainty, while the reverse might be the case in a performance-maximizing situation. Greater uncertainty arising from technical sources would imply greater sophistication in effective firms' product planning approaches, while a more stable technology would imply greater sophistication in market research and market-oriented strategies for innovation, and so forth. Much more work is needed along these lines if outcomes of interventions in the innovative process are to be predicted with any accuracy. Some implications for providing incentives and reducing barriers do seem clear from the work to date. Effective directions for federal action lie in strategies such as creating new markets through purchases or procurement policies; aggregating or focusing markets through regulation and other means; providing for market entry by contracts to smaller firms, venture capital, stronger patent protection, and so on; and providing for mobility and informal contacts within the technical community. Technology ""push"" strategies (such as tax incentives) to increase most research spending, prizes for new technology, and documentation and information retrieval systems would probably be less important in stimulating innovation. Definitive answers will require the most difficult kind of research-experiments in the field. Since the interventions required are difficult and expensive in most cases, they will not be under the researcher's control. Nor will the effect of policy changes be visible over a short period. Thus it seems imperative to take advantage of interventions that occur fortuitously to construct ""quasi-experiments"" (69) with as great a degree of control over other factors as possible. For example, have recent changes in policy regarding federally held patents increased the commercial use of these patents? Have changes in the capital gains laws retarded the development and growth of ""spin-off"" enterprises? Has the identification of technology gaps (3) and competitive opportunities stimulated innovation? The effects of such actions on technical innovation could be carefully observed with a modest but sustained research effort, which promises to yield valuable information beyond that available from largely historical sources."

Lanthanum deposits were found only in cell walls and on the outside of the plasma membrane of epidermal, cortical, and endodermal cells up to the Casparian strip. Lanthanum was completely absent from the stele, indicating that the Casparian strip provides an effective barrier to apoplastic movement of solutes. Inhibitory effects of trivalent lanthanum ions on the absorption of potassium ions are discussed in relation to the nature of the lanthanum ion binding site on membranes."

This hydrate dissociates upon release of pressure at temperatures between 0° and 10°C. The heat capacity of the ground would be sufficient to produce up to 4 percent (by volume) of water at a rate equal to that at which it can be drained away. Catastrophic dissociation of carbon dioxide hydrate during some past epoch when the near surface temperature was in this range would have produced chaotic terrain and flood channels."
https://openalex.org/W2009131642,"Interference by tribothermoluminescence and by regeneration thermoluminescence can be eliminated for burned flint if thin polished slices are used instead of the powders conventionally used in thermoluminescent measurements. Measurement of the internal and external radiation dose rates then makes possible the absolute determination of the date of pyrolization of small fragments of chert or chalcedony to an accuracy of about 10 to 15 percent. The method may be usable to ages in the range from 200,000 to 300,000 years before the present (B.P.). For samples from the archeological site at Carigüela in southern Spain dates from 12,000 to 50,000 years B.P. have been determined, covering deposits ranging from Late Paleolithic-Epipaleolithic to Mousterian. One Bronze Age specimen gave an age of 4,300 years B.P., in excellent agreement with the age determined by other methods."

https://openalex.org/W2016113475,"Methylation of polysaccharides in the growing primary wall of Micrasterias is localized at specific points on the wall which, by analogy with hyphal growth in fungi, are sites of maximum wall extension. Rather than being a direct cause of extension at these points, methylation may indicate an incorporation of hemicellulosic matrix substance that accompanies extension."

https://openalex.org/W2149003722,"In searching for a subject for this talk, I find that some addresses of retiring presidents have been discussions of topics relating to the social responsibilities and problems of physicists, while others have been technical reviews of research in a particular phase of physics. Professor Bridgman struck a compromise by giving a retiring address which was part political, part physical, and, being from Harvard, I have naturally decided to follow his pattern. One of the barriers about which I shall speak today is political and macroscopic, the other is physical and microscopic. As you perhaps have guessed, the political barrier phenomenon of which I will speak is that presented by the present policy of the United States regarding visas for visiting physicists from abroad. Because of limitations of time, I shall not discuss the reciprocal problem of the difficulties sometimes experienced by United States citizens in obtaining passports."

https://openalex.org/W1976832601,"The United States possesses immense deposits of coal and oil shale. The combined effects of government and industry research, and the exploding prices of conventional petroleum make synthetic oil and gas within a comfortable profit margin. At a shale oil plant, the production costs are about the same as the current price of conventional oil in the USA. Government funding is not necessary, since estimated costs of a shale or gnsification plant are not much higher than nuclear power plants that are being built privately. The AEC concludes that a massive synthetic fuel program cannot now be justified, but calls for a Synthetic Fuels Pioneer Program.'' (auth)"
