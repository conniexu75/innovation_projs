https://openalex.org/W2047125104,"Prefrontal cortex is thought to have a fundamental role in flexible, context-dependent behaviour, but the exact nature of the computations underlying this role remains largely unknown. In particular, individual prefrontal neurons often generate remarkably complex responses that defy deep understanding of their contribution to behaviour. Here we study prefrontal cortex activity in macaque monkeys trained to flexibly select and integrate noisy sensory inputs towards a choice. We find that the observed complexity and functional roles of single neurons are readily understood in the framework of a dynamical process unfolding at the level of the population. The population dynamics can be reproduced by a trained recurrent neural network, which suggests a previously unknown mechanism for selection and integration of task-relevant inputs. This mechanism indicates that selection and integration are two aspects of a single dynamical process unfolding within the same prefrontal circuits, and potentially provides a novel, general framework for understanding context-dependent computations."

(p. 948 , published online 7 November; see the Perspective by Kleckner et al. ) used chromosome conformation capture-based methods in human tissue culture cells to analyze the higher order folding of human chromosomes across the cell cycle. During interphase the chromosomes showed locus-specific compart-mentalization. In mitotic cells, on the other hand, the chromosome organization was more linear, consistent with arrays of consecutive chromatin loops."
https://openalex.org/W2094949149,"From the formation of animal flocks to the emergence of coordinate motion in bacterial swarms, at all scales populations of motile organisms display coherent collective motion. This consistent behavior strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. Guided by this universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely alignment rules at the individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations. However, more complex collective behaviors have been systematically found in experiments including the formation of vortices, fluctuating swarms, clustering and swirling. All these model systems predominantly rely on actual collisions to display collective motion. As a result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behavior of the populations therefore depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings. Here, we demonstrate a new phase of active matter. We reveal that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rollers self-organize to achieve coherent motion along a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic flock at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active populations into stable directed motion."

On 15 February 2013, the Russian district of Chelyabinsk, with a population of more than 1 million, suffered the impact and atmospheric explosion of a 20-meter-wide asteroid—the largest impact on Earth by an asteroid since 1908. Popova et al.

https://openalex.org/W1980682199,"Circadian clocks regulate numerous physiological processes that vary across the day-night (diurnal) cycle, but if and how the circadian clock regulates the adaptive immune system is mostly unclear. Interleukin-17-producing CD4(+) T helper (T(H)17) cells are proinflammatory immune cells that protect against bacterial and fungal infections at mucosal surfaces. Their lineage specification is regulated by the orphan nuclear receptor RORγt. We show that the transcription factor NFIL3 suppresses T(H)17 cell development by directly binding and repressing the Rorγt promoter. NFIL3 links T(H)17 cell development to the circadian clock network through the transcription factor REV-ERBα. Accordingly, TH17 lineage specification varies diurnally and is altered in Rev-erbα(-/-) mice. Light-cycle disruption elevated intestinal T(H)17 cell frequencies and increased susceptibility to inflammatory disease. Thus, lineage specification of a key immune cell is under direct circadian control."
https://openalex.org/W2036442917,"The transcription factor NPAS4 enables neurons to distinguish synaptic inputs received at their soma or dendrites; sensory stimulation increases NPAS4 which promotes inhibitory synapses on the soma and destabilizes inhibitory synapses on the dendrites. Individual neurons distinguish synaptic inputs received at their soma and dendrites, but how behaviour may affect their balance has been unclear. Now Michael Greenberg and colleagues show that mouse hippocampus neurons respond to sensory enrichment with increased levels of the transcription factor NPAS4 and its target-gene product, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which then promotes inhibitory synapses on the cell body while destabilizing those on dendrites. Thus individual neurons respond to sensory stimulation by redrawing the map of their inhibitory inputs, restricting their somatic output while promoting plasticity at their dendrites. A heterogeneous population of inhibitory neurons controls the flow of information through a neural circuit1,2,3. Inhibitory synapses that form on pyramidal neuron dendrites modulate the summation of excitatory synaptic potentials4,5,6 and prevent the generation of dendritic calcium spikes7,8. Precisely timed somatic inhibition limits both the number of action potentials and the time window during which firing can occur8,9. The activity-dependent transcription factor NPAS4 regulates inhibitory synapse number and function in cell culture10, but how this transcription factor affects the inhibitory inputs that form on distinct domains of a neuron in vivo was unclear. Here we show that in the mouse hippocampus behaviourally driven expression of NPAS4 coordinatesthe redistribution of inhibitory synapses made onto a CA1 pyramidal neuron, simultaneously increasing inhibitory synapse number on the cell body while decreasing the number of inhibitory synapses on the apical dendrites. This rearrangement of inhibition is mediated in part by the NPAS4 target gene brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), which specifically regulates somatic, and not dendritic, inhibition. These findings indicate that sensory stimuli, by inducing NPAS4 and its target genes, differentially control spatial features of neuronal inhibition in a way that restricts the output of the neuron while creating a dendritic environment that is permissive for plasticity."

Lindeboom et al. ( 10.1126/science.1245533 , published online 7 November; see the Perspective by Roll-Mecak ) used live-cell imaging and genetic studies to show that the microtubule-severing protein, katanin, plays a crucial role in reorienting cortical arrays from transverse to longitudinal in Arabidopsis seedlings in response to blue light perception. Katanin localized to microtubule intersections where, stimulated by blue light receptors, it preferentially catalyzed the severing of the newer microtubule. The microtubule “plus” end created by severing were observed to grow preferentially, effectively building a new population of microtubules orthogonal to the initial array. The net effect of this process steers the growing seedling toward light."

https://openalex.org/W2034817348,"Digestive physiology has played a prominent role in explanations for terrestrial herbivore body size evolution and size-driven diversification and niche differentiation. This is based on the association of increasing body mass (BM) with diets of lower quality, and with putative mechanisms by which a higher BM could translate into a higher digestive efficiency. Such concepts, however, often do not match empirical data. Here, we review concepts and data on terrestrial herbivore BM, diet quality, digestive physiology and metabolism, and in doing so give examples for problems in using allometric analyses and extrapolations. A digestive advantage of larger BM is not corroborated by conceptual or empirical approaches. We suggest that explanatory models should shift from physiological to ecological scenarios based on the association of forage quality and biomass availability, and the association between BM and feeding selectivity. These associations mostly (but not exclusively) allow large herbivores to use low quality forage only, whereas they allow small herbivores the use of any forage they can physically manage. Examples of small herbivores able to subsist on lower quality diets are rare but exist. We speculate that this could be explained by evolutionary adaptations to the ecological opportunity of selective feeding in smaller animals, rather than by a physiologic or metabolic necessity linked to BM. For gigantic herbivores such as sauropod dinosaurs, other factors than digestive physiology appear more promising candidates to explain evolutionary drives towards extreme BM."

At least three 3’UTR polymorphic sites have been associated with HLA-G mRNA regulation, including the 14 base pair (14bp) Insertion/Deletion, +3142C-G and +3187A-G. We studied the association of polymorphic sites at 3’UTR (sequencing analysis, encompassing the 14bp Ins-Del/+3003T-C/+3010C-G/+3027C-A/+3035C-T/+3142C-G/+3187A-G/+3196C-G polymorphic sites) with plasma soluble HLA-G levels (sHLA-G, detected by ELISA) in 187 French and 153 Brazilian healthy individuals. Allele and genotype frequencies were closely similar in both populations; however, Brazilians showed a higher HLA-G 3’UTR haplotype diversity. Considering sHLA-G levels in both populations altogether, individuals presenting 14bp Del/Del showed higher levels compared to 14bpIns/Ins genotype (P <0.05); those presenting +3010C/G showed higher levels compared to the +3010C-C genotype (P< 0.05); those presenting +3027C-C showed higher levels than the +3027A-A genotype (P< 0.05); and those bearing +3035C-C showed higher levels compared to the +3035C-T (P < 0.01) and +3035T-T (P < 0.05) genotypes. The analyses of 3’UTR haplotypes showed that UTR-1 (DelTGCCCGC) was associated with higher expression of sHLA-G, whereas UTR-5 (InsTCCTGAC) and UTR-7 (InsTCATGAC) with lower expression and other UTRs (UTR-2/3/4/6) exhibited intermediate levels. Since the differential expression of HLA-G may be beneficial or harmful depending on the underlying condition, the identification of individuals genetically programmed to differentially express HLA-G may help on defining novel strategies to control the immune response against the underlying disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1990731282,"Introduction Initiation of protein synthesis is a key step in the control of gene expression. In eukaryotes, initiation is a highly complex process that requires almost a dozen protein factors. The last step involves joining of the large and small subunits of the ribosome to form the 80 S initiation complex with the transfer RNA (tRNA) in the P-site base paired to the start codon. This step is catalyzed by the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) factor eIF5B. In addition, eIF5B is thought to play a role in ensuring that translation initiation takes place only on mature ribosomes. Methods The development of fast, direct electron detectors and new methods of image analysis for cryo–electron microscopy allow high-resolution reconstructions from much smaller numbers of particles than previously possible. We used these new methods to provide feedback to improve the biochemical preparation of samples for structure determination of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex with initiator tRNA and eIF5B, which was trapped on the ribosome with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GDPCP. Results Although the structure of the fully assembled complex was calculated from only 5143 particles, representing just 3% of the population in the sample, it was possible to obtain a resolution of 6.6 Å. This allowed us to propose a molecular model for the initiation complex. The structure shows that the subunits of the ribosome are rotated relative to the canonical state after initiation. The long helix and C-terminal domain of eIF5B have changed conformation and moved into the ribosome, where the C-terminal domain interacts with the initiator tRNA. The tRNA is stabilized in a distorted conformation, with its 3′-CCA end out of the peptidyl transferase center. Discussion The conformational change in eIF5B may be induced upon binding to the small (40 S ) subunit when it specifically recognizes initiator tRNA. In its altered conformation, eIF5B interacts simultaneously with the initiator tRNA and the GTPase center of the ribosome, thus coupling GTP hydrolysis with tRNA recognition in the ribosome. The large number of contacts made by eIF5B with the ribosomal subunits and tRNA is consistent with its role in subunit joining. A close contact with the eukaryote-specific ribosomal protein L40 would not be possible in the immature ubiquitinated form of L40, thus precluding the recruitment of immature 60 S subunits. A comparison with previous work on the bacterial homolog IF2 suggests that the mechanism of this step of initiation is conserved across kingdoms. Finally, the use of recent advances in cryo-EM to determine a relatively high-resolution structure of the eIF5B-ribosome complex from a very small fraction of a sample could be a general approach for the study of other dynamic or transient biological complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2133907326,"Economic development and growth depend on growing levels of resource use, and result in environmental impacts from large scale resource extraction and emissions of waste. In this study, we examine the resource dependency of economic activities over the past several decades for a set of countries comprising developing, emerging and mature industrialized economies. Rather than a single universal industrial development pathway, we find a diversity of economic dependencies on material use, made evident through cluster analysis. We conduct tests for relative and absolute decoupling of the economy from material use, and compare these with similar tests for decoupling from carbon emissions, both for single countries and country groupings using panel analysis. We show that, over the longer term, emerging and developing countries tend to have significantly larger material-economic coupling than mature industrialized economies (although this effect may be enhanced by trade patterns), but that the contrary is true for short-term coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that absolute dematerialization limits economic growth rates, while the successful industrialization of developing countries inevitably requires a strong material component. Alternative development priorities are thus urgently needed both for mature and emerging economies: reducing absolute consumption levels for the former, and avoiding the trap of resource-intensive economic and human development for the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2030063383,"Sustained activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) leads to hepatic fibrosis, which is characterized by excessive collagen production, and for which there is no available drug clinically. Despite tremendous progress, the cellular activities underlying HSC activation, especially the driving force in the perpetuation stage, are only partially understood. Recently, microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been found to be prevalently up-regulated during fibrogenesis in different tissues, although its detailed role needs to be further elucidated. In the present study, miR-21 expression was examined in human cirrhotic liver samples and in murine fibrotic livers induced by thioacetamide or carbon tetrachloride. A dramatic miR-21 increase was noted in activated HSCs. We further found that miR-21 maintained itself at constant high levels by using a microRNA-21/programmed cell death protein 4/activation protein-1 (miR-21/PDCD4/AP-1) feedback loop. Disrupting this loop with miR-21 antagomir or AP-1 inhibitors significantly suppressed fibrogenic activities in HSCs and ameliorated liver fibrosis. In contrast, reinforcing this loop with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PDCD4 promoted fibrogenesis in HSCs. Further analysis indicated that the up-regulated miR-21 promoted the central transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway underlying HSC activation. In summary, we suggest that the miR-21/PDCD4/AP-1 autoregulatory loop is one of the main driving forces for hepatic fibrosis progression. Targeting this aberrantly activated feedback loop may provide a new therapeutic strategy and facilitate drug discovery against hepatic fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2057213628,"Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major bioactive component of marijuana, has been shown to induce functional myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in vivo. Here, we studied the involvement of microRNA (miRNA) in this process. CD11b(+)Gr-1(+) MDSCs were purified from peritoneal exudates of mice administered with THC and used for genome-wide miRNA profiling. Expression of CD31 and Ki-67 confirmed that the THC-MDSCs were immature and proliferating. THC-induced MDSCs exhibited distinct miRNA expression signature relative to various myeloid cells and BM precursors. We identified 13 differentially expressed (>2-fold) miRNA in THC-MDSCs relative to control BM precursors. In silico target prediction for these miRNA and pathway analysis using multiple bioinformatics tools revealed significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology clusters within hematopoiesis, myeloid cell differentiation, and regulation categories. Insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling involved in cell growth and proliferation, and myeloid differentiation pathways were among the most significantly enriched canonical pathways. Among the differentially expressed, miRNA-690 was highly overexpressed in THC-MDSCs (∼16-fold). Transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) was identified as a potential functional target of miR-690. Supporting this, C/EBPα expression was attenuated in THC-MDSCs as compared with BM precursors and exhibited an inverse relation with miR-690. miR-690 knockdown using peptide nucleic acid-antagomiR was able to unblock and significantly increase C/EBPα expression establishing the functional link. Further, CD11b(+)Ly6G(+)Ly6C(+) and CD11b(+)Ly6G(-)Ly6C(+) purified subtypes showed high levels of miR-690 with attenuated C/EBPα expression. Moreover, EL-4 tumor-elicited MDSCs showed increased miR-690 expression. In conclusion, miRNA are significantly altered during the generation of functional MDSC from BM. Select miRNA such as miR-690 targeting genes involved in myeloid expansion and differentiation likely play crucial roles in this process and therefore in cannabinoid-induced immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2073342000,"'Medical Tourism' - the phenomenon of people travelling abroad to access medical treatment - has received increasing attention in academic and popular media. This paper reports findings from a study examining effect of inbound and outbound medical tourism on the UK NHS, by estimating volume of medical tourism and associated costs and benefits. A mixed methods study it includes analysis of the UK International Passenger Survey (IPS); interviews with 77 returning UK medical tourists, 63 policymakers, NHS managers and medical tourism industry actors policymakers, and a review of published literature. These informed costing of three types of treatments for which patients commonly travel abroad: fertility treatment, cosmetic and bariatric surgery. Costing of inbound tourism relied on data obtained through 28 Freedom-of-Information requests to NHS Foundation Trusts. Findings demonstrate that contrary to some popular media reports, far from being a net importer of patients, the UK is now a clear net exporter of medical travellers. In 2010, an estimated 63,000 UK residents travelled for treatment, while around 52,000 patients sought treatment in the UK. Inbound medical tourists treated as private patients within NHS facilities may be especially profitable when compared to UK private patients, yielding close to a quarter of revenue from only 7% of volume in the data examined. Costs arise where patients travel abroad and return with complications. Analysis also indicates possible savings especially in future health care and social costs averted. These are likely to be specific to procedures and conditions treated. UK medical tourism is a growing phenomenon that presents risks and opportunities to the NHS. To fully understand its implications and guide policy on issues such as NHS global activities and patient safety will require investment in further research and monitoring. Results point to likely impact of medical tourism in other universal public health systems."

https://openalex.org/W2138644340,"Background Many vertebrates distinguish between short and long day lengths using suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). In birds particular, the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) is suggested to be involved in the timing of seasonal reproduction. This study investigated the response of SCN and MBH to a single long day, and the role of MBH in induction of the migratory phenotype in night-migratory blackheaded buntings. Methodology/Principal Findings Experiment 1 immunocytochemically measured c-fos in the SCN, and c-fos, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the MBH of buntings exposed to a 20 h light period. Long light period induced significantly stronger c-fos expression, measured as number of c-fos-like immunoreactive (c-fos-lir) cells, in MBH, but not in the SCN. Within the MBH, c-fos-lir cells were significantly denser in the inferior hypothalamic nucleus (IH) and infundibular nucleus (IN), but not in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). IH and IN also had significantly increased number of VIP and NPY labeled cells. DMH had significantly increased number of VIP labeled cells only. Experiment 2 assayed c-fos, VIP and NPY immunoreactivities in the middle of day and night in the MBH of buntings, after seven long days (day active, non-migratory state) and after seven days of Zugunruhe (night active, migratory state) in long days. In the migratory state, the number of c-fos-lir cells was significantly greater only in DMH; VIP-lir cells were denser in all three MBH regions suggesting enhanced light sensitivity at night. The denser NPY-lir cells only in IN in the non-migratory state were probably due to premigratory hyperphagia. Conclusions/Significance In buntings, SCN may not be involved in the photoperiod-induced seasonal responses. MBH contains the seasonal clock sensitive to day length. VIP and NPY are parts of the neuroendocrine mechanism(s) involved, respectively, in sensing and translating the photoperiodic message in a seasonal response."
https://openalex.org/W2154254852,"Mitochondrial dysfunction in white adipose tissue plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence specifically suggests that altered oxidative phosphorylation in adipocytes may have a relevant effect on systemic glucose homeostasis, requiring understanding of adipocyte bioenergetics. We analyzed energetic flux of an intact human adipocyte cell model by plate-based respirometry and extracellular acidification. During differentiation, we discovered that glycolytic ATP production was increasingly replaced by mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (from 20 to 60%). This observation was corroborated by simultaneous up-regulation of canonical mitochondrial gene programs, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC1α; 150-fold) and cytochrome c-1 (CytC; 3-fold). Mimicking diabetic phenotypes by exposure to various glucose levels (0, 5, and 25 mM) resulted in immediate adjustments of glycolytic and mitochondrial activity that aimed to maintain intracellular ATP. We conclude that ATP deficits by mitochondrial failure are compensated by glycolytic ATP production, resulting in inefficient conversion of glucose to cellular ATP. Metabolic inefficiency may enhance glucose uptake, therefore improving systemic glucose homeostasis. Notably, mature adipocytes developed a high spare respiratory capacity (increased by 6-fold) permitting rapid adaptation to metabolic changes. Spare respiratory capacity may also allow additional metabolic scope for energy dissipation, potentially offering new therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983350301,"The human AAA ATPase p97 is a molecular chaperone essential in cellular proteostasis. Single amino acid substitutions in p97 have been linked to a clinical multiple-disorder condition known as inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia. How the mutations affect the molecular mechanism that governs the function of p97 remains unclear. Here, we show that within the hexameric ring of a mutant p97, D1 domains fail to regulate their respective nucleotide-binding states, as evidenced by the lower amount of prebound ADP, weaker ADP binding affinity, full occupancy of adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding, and elevated overall ATPase activity, indicating a loss of communication among subunits. Defective communication between subunits is further illustrated by altered conformation in the side chain of residue Phe-360 that probes into the nucleotide-binding pocket from a neighboring subunit. Consequently, conformations of N domains in a hexameric ring of a mutant p97 become uncoordinated, thus impacting its ability to process substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2113488569,"αβ T-cell receptors (TCRs) engage antigens using complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops that are either germ line-encoded (CDR1 and CDR2) or somatically rearranged (CDR3). TCR ligands compose a presentation platform (major histocompatibility complex (MHC)) and a variable antigenic component consisting of a short ""foreign"" peptide. The sequence of events when the TCR engages its peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligand remains unclear. Some studies suggest that the germ line elements of the TCR engage the MHC prior to peptide scanning, but this order of binding is difficult to reconcile with some TCR-pMHC structures. Here, we used TCRs that exhibited enhanced pMHC binding as a result of mutations in either CDR2 and/or CDR3 loops, that bound to the MHC or peptide, respectively, to dissect the roles of these loops in stabilizing TCR-pMHC interactions. Our data show that TCR-peptide interactions play a strongly dominant energetic role providing a binding mode that is both temporally and energetically complementary with a system requiring positive selection by self-pMHC in the thymus and rapid recognition of non-self-pMHC in the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2171153029,"Activation of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) promotes fibrosis and collagen synthesis. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear, not least because cAMP, its principal effector, has been found to inhibit TGFβ1-induced collagen synthesis. Here, we show that in primary normal human dermal fibroblasts, A2AR stimulation with CGS21680 elicits a modest cAMP increase (150±12% of control; EC50 54.8 nM), which stimulates collagen1 (Col1) and collagen3 (Col3), but maximal cAMP resulting from direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin (15,689±7038% of control; EC50 360.7 nM) inhibits Col1 and increases Col3. Similar to Col1 expression, fibroblast proliferation increased following physiological cAMP increases by CGS21680 but was inhibited by cAMP increases beyond the physiological range by forskolin. The A2AR-mediated increase of Col1 and Col3 was mediated by AKT, while Col3, but not Col1, expression was dependent on p38 and repressed by ERK. TGFβ1 induced phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and increased Col3 expression, which was prevented by Smad3 depletion. In contrast, CGS21680 did not activate Smad2/3, and Smad2/3 knockdown did not prevent CGS21680-induced Col1 or Col3 increases.

In this study direct coupling between LVDCC (Cav1.2) and BKCa and the role of caveoline-1 on their interaction in mouse mesenteric artery SMCs were examined. The direct activation of BKCa by Ca(2+) influx through coupling LVDCC was demonstrated by patch clamp recordings in freshly isolated VSMCs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, it was found that a large part of yellow fluorescent protein-tagged BKCa co-localized with the cyan fluorescent protein-tagged Cav1.2 expressed in the plasma membrane of primary cultured mouse VSMCs and that the two molecules often exhibited FRET. It is notable that each BKα subunit of a tetramer in BKCa can directly interact with Cav1.2 and promotes Cav1.2 cluster in the molecular complex. Furthermore, caveolin-1 deficiency in knock-out (KO) mice significantly reduced not only the direct coupling between BKCa and Cav1.2 but also the functional coupling between BKCa and ryanodine receptor in VSMCs. The measurement of single cell shortening by 40 mm K(+) revealed enhanced contractility in VSMCs from KO mice than wild type. Taken together, caveolin-1 facilitates the accumulation/clustering of BKCa-LVDCC complex in caveolae, which effectively regulates spatiotemporal Ca(2+) dynamics including the negative feedback, to control the arterial excitability and contractility."

Over 100 pathogenic mutations in peripherin cause inherited rod- and cone-related dystrophies in humans. Peripherin and ROM1 interact in vivo and are predicted to form a core heterotetrameric complex capable of creating higher order oligomers. However, structural analysis of tetraspanin proteins has been hampered by their resistance to crystallization. Here we present a simplified methodology for high yield purification of peripherin-ROM1 from bovine retinas that permitted its biochemical and biophysical characterization. Using size exclusion chromatography and blue native gel electrophoresis, we confirmed that the core native peripherin-ROM1 complex exists as a tetramer. Peripherin, but not ROM1, is glycosylated and we examined the glycosylation site and glycan composition of ROM1 by liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry was used to analyze the native complex in detergent micelles, demonstrating its tetrameric state. Our electron microscopy-generated structure solved to 18 Å displayed the tetramer as an elongated structure with an apparent 2-fold symmetry. Finally, we demonstrated that peripherin-ROM1 tetramers induce membrane curvature when reconstituted in lipid vesicles. These results provide critical insights into this key retinal component with a poorly defined function.

https://openalex.org/W1975865328,"Transmembrane mucins, MUC4 and MUC16 are associated with tumor progression and metastatic potential in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We discovered that miR-200c interacts with specific sequences within the coding sequence of MUC4 and MUC16 mRNAs, and evaluated the regulatory nature of this association. Pancreatic cancer cell lines S2.028 and T3M-4 transfected with miR-200c showed a 4.18 and 8.50 fold down regulation of MUC4 mRNA, and 4.68 and 4.82 fold down regulation of MUC16 mRNA compared to mock-transfected cells, respectively. A significant reduction of glycoprotein expression was also observed. These results indicate that miR-200c overexpression regulates MUC4 and MUC16 mucins in pancreatic cancer cells by directly targeting the mRNA coding sequence of each, resulting in reduced levels of MUC4 and MUC16 mRNA and protein. These data suggest that, in addition to regulating proteins that modulate EMT, miR-200c influences expression of cell surface mucins in pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2046099289,"In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the translocation of β-catenin is important for the activation of target genes in the nucleus. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its nuclear localization remain unclear. In the present study, we found IQGAP1 to be a regulator of β-catenin function via importin-β5. In Xenopus embryos, depletion of IQGAP1 reduced Wnt-induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and expression of Wnt target genes during early embryogenesis. Depletion of endogenous importin-β5 associated with IQGAP1 also reduced expression of Wnt target genes and the nuclear localization of IQGAP1 and β-catenin. Moreover, a small GTPase, Ran1, contributes to the nuclear translocation of β-catenin and the activation of Wnt target genes. These results suggest that IQGAP1 functions as a regulator of translocation of β-catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2035130927,"Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is abundantly expressed in the mitochondrial inner membrane of brown adipose tissues and has an important role in heat generation, mediated by its proton transport function. The structure and function of UCP1 are not fully understood, partially due to the difficulty in obtaining native-like folded proteins in vitro. In this study, using the auto-induction method, we have successfully expressed UCP1 in Escherichia coli membranes in high yield. Overexpressed UCP1 in bacterial membranes was extracted using mild detergents and reconstituted into phospholipid bilayers for biochemical studies. UCP1 was folded in octyl glucoside, as indicated by its high helical content and binding to ATP, a known UCP1 proton transport inhibitor. Reconstituted UCP1 in phospholipid vesicles also exhibited highly helical structures and proton transport that is activated by fatty acids and inhibited by purine nucleotides. Self-associated functional forms of UCP1 in lipid membranes were observed for the first time. The self-assembly of UCP1 into tetramers was unambiguously characterized by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and semi-native gel electrophoresis. In addition, the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin stabilized the structure of associated UCP1 and enhanced the proton transport activity of the protein. The existence of the functional oligomeric states of UCP1 in the lipid membranes has important implications for understanding the structure and proton transport mechanism of this protein in brown adipose tissues as well as structure-function relationships of other mammalian UCPs in other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2129552266,"Increased intra-subject variability of reaction times (ISV-RT) is one of the most consistent findings in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although the nature of this phenomenon is still unclear, it has been hypothesised to reflect interference from the Default Mode Network (DMN). So far, ISV-RT has been operationally defined either as a frequency spectrum of the underlying RT time series, or as a measure of dispersion of the RT scores distribution. Here, we use a novel RT analysis framework to link these hitherto unconnected facets of ISV-RT by determining the sensitivity of different measures of RT dispersion to the frequency content of the underlying RT time series. N=27 patients with ADHD and N=26 healthy controls performed several visual N-back tasks. Different measures of RT dispersion were repeatedly modelled after individual frequency bands of the underlying RT time series had been either extracted or suppressed using frequency-domain filtering. We found that the intra-subject standard deviation of RT preserves the ""1/f noise"" characteristic typical of human RT data. Furthermore and most importantly, we found that the ex-Gaussian parameter τ is rather exclusively sensitive to frequencies below 0.025 Hz in the underlying RT time series and that the particularly slow RTs, which nourish τ, occur regularly as part of an quasi-periodic, ultra-slow RT fluctuation. Overall, our results are compatible with the idea that ISV-RT is modulated by an endogenous, slowly fluctuating process that may reflect DMN interference."

Fe-S cluster biogenesis proteins work together to mobilize sulfide and iron, form the nascent cluster, traffic the cluster to target metalloproteins, and regulate the assembly machinery in response to cellular Fe-S cluster demand. A complex series of protein-protein interactions is required for the assembly machinery to function properly. Despite considerable progress in obtaining static three-dimensional structures of the assembly proteins, little is known about transient protein-protein interactions during cluster assembly or the role of protein dynamics in the cluster assembly process. The Escherichia coli cysteine desulfurase SufS (EC 2.8.1.7) and its accessory protein SufE work together to mobilize persulfide from l-cysteine, which is then donated to the SufB Fe-S cluster scaffold. Here we use amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to characterize SufS-SufE interactions and protein dynamics in solution. HDX-MS analysis shows that SufE binds near the SufS active site to accept persulfide from Cys-364. Furthermore, SufE binding initiates allosteric changes in other parts of the SufS structure that likely affect SufS catalysis and alter SufS monomer-monomer interactions. SufE enhances the initial l-cysteine substrate binding to SufS and formation of the external aldimine with pyridoxal phosphate required for early steps in SufS catalysis. Together, these results provide a new picture of the SufS-SufE sulfur transferase pathway and suggest a more active role for SufE in promoting the SufS cysteine desulfurase reaction for Fe-S cluster assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2083716168,"Due to the high sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to physiological motion, clinical DTI scans often suffer a significant amount of artifacts. Tensor-fitting-based, post-processing outlier rejection is often used to reduce the influence of motion artifacts. Although it is an effective approach, when there are multiple corrupted data, this method may no longer correctly identify and reject the corrupted data. In this paper, we introduce a new criterion called ""corrected Inter-Slice Intensity Discontinuity"" (cISID) to detect motion-induced artifacts. We compared the performance of algorithms using cISID and other existing methods with regard to artifact detection. The experimental results show that the integration of cISID into fitting-based methods significantly improves the retrospective detection performance at post-processing analysis. The performance of the cISID criterion, if used alone, was inferior to the fitting-based methods, but cISID could effectively identify severely corrupted images with a rapid calculation time. In the second part of this paper, an outlier rejection scheme was implemented on a scanner for real-time monitoring of image quality and reacquisition of the corrupted data. The real-time monitoring, based on cISID and followed by post-processing, fitting-based outlier rejection, could provide a robust environment for routine DTI studies."
https://openalex.org/W2003428468,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that impair its expression and/or chloride channel function. Here, we provide evidence that type 4 cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDE4s) are critical regulators of the cAMP/PKA-dependent activation of CFTR in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. In non-CF cells, PDE4 inhibition increased CFTR activity under basal conditions (ΔISC 7.1 μA/cm(2)) and after isoproterenol stimulation (increased ΔISC from 13.9 to 21.0 μA/cm(2)) and slowed the return of stimulated CFTR activity to basal levels by >3-fold. In cells homozygous for ΔF508-CFTR, the most common mutation found in CF, PDE4 inhibition alone produced minimal channel activation. However, PDE4 inhibition strongly amplified the effects of CFTR correctors, drugs that increase expression and membrane localization of CFTR, and/or CFTR potentiators, drugs that increase channel gating, to reach ∼ 25% of the chloride conductance observed in non-CF cells. Biochemical studies indicate that PDE4s are anchored to CFTR and mediate a local regulation of channel function. Taken together, our results implicate PDE4 as an important determinant of CFTR activity in airway epithelia, and support the use of PDE4 inhibitors to potentiate the therapeutic benefits of CFTR correctors and potentiators."

https://openalex.org/W2049797818,"Genome sequencing revealed an extreme AT-rich genome and a profusion of asparagine repeats associated with low complexity regions (LCRs) in proteins of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Despite their abundance, the function of these LCRs remains unclear. Because they occur in almost all families of plasmodial proteins, the occurrence of LCRs cannot be associated with any specific metabolic pathway; yet their accumulation must have given selective advantages to the parasite. Translation of these asparagine-rich LCRs demands extraordinarily high amounts of asparaginylated tRNA(Asn). However, unlike other organisms, Plasmodium codon bias is not correlated to tRNA gene copy number. Here, we studied tRNA(Asn) accumulation as well as the catalytic capacities of the asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase of the parasite in vitro. We observed that asparaginylation in this parasite can be considered standard, which is expected to limit the availability of asparaginylated tRNA(Asn) in the cell and, in turn, slow down the ribosomal translation rate when decoding asparagine repeats. This observation strengthens our earlier hypothesis considering that asparagine rich sequences act as ""tRNA sponges"" and help cotranslational folding of parasite proteins. However, it also raises many questions about the mechanistic aspects of the synthesis of asparagine repeats and about their implications in the global control of protein expression throughout Plasmodium life cycle."

In comparison to previous research, which has mainly focused on the phenomenological experience and the age distribution of retrieved events, the present study provides a novel view on the retrieval of event information by quantifying the information as semantic representations. We investigated the semantic representation of sensory cued autobiographical events and studied the modality hierarchy within the multimodal retrieval cues. The experiment comprised a cued recall task, where the participants were presented with visual, auditory, olfactory or multimodal retrieval cues and asked to recall autobiographical events. The results indicated that the three different unimodal retrieval cues generate significantly different semantic representations. Further, the auditory and the visual modalities contributed the most to the semantic representation of the multimodally retrieved events. Finally, the semantic representation of the multimodal condition could be described as a combination of the three unimodal conditions. In conclusion, these results suggest that the meaning of the retrieved event information depends on the modality of the retrieval cues."

NF-κB activity is normally low in vessels but is rapidly activated during vascular injury. Degradation of IκBα and increased NF-κB-dependent gene expression was observed after balloon injury (16Landry D.B. Couper L.L. Bryant S.R. Lindner V. Activation of the NF-κB and IκB system in smooth muscle cells after rat arterial injury. Induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 1085-1095PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, administration of an IκBα adenovirus during angioplasty decreased ICAM-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) expression as well as macrophage recruitment and lumen narrowing (17Breuss J.M.

The physical and functional interaction between vascular cells and macrophages is therefore critical during vascular remodeling, and the identification of mediators of this interaction is significant for understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to vascular disease. Here we report that the PSD-95, Discs-large, and ZO1 (PDZ)-scaffolding protein EBP50 is a central mediator of this interaction. EBP50, also known as Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF1), is a scaffolding protein that assembles signal transduction complexes through its two PDZ domains (18Reczek D. Berryman M.

The association of NHERF adaptor proteins with G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This adaptor protein also contains an ezrin-binding domain (EBD) that tethers binding partners to the cytoskeleton. In healthy vessels, EBP50 is predominantly expressed by endothelial cells and, at lower levels, by VSMC. EBP50 is significantly up-regulated in the neointima formed after endoluminal injury (20Song G.J. Barrick S. Leslie K.L. Sicari B. Fiaschi-Taesch N.M. Bisello A.

EBP50 increases VSMC proliferation and motility, and consequently neointima formation following wire injury is greatly reduced in EBP50−/− mice (20Song G.J. Barrick S. Leslie K.L. Sicari B.

However, the molecular mediators that increase EBP50 expression in injured vessels are not known. Similarly, the effects of EBP50 on inflammation and on the response of vascular cells to inflammatory stimuli have not been established. In this study, we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine the mechanisms controlling EBP50 expression and the role of EBP50 on NF-κB signaling and inflammation. Our observations indicate that EBP50 and NF-κB participate in a feed-forward loop propagating macrophage activation and enhancing vascular inflammation. The N-terminal FLAG-tagged EBP50 mutants were constructed as described previously (22Song G.J. Leslie K.L. Barrick S. Bougoin S. Taboas J.M. Bisello A. EBP50 promotes focal adhesion turnover and vascular smooth muscle cells migration.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2012; 53: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The PKCζ-EESA mutant construct was made from wild-type PKCζ (a generous gift from Peter Parker, King's College London) by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Mutagenic primers were designed based on rat PKCζ sequence (5′-GTCTGCTGAGGAGTCCGCGTGACTCTAGAG-3′). N-terminally CFP-tagged PKCζ was constructed by inserting WT PKCζ into a pcDNA3-CFP vector (Addgene plasmid 13030, a generous gift from Doug Golenbock). DNA sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis (GENEWIZ). Animal surgeries were performed in 10-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice and EBP50−/− littermates. Mice were anesthetized using Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (5 mg/kg) intramuscularly. A 0.015-inch diameter fixed core wire guide (Cook Medical Inc.) was inserted into the left femoral artery and passed within the artery three times. The right femoral artery was used as uninjured control artery. Femoral arteries were harvested 1 week after surgery. For the LPS studies, mice were injected with 10 mg/kg of LPS intraperitoneally for the indicated times before sacrifice. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and the serum was used in a TNFα ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The aorta and femoral arteries were also harvested and analyzed as described later. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To isolate peritoneal macrophages, mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and cervical dislocation, and warm RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was injected into the abdominal cavity. After gentle shaking for 1–2 min, the lavage was collected, and cells (3 × 106) were plated in 6-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cultures were vigorously washed with cold PBS to remove nonadherent cells. Macrophages were incubated overnight in 5% CO2 at 37 °C before treatment to allow for quiescence. Primary VSMC were isolated from abdominal aortic explants and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS in 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (22Song G.J. Leslie K.L. Barrick S. Bougoin S. Taboas J.M.

Monolayers of clonal mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages (ATCC) were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS.

Various constructs including pcDNA3.1, p65-FLAG, PKCζ, PKCζ-EESA, FLAG-EBP50, FLAG-EBP50-S1S2, and FLAG-EBP50-ΔEBD were introduced into VSMC by electroporation using an AMAXA electroporator and the basic Nucleofector kit for primary smooth muscle cells (Lonza) as described previously (22Song G.J.

Cells were incubated with adenovirus in serum-free medium for 1 h and incubated with 10% FBS-supplemented medium overnight. Experiments were performed at 48 h after infection. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and transfected using X-tremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) for human EBP50 knockdown was generated by Thermo Scientific as follows: 5′GGAGAACAGUCGUGAAGCCUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCUUCACGACUGUUCUCCUU-3′ (antisense). Accell nontargeting siRNA (Thermo Scientific) was used as control siRNA. HUVEC were transfected with siRNA using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used for experiments 2–3 days later. VSMC and macrophages were treated with 1 μg/ml and 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma, catalogue number L4516, source Escherichia coli 0127:B8), respectively. Recombinant mouse TNFα and IL-4 (R&D Systems) were used at a concentration of 10 and 20 ng/ml, respectively, for all cell treatments unless otherwise indicated. Cells were preincubated with inhibitors as indicated for 1 h, including 60 μm IKK inhibitor II (Calbiochem) and 25 μm PKCζ pseudosubstrate (Calbiochem). VSMC and HUVEC were serum-starved overnight with 0.1% FBS in DMEM and EBM-2, respectively, prior to experiments. Cells were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (4 m urea, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with antibodies (1:500 dilution for all except p65, FLAG (both 1:1000), and actin (1:2000)) to EBP50, VCAM-1, IκBα, PKCζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-IKKα/β (Ser-176/180), IKKβ, phospho-IκBα (Ser-32), phospho-p65 (Ser-536) (Cell Signaling Technology), p65, IL-1β (Abcam), iNOS (BD Biosciences), β-actin, and FLAG (Sigma) with secondary mouse or rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:2000 dilution). CHO cells were transfected as described above and treated with TNFα for 2 min before lysis in radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal amounts of protein were incubated with anti-PKCζ (1:500) for 24 h at 4 °C before a 1-h incubation with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were washed three times with cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (1 m Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) before elution with sample buffer and subsequent immunoblotting. RNA was isolated from cells and tissue using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using Im-Prom II reverse transcription system (Promega). Mouse primers to EBP50, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, IL-10, and GAPDH and human primers to VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were designed using Primer 3 software and synthesized by Invitrogen. The specific primers were as follows: EBP50, forward 5′-AGTGCAAAGTGATCCCATCC-3′, reverse 5′-GAGGGCTCTGTGGAAACTTG-3′; VCAM-1 (mouse), forward 5′-CAGGCTGGAGATTGATCTG-3′, reverse 5′-GAGAGATGTAGAGTTGTAGTTC-3′; VCAM-1 (human), forward 5′-TAAAATGCCTGGGAAGATGG-3′, reverse 5′-GGTGCTGCAAGTCAATGAGA-3′; ICAM-1 (mouse), forward 5′-GTGATGCTCAGGTATCCATC-3′, reverse 5′-GTCCACTCTCGAGCTCATC-3′; ICAM-1 (human), forward 5′-GGCTGGAGCTGTTTGAGAAC-3′, reverse 5′-ACTGTGGGGTTCAACCTCTG-3′; and GAPDH, forward 5′-CTCATGACCACAGTCCATGC-3′, reverse 5′-ATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCAC-3′. PCR reactions were run using the Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) reagent. The amplification program was as follows: 10 min at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C (or 55 °C for ICAM-1), and 60 s at 72 °C. A melting curve was run for 60 s at 60 °C and 15 s at 95 °C. TaqMan primers to murine TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, iNOS, IL-10, arginase1 (Arg1), mannose receptor 1 (Mrc1), and actin were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The amplification program was as follows: 20 s at 90 °C, 40 cycles of 1 s at 90 °C and 20 s at 60 °C. CHO cells expressing CFP-PKCζ with or without YFP-EBP50 were analyzed by TIRF at room temperature. After a 5-min stabilization, 10 ng/ml TNFα was added, and images were collected every 20 s for 20 min. YFP-EBP50 was used to determine which cells were positive or negative for EBP50. The translocation of CFP-PKCζ to the cell membrane was calculated as a slope = ΔCFP fluorescence/time after TNFα stimulation. Femoral arteries were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in OCT Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek). Sections (10 μm) were incubated in boiled Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mm Tris base, 8 μm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20) for 10 min, blocked in 4% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, and incubated with antibodies to CD68 (AbD Serotec, 1:100 dilution), α-smooth muscle actin (FITC-conjugated, Sigma, 1:1000), VCAM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100), or ICAM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:100). As a secondary antibody, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 546- or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (Invitrogen, 1:250) was used before DAPI staining. Fluorescence intensities were measured with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). EBP50 expression increases in VSMC after endoluminal arterial injury (20Song G.J. Barrick S. Leslie K.L.

Biol. 2012; 32: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms for this up-regulation are unknown. In the first series of experiments, we tested whether inflammatory stimuli mediate EBP50 expression in VSMC and macrophages. Stimulation of primary peritoneal macrophages and VSMC with LPS for 16 h resulted in a significant increase in EBP50 expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Additional experiments in mice treated with LPS confirmed that inflammatory stimuli increase EBP50 transcripts in the aorta (Fig. 1C). Similar to LPS, EBP50 mRNA expression in VSMC and RAW 264.7 increased with TNFα (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that the effect was not receptor-specific. LPS signaling and TNFα signaling converge on the activation of NF-κB, suggesting that this transcription factor mediates EBP50 expression in inflammatory conditions. We tested this hypothesis by using the irreversible IKK inhibitor II (wedelolactone) and a dominant negative form of IκBα (S32A/S36A) that is unable to be phosphorylated and prevents NF-κB activation. We found that both IKK inhibitor II and IκBα (S32A/S36A) abrogated LPS-induced EBP50 expression in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1F) and RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1G). Conversely, overexpression of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, which overwhelms the basal inhibitory machinery and mimics activation, resulted in a 2-fold increase in EBP50 expression (Fig. 1H). Comparable results were obtained in primary VSMC (Fig. 1I). These studies show that NF-κB regulates the expression of EBP50 in macrophages and VSMC under inflammatory conditions. Because of the critical role that inflammation plays in vascular disease and the importance of NF-κB in the transduction of inflammatory signals, we hypothesized that EBP50 regulates NF-κB signaling. Indeed, LPS-induced activation of IKKβ was decreased in EBP50−/− VSMC as compared with WT VSMC (Fig. 2A). EBP50-null cells also exhibited decreased IκBα phosphorylation and degradation and p65 phosphorylation at serine 536 (Fig. 2B). Importantly, LPS stimulated phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun in both WT and EBP50−/− VSMC (Fig. 2C), indicating that the effect of EBP50 on NF-κB signaling is specific and not related to defects in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. To further verify the role of EBP50 in NF-κB activation, we performed a rescue experiment using EBP50−/− VSMC. Introduction of EBP50 into these cells restored LPS-induced IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). EBP50 contains two PDZ domains, which are important for scaffolding binding partners, and a C-terminal EBD that interacts with cytoskeletal components. To identify the domains of EBP50 that are necessary for NF-κB activation, we utilized EBP50 constructs containing inactivating mutations in both PDZ domains (S1S2) or lacking the EBD domain (ΔEBD). Expression of either mutant was not sufficient to rescue IKK activation in EBP50−/− VSMC (Fig. 2D). The previous experiments show that the effect of EBP50 occurs between TLR4 and the IKK complex. Examination of potential PDZ ligands in the C termini of TLR4-mediated signaling components suggested PKCζ as a potential target for EBP50. Indeed, PKCζ contains a typical type III consensus motif for PDZ binding (-EESV) and participates in NF-κB activation (25Leitges M. Sanz L. Martin P. Duran A. Braun U. García J.F. Camacho F.

As shown in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment in Fig. 3A, TNFα promoted the association between PKCζ and EBP50. This was dependent on the PDZ-binding motif in PKCζ because mutation of the C-terminal valine to alanine abrogated the interaction with EBP50 (Fig. 3A). We next determined the role of the interaction between EBP50 and PKCζ on NF-κB activation. Consistent with previous studies (27Huang X. Chen L.-Y. Doerner A.M. Pan W.W. Smith L. Huang S.

These results suggested that EBP50 regulates membrane localization of PKCζ in response to inflammatory stimuli. We therefore recorded PKCζ translocation by TIRF microscopy. TNFα stimulated CFP-PKCζ translocation only in CHO cells expressing EBP50 (Fig. 3E). This translocation began promptly after TNFα application and continued for at least 20 min. The slope of the membrane-delimited CFP fluorescence over time after TNFα stimulation was significantly greater in EBP50-expressing cells than in naive CHO cells (0.57 ± 0.14 versus 0.14 ± 0.13 fluorescence × min−1 for EBP50-positive and -negative cells, respectively; p = 0.031, n = 10) (Fig. 3F).

Localization and properties of angiotensin receptors.J. Hypertens. 1985; 3: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two main ANGII receptor subtypes, the AT1 and AT2 receptors, have been identified (6Timmermans P.B. Wong P.C. Chiu A.T. Herblin W.F. Benfield P. Carini D.J. Lee R.J. Wexler R.R. Saye J.A. Smith R.D. Angiotensin II receptors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.Pharmacol. Rev. 1993; 45: 205-251PubMed Google Scholar). AT1 receptor (AT1R) is the principal mediator of the aforementioned physiological effects of ANGII in mammalian adults, and mounting evidence unequivocally shows the contributions of AT1R in cardiovascular pathologies (3Griendling K.K.

On the other hand, Le et al. (8Le T.H. Kim H.S. Allen A.M. Spurney R.F. Smithies O. Coffman T.M. Physiological impact of increased expression of the AT1 angiotensin receptor.Hypertension. 2003; 42: 507-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have generated transgenic mice overexpressing the AT1R gene and have shown that increasing the gene copy number from 2 to 4 leads to doubling of AT1R mRNA expression in the vasculature and the heart of these mice. This resulted in hypertension, especially in female transgenic mice. Additionally, transgenic mice overexpressing AT1R in the cardiac myocytes demonstrate cardiac enlargement, heart failure, and early death (9Hein L. Stevens M.E. Barsh G.S. Pratt R.E. Kobilka B.K.

Complex cardiovascular disorders, like hypertension, are polygenic in nature with strong familial inheritance. Polymorphisms in the regulatory regions of the genes regulating blood pressure contribute to this inheritance. Contextually, the AT1R gene is one of the prime candidates whose differential regulation may predispose to such disorders. An A/C polymorphism at position 1166 (rs5186) in the 3′-UTR of the AT1R gene has been associated with hypertension in the Finnish (13Perola M. Kainulainen K. Pajukanta P. Terwilliger J.D. Hiekkalinna T. Ellonen P. Kaprio J. Koskenvuo M. Kontula K. Peltonen L. Genome-wide scan of predisposing loci for increased diastolic blood pressure in Finnish siblings.J.

Evidence for involvement of the type 1 angiotensin II receptor locus in essential hypertension.Hypertension. 1999; 33: 844-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and the Caucasian populations (15Bonnardeaux A. Davies E. Jeunemaitre X. Féry I. Charru A. Clauser E. Tiret L. Cambien F. Corvol P. Soubrier F. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene polymorphisms in human essential hypertension.Hypertension. 1994; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The role of this polymorphism, however, in human hypertension remains unconfirmed. On the other hand, in Caucasian hypertensive subjects we identified four novel SNPs, in linkage disequilibrium (LD), in the promoter region of the human AT1R (hAT1R) gene. The SNPs are: T/A at −777, T/G at −680, A/C at −214, and A/G at −119. Variants −777T, −680T, −214A, and −119A always occur together creating the haplotype I, and variants −777A, −680G, −214C, and −119G always occur together, creating the haplotype II. These SNPs may affect transcription factor binding, such as for upstream stimulatory factor-2 (USF2), and modulate gene expression. Thus, we generated transgenic (TG) mice with the either haplotype and tested the hypothesis that haplotype-dependent, differential regulation of the hAT1R gene will increase hAT1R expression and predispose to AT1R-induced hypertension. We show here that the haplotype I is associated with hypertension in Caucasian subjects. We also show increased promoter activity, in both basal and USFco-transfected cells, and increased USF2 binding to the oligonucleotide corresponding to the haplotype I in adrenal (H295-R) and vascular smooth muscle (A7r5) cells. In vivo testing was done in TG mice containing either haplotype I or haplotype II of the hAT1R gene—using recombineering of a 166-kb BAC containing 5′-flanking region, coding sequence, and 3′-flanking region of the hAT1R gene. TG mice with haplotype I demonstrated enhanced USF2 chromatin binding with increased hAT1R expression in the cardiac and the renal tissues. Complementary experiments revealed significantly higher blood pressure; pro-inflammatory markers, including IL-6, TNFα, and CRP; and oxidative stress markers, such as NADPH oxidase, in TG mice containing haplotype I of the hAT1R gene as compared with TG mice with the haplotype II. We have analyzed the genomic DNA from 374 hypertensive (182 males and 192 females; mean age, 59 ± 10 years) and 388 normotensive subjects (182 males and 206 females; mean age, 58 ± 10 years). All of these subjects were recruited from the outpatient department of Westchester Medical Center (Valhalla, NY) or from the AmDec Foundation. All case and control subjects gave informed consent before participating in the research. The Institutional Review Board at the New York Medical College approved the research protocol for animal use. Individuals were excluded if they had a previous history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, secondary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or renal diseases. For a period of 30 min before blood pressure (BP) measurement, no exercise, alcohol, caffeine, or smoking were allowed. BP was measured by conventional mercury sphygmomanometer. Measurements by two different observers were taken at the left arm with individuals in the seated position after 15 min of resting. The criteria for hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mm Hg, or under antihypertensive therapy. The normotensives (with SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg) without a history of hypertension and without diabetes mellitus were recruited from the same population and matched for the sex and age. Clinical data of the patients were self-reported during a detailed prestudy examination and confirmed by medical charts provided by their physicians. The genomic DNA was amplified using 5′-TGT AAA CTA CAG TCA CCC TCT CAC C-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-ATG AGG CAG TAT CAC CCT GA-3′ as a reverse primer to amplify the 238-bp 5′-flanking region of the hAT1R gene containing the T/G polymorphic site at the −680 position of the promoter. The amplified fragment was then analyzed by 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis after HinfI restriction digestion. HinfI recognizes the nucleotide sequence GANTC and cleaves the amplified DNA when nucleoside A is present at −680 to produce 127- and 111-bp fragments. The results obtained by restriction analysis were confirmed by direct sequencing of representative amplified fragments. The reporter constructs pHAT1Rhap-1luc (haplotype I) and pHAT1Rhap-2luc (haplotype II) were synthesized by PCR amplification of the human AT1R gene using TGTAGGCTTTGTCCATTTTT as the forward primer and GTCCAGACGTCCTGTCACTCTCGAG as the reverse primer using DNA from human subjects containing either haplotype I or II of the hAT1R gene. The amplified fragment contained nucleotides −1174 to +55 and was subcloned in the pGL3-basic vector lacking eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences (Promega). Expression vector RSV-β-gal was obtained from Promega. Plasmid DNAs for transient transfection were prepared by Qiagen midi or maxi plasmid kits using conditions described by the manufacturer. Human adrenocortical carcinoma cells (H295-R) or vascular smooth muscle cells (A7r5) were grown as monolayers in DMEM/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% Nu-Serum IV, 1% ITS (BD Biosciences), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For transient transfections, reporter DNA (500 ng) and β-galactosidase DNA (10 ng) were mixed with pBluescript DNA to a final weight of 1 μg of DNA. Transient transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. For co-transfection experiments, expression vector pSV-USF2 (100 ng) was added to the reporter constructs. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were serum-starved for an additional 24 h. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and whole cell extracts were prepared by resuspension in 200 μl of lysis buffer (Promega). An aliquot of the cell extract was used to measure luciferase activity in a Turners Design 20/20 luminometer using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity that was determined using the β-glo assay system (Promega). The probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were chemically synthesized by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC), annealed, and radiolabeled at the 5′-ends by polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP. DNA fragments (100,000 cpm), poly(dI-dC) (2 μg), BSA (20 μg), and nuclear extract (5–10 μg) were incubated in a solution containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm PMSF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol on ice for 30 min and separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in a cold room. After 2–3 h, the gel was dried under vacuum, and protein-nucleic acid complexes were identified by autoradiography. For supershift assay 5 μg of USF1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for 20 min and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Radioactive nucleotides were purified by chromaspin columns (BD Biosciences). Nuclear extracts for gel mobility shift assays were prepared by modification of a previously described method (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Accurate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract from isolated mammalian nuclei.Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides 214A and 214C were obtained by annealing CGGGACCACGTGAAC, and CGGGACCCCGTGAAC with their respective complementary oligonucleotides. Double-stranded oligonucleotide MLTF containing the consensus USF binding site was obtained by annealing CTAGTGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGG with its respective complementary oligonucleotide (USF binding site is underlined). Oligonucleotides containing the consensus HNF-3 binding site was obtained by annealing CTAGTATTATTGACTTAGGATC with its complementary oligonucleotide. Procedures were approved by the University of Toledo Animal Care and Use Committee and performed according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). BAC clone (CTD-3080C3) containing hAT1R gene was purchased from CalTech. The plasmid was grown in low salt LB medium containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C, and BAC DNA was purified using Nucleobond BAC maxiprep kit (BD Biosciences). The promoter sequence in the wild type hAT1R BAC was modified by recombineering using the galK two-step procedure in SW102 cells (17Warming S. Costantino N. Court DL Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Simple and highly efficient BAC recombineering using galK selection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). SW102 cells were grown at 32 °C. First, the 1.7-kb promoter region of the hAT1R gene was deleted by inserting galK cassette. Next, the galK cassette was replaced with a 1.7-kb promoter region from the DNA of a subject containing mutant haplotype of the hAT1R gene. Wild type and modified BAC DNAs were analyzed by fingerprinting after treatment with SpeI (releasing 30 fragments varying in size from 500 bp to 16 kb). The modified region of the hAT1R BAC was finally confirmed by direct sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of the promoter, all the exons, and the 3′-flanking region were sequenced to confirm that the two BAC differ only in the promoter region and contained either haplotype I or II of the hAT1R gene. To understand the regulation of human AT1R gene in an in vivo situation, we generated transgenic mice using 166-kb BAC plasmid DNA containing hAT1R gene. This BAC contains 68 kb of the 5′-flanking region, 45 kb of the coding region, and 53 kb of the 3′-flanking region of the hAT1R gene cloned in 7.4 kb of pBeloBAC11 vector (see Fig. 6A). We characterized the BAC by restriction digestion with SpeI enzyme followed by gel electrophoresis. This treatment produced 30 DNA fragments varying from 500 bp to 16 kb as predicted (see Fig. 6B). Nucleotide sequencing of the BAC revealed that it contains haplotype I of the hAT1R gene. The 1.2-kb promoter of the hAT1R gene in this BAC was modified to haplotype II by recombineering using the 1.2-kb promoter fragment from a human subject containing haplotype II of the hAT1R gene as described previously for hAGT gene (18Jain S. Tillinger A. Mopidevi B. Pandey V.G. Chauhan C.K. Fiering S.N. Warming S. Kumar A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 41172-41186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the resulting BAC was confirmed by sequence analysis. The linearized DNA fragments from the wild type and recombineered BACs were obtained after NotI treatment and were used for microinjection to produce transgenic mice. The presence of hAT1R gene was analyzed by PCR amplification of tail DNA of transgenic mice. The location of different regions of the BAC plasmid that were used for PCR amplification to confirm the integration of hAT1R gene in mouse genome is shown in Fig. 6C. Nucleotide sequences of primers used for the amplification of different regions of hAT1R gene in transgenic animals are presented in Table 1. Initially we obtained three transgenic lines from each construct, but after characterization we maintained only one TG line for each haplotype of hAT1R gene. These TG mice have single copy of the hAT1R gene as determined by quantitative PCR (19D'haene B. Vandesompele J. Hellemans J. Accurate and objective copy number profiling using real-time quantitative PCR.Methods. 2010; 50: 262-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Sequences of the primers used for the characterization of human AT1R gene in the hAT1R transgenic micePrimerLocationSequence5′-Upstream-F43-kb 5′-TISGAGATGGAGTCTCACTCT5′-Upstream-RCATGAGCAGACAATTCTCExon 2-F10-kb 3′-TISCTCTTAAGATGCAGTGTGGExon 2-RCTGCTTCCTCTACTTCTExon 5-F43-kb 3′-TISTGGCATGGCAGTGGTGTExon 5-RCAGATGCTCAAGAATGG3′-Downstream-F70-kb 3′-TISGACACAGTGAGTGACAT3′-Downstream-RCTATATGTTCCACAGGCA Open table in a new tab Kidney and heart from 10–12-week-old hAT1R transgenic male mice were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C. RNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Revert Aid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers for human AT1R, IL-6, TNFα, and CRP from SAB using standard protocol. Relative transcript abundance was calculated following normalization with mouse GAPDH. The ChIP assay was performed using the EZ ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit from Millipore. The mice were perfused with normal saline. Kidney was excised and washed in PBS; minced into smaller pieces; fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature; and washed with chilled PBS followed by their lysis. The DNA was fragmented by sonication, and 10 μl of the chromatin solution was saved as input. A 5-μg amount of USF2 or RNA pol II antibody or rabbit immunoglobulin G was added to the tubes containing 900 μl of sonicated chromatin solution, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The antibody complexes were captured with protein A-agarose beads and subjected to serial washes (as described in manufacturer's protocol). The chromatin fraction was extracted with SDS buffer and reverse cross-linked at 65 °C for 4–6 h. The DNA was then purified using Qiagen miniprep column. The immunoprecipitated DNA (1 μl) and the input DNA (1 μl) were subjected to 35 cycles of PCR amplification using −213for TCCGCAGGAAATGATACTCC as a forward and −213rev ACGAGGCTCTGTTTTGCATT as a reverse primer when USF2 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation. This amplified 217 bp fragment spanning the USF binding site located around −213 region of the human AT1R gene promoter −119for TGATAGTTGACACGGGACGA as a forward primer and −119rev TTTATAGTGAGGGGCGTTGC as a reverse primer when RNA pol II antibody was used. This amplified 178-bp fragment containing RNA pol II-binding region of the human AT1R gene promoter. The PCR-amplified products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel. All mice were fed standard mice chow and had access to water ad libitum. BP was measured in the conscious state by radio telemetry as described previously (20Butz G.M. Davisson R.L. Long-term telemetric measurement of cardiovascular parameters in awake mice. A physiological genomics tool.Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). After 4 days of basal blood pressure measurement, animals were treated with the AT1R blocker losartan (Sigma-Aldrich; 30 mg/kg/day) in drinking water as described previously (18Jain S. Tillinger A. Mopidevi B. Pandey V.G. Chauhan C.K. Fiering S.N. Warming S. Kumar A. Transgenic mice with −6A haplotype of the human angiotensinogen gene have increased blood pressure compared with −6G haplotype.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 41172-41186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The blood pressure was then measured 24 h after losartan treatment. Mean BP values were calculated for every hour from the values taken over 24 h. The animals were housed in individual cages. The GraphPad statistical software package (GraphPad 3.00 for Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) was used for calculating the differences in allele frequency between case and control subjects and comparison of promoter activity of different reporter constructs in transient transfection assays. Allele and genotype frequencies between study participants were estimated by gene counting and analyzed by means of the χ2 test and logistic regression using SPSS 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using analysis of variance with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test. Statistical significant results are marked by asterisks (p < 0.05). Because of LD of the SNPs in haplotypes, −680T or −680G was used as reporter polymorphism for haplotype I and II, respectively (Fig. 1). DNA from 374 hypertensive and 388 normotensive subjects was analyzed by restriction analysis followed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). −680T allele of the hAT1R gene is associated with hypertension in Caucasian subjects (p = 0.004, χ2 = 8.46) (allele frequency of 680T was 0.80 in hypertensive subjects and 0.74 in normotensive subjects). All patients and control subjects were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results of this analysis suggest that −680T allele of the AT1R gene to be a risk factor for hypertension in Caucasian subjects (Table 2).FIGURE 2Restriction analysis to determine the frequency of haplotypes I and II of the hAT1R gene. Because four polymorphisms in the hAT1R promoter are in LD, the frequency of each haplotype may be calculated by measuring frequency of any polymorphism. Restriction enzyme HinfI digests the PCR-amplified fragment only when −680T is present. Therefore, genomic DNA from hypertensive patients and normotensive controls was amplified to produce 238-bp fragments as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The partial nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment around the T/G polymorphic site at −680 of the AT1R gene is shown in the first line. The HinfI restriction site (which will cleave the amplified DNA if nucleoside T is present at −680) is shown in the second line. The amplified DNA fragments were treated with HinfI and separated on a 3.5% agarose gel.

We next performed transient transfections of the reporter constructs pHAT1Rhap-1luc (haplotype I) and hAT1Rhap-2luc (haplotype II) in H295R cells. These cells have been shown to contain functional angiotensin II receptors (21Bird I.M. Mason J.I. Rainey W.E. Regulation of type 1 angiotensin II receptor messenger ribonucleic acid expression in human adrenocortical carcinoma H295 cells.Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2468-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results show ∼4-fold increased (p < 0.05) promoter activity of the haplotype I reporter construct as compared with haplotype II (Fig. 3A). Similar results were seen in A7r5 cells. AT1R gene is expressed in these cells, which were transfected with either pHAT1Rhap-1luc or pHAT1Rhap-2luc. Increased promoter activity of the reporter construct with haplotype I, ∼1.9-fold (p < 0.05), was observed as opposed to the promoter activity of haplotype II (Fig. 3B). The USF consensus sequence, CANNTG, exhibits greater sequence homology to the hAT1R promoter of haplotype I when compared with that of haplotype II. Site −214 is the principal determinant of this preference, where −214A of haplotype I could provide for stronger USF binding than −214C of haplotype II (Fig. 4A). The hypothesis was tested with gel shift assay performed using radioactive oligonucleotides −214A and −214C as probes and H295R extract as a source of transcription factors. Competition was then performed in the presence of cold oligonucleotides 214A, 214C, consensus USF site, nonspecific oligonucleotide containing HNF-3 binding site, and in the presence or absence of USF1 antibody (Fig. 4B). Radioactice oligonucleotide 214A formed a complex (shown by an arrow) (lane 1) that was competed out with self-oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 3) or an oligonucleotide-containing consensus USF binding site (lane 6) but not with 214C or nonspecific oligonucleotides (lanes 4, 5, and 8).

In this study, we have developed an experimental system using the C subunit tagged with GFP that allows us to study the functional domain and/or the amino acid residue(s) of Vma4p for glucose-dependent V-ATPase disassembly (see Fig. 1A). The Glu-44 and its vicinity in the amino-terminal α-helical domain of Vma4p were identified as having a key role in V-ATPase disassembly and catalysis.

Cells transformed with the yeast expression vector pKT10 were selected and maintained on SD-uracil medium. The strains used in this study were grown in yeast extract-peptone-2% dextrose (YPD) medium buffered to pH 5.0 with 50 mm sodium phosphate/50 mm sodium succinate (YPD, pH 5.0), and/or YPD medium buffered to pH 7.5 with 50 mm sodium phosphate (YPD, pH 7.5). Reagents for the growth medium were obtained from BD Biosciences. Reagents for molecular biology were purchased from Takara Bio (Kyoto, Japan), New England Biolabs, Sigma-Aldrich, and Nacalai Tesque Co. (Osaka, Japan). Bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Wako Chemicals Co. Pyruvate kinase, phosphoenol pyruvate, and lactate dehydrogenases were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Total yeast protein extract was obtained by lysing cells usiung cracking buffer (8 m urea, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Monoclonal antibodies for anti-Myc epitope (9E10) and the anti-V-ATPase A subunit (8B1; A6422) were obtained from Invitrogen. The polyclonal antibody used to detect V-ATPase a subunit, Vph1p was raised against a synthetic polypeptides sequence (C-EIEQPVYDVKTREYKHKN) unique to Vph1p. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. ECL substrates were purchased from Pierce. Other reagents at the highest possible quality were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The wild-type VMA4 gene with an N-terminal Myc tag was inserted in the pKT10 plasmid vector containing URA3. Thirty-four sets of forward and reverse complementary primers those contain sequence between Vma4p Lys-33 to Lys-83 with a single amino acid residue (indicated in red in Fig. 2B) to alanine substitutions were custom synthesized (Sigma-Genosys). Those reverse primers and the VMA4-forward EcoRI (5′-CGGAATTCATGTCCTCCGCTATTACTGCTTTGACAC-3′) primer and the forward primers and the VMA4-reverse XhoI (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAATCAAAGAACTTTCTTGTCTTGGAAGGAC-3′) primer sets were used to amplify amino-terminal ∼200 and carboxyl-terminal ∼500 base pairs, respectively. The resulting PCR products were then annealed and the full-length VMA4 gene with introduced mutations was amplified using VMA4 forward EcoRI and reverse XhoI primers. The Glu-44 to Asn, Asp, and Gln were also introduced by PCR using the method described as above. The full-length VMA4 PCR products were digested by restriction enzymes, EcoRI and XhoI, and were inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pKT10 plasmid vector. The plasmids were transformed into Δvma4::C-GFP cells, and the transformants were selected by growth on SD-uracil medium. Spheroplasts were prepared from cells harvested at midexponential growth phase by following the method described previously (27Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y.

Spheroplasts were incubated in YP medium with or without glucose for 20 min prior to an osmotic lysis, and the yeast cytoplasmic proteins were incubated with anti V-ATPase subunit A antibody conjugated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare) for immunoprecipitation of VoV1 by the method described (25Hayashi K.

Membranes were treated with or without 100 nm BafilomycinA1 for 1 h prior to the assay in 150 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, with KOH. Bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity was determined at 30 °C by an NADH-coupled assay system (28Pullman M.E. Penefsky H.S. Datta A. Racker E.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215879) Google Scholar). We have developed a system in which the C-subunit is tagged with GFP (C-GFP) that enables us to observe the disassembly of V-ATPase in real time (Fig. 1A). A yeast Δvma4::C-GFP cell, lacking the E subunit (VMA4) gene and expressing the C subunit tagged with GFP, was generated by a genetic cross and was transformed with a yeast expression vector carrying the E subunit gene. The resulting transformants expressing the cDNA for Vma4p or mouse E1 or E2 were all able to grow on glucose medium (pH 7.5), and C-GFP fluorescence was observed in the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 1B), indicating that both E1 and E2 have restored the function and localization of the V-ATPase similarly to restoration by Vma4p. When glucose was removed from the medium, C-GFP was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing Vma4p (Fig. 1B, VMA4). In contrast, C-GFP was found primarily in the vacuolar membrane of the transformants expressing E1 and E2 (Fig. 1B, E1 and E2), indicating that the hybrid V-ATPases are still assembled after removal of glucose. This result is consistent with our previous immunoprecipitation data showing that the Vo and V1 complexes of mouse E1 yeast hybrid V-ATPase are mostly associated after removal of glucose (25Hayashi K. Sun-Wada G.H. Wada Y. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Futai M. Defective assembly of a hybrid vacuolar H(+)-ATPase containing the mouse testis-specific E1 isoform and yeast subunits.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results indicate that our newly developed experimental system allows us to analyze the critical domain of Vma4p for VoV1 disassembly in real time without having to perform time-consuming immunochemical procedures. Unlike the authentic yeast V-ATPase, the V-ATPase containing the mouse E1 yeast hybrid does not readily disassemble upon removal of glucose from the medium (Fig. 1B). To determine which domain of E1 affects the disassembly, we have tested a series of previously constructed plasmids (25Hayashi K. Sun-Wada G.H. Wada Y. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Futai M. Defective assembly of a hybrid vacuolar H(+)-ATPase containing the mouse testis-specific E1 isoform and yeast subunits.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1777: 1370-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that express E1/Vma4p chimeric E subunits and examined their assembly properties. First, a chimeric E subunit in which Met-1 to Lys-33 of Vma4p was replaced by the corresponding residues of E1 (E1/VMA4–1) was expressed in Δvma4::C-GFP cells. These cells showed the vacuolar localization of C-GFP only in the presence of glucose (Fig. 2A), indicating that this region does not affect the glucose-dependent assembly of yeast V-ATPase. Second, the region between Met-1 and Lys-83 of Vma4p replaced by the corresponding residues of E1 (E1/VMA4–2) was expressed in the Δvma4::C-GFP cells. These cells had C-GFP fluorescence in the vacuolar membrane irrespective of the presence or absence of glucose. Because E1/VMA4–1 does not affect the glucose-dependent assembly, the region between Lys-33 and Lys-83 of Vma4p is likely to be affecting the glucose-dependent C-GFP localization. As expected, cells expressing a chimeric E subunit with the E1 residues corresponding Lys-33 to Lys-83 of Vma4p (E1/VMA4–5) showed the vacuolar localization of C-GFP irrespective of glucose (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that the amino-terminal region of Vma4p between Lys-33 and Lys-83 contains residue(s) responsible for glucose-dependent disassembly. The above data indicated that the 34 residues between Lys-33 and Lys-83 of Vma4p that are not conserved in E1 (Fig. 2B; indicated in red) may have a role in glucose-dependent assembly of V-ATPase. To test this hypothesis, these 34 residues were substituted one by one with Ala, so that we could change each functional moiety without drastically interfering with the helical property of this domain (30Blaber M. Zhang X.J. Matthews B.W. Structural basis of amino acid α helix propensity.Science. 1993; 260: 1637-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The Δvma4::C-GFP cells expressing each mutant Vma4p restored the defective growth of Δvma4 on alkaline pH, indicating that all 34 mutants form an active V-ATPase (data not shown). We then tested these substitution mutants for the subcellular localization of C-GFP with or without glucose. The Glu-44 to Ala mutant showed primarily vacuolar membrane localization of C-GFP irrespective of the presence of glucose (supplemental Fig. 1). In addition, Ala substitution mutants of Glu-54, Gly-60, and Asn-61 showed partial vacuolar membrane localization of C-GFP (supplemental Fig. 1). The latter three mutations resulted in C-GFP localization to both the cytoplasm and vacuolar membrane irrespective of the presence of glucose. These results indicate that Ala substitution at these three positions is generally affecting V-ATPase assembly, whereas the Glu-44 to Ala substitution results in reduced V-ATPase disassembly by glucose depletion. We therefore further investigated the role of Glu-44 in glucose-dependent disassembly. As shown in the amino acid alignment (Fig. 2B), the mouse E subunits are shorter than Vma4p by five residues; thus, the Vma4p Glu-44 corresponds to Asn-39 in E1 and E2. Because the mouse E1 yeast hybrid V-ATPase does not disassemble upon removal of glucose, Vma4p with a Glu-44 to Asn substitution may be less sensitive to glucose. In addition, the carboxyl moiety and/or the length of side chain of the residue at position 44 may affect disassembly. Vma4p with Glu-44 to Asn, Asp, and Gln substitution mutants were therefore constructed based on these considerations. These substitution mutants all complemented the Δvma4 phenotype and growth at alkaline pH was indistinguishable from that of wild-type (Fig. 3A), indicating that the Vma4p Glu-44 substitutions are functional. Furthermore, cells transformed with the wild-type VMA4 gene and with the Glu-44 substitutions, all contained essentially the same amount of Vma4p (Fig. 3B), suggesting that a comparable amount of V-ATPase is expressed in these cells. Similarly to the cells expressing Vma4p with Glu-44 substitution to Ala (E44A), the Asn (E44N), Asp (E44D), and Glu (E44Q) substitutions all showed vacuolar C-GFP localization in the absence of glucose (Fig. 4A), whereas C-GFP was observed mostly in the cytoplasm in the wild-type (Glu-44). These results suggest that a considerable amount of the Vo and V1 complexes are still associated in these Glu-44 substitution mutants. To examine the VoV1 association, protoplasts were prepared from the cells expressing wild-type Vma4p, and the E44A, E44N, E44D, and E44Q substitutions and were incubated with or without glucose for 20 min prior to an osmotic lysis of the plasma membrane. The VoV1 complex was immuno-precipitated by an anti-A subunit antibody and the co-precipitation of Vo subunit a was examined using an anti-Vph1p specific antibody (Fig. 4B). Vph1p was detected in all cells incubated with glucose. In agreement with the microscopic observations of the subcellular localization of C-GFP (Fig. 4A, no sugar), <10% of the Vph1p was detectable by densitometry in the protoplasts expressing wild-type Vma4p without glucose compared with those with glucose. In contrast, >30% of the Vph1p was still detected in the E44A, E44N, E44D, and E44Q substitution mutant cells incubated without glucose compared with those with (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that VoV1 is still mostly associated in the mutants under this condition. To examine whether these substitutions resulted in a change of VoV1 disassembly kinetics, we performed a real time observation of the vacuolar localization of C-GFP after removal of glucose over 60 min. We have used cells in the mid-logarithmic phase for this analysis. It should be noted that these cells have ∼70% assembled V-ATPase that is close to previous biochemical observations (16Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Reversible association between the V1 and V0 domains of yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase is an unconventional glucose-induced effect.Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study disassembly kinetics, these cells with C-GFP localized in the vacuolar membrane in SD medium were followed after removal of glucose. Consistent with the previous results (14Kane P.M. Disassembly and reassembly of the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kane P.M. Close-up and genomic views of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the vacuolar C-GFP localization of typical wild-type cells became mostly cytoplasmic within 6 min after the removal of glucose with some C-GFP remaining in the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 5A; 6 min, closed arrowhead). In the majority of wild-type cells, the C-GFP became evenly distributed across the cytoplasm by 10 min (Fig. 5A; 10 min, open arrowhead) indicating the dissociation of V1 and Vo. The time course of V1 dissociation from Vo was examined in the Glu-44 substitution mutants by counting cells with C-GFP observed in the vacuolar membrane after removal of glucose and we have defined those cells in which C-GFP was observed predominantly in the vacuolar membrane (Fig. 5A; 2 min) and those with some C-GFP observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A; 4 min) as C-GFP vacuolar localized. The number of wild-type cells with vacuolar C-GFP localization was decreased to <30% within 10 min (Fig. 4B). This value became <5% in 30 min, indicating most of the V1 complexes were disassembled from Vo. Cells with the Vma4p Glu-44 substitutions showed a significant delay in the decrease of vacuolar C-GFP compared with wild-type cells. More than 10% of cells with E44N and E44Q substitutions and >40% of cells with E44A and E44D showed vacuolar localization of C-GFP even 30 min after the removal of glucose. Subsequently, their vacuolar C-GFP localization gradually decreased to <5% in 60 min. These results clearly indicate that the Glu-44 substitutions affect glucose-dependent V-ATPase disassembly. As described above, we have substituted Glu-44 with Asp, Asn, and Gln, assuming that Glu-44 has a specific role for assembly. These residues are found at the corresponding position in Vma4p with fungi, plants, and animals (using ClustalW alignments). It is interesting to note that within Ascomycota, Glu-44 is conserved in Saccharomycotina, whereas Ala is conserved in Pezizomycotina except for a branch of Sordariomycetes, and the Gln residue is conserved within Schizosaccharomyces at this corresponding position (supplemental Fig. 2). The alignment of Vma4p and mouse E subunits indicated that the Asn residue is conserved at the corresponding position (Fig. 2B) within the whole of Animalia and Plantae. There are a number of examples indicating V-ATPase assembly is regulated by hexose sugar availability (32Dechant R. Binda M. Lee S.S. Pelet S. Winderickx J. Peter M. Cytosolic pH is a second messenger for glucose and regulates the PKA pathway through V-ATPase.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 2515-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Schnitzer D. Seidel T. Sander T. Golldack D. Dietz K.J. The cellular energization state affects peripheral stalk stability of plant vacuolar H+-ATPase and impairs vacuolar acidification.Plant Cell Physiol. 2011; 52: 946-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the initiation of disassembly was delayed by 10∼30 min, the VoV1 of Ala, Asn, Asp, and Gln substitution mutants eventually dissociated upon glucose removal (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). These results indicate that the degree of V-ATPase disassembly may be different between organisms. The Glu-44 substitutions may have affected the Vma4p conformation and made the V-ATPase harder to disassemble. However, it is difficult to further assess the effects of amino acid substitutions on the disassembly kinetics. The E subunit serves as a part of three stators those support the A3B3 catalytic hexamer to the Vo sector. These stators have been shown to have flexible arms (8Oot R.A. Huang L.S. Berry E.A. Wilkens S. Crystal Structure of the Yeast Vacuolar ATPase Heterotrimeric EGC(head) Peripheral Stalk Complex.Structure. 2012; 20: 1881-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and most likely regulate the ATP binding, chemical reaction, or release of ADP/Pi in a sequence of rotational catalysis. Therefore, conformational changes of the E subunit may affect stator structure leading to the indirect effects on V-ATPase catalysis. Thus, it became of interest to test the effects of E subunit mutations on V-ATPase catalysis. As expected, the substitutions of Glu-44 all affected the activation energy for ATPase catalysis (Fig. 6A). It is not immediately obvious how substitutions in Glu-44 of Vma4p, that is a peripheral stalk subunit of V-ATPase, have affected the activation energy. However, it is plausible that the functional moiety at position 44 of Vma4p has affected the structural flexibility of the peripheral stalks during the rotational catalysis. The Arrhenius plots of E44N and E44Q, with amino moiety in the side chain, were parallel to each other and showed similar kinetics. Their Km values were lower, but the maximal velocities (Vmax) were similar to that of WT (Table 1). They both required ∼3 times higher enthalpy (ΔH‡) for V-ATPase catalysis (Fig. 6B). Thus, the carboxyl moiety of Glu-44 (WT) may contribute to lower the enthalpy for catalysis. The increase in enthalpy for catalysis in E44N and E44Q mutants may reflect their gain of rigidity in the peripheral stalks, leading to a reduced V-ATPase disassembly upon glucose removal.TABLE 1The V-ATPase activity and catalysis of the Glu-44 substitution mutantsGlu-44 SubstitutionsATPase activityActivation energy for catalysisVmaxKmμmol/min/mgμm ATPkJ/molNone (WT)40 (±13)190 (±63)31Alanine (A)95 (±41)119 (±61)155Asparagine (N)29 (±5)73 (±32)90Aspartate (D)67 (±8)58 (±15)49Glutamine (Q)44 (±32)85 (±37)95 Open table in a new tab WT and E44D, those with a carboxyl moiety, had similar activation energy for V-ATPase catalysis. The slope of Arrhenius plot of E44D was closely similar to that of WT (Fig. 6A). However, E44D showed higher rate of V-ATPase activity than WT between 20 and 34 °C. These results suggest that the rotational catalysis rate of V-ATPase with E44D substitution is faster than that of WT. It is worth noting that E44A also showed higher rate of V-ATPase activity than WT and the Vmax at 30 °C was similar to that of E44D. These results indicated that mutants with shorter amino acid side chain had similar catalysis. The increase of Vmax rate with E44D and E44A mutants may be due to the altered conformation of the complex. This change in conformation may have resulted in a gain-of-increased-interaction between subunits that likely lead to the reduced V-ATPase disassembly in those E44D and E44A upon glucose removal. The transition state thermodynamics parameters showed that the substitutions have a relatively small effect on free energy (ΔG‡) obtained by catalysis (Fig. 6, B and C), whereas enthalpy (ΔH‡) and entropy (TΔS‡) were increased by the substitutions (Fig. 6, B and C). The results suggest that these substitutions caused an increase in the activation energy for V-ATPase catalysis. Thermodynamic analysis has shown that the increase in enthalpy (ΔH‡) and entropy (TΔS‡) of the Vma4p E44D mutant were ∼20 kJ/mol. The values for the E44N and E44Q substitutions were ∼60 kJ/mol and those of E44A were ∼120 kJ/mol. These results may be indicating that the Vma4p Glu-44 substitutions have rendered the V-ATPase with extra bonds (i.e. electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions) between subunits giving it a stronger structural entity than that of wild-type. Recently, x-ray crystallography analysis of the heterotrimeric EGC complexes has identified two hinge regions “bulge” and “skip” in the E subunit (8Oot R.A. Huang L.S. Berry E.A. Wilkens S.

These hinges had been suggested to contribute to the conformational flexibility that may be also important for priming the V-ATPase complex for rapid disassembly in response to glucose availability (8Oot R.A.

Stock D. Priming a molecular motor for disassembly.Structure. 2012; 20: 1799-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly to Vma4p, Vma10p (yeast G subunit) may also have a role in glucose-dependent VoV1 disassembly as the Arg-25 to Ala or Leu substitutions affect the assembly (35Charsky C.M. Schumann N.J. Kane P.M. Mutational analysis of subunit G (Vma10p) of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37232-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Arg-25 and Glu-44 residues may be interacting, however, the coordinates of the carboxyl moiety of the Glu-44 residue in the predicted structures suggest that such an interaction is unlikely to be formed (Fig. 7). Nevertheless, Vma4p was shown to interact with the C, G, and H subunits (36Féthière J. Venzke D. Diepholz M. Seybert A. Geerlof A. Gentzel M. Wilm M. Böttcher B.

Gain of function by domain exchange and alanine scan mutagenesis of the E subunit in the peripheral stalk of V-ATPase indicated that the stalk subunit interaction with V-ATPase is important for catalytic activity and disassembly in response to glucose starvation. In addition, the alanine scan analysis identified Glu-44 as the residue that may prevent the formation of a strongly-held coiled coil that allow V-ATPase disassembly. We propose that the Glu-44 provide Vma4p a structural flexibility that allows the V-ATPase catalysis with low energy cost."

Consecutive hours of computer work was found to be associated with work related backache or discomfort in 27.4% (n = 114) participants (16.1% male, 11.3% female). Frequent short breaks improved backache (p value <0.001) in 93 (22.4%) participants (13.2% male, 9.2% female). No significant relation was observed with the duration of computer usage or usage per day; between the two genders or occupational groups. Backache had no significance within age groups.Our study identifies the occurrence of low back pain among those who are using computer for consecutive hours without breaks and the results suggest the need to create health awareness especially use of short breaks to minimize the risk and occurrence of low back pain. The result of this study can also be used to improve ergonomic design and standards."
https://openalex.org/W2025967370,"A very long neck is a characteristic feature of most sauropod dinosaurs. In the genus Mamenchisaurus, neck length is extreme, greater than 40 percent of total body length. However, the posture, utilization, and selective advantage of very long necks in sauropods are still controversial. An excellently preserved skeleton of Mamenchisaurus youngi, including a complete neck, provides an opportunity for a comprehensive biomechanical analysis of neck posture and mobility. The biomechanical evidence indicates that Mamenchisaurus youngi had a nearly straight, near horizontal neck posture and browsed at low or medium heights. The results differ from the findings for some other sauropod species, like Euhelopus, Diplodocus, and Giraffatitan (Brachiosaurus) that had been analyzed in previous studies with similar methods. The selective advantage of extreme neck length in sauropods is likely advantageous for different feeding strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2085692324,"RNA polymerase II (Pol II), the enzyme that transcribes protein-coding genes, requires additional factors to accurately initiate transcription from promoter-directed start sites. These general transcription factors (GTFs) assemble with Pol II into a pre-initiation complex (PIC) that is a key intermediate in the transcription activation pathway ( 1 ). The main role of the GTFs is to accurately position and orient Pol II on the DNA template and to facilitate access of the catalytic site to the transcribed strand. Recent structural studies, including the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of the yeast PIC by Murakami et al. on page 709 of this issue ( 2 ), provide detailed views into the structural organization of this large complex. These studies will pave the way for a more complete understanding of how gene expression is regulated."
