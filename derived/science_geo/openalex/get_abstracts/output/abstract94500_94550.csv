https://openalex.org/W1980199048,"Preliminary observations suggest a sex difference in the shape and surface area of the human corpus callosum. The sexual dimorphism is striking in the splenium, the caudal or posterior portion of the corpus callosum. The female splenium is both more bulbous and larger than the male counterpart. Since peristriate, parietal, and superior temporal fibers course through the splenium, this finding could be related to possible gender differences in the degree of lateralization for visuospatial functions."

A specific membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, the ‘docking protein’, releases this block and allows further synthesis to be directly coupled to transfer across the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1533807800,"A new isozyme of cytochrome P-450 has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from hepatic microsomes of rabbits treated chronically with ethanol. Several criteria indicate that the ethanol-inducible cytochrome, which has a minimal molecular weight of 51,000 and is designated form 3a on the basis of its relative electrophoretic mobility, is distinct from the known isozymes of P-450. As judged spectrally, the new isozyme is high spin in the oxidized state, as is form 4, but differs in that the spin state is unperturbed by nonionic detergents. The absolute spectrum of the ferrous carbonyl complex of form 3a is red shifted as compared to that of forms 2, 3b, 3c, 4, and 6 and exhibits a maximum at 452 nm. The amino acid composition of form 3a is different from that of the other isozymes, and both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences are distinct; form 3a has an NH2-terminal alanine and a carboxyl-terminal leucine residue. Peptide mapping by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following treatment with papain, chymotrypsin, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and by high performance liquid chromatography following trypsinolysis indicates that form 3a is a unique gene product. This cytochrome displays the highest activity of all of the rabbit isozymes in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde and the p-hydroxylation of aniline when reconstituted with NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and phospholipid in the presence of NADPH and oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1605712430,"We report the successful establishment of 16 stable murine hybridoma monoclones that produce homogeneous antibodies against KB cell DNA polymerase alpha. All of the antibodies exhibit specific binding of polymerase alpha activity, and 3 of them possess anti-polymerase alpha neutralizing activity. None of the antibodies interacts detectably with KB cell DNA polymerases beta or gamma. All of the 5 antibodies so far examined demonstrate linear Scatchard binding plots and very high binding affinities, with equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) ranging between 3.2 x 10(-9) and 3.4 x 10(-10) M. These monoclonal antibodies comprise a set of powerful and specific reagents that should facilitate the development and application of novel approaches to the complex biochemical mechanisms of mammalian DNA replication."

https://openalex.org/W2021990983,"Umbilical cord blood specimens from 11,837 births between April 1979 and April 1981 have been analyzed for lead by anodic stripping voltammetry. The mean was 6.56 +/- 3.19 (standard deviation) micrograms per deciliter of blood, and the range was 0.0 to 37.0 micrograms per deciliter. The mean decreased annually by 0.77 +/- 0.03 microgram per deciliter, about 11 percent. Lead concentrations were higher in infants born in summer than in infants born in winter (7.17 versus 5.99, probability less than .001). A Fourier model of the data is presented, and possible reasons for the decline are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2080079285,"Golden Syrian hamsters were placed individually in cages with three drinking bottles--one empty, one containing water, and the third containing water and ethanol. Control hamsters received water only. After 1 year the experimental hamsters showed a significantly lower concentration of leucine-enkephalin-like immunoreactive substance in the basal ganglia than the control hamsters. This finding indicates that the action of ethanol involves endogenous peptidyl opiates."

https://openalex.org/W1964858323,"The metabolism of zoxazolamine to 6-hydroxyzoxazolamine by liver microsomes from neonatal rats is stimulated severalfold by the in vitro addition of flavone, a naturally occurring compound found in several plant species. The intraperitoneal injection of flavone into neonatal rats causes an immediate several-fold stimulation in the rate of total body metabolism of simultaneously administered zoxazolamine. This is the first demonstration of stimulation of oxidative drug metabolism in vivo by a zenobiotic that is an activator of hepatic microsomal."

https://openalex.org/W2168945048,"Histone deposition in HeLa cells has been studied by monitoring the fractionation and electrophoresis mobility of pulse-labeled histones under conditions that separate newly replicated from bulk chromatin DNA. The separation efficiency of these two methods is approximately 70%. Following micrococcal nuclease digestion, chromatin was fractionated by salt elution. 50-65% of the newly synthesized histones eluted with bulk chromatin at NaCl concentrations between 0.1 and 0.3 M and were further down to co-electrophorese with bulk chromatin DNA, not with the more extensively digested newly replicated chromatin DNA contained in those fractions. The remaining chromatin fractions, solubilized with 0.4-0.6 M NaCl, were several-fold enriched in nascent DNA (Annunziato, A. T., Schindler, R. K., Thomas, C. A., Jr., and Seale, R. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11880-11886) and were correspondingly enriched for the balance (35-50%) of newly synthesized core histones. This fraction of newly synthesized core histone may be preferentially deposited onto newly replicated DNA. In contrast, histone H1 showed little tendency toward deposition onto new DNA. Within 15 min all new core histones attained the same solubility and electrophoretic mobility as bulk chromatin. We conclude that newly synthesized histones are deposited onto both replicating and nonreplicating regions of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1587672805,"Total cellular RNA, isolated from rat intestinal epithelium, was translated in a wheat germ cell-free system, and the primary translation product of apolipoprotein A-IV mRNA was purified by immunoprecipitation with monospecific antibody. NH2-terminal sequence analyses of mature rat plasma high density lipoprotein-associated A-IV and the cell-free product revealed that A-IV is initially synthesized with a 20-amino-acid NH2-terminal extension. Co-translational cleavage of the primary translation product indicated that the entire NH2-terminal extension behaved as a prepeptide. The prepeptides of intestinal apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV have 59% sequence homology. However, A-IV does not possess the unusual propeptide previously identified in intestinal A-I (Gordon, J. I., Smith, D. P. Andy, R., Alpers, D. H. Schonfeld, G., and Strauss, A. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 971-978). Therefore it appears that proteolytic processing of these two apolipoproteins differs significantly."

https://openalex.org/W1578178240,"Coated vesicles were prepared from rat liver homogenates by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and the clathrin coat, dissociated by mild treatment with Tris-Cl, was characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. At pH 6.5 and below, the soluble clathrin preparations induced a voltage-dependent increase in ion conductance across a black lipid membrane of oxidized cholesterol under conditions where the intact coated vesicles were inert. Further evidence for the interaction of clathrin with the lipid bilayer was provided by the demonstration that the fluorescent dye, carboxyfluorescein, was released from the internal aqueous space of small unilamellar dioleoyl and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles upon the addition of the soluble protein. Dye release was shown to be a function of both calcium and pH. In the presence of calcium, release occurred at or above pH 8.0; in the absence of calcium, release was most prominent at pH 5.0-6.5. Formation of stable protein-phospholipid complexes was shown by KBr density gradient centrifugation. Stability of the complexes in high salt concentration suggested that electrostatic interactions were not essential to maintain the recombinants. Here, as with the black lipid membrane, incubation of the phospholipid vesicles with intact coated vesicles failed to induce release of the dye at pH 6.5 or below. Interaction of the clathrin coat protein with unilamellar vesicles at low pH resulted in a change in vesicle size and morphology as shown by electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1531677157,"Trivalent lanthanide ions are known to be good substituents for Ca2+ at all four calcium-binding sites of rabbit skeletal troponin-C (TnC). In particular, the visible luminescence of terbium ions bound at the two high affinity sites can be excited via a tyrosine residue. We have carried out energy transfer measurements using Tb3+ as the donor and a number of lanthanide ions as acceptors in order to measure the distance between the two high affinity sites in TnC. Luminescence decay measurements showed that, in the absence of acceptors, TnC-bound Tb3+ decays with a single lifetime of 1.31 ms. In the presence of a good acceptor such as Nd3+, the decay was resolvable into two components of roughly equal amplitude. The first was the same in lifetime as that of TnC-bound Tb3+ alone; the second has a shorter lifetime, presumably due to interlanthanide ion energy transfer. From these lifetimes and published critical transfer distances (Horrocks, W. DeW., Jr., Rhee, M.-J., Snyder, A.P., and Sudnick, D.R. (1980) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 102, 3650-3652), we obtained a distance of 0.92 nm between the two high affinity sites. This distance is consistent with the fact that the two high affinity sites have been located in the COOH-terminal half of TnC and with the proposal that each half of TnC is homologous in structure to parvalbumin (Kretsinger, R. H., and Barry, C. D. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 405, 40-52)."
https://openalex.org/W1530108844,"The 5-amino substituents of two pyrimidine cofactors of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase, 2,5,6-triamino-4-pyrimidinone (TP) and 5-benzylamino-2,6-diamino-4-pyrimidinone (BDP), have been shown to be cleaved quantitatively by enzyme (Bailey, S. W., and Ayling, J. E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7774-7781). That the pyrimidine product of this process (when carried out in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol) is 2,6-diamino-5-hydroxy-4-pyrimidinone (divicine) is further confirmed by mass spectrometry of an isolated t-butyldimethylsilyl derivative. The origin of the oxygens in this divicine was studied with enzyme reactions containing 18O2. Corrected for the loss in the controls, the divicine generated by phenylalanine hydroxylase from TP and BDP incorporated one atom of 18O with an efficiency of 98 +/- 5% and 100 +/- 3%, respectively, even though these reactions are partially uncoupled. The position of the isotope was unambiguously assigned to the 5-hydroxyl group by the simultaneous use of [18O] TP and 18O2, the divicine from which was found to be doubly labeled. o-Methylphenylalanine stimulates a rate of cofactor oxidation at least 10-fold greater than its own rate of hydroxylation. The majority of divicine isolated from phenylalanine hydroxylase incubations with o-methyl substrate analog was labeled with oxygen from 18O2. The demonstration, with phenylalanine hydroxylase, that one atom of molecular oxygen remains attached to position 5 of pyrimidine cofactor, provides the first strong evidence for activation of oxygen by aromatic amino acid monooxygenases via covalent addition to C4a of tetrahydrobiopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1595276265,"Mouse GM979 erythroleukemic cells were found to synthesize the branched form of erythroglycan, a large polylactosamine structure known to be attached to band 3 and possibly to other proteins on human erythrocytes. Total protein-derived oligosaccharides from GM979 cells, labeled metabolically with [3H]glucosamine, [3H]mannose, or [3H]galactose, were prepared by hydrazinolysis after extracting the lipids. The 3H-labeled oligosaccharides were fractionated on Sephadex G-50 revealing 10-25% of each labeled product as a high molecular weight fraction (Mr = 10,000). Digestion of this [3H]glucosamine fraction with endo-beta-galactosidase from Escherichia freundii, specific for the repeating structure of Gal beta (1 leads to 4)GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3), resulted in the following four products upon Bio-Gel P-2 Gel filtration: 1) a disaccharide with the structure GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3)Gal, 2) a trisaccharide with the structure Gal beta (1 leads to 4)GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3) beta Gal, 3) a tetrasaccharide with the sequence Fuc alpha (1 leads to 2)Gal beta (1 leads to 4)GlcNAc beta (1 leads to 3)Gal, and 4) a large complex fragment which contained mannose, glucosamine, galactose, and fucose (presumably the protein linkage region). Methylation linkage analysis of the large complex fraction shows mainly the presence of 4-substituted and terminal N-acetylglucosamine; 3,6-substituted, 6-substituted, 2-substituted, and 2,3-substituted galactose. The GM979 cell erythroglycan is only 30% susceptible to endo-beta-galactosidase degradation probably because of the branched galactose residues, whereas the linear form of erythroglycan from human K562 cells is 60% susceptible. The branched residues in GM979 cell saccharides indicate that this mouse cell line bears an arborized erythroglycan-like glycopeptide similar to those found on human adult erythrocytes, and thus may be a source for the enzyme which transfers an N-acetylglucosamine residue to a 3-linked galactose to form a 3,6-disubstituted galactose."

https://openalex.org/W2056534434,"Delire et al.1 have reported antigen–antibody (Ag–Ab) complexes in newborns, fed on cow's milk, 6 days after birth, whereas they were absent from breast-fed neonates. The method they used was the inhibition of latex–IgG agglutination by polyclonal rheumatoid factor (pRF), linked to the Ag–Ab complexes2. The presence of immune complexes was attributed to the passage through the placenta of maternal IgG with antibody activity against proteins in cow's milk. This interpretation was also based on the characterization of the Ag–Ab nature of the immune complex-like material. We have now used the same and a different method to study a similar population of newborns. Our results are very different from those of Delire et al. We conclude that the possible pathogenicity of immune complexes cannot be assessed on the basis of a single insensitive test and in the absence of symptoms of serum sickness."
