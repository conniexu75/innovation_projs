https://openalex.org/W25637233,"Previous studies in our laboratories had shown that sarcosine dehydrogenase and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase are exclusively mitochondrial enzymes and that they can be liberated from mitochondria by sonic irradiation (2, 3). By employing the N-methyl-oxidizing enzymes as markers, the rates and extent of release of various mitochondrial components during sonic irradiation have been measured. Prom such analyses it has been possible to define more quantitatively the size and composition of the soluble compartment of the mitochondrion. It has been demonstrated also that sarcosine dehydrogenase, located
exclusively in the soluble compartment, provides a convenient marker for distinguishing “heavy” and “light” mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W121512451,"SUMMARY The properties of the oxidation of tetrachlorohydroquinone (THQ) by beef heart mitochondria are described. The addition of protamine is essential for enzymatic activity in mitochondria, although other mitochondrial preparations, such as electron transport particles, can catalyze the oxidation of THQ at maxi- mal rates in the absence of polycation. It is suggested that the addition of protamine to mitochondria which are in a partially open form converts them to a closed system similar to electron transport particles. Specificity studies show that only the tetrahalogenated hydro- quinones can serve as a substrate for the enzyme. Substances such as duroquinone are not enzymatically oxidized by mito- chondrial preparations. It is proposed that the addition of THQ to protamine results in a model cytochrome c compound in which the protein moiety is replaced by protamine, and the heme group by THQ. In mitochondrial preparations, it seems that the cytochrome c oxidase system is responsible for the oxidation of THQ. The effects of inhibitors and the rapid reduction of cytochromes a and u3 indicate that the primary site of interaction of THQ and the respiratory chain may be cytochrome a itself, or that the interaction is between cytochromes a and u3. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21.

https://openalex.org/W2021992205,"SEVERAL, investigators have used the electron spin resonance technique to measure the numbers of stable free radicals induced by ionizing radiation in amino-acids1–4. The observation that at doses in the M.rad region the radical yield does not increase linearly with the absorbed dose but tends towards saturation was explained by Rotblat and Simmons4 as being due to a back reaction between stable and unstable radicals, but as their nature was still in some dispute at that time no details of the mechanism were attempted. The availability of new evidence concerning the radical species has now prompted further investigation of this problem."

All these polysaccharides can be stained with acridine orange after sulphation. Several sulphation techniques have been tried, and the best results have been obtained with chlorosulphonic acid in dry pyridine (Kramer and Windrum6). For the sulphation of glycogen 5 min treatment at 65° C is enough, whereas paramylum bodies and cyst wall require 10–15 min treatment at 70°–75° C."

https://openalex.org/W2013352878,"A PROPORTION of the mammary tumours induced in rats by oral administration of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benz-anthracene (DMBA) have been found to undergo spontaneous regression1. Attempts to stimulate regressing tumours to grow again by hormonal means have been unsuccessful, and it appears possible that this regression may be due to an immunological mechanism2. If this is so it might be possible to demonstrate the presence of anti-tumour antibodies on tumour cells by using Coon's fluorescent antibody technique."
