https://openalex.org/W3011414603,"Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47–69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63–73) vs 55 (IQR 35–60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7–13) vs 12 (IQR 11–43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3012233629,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biodegradable biopolymer which is useful for various applications including packing, medical and coating materials. An endospore-forming bacterium (strain BP17) was isolated from composted soil and evaluated for PHB production. Strain BP17, taxonomically identified as Bacillus drentensis, showed enhanced PHB accumulation and was selected for further studies. To achieve maximum PHB production, the culture conditions for B. drentensis BP17 were optimized through response surface methodology (RSM) employing central composite rotatable design (CCRD). The final optimum fermentation conditions included: pineapple peel solution, 11.5% (v/v); tryptic soy broth (TSB), 60 g/L; pH, 6.0; inoculum size, 10% (v/v) and temperature, 28°C for 36 h. This optimization yielded 5.55 g/L of PHB compared to the non-optimized condition (0.17 g/L). PHB accumulated by B. drentensis BP17 had a polydispersity value of 1.59 and an average molecular weight of 1.15x105 Da. Thermal analyses revealed that PHB existed as a thermally stable semi-crystalline polymer, exhibiting a thermal degradation temperature of 228°C, a melting temperature of 172°C and an apparent melting enthalpy of fusion of 83.69 J/g. It is evident that B. drentensis strain BP17 is a promising bacterium candidate for PHB production using agricultural waste, such as pineapple peel as a low-cost alternative carbon source for PHB production."
https://openalex.org/W3010706193,"The pathogenesis of spinal cord injury (SCI) remains poorly understood and treatment remains limited. Emerging evidence indicates that post-SCI inflammation is severe but the role of reactive astrogliosis not well understood given its implication in ongoing inflammation as damaging or neuroprotective. We have completed an extensive systematic study with MRI, histopathology, proteomics and ELISA analyses designed to further define the severe protracted and damaging inflammation after SCI in a rat model. We have identified 3 distinct phases of SCI: acute (first 2 days), inflammatory (starting day 3) and resolution (>3 months) in 16 weeks follow up. Actively phagocytizing, CD68+/CD163- macrophages infiltrate myelin-rich necrotic areas converting them into cavities of injury (COI) when deep in the spinal cord. Alternatively, superficial SCI areas are infiltrated by granulomatous tissue, or arachnoiditis where glial cells are obliterated. In the COI, CD68+/CD163- macrophage numbers reach a maximum in the first 4 weeks and then decline. Myelin phagocytosis is present at 16 weeks indicating ongoing inflammatory damage. The COI and arachnoiditis are defined by a wall of progressively hypertrophied astrocytes. MR imaging indicates persistent spinal cord edema that is linked to the severity of inflammation. Microhemorrhages in the spinal cord around the lesion are eliminated, presumably by reactive astrocytes within the first week post-injury. Acutely increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases decrease and anti-inflammatory cytokines increase in later phases. In this study we elucidated a number of fundamental mechanisms in pathogenesis of SCI and have demonstrated a close association between progressive astrogliosis and reduction in the severity of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3011091101,"The assessment of examination questions is crucial in educational institutes since examination is one of the most common methods to evaluate students’ achievement in specific course. Therefore, there is a crucial need to construct a balanced and high-quality exam, which satisfies different cognitive levels. Thus, many lecturers rely on Bloom’s taxonomy cognitive domain, which is a popular framework developed for the purpose of assessing students’ intellectual abilities and skills. Several works have been proposed to automatically handle the classification of questions in accordance with Bloom’s taxonomy. Most of these works classify questions according to specific domain. As a result, there is a lack of technique of classifying questions that belong to the multi-domain areas. The aim of this paper is to present a classification model to classify exam questions based on Bloom’s taxonomy that belong to several areas. This study proposes a method for classifying questions automatically, by extracting two features, TFPOS-IDF and word2vec. The purpose of the first feature was to calculate the term frequency-inverse document frequency based on part of speech, in order to assign a suitable weight for essential words in the question. The second feature, pre-trained word2vec, was used to boost the classification process. Then, the combination of these features was fed into three different classifiers; K-Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine, in order to classify the questions. The experiments used two datasets. The first dataset contained 141 questions, while the other dataset contained 600 questions. The classification result for the first dataset achieved an average of 71.1%, 82.3% and 83.7% weighted F1-measure respectively. The classification result for the second dataset achieved an average of 85.4%, 89.4% and 89.7% weighted F1-measure respectively. The finding from this study showed that the proposed method is significant in classifying questions from multiple domains based on Bloom’s taxonomy."
https://openalex.org/W3011208856,"The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS) is the most widely used measure of general belief in conspiracy theories. The scale comprises five related but distinct factors (Government Malfeasance, Extraterrestrial Cover-up, Malevolent Global Conspiracies, Personal Wellbeing, and Control of Information). Despite this, investigators have typically treated the GCBS as unidimensional by referencing only overall total. Although, the GCBS possesses established psychometric properties, critics question its factorial structure, suggest alternative models, and recommend routine examination of GCBS dimensions as part of analysis. Through two studies, the present paper assessed GCBS factorial structure, internal reliability, convergent validity, and invariance. This involved comparing the original five-factor solution with alternative one, two, and three-factor models. To ensure that the best fitting model was robust, the authors conducted analysis in two independent samples (Study one, N = 794, UK university-based sample; and Study two, N = 418, UK respondents collected via a market research company). Results in both studies indicated superior fit for the correlated five-factor solution. This solution demonstrated invariance across gender, and samples (Study one and two). Furthermore, the total scale and five subfactors evinced good alpha and omega total reliability. Convergent validity testing exhibited associations of an expected strength between conspiracist beliefs, reality testing, and cognitive insight. Large intercorrelations existed among GCBS subfactors, suggesting that the measure reflects a narrow set of interrelated conspiracist assumptions. These findings support the use of overall scale scores as an index of belief in conspiracy theories."
https://openalex.org/W3011031607,"Purpose The aim of this study was to quantify changes in physical capacities of thirty-eight basketball players selected from different teams, as well as from varying competitive levels (i.e. Division I, Division II and Division III) during the preparation and in-season periods. Methods Pre (T1) and post (T2) preparation period and during regular season (T3), the players completed a Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery test—level 1. Following a 3 to 8 days-break, players performed a 6-min continuous running test (Mognoni’s test), a counter-movement jump test and a 5-min high-intensity intermittent running test. Results Blood lactate concentration measured after the Mognoni’s test was significantly reduced from T1 to T2, and from T2 to T3 (P<0.001, ƞ2 = 0.424). The distance covered during the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery test was significantly increased only from T1 to T2 in Division II and III (P<0.001, ƞ2 = 0.789). Similarly, the physiological responses to high-intensity intermittent running test were improved only from T1 to T2 (all P<0.001, ƞ2 = 0.495 to 0.652). Despite significant changes observed in running tests from T1 to T2, at individual level 35–55% of players did not show a very likely improvement. Relative peak power produced during vertical jumps at T3 by Division I players was increased compared to T1 (ANOVA interaction, P = 0.037, ƞ2 = 0.134). Conclusions The main improvements in physical capacities occurred during the preparation period, when the aerobic fitness and the ability to sustain high-intensity intermittent efforts were moderately-to-largely improved. However, it appears that the preparation period does not consistently impact on vertical jump variables. Aerobic fitness and force/power production during vertical jumps appear to improve across the competitive season (slightly-to-moderately). Physical tests should be used to identify weaknesses in physical performance of players and to monitor their fatigue status, with the aim to develop individualized training programs."
https://openalex.org/W3012215179,"Even though the acute effects of pre-exercise static stretching and dynamic muscle activity on muscular and functional performance have been largely investigated, their effects on the corticospinal pathway are still unclear. For that reason, this study examined the acute effects of 5×20 s of static stretching, dynamic muscle activity and a control condition on spinal excitability, corticospinal excitability and plantar flexor neuromuscular properties. Fifteen volunteers were randomly tested on separate days. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to investigate corticospinal excitability by recording the amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) and the duration of the cortical silent period (cSP). Peripheral nerve stimulation was applied to investigate (i) spinal excitability using the Hoffmann reflex (Hmax), and (ii) neuromuscular properties using the amplitude of the maximal M-wave (Mmax) and corresponding peak twitch torque. These measurements were performed with a background 30% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Finally, the maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque and the corresponding electromyography (EMG) from soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis were recorded. These parameters were measured immediately before and 10 s after each conditioning activity of plantar flexors. Corticospinal excitability (MEP/Mmax) was significantly enhanced after static stretching in soleus (P = 0.001; ES = 0.54) and gastrocnemius lateralis (P<0.001; ES = 0.64), and after dynamic muscle activity in gastrocnemius lateralis (P = 0.003; ES = 0.53) only. On the other hand, spinal excitability (Hmax/Mmax), cSP duration, muscle activation (EMG/Mmax) as well as maximal voluntary and evoked torque remained unaltered after all pre-exercise interventions. These findings indicate the presence of facilitation of the corticospinal pathway without change in muscle function after both static stretching (particularly) and dynamic muscle activity."
https://openalex.org/W3011873614,"Among several studied strains, Streptomyces rochei IT20 and S. vinaceusdrappus SS14 showed a high level of inhibitory effect against Phytophthora capsici, the causal agent of pepper blight. The effect of two mentioned superior antagonists, as single or combination treatments, on suppression of stem and fruit blight diseases and reproductive growth promotion was investigated in pepper. To explore the induced plant defense reactions, ROS generation and transcriptional changes of selected genes in leaf and fruit tissues of the plant were evaluated. The plants exposed to the combination of two species responded differently in terms of H2O2 accumulation and expression ratio of GST gene compared to single treatments upon pathogen inoculation. Besides, the increment of shoot length, flowering, and fruit weight were observed in healthy plants compared to control. Likely, these changes depended on the coordinated relationships between PR1, ACCO genes and transcription factors WRKY40 enhanced after pathogen challenge. Our findings indicate that appropriate tissue of the host plant is required for inducing Streptomyces-based priming and relied on the up-regulation of SUS and differential regulation of ethylene-dependent genes."
https://openalex.org/W3011650062,"Background Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) can chronically relieve ischemic chest pain and improve the prognosis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Despite its role in mitigating heart complications, EECP and the mechanisms behind its therapeutic nature, such as its effects on blood flow hemodynamics, are still not fully understood. This study aims to elucidate the effect of EECP on significant hemodynamic parameters in the coronary arterial tree. Methods A finite volume method was used in conjunction with the inlet pressure wave (surrogated by the measured aortic pressure) before and during EECP and outlet flow resistance, assuming the blood as newtonian fluid. The time-average wall shear stress (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were determined from the flow field. Results Regardless of the degree of vascular stenosis, hemodynamic conditions and flow patterns could be improved during EECP. In comparison with the original tree, the tree with a severe stenosis (75% area stenosis) demonstrated more significant improvement in hemodynamic conditions and flow patterns during EECP, with surface area ratio of TAWSS risk area (SAR-TAWSS) reduced from 12.3% to 6.7% (vs. SAR-TAWSS reduced from 7.2% to 5.6% in the original tree) and surface area ratio of OSI risk area (SAR-OSI) reduced from 6.8% to 2.5% (vs. SAR-OSI of both 0% before and during EECP in the original tree because of mild stenosis). Moreover, it was also shown that small ratio of diastolic pressure (D) and systolic pressure (S) (D/S) could only improve the hemodynamic condition mildly. The SAR-TAWSS reduction ratio significantly increased as D/S became larger. Conclusions A key finding of the study was that the improvement of hemodynamic conditions along the LMCA trees during EECP became more significant with the increase of D/S and the severity degree of stenoses at the bifurcation site. These findings have important implications on EECP as adjuvant therapy before or after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with diffuse atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3012357990,"Objective To analyze factors associated with knowledge gaps and acquisition about HPV and its vaccine among medical students. Method Cross-sectional and analytical study conducted at the University of São Paulo Medicine School, in 2016. A convenience sample of students completed a data collection instrument containing questions on knowledge about HPV and its vaccine, and vaccine acceptability. The level of knowledge and acceptability established as a ""good level"" was 80% of correct answers on the questionnaire. Internal validity was calculated with Cronbach's alpha value (α) = 0.74. Bivariate and multiple analyzes were performed using the Stata® program (Stata Corp, College Station, USA) 14.0. Results To evaluate the internal consistency of the instrument applied, the Cronbach's alpha equation was used, obtaining the alpha value (α) = 0.74 for this population. This value attests that the consistency of the answers obtained with this questionnaire is considered substantial and acceptable. Among the 518 medical students who completed the survey, the majority were men 312 (60.4%) with a mean age of 23 (± 2.8) years old; 199 (38.3%) of the students were in the final years of graduation (5th and 6th years). Students in the first, second and third year of study had a 51% higher risk of a knowledge gap when compared to students in the final years of graduation [PR 1.51 (1.3:1.8); p <0.001]. Men were at 22% higher risk of unsatisfactory knowledge than women are [PR 1.22 (1.07: 1.39). There was no knowledge acquisition during medical school in the following questions (p <0.05), indication of vaccine for individuals with HIV and contraindication in pregnant patients. Conclusion Male medical students, in the first year of medical school, and those who were not vaccinated had significant knowledge gaps about HPV. The novelty of the study includes the finding of non- acquisition of knowledge during the medical school graduation on safety and vaccination schedule and vaccine administration in specific populations."
https://openalex.org/W3012400709,"Spatio-temporal variation in resource availability leads to a variety of animal movement strategies. In the case of ungulates, temporally unpredictable landscapes are associated with nomadism, while high predictability in the resource distribution favours migratory or sedentary behaviours depending on the spatial and temporal scale of landscape dynamics. As most of the surveys on moose (Alces alces) movement behaviours in Europe have been conducted on Scandinavian populations, little is known about the movement strategies of moose at the southern edge of the species’ range. We expected that decreasing habitat patchiness in central Europe would be associated with the prevalence of migratory behaviours. To verify this hypothesis, we analysed 32 moose fitted with GPS collars from two study areas in eastern Poland which differed in a level of habitat patchiness. We classified moose movements using the net squared displacement method. As presumed, lower patchiness in the Biebrza study site was associated with the predominance of individuals migrating short-distance, while in more patchy landscape of Polesie, resident moose dominated. At the individual level, the propensity of moose to migrate decreased with increasing abundance of forest habitats in their summer ranges. In addition, the parameters (migration distance, timing and duration) for migratory individuals varied substantially between individuals and years. Yet, in spring individual moose expressed a consistent migration timing across years. There was little synchronization of migration timing between individuals from the same population both in spring and autumn, which may have been related to mild weather conditions. We observed that moose postponed their migrations and started movement toward summer ranges at a similar time window in years when spring was delayed due to harsh weather. Hence, in light of global warming, we presume further changes in animal movements will arise."
https://openalex.org/W3011563967,"Literature shows a high prevalence of MetS among Malaysians, varying across the major ethnicities. Since sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and diet habits of such communities have been reported to be diverse, the objective of this study was to investigate the association of various sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors and diet habits with MetS overall, as well as with the three major ethnic communities in Malaysia, specifically.We conducted a cross-sectional study among 481 Malaysians of ages 18 years and above living in the state of Johor, Malaysia. Information on demographics, lifestyle and diet habits were collected using a structured questionnaire. Harmonized criteria were used to assess the status of MetS. Multiple logistic regression was employed to determine any associations between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and dietary behaviours with MetS.MetS was found among 32.2% of the respondents and was more prevalent among the Indians (51.9%), followed by the Malays (36.7%) and the Chinese (20.2%). Overall, increasing age (AOR = 2.44[95%CI = 1.27-4.70] at 40-49 years vs. AOR = 4.14[95%CI = 1.97-8.69] at 60 years and above) and Indian ethnicity (AOR = 1.95[95%CI = 1.12-3.38)] increased the odds of MetS, while higher education (AOR = 0.44[95%CI = 0.20-0.94] decreased the odds of MetS in this population. Quick finishing of meals (AOR = 2.17[95%CI = 1.02-4.60]) and low physical activity (AOR = 4.76[95%CI = 1.49-15.26]) were associated with increased odds of MetS among the Malays and the Chinese, respectively.The population of Johor depicts a diverse lifestyle and diet behaviour, and some of these factors are associated with MetS in certain ethnic groups. In the light of such differences, ethnic specific measures would be needed to reduce the prevalence of MetS among those in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3012543558,"In this paper, we introduce a network-based methodology to study how political entities evolve over time. We constructed networks of voting data from the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, where deputies are nodes and edges are represented by voting similarity among deputies. The Brazilian Chamber of deputies is characterized by a multi-party political system. Thus, we would expect a broad spectrum of ideas to be represented. Our results, however, revealed that plurality of ideas is not present at all: the effective number of communities representing ideas based on agreement/disagreement in propositions is about 3 over the entire studied time span. The obtained results also revealed different patterns of coalitions between distinct parties. Finally, we also found signs of early party isolation before presidential impeachment proceedings effectively started. We believe that the proposed framework could be used to complement the study of political dynamics and even applied in similar social networks where individuals are organized in a complex manner."
https://openalex.org/W3011009278,"Mitochondria are mostly inherited by maternal via, that is, only mitochondria from eggs are retained in the embryos. However, this general assumption of uniparentally transmitted, homoplasmic and non-recombining mitochondrial genomes is becoming more and more controversial. The presence of different sequences of mtDNA within a cell or individual, known as heteroplasmy, is increasingly reported in several taxon of animals, such as molluscs, arthropods and vertebrates. In this work, a considerable frequency of heteroplasmy were detected in the COI and 16S genes of the spider crab Maja brachydactyla, possibly associated to hybridisation with the congeneric species Maja squinado. This finding is a fact to keep in mind before addressing molecular analyses based on mitochondrial markers, since the assumption of maternal inheritance could lead to erroneous results. As M. brachydactyla is a commercial species, heteroplasmy is an important aspect to take into account for the fisheries management of this resource, since effective population size could be overestimated."
https://openalex.org/W3011588497,"Major vascular complications (VCs) of ilio-femoral arterial access after percutaneous coronary interventions are infrequent, but are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Routine endovascular repair of VCs is becoming the treatment of choice, especially for patients who cannot tolerate vascular surgery due to advanced cardiovascular disease or are in a bailout situation. Here, we review the different types of vascular access site complications associated with percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and assess the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment.Data were retrospectively analysed from patients who experienced VCs after transfemoral PCIs, from December 2014 to May 2018. During this period, out of 2833 patients who underwent femoral coronary interventions, 53 (1.9%) experienced major VCs.In total, 40/53 (75.5%) cases with major VCs led to unplanned endovascular repair and 13/53 (24.5%) cases required surgical repair. VCs included 17 (32.1%) retroperitoneal bleeding events (BARC-2, 3a,b), 20 (37.7%) intimal dissections, and 16 (30.2%) femoral pseudoaneurysms. Overall, 32 (60.4%) patients received a covered stent, two (3.8%) received a nitinol stent, five (9.4%) patients with dissections were treated with prolonged balloon angioplasty alone, and one patient with femoral pseudoaneurysm underwent thrombin injection with simultaneous balloon occlusion. The mean hospital stay for patients after endovascular treatment was 11.06 ± 5.2 days, while for patients after surgical repair it was 17 ± 8.2 days. Endovascularly treated patients were transfused with red blood cells (13/40 32.5% vs. 2/13 15.4%) significantly more often than patients treated surgically, although surgically treated patients received more red blood cell concentrates per unit than endovascularly treated patients (1 ± 0.47 vs. 2 ± 0.93). During the one-year follow-up, no intermittent claudication was reported, and no patient required secondary endovascular or surgical repair.For patients who cannot tolerate vascular surgery due to advanced cardiovascular disease or are in a bailout situation, endovascular management of VCs following PCIs seems to be a feasible and safe treatment option, and represents an alternative to surgical repair in life-threatening situations. Endovascular treatment was associated with significantly fewer red blood cell concentrates per patient and fewer days in hospital than surgical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3012049809,"Complications of prematurity are a leading cause of newborn death in Malawi. Despite early adoption of Kangaroo mother care (KMC), coverage remains low and women have expressed challenges in using the traditional wrapper-chitenje. In 2016, a study was conducted to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a customized KMC wrap in improving adherence to KMC practices among mothers.Mother-baby dyads (301) were randomized to receive either a customized CarePlus Wrap developed by Lærdal Global Health or a traditional chitenje. Enrolled mother-baby dyads were assessed in the KMC ward at 2-3 days after of admission, and then again at 7-15 days post-discharge. Topics covered included skin-to-skin practices, breastfeeding, perceptions of the wrap, and family/community support. Chi square tests were used to assess associations between wrap type and KMC practices. The study received ethics approval.This study found that a customized KMC wrap is highly acceptable to women and improved skin-to-skin practices in facility-based KMC: 44% of mothers using a customized wrap reported 20 or more hours per day, compared to 33% of mothers using the traditional chitenje. Women using the customized wrap reported being comfortable in keeping the baby in skin-to-skin position more often than women using the chitenje (96% vs. 71%), and they were able to tie on the wrap themselves (86% vs. 10%). At the time of discharge from KMC, more women who used the customized wrap were satisfied with the wrap than those who used the traditional chitenje (94% vs. 56%). The customized wrap did not appear to impact other newborn practices, such as breastfeeding.This study provides evidence that a customized KMC wrap is highly acceptable to mothers, and it can contribute to better skin-to-skin practices. Use of a customized wrap may be one mechanism to support mothers in practicing KMC and skin-to-skin contact in addition to other interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3012257162,"Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy (ASBP) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as pyelonephritis, preterm or low birth weight delivery if untreated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the isolated bacterial agents, and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns in pregnant women attending antenatal care at Mbale Hospital.This was a cross sectional study in which 587 pregnant women with no symptoms and signs of urinary tract infection were recruited from January to March 2019. Mid-stream clean catch urine samples were collected from the women using sterile containers. The urine samples were cultured using standard laboratory methods. The bacterial colonies were identified and antibiotic sensitivity was done using disc diffusion method. Chi squared tests and logistic regression were done to identify factors associated with asymptomatic bacteriuria. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Out of the 587 pregnant women, 22 (3.75%) tested positive for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Women aged 20-24 years were less likely to have ASBP when compared to women aged less than 20 years (AOR = 0.14, 95%CI 0.02-0.95, P = 0.004). The most common isolates in descending order were E. coli (n = 13, 46.4%) and S.aureus (n = 9, 32.1%). Among the gram negative isolates, the highest sensitivity was to gentamycin (82.4%) and imipenem (82.4%). The gram positive isolates were sensitive to gentamycin (90.9%) followed by imipenem (81.8%). All the isolates were resistant to sulphamethoxazole with trimethoprim (100%). Multidrug resistance was 82.4% among gram negative isolates and 72.4% among the gram positive isolates.There was high resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics. There is need to do urine culture and sensitivity from women with ASBP so as to reduce the associated complications."
https://openalex.org/W3012413059,"Peach tree (PT) pollen sensitization is highly prevalent in subjects living in areas where this tree is widely cultivated. None of the allergens responsible for these sensitizations have been identified so far. Our aim was to identify the most relevant PT pollen allergens and analyze their capacity for inducing respiratory symptoms. We studied sixty-two individuals sensitized to PT pollen who developed symptoms after its exposure. The IgE binding profile on peach pollen extract by means of immunoblotting using sera from these subjects was analyzed. Protein extract was fractionated by anion-exchange chromatography and HPLC, fractions run in SDS-PAGE and proteins were identified from IgE-binding bands by mass spectrometry. Several allergenic proteins in the PT pollen extract were recognized by patients’ IgE: a glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase-like, a polygalacturonase, an UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase and a PR-1a protein. This PR-1a protein is a novel allergen frequently recognized with a molecular mass of 18 kDa, named as Pru p 9 following the WHO-IUIS nomenclature. Skin Prick Test (SPT) performed with this allergen was positive in 41% of the PT pollen-sensitized clinical cases. Most of them had rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis, but a significant percentage experienced asthma with seasonal symptoms during the period of PT flowering. Nasal Provocation test (NPT) with Pru p 9 was positive in all cases with positive SPT to this new allergen eliciting nasal symptoms similar to those challenged with PT pollen. We demonstrate that PT pollen can induce sensitization and allergy in an exposed population, being Pru p 9 a relevant allergen responsible of respiratory symptoms. Considering the extensive peach worldwide production with a large number of people involved, our results add a great value for the diagnosis and management of subjects allergic to this pollen."
https://openalex.org/W3012504469,"A total of 201 patients with major depressive disorder from four hospitals in Malaysia were followed up for 5 years to determine the prognostic factors of recurrent major depressive disorder that could potentially contribute to improving the management of MDD patients. For each individual patient, at the time of recruitment as part of a case-control study, information was collected on recent threatening life events, personality and social and occupational functioning, while blood samples were collected to genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor (VDR), zinc transporter-3 (ZnT3), dopamine transporter-1 (DAT1), brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), serotonin receptor 1A (HT1A) and 2A (HT2A) genes. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression were used to estimate hazard functions for recurrence of major depressive disorder. Individuals with severe MDD in previous major depressive episodes had five and a half times higher hazard of developing recurrence compared to mild and moderate MDD (HR = 5.565, 95% CI = 1.631-18.994, p = 0.006). Individuals who scored higher on social avoidance had three and a half times higher hazard of recurrence of MDD (HR = 3.525, 95% CI = 1.349-9.209; p = 0.010). There was significant interaction between ApaI +64978C>A single nucleotide polymorphism and severity. The hazard ratio increased by 6.4 times from mild and moderate to severe MDD for A/A genotype while that for C/A genotype increased by 11.3 times. Social avoidance and severity of depression at first episode were prognostic of recurrence. Screening for personality factors at first encounter with MDD patients needs to be considered as part of the clinical practice. For those at risk of recurrence in relation to social avoidance, the psychological intervention prescribed should be customized to focus on this modifiable factor.

First introduced in 2017, 3D perovskite sensitized upconversion (UC) is a young fast-evolving field due to the tunability of the underlying perovskite material. By tuning the perovskite bandgap, visible-to-ultraviolet, near-infrared-to-visible or green-to-blue UC has been realized, which depicts the broad applicability of this material. As this research field is still in its infancy, we hope to stimulate the field by highlighting the advantages of these perovskite nanocrystals and bulk films, as well as shedding light onto the current drawbacks. In particular, the keywords toxicity, reproducibility and stability must be addressed prior to commercialization of the technology. If successful, photon interconversion is a means to increase the achievable efficiency of photovoltaic cells beyond its current limits by increasing the window of useable wavelengths."
https://openalex.org/W3012367104,"Mollusk shell is composed of two CaCO3 polymorphs (calcite and aragonite) and an organic matrix that consists of acetic acid- or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-soluble and insoluble proteins and other biomolecules (polysaccharides, β-chitin). However, the shell matrix proteins involved in nacre formation are not fully known. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify and characterize a novel protein from the acetic acid-insoluble fraction from the shell of Pteria sterna, named in this study as Ps19, to have a better understanding of the biomineralization process. Ps19 biochemical characterization showed that it is a glycoprotein that exhibits calcium- and chitin-binding capabilities. Additionally, it is capable of inducing aragonite plate crystallization in vitro. Ps19 partial peptide sequence showed similarity with other known shell matrix proteins, but it displayed similarity with proteins from Crassostrea gigas, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Biomphalaria glabrata, Alpysia californica, Lottia gigantea and Elysia chlorotica. The results obtained indicated that Ps19 might play an important role in nacre growth of mollusk shells."
https://openalex.org/W3011064184,"Background Ghana’s national prevalence survey showed higher than expected tuberculosis (TB) prevalence, indicating that many people with TB are not identified and treated. This study aimed to identify gaps in the TB diagnostic cascade prior to starting treatment. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in urban and rural health facilities in south-east Ghana. Consecutive patients routinely identified as needing a TB test were followed up for two months to find out if sputum was submitted and/or treatment started. The causal effect of health facility location on submitting sputum was assessed before risk factors were investigated using logistic regression. Results A total of 428 persons (mean age 48 years, 67.3% female) were recruited, 285 (66.6%) from urban and 143 (33.4%) from rural facilities. Of 410 (96%) individuals followed up, 290 (70.7%) submitted sputum, among which 27 (14.1%) had a positive result and started treatment. Among those who visited an urban facility, 245/267(91.8%) submitted sputum, compared to 45/143 (31.5%) who visited a rural facility. Participants recruited at the urban facility were far more likely to submit a sputum sample (odds ratio (OR) 24.24, 95%CI 13.84–42.51). After adjustment for confounding, there was still a strong association between attending the urban facility and submitting sputum (adjusted OR (aOR) 9.52, 95%CI 3.87–23.40). Travel distance of >10 km to the laboratory was the strongest predictor of not submitting sputum (aOR 0.12, 95%CI 0.05–0.33). Conclusion The majority of presumptive TB patients attending a rural health facility did not submit sputum for testing, mainly due to the long travel distance to the laboratory. Bridging this gap in the diagnostic cascade may improve case detection."

This octopus species, found from the intertidal to shallow continental-shelf waters, is largely sedentary, and the subject of intense, frequently unregulated fishing effort. We infer connectivity among insular populations of this octopus. Mitochondrial control region and COX1 sequence datasets reveal two highly divergent haplogroups (α and β) at similar frequencies, with opposing clinal distributions along the sampled latitudinal range. Haplogroups have different demographic and phylogeographic patterns, with origins related to the two last glacial maxima. FST values suggest a significant differentiation for most pairwise comparisons, including insular and continental samples, from the Galicia and Morocco coasts, with the exception of pairwise comparisons for samples from Madeira and the Canaries populations. Results indicate the existence of genetically differentiated octopus populations throughout the NEA. This emphasizes the importance of regulations by autonomous regional governments of the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries, for appropriate management of insular octopus stocks."
https://openalex.org/W3012101860,"Water is essential for living organisms. Terrestrial organisms are incessantly exposed to the stress of losing water, desiccation stress. Avoiding the mortality caused by desiccation stress, many organisms acquired molecular mechanisms to tolerate desiccation. Larvae of the African midge, Polypedilum vanderplanki, and its embryonic cell line Pv11 tolerate desiccation stress by entering an ametabolic state, anhydrobiosis, and return to active life after rehydration. The genes related to desiccation tolerance have been comprehensively analyzed, but transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to induce these genes after desiccation or rehydration remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the gene regulatory network in Pv11 cells and compared it with that of Drosophila melanogaster, a desiccation sensitive species. We demonstrated that nuclear transcription factor Y subunit gamma-like, which is important for drought stress tolerance in plants, and its transcriptional regulation of downstream positive feedback loops have a pivotal role in regulating various anhydrobiosis-related genes. This study provides an initial insight into the systemic mechanism of desiccation tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3009447817,"The American White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) is a nomadic wading bird that is increasing the amount of time spent foraging in urban areas, relying on artificial wetlands and other anthropogenic resources year-round. In this study, we explore whether and how American White Ibis association with urban environments is predictive of variation in the timing and length of behavioral seasons. Other urbanized species exhibit altered annual cycles such as loss of migratory behavior and year-round breeding related to consistent resource abundance, often related to intentional and unintentional provisioning. To determine if these same patterns of behavior were also present in White Ibis, we used behavioral change point analysis to segment the tracks of 41 ibis equipped with GPS backpacks to identify the initiation and duration of four behavioral seasons (non-breeding, pre-breeding, breeding, post-breeding) the degree of urban association. We found that intraspecific variation in urban habitat use had strong carryover effects on the timing and duration of behavioral seasons. This study revealed ibis with higher use of urban habitats in non-breeding seasons had longer non-breeding seasons and shorter breeding seasons that began earlier in the year compared to ibis that primarily use wetland habitats. The timing and duration of seasons also varied with ibis age, such that ibis spent more time engaged in breeding-related seasons as they aged. Juvenile and subadult ibis, though considered to be reproductively immature, also exhibit behavioral shifts in relation to breeding seasons. The behavioral patterns found in this study provide evidence that ibis are adapting their annual cycles and seasonal behaviors to exploit urban resources. Future research is needed to identify the effect of interactions between ibis urban association and age on behavioral season expression."
https://openalex.org/W3010815141,"The continuing HIV pandemic calls for broad, multi-sectoral responses that foster community control of local prevention and care services, with the goal of leveraging high quality treatment as a means of reducing HIV incidence. Service system improvements require stakeholder input from across the care continuum to identify gaps and to inform strategic plans that improve HIV service integration and delivery. System dynamics modeling offers a participatory research approach through which stakeholders learn about system complexity and about ways to achieve sustainable system-level improvements. Via an intensive group model building process with a task force of community stakeholders with diverse roles and responsibilities for HIV service implementation, delivery and surveillance, we designed and validated a multi-module system dynamics model of the HIV care continuum, in relation to local prevention and care service capacities. Multiple sources of data were used to calibrate the model for a three-county catchment area of central Connecticut. We feature a core module of the model for the purpose of illustrating its utility in understanding the dynamics of treatment as prevention at the community level. We also describe the methods used to validate the model and support its underlying assumptions to improve confidence in its use by stakeholders for systems understanding and decision making. The model's generalizability and implications of using it for future community-driven strategic planning and implementation efforts are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3011222545,"The Mediterranean Basin represents a Global Biodiversity Hotspot where many organisms show high inter- and intraspecific differentiation. Extant phylogeographic patterns of terrestrial circum-Mediterranean faunas were mainly shaped through Pleistocene range shifts and range fragmentations due to retreat into different glacial refugia. Thus, several extant Mediterranean bird species have diversified by surviving glaciations in different hospitable refugia and subsequently expanded their distribution ranges during the Holocene. Such a scenario was also suggested for the Eurasian Wren (Nannus troglodytes) despite the lack of genetic data for most Mediterranean subspecies. Our phylogenetic multi-locus analysis comprised 18 out of 28 currently accepted subspecies of N. troglodytes, including all but one subspecies which are present in the Mediterranean Basin. The resulting phylogenetic reconstruction dated the onset of the entire Holarctic radiation of three Nannus species to the early Pleistocene. In the Eurasian Wren, two North African subspecies represented separate basal lineages from the Maghreb (N. t. kabylorum) and from the Libyan Cyrenaica (N. t. juniperi), being only distantly related to other Mediterranean populations. Although N. troglodytes appeared to be paraphyletic with respect to the Nearctic Winter Wren (N. hiemalis), respective nodes did not receive strong statistical support. In contrast, paraphyly of the Ibero-Maghrebian taxon N. t. kabylorum was strongly supported. Southern Iberian populations of N. t. kabylorum did not clade with Maghrebian populations of the same subspecies but formed a sister clade to a highly diverse European clade (including nominate N. t. troglodytes and eight further taxa). In accordance with a pattern also found in other birds, Eurasian populations were split into a western clade (Europe, Caucasus) and an eastern clade (Central Asia, Sino-Himalayas, East Asia). This complex phylogeographic pattern revealed cryptic diversification in N. troglodytes, especially in the Iberio-Maghrebian region."

In nasopharyngeal cancer, the prognostic role of this immune cells within tumor microenvironment is still doubtful. We conducted a study that included 25 nasopharyngeal cancer biopsy specimens to seek a more direct relationship between tumor infiltrating immune cells and tumor progression. Apart from that, we also checked the PD-L1 protein through immunohistochemistry. The PD-L1 was positively expressed in all our 25 samples with nasopharyngeal cancer WHO type 3 histology. Majority samples have >50% PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. We also found that denser local tumor infiltrating immune cells population have relatively much smaller local tumor volume. The inverse applied, with the mean local tumor volumes were 181.92 cm3 ± 81.45 cm3, 117.13 cm3 ± 88.72 cm3, and 55.13 cm3 ± 25.06 cm3 for mild, moderate, and heavy immune cells infiltration respectively (p = 0.013). Therefore, we concluded that tumor infiltrating immune cells play an important role in tumor progression, hence evaluating this simple and predictive factor may provide us with some valuable prognostic information."
https://openalex.org/W3012291766,"In this study, research on a pile group system was conducted using shaking table tests under four working conditions: a natural foundation and pile-spacing conditions of 3D, 3.5D, and 4D (D is the diameter of the pile). The time histories of the excess pore pressure ratio and settlement were analyzed. It was determined that pile foundations improved the anti-liquefaction performance of the soil, and the effect was much greater when the pile spacing was 3D. In addition, the settlement dynamic amplification factor (SDAF) was proposed and calculated at different vibration times. The result was fitted with a linear relationship, and the correlation coefficient was relatively high. During the aseismic design of the pile foundation bearing capacity, the SDAF was multiplied by the static load, and the results showed that in the dynamic design of the pile foundation, the dynamic problem can be transformed into a static analysis, which can provide a reference for the design of the vertical bearing capacity of pile foundations under seismic force."
https://openalex.org/W3012513438,"In Argentina, HIV prevalence among transgender women (TGW) has been reported at 34%. The stigma is one of the most important factors limiting their access to healthcare services. The aims of this study were to compare different HIV testing methodologies, to determine the factors associated with HIV diagnosis and to determine the feasibility of a home-based HIV testing service for TGW.A multidisciplinary team performed home-based HIV testing interventions in four cities of Argentina. Participants self-identified as TGW, older than 14 years and with a negative or unknown HIV status. Blood samples were screened by two rapid tests (RT), one based on antibodies (Determine™ HIV-1/2) and the other on antigen and antibodies (Determine™ HIV-1/2 Combo), and the subsequent blood processing via 4th generation ELISA (VIDAS HIV DUO). All reactive samples were confirmed with a viral load (VL). We compared the results of both RT with the ELISA. Samples were pooled in groups of 6 and a VL (Abbott Real Time) performed to identify acute HIV infections. Factors associated with HIV infection were evaluated with multivariate logistic regression analysis.A total of 260 TGW were tested, 51 tested positive (HIV prevalence 19.6%). There were no discordant results between both RTs nor between RTs and 4th generation ELISA, therefore the correlation was 100%. The VL identified 2 additional positive samples. The final analytic sample for positive cases consisted of 53 TGW. In the multivariate analysis, factors associated with a positive HIV result were history of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and not being previously tested for HIV. TGW tested for the first time were at 4 times greater risk of being HIV positive compared to those that were tested previously.A multidisciplinary home-based HIV testing service among TGW is feasible and effective to detect cases of HIV infection. The testing algorithm should start with an RT followed by molecular diagnosis. The history of STIs and never having been tested for HIV were the factors associated with HIV-positive results and should determine efforts to reach this population. Home-based testing reaches individuals that were not tested before and who have more risk of acquiring HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3011048657,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of serious lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children worldwide and a high priority for vaccine development. Despite over 50 years of research, however, no vaccine is yet available. One block to vaccine development is an incomplete understanding of the aberrant memory response to the formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV) given to children in the 1960s. This vaccine caused enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) with later natural RSV infection. Concern that any non-live virus vaccine may also cause ERD has blocked development of subunit vaccines for young children. A number of animal FI-RSV studies suggest various immune mechanisms behind ERD. However, other than limited data from the original FI-RSV trial, there is no information on the human ERD-associated responses. An in vitro model with human blood specimens may shed light on the immune memory responses likely responsible for ERD. Memory T cell responses to an antigen are guided by the innate responses, particularly dendritic cells that present an antigen in conjunction with co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine signaling. Our in vitro model involves human monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDC) and allogenic T cell cultures to assess innate responses that direct T cell responses. Using this model, we evaluated human responses to live RSV, FI-RSV, and subunit RSV G vaccines (G-containing virus-like particles, G-VLP). Similar to findings in animal studies, FI-RSV induced prominent Th2/Th17-biased responses with deficient type-1 responses compared to live virus. Responses to G-VLPs were similar to live virus, i.e. biased towards a Th1 and not a Th2/Th17. Also mutating CX3C motif in G gave a more pronounced moDC responses associated with type-1 T cell responses. This in vitro model identifies human immune responses likely associated with ERD and provides another pre-clinical tool to assess the safety of RSV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3011720326,"It has been demonstrated that secretion of several hormones can be classically conditioned, however, the underlying brain responses of such conditioning have never been investigated before. In this study we aimed to investigate how oxytocin administration and classically conditioned oxytocin influence brain responses. In total, 88 females were allocated to one of three groups: oxytocin administration, conditioned oxytocin, or placebo, and underwent an experiment consisting of three acquisition and three evocation days. Participants in the conditioned group received 24 IU of oxytocin together with a conditioned stimulus (CS) during three acquisition days and placebo with the CS on three evocation days. The oxytocin administration group received 24 IU of oxytocin and the placebo group received placebo during all days. On the last evocation day, fMRI scanning was performed for all participants during three tasks previously shown to be affected by oxytocin: presentation of emotional faces, crying baby sounds and heat pain. Region of interest analysis revealed that there was significantly lower activation in the right amygdala and in two clusters in the left superior temporal gyrus in the oxytocin administration group compared to the placebo group in response to observing fearful faces. The activation in the conditioned oxytocin group was in between the other two groups for these clusters but did not significantly differ from either group. No group differences were found in the other tasks. Preliminary evidence was found for brain activation of a conditioned oxytocin response; however, despite this trend in the expected direction, the conditioned group did not significantly differ from other groups. Future research should, therefore, investigate the optimal timing of conditioned endocrine responses and study whether the findings generalize to other hormones as well."
https://openalex.org/W3010683256,"Introduction The management of minor conditions represents a significant burden for urgent and emergency care services and reduces the capacity to provide specialist care for higher acuity healthcare need. A pilot Digital Minor Illness Service (DMIRS) was commenced in the North East of England in December 2017 to feasibility test the NHS 111 referral to community pharmacy for patients presenting with minor conditions. Objectives A formative evaluation of the service activity data and qualitative investigation of stakeholders involved in the service design, management, delivery and use, aims to present and investigate the service outcomes. Method Routine service activity data was evaluated during Jan–Dec 2018 to investigate the demographics of patients included in the service; the presenting conditions; and how those referrals were managed by community pharmacies. Semi-structured interviews with NHS 111 call handlers, project team members, community pharmacists and patients were undertaken to investigate the design, management, implementation and delivery of the service. Results 13,246 NHS 111 patient calls were referred to community pharmacy during the evaluative period. The most common presenting conditions were acute pain (n = 1144, 8.6%) and cough (n = 887, 6.7%). A large volume of complaints (47.1%, 6233) were resolved in community pharmacy. Stakeholders explained the structured approach to service design, organisation and implementation facilitated successful delivery and management. Patients reported positive experiences with accessing care via DMIRS. Conclusions DMIRS demonstrated that patients could be referred to community pharmacy for the management of minor conditions, shifting a burden away from urgent and emergency care. The service data provides key information for further optimisation of service design, and stakeholder training and awareness. The service was acceptable and valued by patients. Evidence from the DMIRS pilot has been utilised to inform recent national healthcare policy and practice around the management of minor conditions within the urgent and emergency care setting."
https://openalex.org/W3010741085,"Background Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a late-stage malignancy with poor prognosis, but we know little about what diagnostic tests and procedures people with CUP receive prior to diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to determine how health service utilisation prior to diagnosis for people with cancer-registry notified CUP differs from those notified with metastatic cancer of known primary. Methods We identified people with a cancer registry notification of CUP (n = 327) from the 45 and Up Study, a prospective cohort of 266,724 people ≥45 years in New South Wales, Australia, matched with up to three controls with a diagnosis of metastatic cancer of known primary (n = 977). Baseline questionnaire data were linked to population health data to identify all health service use, diagnostic tests, and procedures in the month of diagnosis and 3 months prior. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results After adjusting for age and educational attainment, people with a cancer-registry notified CUP diagnosis were more likely to be an aged care resident (OR = 2.78, 95%CI 1.37–5.63), have an emergency department visit (OR = 1.65, 95%CI 1.23–2.21), serum tumor marker tests (OR = 1.51, 95%CI 1.12–2.04), or a cytology test without immunohistochemistry (OR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.47–2.76), and less likely to have a histopathology test without immunohistochemistry (OR = 0.43, 95%CI 0.31–0.59). Neither general practitioner, specialist, allied health practitioner or nurse consultations, hospitalisations, nor imaging procedures were associated with a CUP diagnosis. Conclusions The health service and diagnostic pathway to diagnosis differs markedly for people notified with CUP compared to those with metastatic cancer of known primary. While these differences may indicate missed opportunities for earlier detection and appropriate management, for some patients they may be clinically appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W3011081949,"One of the key challenges in real-time systems is the analysis of the memory hierarchy. Many Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis methods supporting an instruction cache are based on iterative or convergence algorithms, which are rather slow. Our goal in this paper is to reduce the WCET analysis time on systems with a simple lockable instruction cache, focusing on the Lock-MS method. First, we propose an algorithm to obtain a structure-based representation of the Control Flow Graph (CFG). It organizes the whole WCET problem as nested subproblems, which takes advantage of common branch-and-bound algorithms of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solvers. Second, we add support for multiple locking points per task, each one with specific cache contents, instead of a given locked content for the whole task execution. Locking points are set heuristically before outer loops. Such simple heuristics adds no complexity, and reduces the WCET by taking profit of the temporal reuse found in loops. Since loops can be processed as isolated regions, the optimal contents to lock into cache for each region can be obtained, and the WCET analysis time is further reduced. With these two improvements, our WCET analysis is around 10 times faster than other approaches. Also, our results show that the WCET is reduced, and the hit ratio achieved for the lockable instruction cache is similar to that of a real execution with an LRU instruction cache. Finally, we analyze the WCET sensitivity to compiler optimization, showing for each benchmark the right choices and pointing out that O0 is always the worst option."
https://openalex.org/W3011148598,"The population genetic structure of crop pest populations gives information about their spatial ecology, which helps in designing management strategies. In this paper, we investigated the genetic structure of the Mediterranean Corn Borer (MCB), Sesamia nonagrioides Lefèbvre (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), one of the most important maize pests in the Mediterranean countries, using microsatellite markers for the first time in this species. Insects were collected in twenty-five locations in southwest and southeast France from cultivated and wild host plants (Zea mays, Sorghum halepense and Typha domingensis). Contrary to what has been reported so far in France, we found that MCB populations could be locally abundant on wild poales plants. Analysis was carried out at 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Molecular variance was significantly determined by geography, then by host plant, with 17% and 4%, respectively, when considered as a major effect, and with 14% and 1%, respectively, when considered as a marginal effect in permutational analysis. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and GENELAND Bayesian clustering suggested that populations infecting wild plants (T. domingensis and S. halepense) were more structured locally than those affecting cultivated maize. In S. halepense, significant Isolation By Distance (IBD) indicated that this factor could explain genetic differentiation of the moth populations. In T. domingensis, local population differentiation was strong but did not depend on distance. The implication of this absence of population structure in maize and the heterogeneity of population genetics patterns in wild plants are discussed in the context of the population dynamics hypothesis and population management strategies."

We tested the helpfulness of a map with the points of interest, an image preview of the next point of interest to visit, and an arrow showing the direction to it. The results show that the effectiveness of these guidance systems depend on the distance to the point of interest and the accuracy of the data obtained from the Global Positioning System. We also measured the total time that participants spent looking at the screen, as well as the perceived elapsed time as a measurement of real world dissociation. Finally, we discuss preliminary results to minimize the risk of accidents when using augmented reality applications in an outdoor urban environment."
https://openalex.org/W3012535063,"Obesity can initiate and accelerate the progression of kidney diseases. However, it remains unclear how obesity affects renal dysfunction. Here, we show that a newly generated podocyte-specific tubular sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) knockout mouse model (Tsc2Δpodocyte) develops proteinuria and dies due to end-stage renal dysfunction by 10 weeks of age. Tsc2Δpodocyte mice exhibit an increased glomerular size and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, including podocyte foot process effacement, mesangial sclerosis and proteinaceous casts. Podocytes isolated from Tsc2Δpodocyte mice show nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2-mediated increased oxidative stress response on microarray analysis and their autophagic activity is lowered through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-unc-51-like kinase 1 pathway. Rapamycin attenuated podocyte dysfunction and extends survival in Tsc2Δpodocyte mice. Additionally, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is increased in podocytes of renal biopsy specimens obtained from obese patients with chronic kidney disease. Our work shows that mTORC1 hyperactivation in podocytes leads to severe renal dysfunction and that inhibition of mTORC1 activity in podocytes could be a key therapeutic target for obesity-related kidney diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3012100632,"Objectives We had developed a method that can help detect and identify lymph nodes affected by the neoplastic process. Our group evaluated the fractal dimension (FD) and X-ray attenuation (XRA) of lymph nodes in HL and compared to their metabolic activity as measured by 18F-FDG-PET examination. Methods The training set included 72 lymph nodes from 31 consecutive patients, and the tested set of 71 lymph nodes from next 19 patients. The measurement of FD of each lymph node was performed before the start of therapy using original software. X-ray attenuation (XRA) expressed in HU (Hounsfield Units) from CT scans was compared with the metabolic activity of the lymphatic nodes, measured by 18F-FDG-PET examination. Results Significant differences were observed between XRAmax and FDmax values in assessing the PET(+) and PET(-) nodes. All nodes were scored from 0 to 2. The HUFRA test properly qualified 95% with a score of 2 and 0 points as PET(+) or PET(-). Conclusion The HUFRA test can differentiate about 70–80% of lymph nodes as PET(+) or PET(-) based solely on the CT examination. It can be useful in patients who were not subjected to 18FFDG-PET/CT examination before the treatment, or who had an unreliable result of 18F-FDG-PET/CT with further research requirements."
https://openalex.org/W3012531352,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are worldwide chemical pollutants that have been linked to disrupted reproduction and altered sexual behaviour in many organisms. However, the effect of developmental PCB-exposure on adult passerine reproductive behaviour remains unknown. A commercial PCB mixture (Aroclor 1242) or an estrogenic congener (PCB 52) were administered in sublethal amounts to nestling zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in the laboratory to identify effects of developmental PCB-exposure on adult zebra finch reproductive parameters. Results indicate that although traditional measures of reproductive success are not altered by this PCB dosage, PCBs do alter sexual behaviours such as male song and nesting behaviour. Males treated with PCB 52 in the nest sang significantly fewer syllables than control males, while females treated with Aroclor 1242 in the nest showed the strongest song preferences. PCB treatment also caused an increase in the number of nesting attempts and abandoned nests in the Aroclor 1242 treatment relative to the PCB 52 treatment, and offspring with control fathers fledged significantly earlier than those with fathers treated with Aroclor 1242. Behavioural differences between males seem to best explain these reproductive effects, most notably aggression. These findings suggest that sublethal PCB-exposure during development can significantly alter key reproductive characteristics of adult zebra finches, likely reducing fitness in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W3010780744,"Serotonin (5-HT) is a neuromodulator secreted from serotonergic neurons located in the pons and upper brain stem in a behavioral context-dependent manner. The serotonergic axon terminals innervate almost the whole brain, causing modulatory actions on various brain functions including vision. Our previous study demonstrated the visual responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized monkeys were modulated by the activation of 5-HT receptors depending on the response magnitude, in which 5-HT2A receptor-selective agonists enhanced weak visual responses but not strong responses. This observation suggests that the activation of serotonergic receptors modulates neuronal visual information processing to improve the behavioral detectability of a stimulus. However, it remains unknown if 5-HT improves visual detectability at the behavioral level. To investigate this point, visual detectability was measured as contrast sensitivity (CS) in freely moving rats using a two-alternative forced-choice visual detection task (2AFC-VDT) combined with the staircase method. The grating contrast was decreased or increased step by step after a correct choice (hit) or incorrect choice (miss), respectively. CS was evaluated as an inverse value of the visual contrast threshold. The effect of the intraperitoneal administration of fluoxetine (FLX, 5 mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on CS was tested. The CS of rats was significantly higher in FLX than control conditions, and the drug effect showed specificity for the spatial frequency (SF) of a grating stimulus, in which CS improvement was observed at optimal SF but not non-optimal high SF. Thus, we conclude that endogenously-secreted serotonin in the brain improves visual detectability, which may be mediated by vision-related neurons acquiring SF information of the visual stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W3010797569,"Background Unreliable laboratory results lead to unnecessary tests, procedures or treatments which may harm the patient. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is a useful objective tool to improve processes and services. The use of quality indicators that meet requirements for effectiveness is an important quality improvement tool. However, the quality of critical aspects of pre-examination, examination, and post-examination processes have not been evaluated in Ethiopia including our setting. Hence, this study aimed to assess the performance of continuous quality improvement of TB and HIV laboratory tests in the Amhara Public Health Institute (APHI). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the quality indicators of advanced TB and HIV related laboratory tests in APHI from 01 January to 30 September 2019. HIV viral load, exposed infant diagnosis (EID), GeneXpert and TB culture quality indicators data were used as a quality improvement tool and evaluated in comparison to established targets. Data were extracted from excel database and record review of patient information, and entered and analyzed using SPSS V20 software. Results A total of 26,487 samples were received from 01 January to 30 September 2019. The overall specimen rejection rate was 0.43% (115/26,487). Specifically, viral load and TB culture had 0.43% and 1.14% rejection rates, respectively. The highest monthly rejection was documented for TB culture (5.3%) and viral load (2.4%) in September 2019. Centrifugation problems (46.1% [53/115]) and the use of the wrong container (40.9% [47/115]) were the main reasons for the rejections. Moreover, EID test was interrupted for a total of 54 days and 22 days due to reagent stock out and equipment down time, respectively. Similarly, about 82% of viral load and 100% of the EID tests had long turnaround time (TAT) with an average of 24.1 and 29.3 days respectively in September 2019. Conclusions There were high rates of TB culture and viral load specimen rejection, and EID test interruptions. The TAT of viral load and EID tests were longer than the targeted goal (10 days) average TAT. Hence, training of sample collectors, functional equipment maintenance systems and supply chain management are recommended for continuous quality improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3011543063,"Background Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI) is a persistent healthcare issue. In the US, CDI is the most common infectious cause of hospital-onset (HO) diarrhea. Objective Assess the impact of admission testing for toxigenic C. difficile colonization on the incidence of HO-CDI. Design Pragmatic stepped-wedge Infection Control initiative. Setting NorthShore University HealthSystem is a four-hospital system near Chicago, IL. Patients All patients admitted to the four hospitals during the initiative. Interventions From September 2017 through August 2018 we conducted a quality improvement program where admitted patients had a peri-rectal swab tested for toxigenic C. difficile. All colonized patients were placed into contact precautions. Measurements We tested admissions who: i) had been hospitalized within two months, ii) had a past C. difficile positive test, and/or iii) were in a long-term care facility within six months. We measured compliance with all other practices to reduce the incidence of HO-CDI. Results 30% of admissions were tested and 8.3% were positive. In the year prior to the initiative (Period 1) there were 63,057 admitted patients when HO-CDI incidence was 5.96 cases/10,000 patient days. During the 12-month initiative (Period 2) there were 62,760 admissions and the HO-CDI incidence was 4.23 cases/10,000 patient days (p = 0.02). There were no other practice or antibiotic use changes. Continuing admission surveillance provided a HO-CDI incidence of 2.9 cases/10,000 patient days during the final 9 months of 2018 (p<0.0001 compared to Period 1), equaling <1 case/1,000 admissions. Limitations This was not a randomized controlled trial, and multiple prevention practices were in place at the time of the admission surveillance initiative. Conclusion Admission C. difficile surveillance testing is an important tool for preventing hospital-onset C. difficile infection. Registration This quality improvement initiative is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. The unique registration identifier number is NCT04014608."
https://openalex.org/W3011584200,"The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), holds an impressive record of successful invasions promoted by the growth and development of international fruit trade. Hence, survival of immatures within infested fruit that are subjected to various conditions during transportation seems to be a crucial feature that promotes invasion success. Wolbachia pipientis is a common endosymbiont of insects and other arthropods generating several biological effects on its hosts. Existing information report the influence of Wolbachia on the fitness traits of insect host species, including the Mediterranean fruit fly. However, little is known regarding effects of Wolbachia infection on immature development in different host fruits and temperatures. This study was conducted to determine the development and survival of immature stages of four different Mediterranean fruit fly populations, either infected or uninfected with Wolbachia, in two hosts (apples, bitter oranges) under three constant temperatures (15, 25 and 30°C), constant relative humidity (45-55 ± 5%), and a photoperiod of 14L:10D. Our findings demonstrate both differential response of two fruit fly lines to Wolbachia infection and differential effects of the two Wolbachia strains on the same Mediterranean fruit fly line. Larva-to-pupa and larva-to-adult survival followed similar patterns and varied a lot among the four medfly populations, the two host fruits and the different temperatures. Pupation rates and larval developmental time were higher for larvae implanted in apples compared to bitter oranges. The survival rates of wildish medflies were higher than those of the laboratory adapted ones, particularly in bitter oranges. The Wolbachia infected medflies, expressed lower survival rates and higher developmental times, especially the wCer4 infected line. High temperatures constrained immature development and were lethal for the Wolbachia infected wCer4 medfly line. Lower temperatures inferred longer developmental times to immature stages of all medfly populations tested, in both host fruits. Implications on the ecology and survival of the fly in nature are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3011961153,"Creatine Kinase (CK) reaction plays an important role in energy metabolism and estimate of its reaction rate constant in heart provides important insight into cardiac energetics. Fast saturation transfer method ([Formula: see text] nominal) to measure CK reaction rate constant (kf) was previously demonstrated in open chest swine hearts. The goal of this work is to further develop this method for measuring the kf in human myocardium at 7T. [Formula: see text] approach is combined with 1D-ISIS/2D-CSI for in vivo spatial localization and myocardial CK forward rate constant was then measured in 7 volunteers at 7T.[Formula: see text] method uses two partially relaxed saturation transfer (ST) spectra and correction factor to determine CK rate constant. Correction factor is determined by numerical simulation of Bloch McConnell equations using known spin and experimental parameters. Optimal parameters and error estimate in calculation of CK reaction rate constant were determined by simulations. The technique was validated in calf muscles by direct comparison with saturation transfer measurements. [Formula: see text] pulse sequence was incorporated with 1D-image selected in vivo spectroscopy, combined with 2D-chemical shift spectroscopic imaging (1D-ISIS/2D-CSI) for studies in heart. The myocardial CK reaction rate constant was then measured in 7 volunteers.Skeletal muscle kf determined by conventional approach and [Formula: see text] approach were the same 0.31 ± 0.02 s-1 and 0.30 ± 0.04 s-1 demonstrating the validity of the technique. Results are reported as mean ± SD. Myocardial CK reaction rate constant was 0.29 ± 0.05 s-1, consistent with previously reported studies.[Formula: see text] method enables acquisition of 31P saturation transfer MRS under partially relaxed conditions and enables 2D-CSI of kf in myocardium. This work enables applications for in vivo CSI imaging of energetics in heart and other organs in clinically relevant acquisition time."
https://openalex.org/W3012009463,"Harmonia axyridis is a major bio-control agent of pests in agriculture and forest ecosystems. It is also a globally important invasive insect species. To test whether dark elytra colour is associated with greater cold hardiness, we compared the survival rate of prolonged cold exposure in both yellow and black colour morphs of female and male H. axyridis. We determined the trehalose and glycogen content, trehalase activity, and the dynamics of genes associated with the trehalose metabolic pathway. Yellow forms predominated before winter began, however black forms increased from 11.15 to 30.46% after overwintering. There was no significant difference in trehalose content between the females and males during overwintering. Glycogen content in over-wintering yellow females and black males increased significantly, while it decreased in black females. Soluble trehalase activity increased significantly in all the insects except black females. Membrane-bound trehalase activity increased in black males, and decreased in black females. Trehalose and glycogen content and trehalase activity were regulated by differential expression of TRE and TPS genes. Female beetles weighed more than males and survived in low temperatures for longer periods of time, regardless of elytra colour, suggesting that mass is a stronger predictor of overwintering survival rather than colour morph. Our results provide a guide for comparing cold resistance in insects and a theoretical basis for cold storage of H. axyridis for use as natural enemies of pests in biological control programs."
https://openalex.org/W3012073837,"Background The aim of this study was to validate the English version of the Itch Cognition Questionnaire in a sample of patients with chronic itch due to psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. An English-language version of an instrument assessing itch-related cognitions is needed since cognitions can contribute to a worsening of itch, and chronic itch is prevalent in English-speaking counties and internationally. Methods The German Itch Cognitions Questionnaire was translated into English, and cognitive interviewing was conducted to finalize item wording. Internal and test-retest reliability, item discrimination, responsiveness to change, and construct, convergent, and discriminant validity were assessed in a national sample of 137 individuals with chronic itch due to atopic dermatitis or psoriasis recruited online. Results Internal reliability was high with Cronbach’s alphas of 0.93 for the Catastrophizing subscale and 0.88–0.90 for Coping. The Pearson’s correlation assessing 1-month test-retest reliability for the Catastrophizing subscale was r = 0.62 and for the Coping subscale was r = 0.61. The corrected item-total correlation revealed that items were relatively consistent with the scores for the subscales (with correlations ranging from 0.58 to 0.79), indicating very good item discrimination. Results of factor analysis, convergent and discriminant, and responsiveness to change analyses provided evidence for validity. Conclusions This study showed good psychometric characteristics of the English version of the Itch Cognitions Questionnaire. We suggest that future studies investigate the use of the measure in clinical practice to assist with treatment planning and outcome assessment related to itch as well as address study limitations such as sampling and replication."
https://openalex.org/W3010996717,"In healthy children, an isotonic solution containing no glucose or a small amount of glucose (1-2%) has been recommended as an intraoperative maintenance fluid due to the potential risk of hyponatremia associated with hypotonic solutions. However, a hypotonic solution with glucose is still widely used as a maintenance fluid for pediatric anesthesia. We speculated that the hypotonic solution may worsen postoperative discomfort and irritability in pediatric patients due to hyponatremia.In the current study, we compared the post-operative Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability(FLACC) scale scores of pediatric patients aged 3-10 years who received either a 1:2 dextrose solution or Hartmann's solution during Nuss Bar removal.The FLACC scale score in the post-anesthesia care unit was higher in the 1:2 dextrose solution group(HYPO) (n = 20) than in the Hartmann's solution group(ISO) (n = 20) (6.30 vs 4.70, p = 0.044, mean difference and 95% Confidence Interval(CI) was 1.6 (0.04 to 3.16)). We also compared opioid consumption at the post-anesthesia care unit. Total dose of fentanyl per body weight in the post-anesthesia care unit was also higher in the HYPO (0.59 vs 0.37 mcg/kg, p = 0.042, mean difference and 95% CI was 0.22 mcg/kg (0.030 to 0.402)).Intraoperative use of the hypotonic solution in children causes increased FLACC scale scores, leading to higher opioid consumption in post-anesthesia care unit."
https://openalex.org/W3012530065,"High energy laser, particularly 532 nm, is widely used in defense and medical applications and there is need to address its occupational safety. Thermal and non-thermal effects of 532 nm high energy laser on skin are cause of concern. This study indicates impact of 532 nm laser on rat skin and first of its kind of attempt to understand transcriptional activation of genes as an early response following laser exposure. Skin of experimental rats were exposed to 532 nm radiance at 0.1, 0.25 and 0.50 W/cm2 for 10 sec. Thermographic changes of skin exposed to 532 nm laser exhibited increased Tmax temperature in radiance dependent manner. After thermal imaging, skin of experimental rats was collected 1 h post laser exposure for studying differential gene expression. The skin exposed to lower power density (0.1 W/cm2) did not show significant changes in expression of gene pathways studied. At moderate radiance (0.25 W/cm2), predominantly canonical wnt/B-catenin pathway genes notch1, axin2, ccdn1, wnt5a and redox homeostasis genes; txn1, nqo1 and txnrd1 were expressed. At higher radiance (0.5 W/cm2), significant repression of genes related to wound healing process particularly notch/wnt pathway viz. hes5, wnt1, wn3b with higher expression of dab2 was recorded. The data obtained from these studies would help in drawing safety limits for skin exposure to 532 nm laser. Further, genes expressed at moderate and high level of radiance exposure to skin were distinct and differential and provide new avenue to configure pathway to counteract laser induced delay in tissue injury and hair follicular damage."
https://openalex.org/W3011170659,"Substandard drugs are a major public health issue worldwide. Key person such as the Qualified Person in China and Europe is responsible for rejecting substandard drugs during the manufacturing stage. This study applies the Hunt-Vitell ethical decision-making model to study their rejection intentions on substandard drugs. Using the experimental vignette methodology, two scenarios were developed to represent different levels of deviation from regulations in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Responses from 204 Chinese key persons show a decline in deontology, ethical judgment, and rejection intention, and an increase in teleology in the minor deviation scenario, in comparison with the major deviation scenario. The results from the two scenarios show that the Hunt-Vitell ethical decision-making model is well fitted to explain substandard drug rejection intentions. Organizational and occupational commitments have a significant positive impact on deontological evaluation. Whereas, occupational commitments have a significant negative impact on teleological evaluation. This study suggests that strengthening occupational commitment can significantly affect key person’s rejection intentions of substandard drugs."
