https://openalex.org/W2955261360,"Immune cells residing in white adipose tissue have been highlighted as important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, but the molecular regulators that drive adipose tissue immune cell remodeling during obesity remain largely unknown. Using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all adipose tissue immune populations in both mice and humans during obesity. We describe a novel and conserved Trem2+ lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subset and identify markers, spatial localization, origin, and functional pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice globally inhibits the downstream molecular LAM program, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy as well as systemic hypercholesterolemia, body fat accumulation, and glucose intolerance. These findings identify Trem2 signaling as a major pathway by which macrophages respond to loss of tissue-level lipid homeostasis, highlighting Trem2 as a key sensor of metabolic pathologies across multiple tissues and a potential therapeutic target in metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2955964880,"Approximately 30% of human lung cancers acquire mutations in either Keap1 or Nfe2l2, resulting in the stabilization of Nrf2, the Nfe2l2 gene product, which controls oxidative homeostasis. Here, we show that heme triggers the degradation of Bach1, a pro-metastatic transcription factor, by promoting its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Fbxo22. Nrf2 accumulation in lung cancers causes the stabilization of Bach1 by inducing Ho1, the enzyme catabolizing heme. In mouse models of lung cancers, loss of Keap1 or Fbxo22 induces metastasis in a Bach1-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of Ho1 suppresses metastasis in a Fbxo22-dependent manner. Human metastatic lung cancer display high levels of Ho1 and Bach1. Bach1 transcriptional signature is associated with poor survival and metastasis in lung cancer patients. We propose that Nrf2 activates a metastatic program by inhibiting the heme- and Fbxo22-mediated degradation of Bach1, and that Ho1 inhibitors represent an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent lung cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2953979824,"For tumors to progress efficiently, cancer cells must overcome barriers of oxidative stress. Although dietary antioxidant supplementation or activation of endogenous antioxidants by NRF2 reduces oxidative stress and promotes early lung tumor progression, little is known about its effect on lung cancer metastasis. Here, we show that long-term supplementation with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and vitamin E promotes KRAS-driven lung cancer metastasis. The antioxidants stimulate metastasis by reducing levels of free heme and stabilizing the transcription factor BACH1. BACH1 activates transcription of Hexokinase 2 and Gapdh and increases glucose uptake, glycolysis rates, and lactate secretion, thereby stimulating glycolysis-dependent metastasis of mouse and human lung cancer cells. Targeting BACH1 normalized glycolysis and prevented antioxidant-induced metastasis, while increasing endogenous BACH1 expression stimulated glycolysis and promoted metastasis, also in the absence of antioxidants. We conclude that BACH1 stimulates glycolysis-dependent lung cancer metastasis and that BACH1 is activated under conditions of reduced oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2953460056,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification on mRNA and is implicated in critical roles in development, physiology, and disease. A major limitation has been the inability to quantify m6A stoichiometry and the lack of antibody-independent methodologies for interrogating m6A. Here, we develop MAZTER-seq for systematic quantitative profiling of m6A at single-nucleotide resolution at 16%-25% of expressed sites, building on differential cleavage by an RNase. MAZTER-seq permits validation and de novo discovery of m6A sites, calibration of the performance of antibody-based approaches, and quantitative tracking of m6A dynamics in yeast gametogenesis and mammalian differentiation. We discover that m6A stoichiometry is hard coded in cis via a simple and predictable code, accounting for 33%-46% of the variability in methylation levels and allowing accurate prediction of m6A loss and acquisition events across evolution. MAZTER-seq allows quantitative investigation of m6A regulation in subcellular fractions, diverse cell types, and disease states."
https://openalex.org/W2955564464,"Neurons in cortical circuits are often coactivated as ensembles, yet it is unclear whether ensembles play a functional role in behavior. Some ensemble neurons have pattern completion properties, triggering the entire ensemble when activated. Using two-photon holographic optogenetics in mouse primary visual cortex, we tested whether recalling ensembles by activating pattern completion neurons alters behavioral performance in a visual task. Disruption of behaviorally relevant ensembles by activation of non-selective neurons decreased performance, whereas activation of only two pattern completion neurons from behaviorally relevant ensembles improved performance, by reliably recalling the whole ensemble. Also, inappropriate behavioral choices were evoked by the mistaken activation of behaviorally relevant ensembles. Finally, in absence of visual stimuli, optogenetic activation of two pattern completion neurons could trigger behaviorally relevant ensembles and correct behavioral responses. Our results demonstrate a causal role of neuronal ensembles in a visually guided behavior and suggest that ensembles implement internal representations of perceptual states."
https://openalex.org/W2954958768,"Genetic studies promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer clusters or super-enhancers. So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in three-dimensional (3D) space. Furthermore, their target genes are often unknown. We have created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers to their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It also revealed >1,300 groups of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. We demonstrate that genetic variation in hubs impacts insulin secretion heritability, and show that hub annotations can be used for polygenic scores that predict T2D risk driven by islet regulatory variants. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture, therefore, provides a framework for interpretation of T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals."
https://openalex.org/W2954785163,"Increasing evidence suggests that transcriptional control and chromatin activities at large involve regulatory RNAs, which likely enlist specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Although multiple RBPs have been implicated in transcription control, it has remained unclear how extensively RBPs directly act on chromatin. We embarked on a large-scale RBP ChIP-seq analysis, revealing widespread RBP presence in active chromatin regions in the human genome. Like transcription factors (TFs), RBPs also show strong preference for hotspots in the genome, particularly gene promoters, where their association is frequently linked to transcriptional output. Unsupervised clustering reveals extensive co-association between TFs and RBPs, as exemplified by YY1, a known RNA-dependent TF, and RBM25, an RBP involved in splicing regulation. Remarkably, RBM25 depletion attenuates all YY1-dependent activities, including chromatin binding, DNA looping, and transcription. We propose that various RBPs may enhance network interaction through harnessing regulatory RNAs to control transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2956088786,"Most of the millions of SNPs in the human genome are non-coding, and many overlap with putative regulatory elements. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked many of these SNPs to human traits or to gene expression levels, but rarely with sufficient resolution to identify the causal SNPs. Functional screens based on reporter assays have previously been of insufficient throughput to test the vast space of SNPs for possible effects on regulatory element activity. Here we leveraged the throughput and resolution of the survey of regulatory elements (SuRE) reporter technology to survey the effect of 5.9 million SNPs, including 57% of the known common SNPs, on enhancer and promoter activity. We identified more than 30,000 SNPs that alter the activity of putative regulatory elements, partially in a cell-type-specific manner. Integration of this dataset with GWAS results may help to pinpoint SNPs that underlie human traits."
https://openalex.org/W2954842895,"Summary Neutrophils are a component of the tumor microenvironment and have been predominantly associated with cancer progression. Using a genetic approach complemented by adoptive transfer, we found that neutrophils are essential for resistance against primary 3-methylcholantrene-induced carcinogenesis. Neutrophils were essential for the activation of an interferon-γ-dependent pathway of immune resistance, associated with polarization of a subset of CD4− CD8− unconventional αβ T cells (UTCαβ). Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses unveiled the innate-like features and diversity of UTCαβ associated with neutrophil-dependent anti-sarcoma immunity. In selected human tumors, including undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, CSF3R expression, a neutrophil signature and neutrophil infiltration were associated with a type 1 immune response and better clinical outcome. Thus, neutrophils driving UTCαβ polarization and type 1 immunity are essential for resistance against murine sarcomas and selected human tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2953945894,"Most candidate drugs currently fail later-stage clinical trials, largely due to poor prediction of efficacy on early target selection1. Drug targets with genetic support are more likely to be therapeutically valid2,3, but the translational use of genome-scale data such as from genome-wide association studies for drug target discovery in complex diseases remains challenging4-6. Here, we show that integration of functional genomic and immune-related annotations, together with knowledge of network connectivity, maximizes the informativeness of genetics for target validation, defining the target prioritization landscape for 30 immune traits at the gene and pathway level. We demonstrate how our genetics-led drug target prioritization approach (the priority index) successfully identifies current therapeutics, predicts activity in high-throughput cellular screens (including L1000, CRISPR, mutagenesis and patient-derived cell assays), enables prioritization of under-explored targets and allows for determination of target-level trait relationships. The priority index is an open-access, scalable system accelerating early-stage drug target selection for immune-mediated disease."
https://openalex.org/W2955441129,"Uveal melanoma is a clinically distinct and particularly lethal subtype of melanoma originating from melanocytes in the eye. Here, we performed multi-region DNA sequencing of primary uveal melanomas and their matched metastases from 35 patients. We observed previously unknown driver mutations and established the order in which these and known driver mutations undergo selection. Metastases had genomic alterations distinct from their primary tumors; metastatic dissemination sometimes occurred early during the development of the primary tumor. Our study offers new insights into the genetics and evolution of this melanoma subtype, providing potential biomarkers for progression and therapy. Multi-region sequencing of 35 primary uveal melanomas and their matched metastases yields new insights into the genetics and evolution of these tumors and provides potential biomarkers for progression and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2954090318,"A real-time understanding of the distribution and duration of power outages after a major disaster is a precursor to minimizing their harmful consequences. Here, we develop an approach for using daily satellite nighttime lights data to create spatially disaggregated power outage estimates, tracking electricity restoration efforts after disasters strike. In contrast to existing utility data, these estimates are independent, open, and publicly-available, consistently measured across regions that may be serviced by several different power companies, and inclusive of distributed power supply (off-grid systems). We apply the methodology in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, which caused the longest blackout in US history. Within all of the island's settlements, we track outages and recovery times, and link these measures to census-based demographic characteristics of residents. Our results show an 80% decrease in lights, in total, immediately after Hurricane Maria. During the recovery, a disproportionate share of long-duration power failures (> 120 days) occurred in rural municipalities (41% of rural municipalities vs. 29% of urban municipalities), and in the northern and eastern districts. Unexpectedly, we also identify large disparities in electricity recovery between neighborhoods within the same urban area, based primarily on the density of housing. For many urban areas, poor residents, the most vulnerable to increased mortality and morbidity risks from power losses, shouldered the longest outages because they lived in less dense, detached housing where electricity restoration lagged. The approach developed in this study demonstrates the potential of satellite-based estimates of power recovery to improve the real-time monitoring of disaster impacts, globally, at a spatial resolution that is actionable for the disaster response community."
https://openalex.org/W2954669281,"Adaptive decision making in dynamic environments requires multiple reinforcement-learning steps that may be implemented by dissociable neural circuits. Here, we used a novel directionally specific viral ablation approach to investigate the function of several anatomically defined orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) circuits during adaptive, flexible decision making in rats trained on a probabilistic reversal learning task. Ablation of OFC neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens selectively disrupted performance following a reversal, by disrupting the use of negative outcomes to guide subsequent choices. Ablation of amygdala neurons projecting to the OFC also impaired reversal performance, but due to disruptions in the use of positive outcomes to guide subsequent choices. Ablation of OFC neurons projecting to the amygdala, by contrast, enhanced reversal performance by destabilizing action values. Our data are inconsistent with a unitary function of the OFC in decision making. Rather, distinct OFC-amygdala-striatal circuits mediate distinct components of the action-value updating and maintenance necessary for decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2954481407,"Neuronal subtypes show diverse injury responses, but the molecular underpinnings remain elusive. Using transgenic mice that allow reliable visualization of axonal fate, we demonstrate that intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are both resilient to cell death and highly regenerative. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we show genes that are differentially expressed in ipRGCs and that associate with their survival and axon regeneration. Strikingly, thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1) ranked as the most differentially expressed gene, along with the well-documented injury-response genes Atf3 and Jun. THBS1 knockdown in RGCs eliminated axon regeneration. Conversely, RGC overexpression of THBS1 enhanced regeneration in both ipRGCs and non-ipRGCs, an effect that was dependent on syndecan-1, a known THBS1-binding protein. All structural domains of the THBS1 were not equally effective; the trimerization and C-terminal domains promoted regeneration, while the THBS type-1 repeats were dispensable. Our results identify cell-type-specific induction of Thbs1 as a novel gene conferring high regenerative capacity."
https://openalex.org/W2955125694,"Developmental silencing of fetal globins serves as both a paradigm of spatiotemporal gene regulation and an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of β-hemoglobinopathy. The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) chromatin complex participates in γ-globin repression. We used pooled CRISPR screening to disrupt NuRD protein coding sequences comprehensively in human adult erythroid precursors. Essential for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) control is a non-redundant subcomplex of NuRD protein family paralogs, whose composition we corroborated by affinity chromatography and proximity labeling mass spectrometry proteomics. Mapping top functional guide RNAs identified key protein interfaces where in-frame alleles resulted in loss-of-function due to destabilization or altered function of subunits. We ascertained mutations of CHD4 that dissociate its requirement for cell fitness from HbF repression in both primary human erythroid precursors and transgenic mice. Finally we demonstrated that sequestering CHD4 from NuRD phenocopied these mutations. These results indicate a generalizable approach to discover protein complex features amenable to rational biochemical targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2954262723,"Homeostatic control of core body temperature is essential for survival. Temperature is sensed by specific neurons, in turn eliciting both behavioral (i.e., locomotion) and physiologic (i.e., thermogenesis, vasodilatation) responses. Here, we report that a population of GABAergic (Vgat-expressing) neurons in the dorsolateral portion of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), hereafter DRNVgat neurons, are activated by ambient heat and bidirectionally regulate energy expenditure through changes in both thermogenesis and locomotion. We find that DRNVgat neurons innervate brown fat via a descending projection to the raphe pallidus (RPa). These neurons also densely innervate ascending targets implicated in the central regulation of energy expenditure, including the hypothalamus and extended amygdala. Optogenetic stimulation of different projection targets reveals that DRNVgat neurons are capable of regulating thermogenesis through both a direct descending pathway through the RPa and multiple indirect ascending pathways. This work establishes a key regulatory role for DRNVgat neurons in controlling energy expenditure."
https://openalex.org/W2954966589,"Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive cancers characterized by a high plasticity, a propensity for metastasis, and drug resistance. Melanomas are composed of phenotypically diverse subpopulations of tumor cells with heterogeneous molecular profiles that reflect intrinsic invasive abilities. In an attempt to identify novel factors of the melanoma invasive cell state, we previously investigated the nature of the invasive secretome by using a comparative proteomic approach. Here, we have extended this analysis to show that PTX3, an acute phase inflammatory glycoprotein, is one such factor secreted by invasive melanoma to promote tumor cell invasiveness. Elevated PTX3 production was observed in the population of MITFlow invasive cells but not in the population of MITFhigh differentiated melanoma cells. Consistently, MITF knockdown increased PTX3 expression in MITFhigh proliferative and poorly invasive cells. High levels of PTX3 were found in tissues and blood of metastatic melanoma patients, and in BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma cells displaying a mesenchymal invasive MITFlow phenotype. Genetic silencing of PTX3 in invasive melanoma cells dramatically impaired migration and invasion in vitro and in experimental lung extravasation assay in xenografted mice. In contrast, addition of melanoma-derived or recombinant PTX3, or expression of PTX3 enhanced motility of low migratory cells. Mechanistically, autocrine production of PTX3 by melanoma cells triggered an IKK/NFκB signaling pathway that promotes migration, invasion, and expression of the EMT factor TWIST1. Finally, we found that TLR4 and MYD88 knockdown inhibited PTX3-induced melanoma cell migration, suggesting that PTX3 functions through a TLR4-dependent pathway. Our work reveals that tumor-derived PTX3 contributes to melanoma cell invasion via targetable inflammation-related pathways. In addition to providing new insights into the biology of melanoma invasive behavior, this study underscores the notion that secreted PTX3 represents a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in a subpopulation of MITFlow invasive and/or refractory melanoma."

Growing DNA damage accompanied this malignant transformation. BRCA1 mutations carry a 40%–80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer (BC). Inadequate maintenance of mammary epithelial cell (MEC) genome integrity is a suspected driver of this outcome (Chen et al., 2018Chen C.C. Feng W. Lim P.X. Kass E.M. Jasin M.

Mechanisms of BRCA1 tumor suppression.Cancer Discov. 2012; 2: 679-684Google Scholar). While p220, the primary disease-suppressing BRCA1 product, exhibits multiple functions, like DNA damage repair, the detailed events that lead to BRCA1 BC are largely unknown. Mammary gland (MG) development is a unidirectional, hierarchical process wherein mammary stem cells (MaSCs) differentiate into progenitors that further differentiate into mature MECs (Visvader and Stingl, 2014Visvader J.E. Stingl J. Mammary stem cells and the differentiation hierarchy: current status and perspectives.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 1143-1158Google Scholar). Dedifferentiation of mature cells into a more primitive state rarely occurs in normal tissues. However, when it does, it can trigger a neoplastic process (Friedmann-Morvinski and Verma, 2014Friedmann-Morvinski D. Verma I.M.

Cells of origin in cancer.Nature. 2011; 469: 314-322Google Scholar). Although BRCA1 can prevent transdifferentiation of cultured, human MECs, whether this translates into BC suppression is unclear (Wang et al., 2016Wang H. Bierie B. Li A.G. Pathania S. Toomire K.

BRCA1 p220 is necessary for maintaining a normal MEC differentiation state, a function that likely contributes to its BC suppression activity (Liu et al., 2008Liu S. Ginestier C. Charafe-Jauffret E.

Defective p220 function promotes aberrant differentiation of otherwise normal, cultured, basal-like human MECs to a more primitive, mesenchymal state that arises, at least in part, from inadequate repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) (Wang et al., 2016Wang H.

Specifically, p220, and its bound partners, BRG1 and FANCD2, and ΔNp63, with which it also communicates, suppress ICL accumulation and MEC transdifferentiation. This study explores these events both in cultured MECs and during BRCA1 mouse mammary tumor development. The BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) region is vital for the p220 DNA repair function. It contains two adjacent BRCT repeat motifs that operate as DNA damage signal receptors (Gerloff et al., 2012Gerloff D.L. Woods N.T. Farago A.A. Monteiro A.N.

Currently, three BRCA1-associated proteins—CtIP, BACH1/BRIP1, and Abraxas—are known to bind to them. All contain pSXXF/pSPTF sequences, where the serine is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR following DNA damage, thereby sustaining their BRCT binding function (Kim et al., 2007Kim H. Huang J. Chen J.

Conceivably, these motifs participate in signaling events that sustain MEC differentiation following effective DNA repair. Lacking evidence that any known BRCT-binding protein participates in MEC differentiation control, we initiated a search for additional p220 BRCT binding proteins. Specifically, we screened database for heretofore undetected BRCA1-binding polypeptides that contain SPTF sequences (Manke et al., 2003Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B.

Interestingly, NUMB is required for MEC differentiation maintenance (Tosoni et al., 2015Tosoni D. Zecchini S. Coazzoli M. Colaluca I. Mazzarol G. Rubio A. Caccia M. Villa E. Zilian O. Di Fiore P.P. Pece S. The Numb/p53 circuitry couples replicative self-renewal and tumor suppression in mammary epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 211: 845-862Google Scholar). NUMB also contains an SPTF and an SPTXXF motif (Figure S1A). Immunoprecipitation (IP) of HA- or myc-tagged BRCA1 in 293T cells showed that it coimmunoprecipitated (coIP’d) with at least two endogenous human NUMB isoforms (long [L] and short [S]; Figures 1A and 1B ). Moreover, endogenous BRCA1 p220 and NUMB coIP’d (Figures 1C and 1D), an event that was stimulated by cell exposure to mitomycin C (MMC) (Figures 1E and 1F).

To test whether the BRCA1 BRCT motifs contribute to NUMB binding, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged BRCA1 fragments, collectively representing the entire BRCA1 sequence, were assayed as candidate NUMB binding targets (Chen et al., 1998Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Stable interaction between the products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes in mitotic and meiotic cells.Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Google Scholar). GST-BRCT fragment F6 (aa 1314–1863) exhibited the strongest NUMB binding. Less impressive NUMB binding was detected with GST-F5 (aa 1005–1313) (Figure 1G). A clinically relevant BRCA1 point mutation (M1775R) introduced into the BRCT domain of HA-tagged full-length BRCA1 abolished BRCA1/NUMB binding as it had done for Abraxas-, CtIP-, and BACH1-BRCA1 binding (Kim et al., 2007Kim H.

By contrast, HA-BRCA1 bearing a RING domain mutation (C61G) bound NUMB normally (Figure S1B). Therefore, one or both F6 BRCT motif(s) bind(s) NUMB. In response to DNA damage, the SPTF sequence(s) that bind the BRCA1 BRCT motifs are phosphorylated by a suitable PIKK kinase. Since this modification is essential for SPTF/BRCT interactions (Manke et al., 2003Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. BRCT repeats as phosphopeptide-binding modules involved in protein targeting.Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2003Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. The BRCT domain is a phospho-protein binding domain.Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Google Scholar), we asked if BRCA1-NUMB binding is NUMB phosphorylation dependent. Specifically, we IP’d HA-tagged NUMB, exposed the IP to an exogenous phosphatase, and NUMB binding to BRCA1 decreased significantly (Figure S1C). ATM inhibitor addition also disrupted BRCA1-NUMB binding (Figure 1E), and mutagenizing NUMB serines 361 and 634 to alanines led the resulting double mutant (NUMB 2A) to exhibit reduced BRCA1 binding (Figure 1H). Thus, endogenous NUMB appears to interact directly and in a phosphorylation-dependent manner with one or both BRCA1-BRCT motifs and is, therefore, an authentic BRCA1 partner. NUMB was first identified in Drosophila as a membrane protein that regulates asymmetric versus symmetric cell division and NOTCH signaling (Guo et al., 1996Guo M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Control of daughter cell fates during asymmetric division: interaction of Numb and Notch.Neuron. 1996; 17: 27-41Google Scholar, Uemura et al., 1989Uemura T. Shepherd S. Ackerman L. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. numb, a gene required in determination of cell fate during sensory organ formation in Drosophila embryos.Cell. 1989; 58: 349-360Google Scholar). At least four NUMB isoforms exist in mammalian cells; the longest controls cell proliferation, and the shortest affects differentiation (Dho et al., 1999Dho S.E. French M.B. Woods S.A. McGlade C.J. Characterization of four mammalian numb protein isoforms. Identification of cytoplasmic and membrane-associated variants of the phosphotyrosine binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33097-33104Google Scholar, Verdi et al., 1999Verdi J.M. Bashirullah A. Goldhawk D.E. Kubu C.J. Jamali M. Meakin S.O. Lipshitz H.D. Distinct human NUMB isoforms regulate differentiation vs. proliferation in the neuronal lineage.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 10472-10476Google Scholar). A mammary-specific Numb knockout led to an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), development of stem cell-like properties, and tumorigenesis (Tosoni et al., 2015Tosoni D. Zecchini S. Coazzoli M. Colaluca I. Mazzarol G. Rubio A. Caccia M. Villa E. Zilian O. Di Fiore P.P. Pece S. The Numb/p53 circuitry couples replicative self-renewal and tumor suppression in mammary epithelial cells.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 211: 845-862Google Scholar), much like the effects of BRCA1 depletion. Since endogenous NUMB binds BRCA1, we asked whether NUMB function is, at least in part, nuclear, and if so, whether it and BRCA1 co-participate in DNA damage control. Specifically, human MECs were fractionated into different subcellular fractions that were then assayed for NUMB (Xia et al., 2006Xia B. Sheng Q. Nakanishi K. Ohashi A. Wu J. Christ N. Liu X. Jasin M. Couch F.J. Livingston D.M. Control of BRCA2 cellular and clinical functions by a nuclear partner, PALB2.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 719-729Google Scholar) (Figure S1D). Both long and short NUMB isoforms were detected in the cytoplasmic (S100) and soluble nuclear (S400) fractions (Figures S1E–S1H). Furthermore, the relative abundance of NUMB in the latter was comparable to that in the former. These findings were consistently observed in multiple cell lines (Figures S1E–S1H), in keeping with others’ results (Dhami et al., 2013Dhami G.K. Liu H. Galka M. Voss C. Wei R. Muranko K. Kaneko T. Cregan S.P. Li L. Li S.S. Dynamic methylation of Numb by Set8 regulates its binding to p53 and apoptosis.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 565-576Google Scholar). Moreover, the long isoform was enriched in CD44low MECs, while the short form was overexpressed in mesenchymal (U2OS) cells (Figure S1E). When exposed to cisplatin, the cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of NUMB in U2OS and MCF7 cells did not change (Figures S1G and S1H). These data suggest that NUMB is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. While participating in certain types of DNA repair, BRCA1 concentrates in multiple, small, nuclear foci in S/G2 cells (Scully et al., 1997Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Dynamic changes of BRCA1 subnuclear location and phosphorylation state are initiated by DNA damage.Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Google Scholar) or single, larger BRCA1-containing foci in G1/G0 cells (Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013Escribano-Díaz C.

Lukas J. 53BP1 nuclear bodies form around DNA lesions generated by mitotic transmission of chromosomes under replication stress.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 243-253Google Scholar). In CD44low MECs, NUMB often colocalized with BRCA1 and 53BP1 in these single, large G0/G1 foci (Figures 2A–2D), which are also known as “53BP1 bodies.” They carry DNA damaged during a prior S/G2 period (Lukas et al., 2011Lukas C.

Lukas J. 53BP1 nuclear bodies form around DNA lesions generated by mitotic transmission of chromosomes under replication stress.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 243-253Google Scholar). BRCA1/NUMB colocalization was confirmed by confocal image analysis (Figure 2B and Video S1). By contrast, frequent colocalization of BRCA1 and NUMB in single, large foci was rare in S/G2 cells (Figures 2A–2F). Analogous results were obtained in MCF7 cells (Figures S2A and S2B).Figure S2NUMB Forms Distinct DNA Damage Foci, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A-B) Immunofluorescent (IF) staining of BRCA1 and NUMB (A) or 53BP1 and NUMB (B) in MCF7 cells.

BRCA1/NUMB Co-immunostaining Nuclear Focus Formation, Related to Figure 2Co-localization of BRCA1 and NUMB nuclear foci (arrows) in HME cells was observed using confocal z stack microscopy. 53BP1 sustains non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and suppresses homologous recombination (HR)-driven double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair in both G1 and S/G2 (Bunting et al., 2010Bunting S.F. Callén E. Wong N. Chen H.T. Polato F. Gunn A. Bothmer A. Feldhahn N. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Cao L. et al.53BP1 inhibits homologous recombination in Brca1-deficient cells by blocking resection of DNA breaks.Cell. 2010; 141: 243-254Google Scholar, Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013Escribano-Díaz C. Orthwein A. Fradet-Turcotte A. Xing M. Young J.T. Tkáč J. Cook M.A. Rosebrock A.P. Munro M.

Dellaire G. et al.A mechanism for the suppression of homologous recombination in G1 cells.Nature. 2015; 528: 422-426Google Scholar). To determine whether NUMB and/or BRCA1 loss results in an accumulation of G1 DNA damage, we searched for 53BP1 foci in cyclin A-negative cells. When NUMB or BRCA1 depleted, these G1 cells overly accumulated large 53BP1 foci (three or more foci per cell), suggesting the development of additional G1 DNA damage (Figures 2E–2F, S2C, and S2D). ATM/ATR signaling is essential for the formation of BRCA1 or 53BP1 foci after DNA damage. Therefore, we asked if reduced ATM/ATR signaling abolishes NUMB focus formation. Cell exposure to the ATM inhibitor, KU55933, suppressed single 53BP1 and NUMB focus formation (Figures 2G–2I). 53BP1 depletion also abolished BRCA1/NUMB focal colocalization (Figures 2J and 2K). BRCA1 depletion also abolished NUMB focus formation, implying its BRCA1/53BP1 co-dependence (Figures S2E and S2F). These observations fit with previous reports implying that BRCA1 loss promotes 53BP1-dependent NHEJ repair (Bunting et al., 2010Bunting S.F. Callén E. Wong N. Chen H.T. Polato F. Gunn A. Bothmer A. Feldhahn N. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Cao L. et al.53BP1 inhibits homologous recombination in Brca1-deficient cells by blocking resection of DNA breaks.Cell. 2010; 141: 243-254Google Scholar). In addition, following the prior development of DNA damage, significantly more cells arrested in G1/G0 after BRCA1 or NUMB depletion, consistent with G1 checkpoint activation (Figure S2D). Thus, BRCA1/NUMB complexes respond to spontaneously arising DNA damage, at least in part, during G1/G0. Failed ICL repair can promote aberrant basal-mesenchymal transdifferentiation of cultured, basal-like human MECs (Wang et al., 2016Wang H. Bierie B. Li A.G. Pathania S. Toomire K. Dimitrov S.D. Liu B. Gelman R. Giobbie-Hurder A. Feunteun J. et al.BRCA1/FANCD2/BRG1-Driven DNA Repair Stabilizes the Differentiation State of Human Mammary Epithelial Cells.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63: 277-292Google Scholar). In addition, at least three proteins—BRCA1 and its partners, FANCD2 and BRG1—participate in ICL repair-driven MEC differentiation control (Wang et al., 2016Wang H. Bierie B. Li A.G. Pathania S. Toomire K. Dimitrov S.D. Liu B. Gelman R. Giobbie-Hurder A. Feunteun J. et al.BRCA1/FANCD2/BRG1-Driven DNA Repair Stabilizes the Differentiation State of Human Mammary Epithelial Cells.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63: 277-292Google Scholar). Thus, we asked if NUMB is also required for ICL repair and found that depletion of NUMB in either CD44low or naive MCF10A MECs led to hypersensitivity to the ICL-inducing agents, cisplatin, and MMC (Figures 3A–3D), much as has been detected in CD44low MECs after BRCA1, BRG1, or FANCD2 depletion (Wang et al., 2016Wang H. Bierie B. Li A.G. Pathania S. Toomire K. Dimitrov S.D. Liu B. Gelman R. Giobbie-Hurder A. Feunteun J. et al.BRCA1/FANCD2/BRG1-Driven DNA Repair Stabilizes the Differentiation State of Human Mammary Epithelial Cells.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63: 277-292Google Scholar). To determine if ICL agent sensitivity was NUMB depletion dependent, we expressed small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant wild-type (WT) NUMB or NUMB-2A mutant cDNAs in MCF10A cells and found that WT NUMB, but not the mutant, rescued cisplatin sensitivity (Figures 3C and 3D). This implied that NUMB phosphorylation participates in sustaining ICL repair. Therefore, NUMB, which was not formerly known to engage in DNA repair, much less ICL repair, is necessary for ICL repair in these cells. We also asked whether BRCA1 and NUMB cooperate in ICL repair. When CD44low MECs were depleted of both NUMB and BRCA1, they became more sensitive to cisplatin or MMC than after depleting NUMB or BRCA1 alone. This suggests that BRCA1 and NUMB cooperate in ICL repair (Figures 3E–3G). In addition, NUMB depletion impaired nuclear focus formation by the key ICL repair protein, FANCD2 (Figures S3A and S3B). Moreover, NUMB depletion in MECs led to failed FANCD2 monoubiquitination following MMC exposure (Figures 3H, 3I, and S3C). Thus, NUMB, like BRCA1 (Garcia-Higuera et al., 2001Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D’Andrea A.D. Interaction of the Fanconi anemia proteins and BRCA1 in a common pathway.Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Google Scholar), promotes FANCD2 recruitment to ICL-damaged sites by supporting its monoubiquitination, a key event during ICL repair. Since inadequate ICL repair threatened the normal differentiation state of CD44low MECs, we asked if NUMB is required to maintain a normal human MEC differentiation state, much like its bound partner, BRCA1. We analyzed CD44low HME cells (epithelial) and their BRCA1-depleted, aberrantly transdifferentiated CD44high derivatives (Wang et al., 2016Wang H. Bierie B. Li A.G. Pathania S. Toomire K. Dimitrov S.D. Liu B. Gelman R. Giobbie-Hurder A. Feunteun J. et al.BRCA1/FANCD2/BRG1-Driven DNA Repair Stabilizes the Differentiation State of Human Mammary Epithelial Cells.Mol. Cell. 2016; 63: 277-292Google Scholar). The former expressed relatively high levels of E-Cadherin and ΔNp63 and a low level of ZEB1, while CD44high cells revealed the opposite phenotype, reflecting their respective epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes (Figure 3J). NUMB also underwent a dramatic isoform switch as CD44low cells experienced BRCA1 depletion-driven EMT (Figure 3J). CD44low HME cells expressed a relatively high level of the NUMB long and a low level of the short isoform, while BRCA1-depleted, aberrantly transdifferentiated CD44high cells"
https://openalex.org/W2953798516,"Prior studies demonstrated that the irreversible ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor neratinib caused plasma membrane-associated mutant K-RAS to localize in intracellular vesicles, concomitant with its degradation. Herein, we discovered that neratinib interacted with the chemically distinct irreversible ERBB1/2/4 inhibitor afatinib to reduce expression of ERBB1, ERBB2, K-RAS and N-RAS; this was associated with greater-than-additive cell killing of pancreatic tumor cells. Knock down of Beclin1, ATG16L1, Rubicon or cathepsin B significantly lowered the ability of neratinib to reduce ERBB1 and K-RAS expression, and to cause tumor cell death. Knock down of ATM-AMPK suppressed vesicle formation and knock down of cathepsin B-AIF significantly reduced neratinib lethality. PKG phosphorylates K-RAS and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduce K-RAS farnesylation both of which remove K-RAS from the plasma membrane, abolishing its activity. Neratinib interacted with the PKG activator sildenafil and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin to further reduce K-RAS expression, and to further enhance cell killing. Neratinib is also a Ste20 kinase family inhibitor and in carcinoma cells, and hematopoietic cancer cells lacking ERBB1/2/4, it reduced K-RAS expression and the phosphorylation of MST1/3/4/Ezrin by ~ 30%. Neratinib increased LATS1 phosphorylation as well as that of YAP and TAZ also by ~ 30%, caused the majority of YAP to translocate into the cytosol and reduced YAP/TAZ protein levels. Neratinib lethality was enhanced by knock down of YAP. Neratinib, in a Rubicon-dependent fashion, reduced PAK1 phosphorylation and that of its substrate Merlin. Our data demonstrate that neratinib coordinately suppresses both mutant K-RAS and YAP function to kill pancreatic tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2955280141,"A central goal in learning and memory research is to reveal the neural substrates underlying episodic memory formation. The hallmark of sequential spatial trajectory learning, a model of episodic memory, has remained equivocal, with proposals ranging from de novo creation of compressed sequential replay from blank slate networks to selection of pre-existing compressed preplay sequences. Here, we show that increased millisecond-timescale activation of cell assemblies expressed during de novo sequential experience and increased neuronal firing rate correlations can explain the difference between post-experience trajectory replay and robust preplay. This increased activation results from an improved neuronal tuning to specific cell assemblies, higher recruitment of experience-tuned neurons into pre-existing cell assemblies, and increased recruitment of cell assemblies in replay. In contrast, changes in overall neuronal and cell assembly temporal order within extended sequences do not account for sequential trajectory learning. We propose the coordinated strengthening of cell assemblies played sequentially on robust pre-existing temporal frameworks could support rapid formation of episodic-like memory."
https://openalex.org/W2955878514,"How cells in primary tumors initially become pro-metastatic is not understood. A previous genome-wide RNAi screen uncovered colon cancer metastatic suppressor and WNT promoting functions of TMED3, a member of the p24 ER-to-Golgi protein secretion family. Repression of canonical WNT signaling upon knockdown (kd) of TMED3 might thus be sufficient to drive metastases. However, searching for transcriptional influences on other family members here we find that TMED3 kd leads to enhanced TMED9, that TMED9 acts downstream of TMED3 and that TMED9 kd compromises metastasis. Importantly, TMED9 pro-metastatic function is linked to but distinct from the repression of TMED3-WNT-TCF signaling. Functional rescue of the migratory deficiency of TMED9 kd cells identifies TGFα as a mediator of TMED9 pro-metastatic activity. Moreover, TMED9 kd compromises the biogenesis, and thus function, of TGFα. Analyses in three colon cancer cell types highlight a TMED9-dependent gene set that includes CNIH4, a member of the CORNICHON family of TGFα exporters. Our data indicate that TGFA and CNIH4, which display predictive value for disease-free survival, promote colon cancer cell metastatic behavior, and suggest that TMED9 pro-metastatic function involves the modulation of the secretion of TGFα ligand. Finally, TMED9/TMED3 antagonism impacts WNT-TCF and GLI signaling, where TMED9 primacy over TMED3 leads to the establishment of a positive feedback loop together with CNIH4, TGFα, and GLI1 that enhances metastases. We propose that primary colon cancer cells can transition between two states characterized by secretion-transcription regulatory loops gated by TMED3 and TMED9 that modulate their metastatic proclivities."
https://openalex.org/W2955145151,"Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) is a stress response transcription factor with multiple tumour suppressor roles in breast tissue, whose expression is often lost in breast cancers. We have previously shown that the breast cancer oncogene TBX2 (T-BOX2) interacts with EGR1 to co-repress EGR1-target genes including the breast tumour suppressor NDRG1. Here, we show the mechanistic basis of this TBX2 repression complex. We show that siRNA knockdown of TBX2, EGR1, Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) isoforms and the generic HP1-associated corepressor protein KAP1 all resulted in growth inhibition of TBX2-expressing breast cancer cells. We show that TBX2 interacts with HP1 through a conserved HP1-binding motif in its N-terminus, which in turn leads to the recruitment of KAP1 and other associated proteins. Mutation of the TBX2 HP1 binding domain abrogates the TBX2-HP1 interaction and loss of repression of target genes such as NDRG1. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that TBX2 establishes a repressive chromatin mark, specifically H3K9me3, around the NDRG1 proximal promoter coincident with the recruitment of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B and histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex components (G9A, Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) and Suppressor of Zeste 12 (SUZ12)). Knockdown of G9A, EZH2 or SUZ12 resulted in upregulation of TBX2/EGR1 co-regulated targets accompanied by a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation. We show that a generic inhibitor of HMT activity, DzNep, phenocopies expression of an inducible dominant negative TBX2. Knockdown of TBX2, KAP1 or HP1 inhibited NDRG1 promoter decoration specifically with the H3K9me3 repression mark. Correspondingly, treatment with a G9A inhibitor effectively reversed TBX2 repression of NDRG1 and synergistically downregulated cell proliferation following TBX2 functional inhibition. These data demonstrate that TBX2 promotes suppression of normal growth control mechanisms through recruitment of a large repression complex to EGR1-responsive promoters leading to the uncontrolled proliferation of breast cancer cells."

Indeed, gain of function of Ryk intracellular domain signaling regulates SST and PV fate in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Ryk signaling acts in a graded fashion. These data reveal an important role for non-canonical Wnt-Ryk signaling in establishing the correct ratios of cortical interneuron subtypes. Interneurons provide inhibitory tone and play critical roles in brain function: regulating cortical rhythmicity, attention states, and signal timing (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The majority of interneurons are contained within one of two broad cardinal classes: parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SST)-expressing cell types, which are fundamentally distinct in terms of their connectivity and contribution to brain function (Fishell and Rudy, 2011Fishell G. Rudy B. Mechanisms of inhibition within the telencephalon: “where the wild things are”.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 535-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The former type is perisomal or axonal targeting, is fast spiking, and shows synaptic depression (Hu et al., 2014Hu H. Gan J. Jonas P. Interneurons.

The spatial and temporal origin of chandelier cells in mouse neocortex.Science. 2013; 339: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas the latter provides inhibition to dendrites, is regular spiking, and typically displays synaptic facilitation (Lovett-Barron et al., 2012Lovett-Barron M.

Despite these differences, PV+ and SST+ interneurons originate from the same embryonic structure, the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). Understanding how functionally distinct cell types arise from a common origin remains a fundamental challenge. We have previously proposed that this process is essentially accomplished in two phases, “cardinal specification” into major subclasses followed by “definitive specification” of mature functional properties as they integrate into cortical circuitry (Kepecs and Fishell, 2014Kepecs A. Fishell G. Interneuron cell types are fit to function.Nature. 2014; 505: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, Wamsley and Fishell, 2017Wamsley B. Fishell G. Genetic and activity-dependent mechanisms underlying interneuron diversity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). With respect to definitive specification, significant progress has been made in identifying extrinsic and intrinsic factors that act coordinately with neuronal activity to differentially fine-tune granular properties of interneurons (De Marco García et al., 2011De Marco García N.V.

Tuning of fast-spiking interneuron properties by an activity-dependent transcriptional switch.Science. 2015; 349: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intrinsic regulation of interneuron identity by transcriptional regulation has been extensively studied (Wonders and Anderson, 2006Wonders C.P. Anderson S.A. The origin and specification of cortical interneurons.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). However, a conclusive extrinsic mechanism underlying cardinal specification is presently lacking. Previous findings have implicated multiple secreted growth factors, notably sonic hedgehog (Shh), and key transcription factors for both the initial acquisition and later maintenance of cardinal identity (Anderson et al., 1997Anderson S.A.

Furthermore, there is evidence of spatial heterogeneity in the types of interneurons generated from different regions of the MGE (Flames et al., 2007Flames N. Pla R. Gelman D.M. Rubenstein J.L.

Coup-TF1 and Coup-TF2 control subtype and laminar identity of MGE-derived neocortical interneurons.Development. 2017; 144: 2837-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, during development, the proportion of subtypes produced shifts; SST+ cells are preferentially generated earlier, with the production of PV+ cells predominating at later developmental time points (Inan et al., 2012Inan M. Welagen J. Anderson S.A. Spatial and temporal bias in the mitotic origins of somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneuron subgroups and the chandelier subtype in the medial ganglionic eminence.Cereb.

Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Therefore, a model to explain the precise orchestration of PV+ versus SST+ cardinal specification must (1) account for the bias in spatial origins between the two subtypes, (2) cleanly delineate between PV+ and SST+, and (3) explain the proportional shift in subtype production over time. Here we describe regional variability in Wnt responsiveness along the caudal-rostral axis of the MGE that reflects Wnt sources emanating from caudally situated embryonic structures. Transplants of MGE subdomains along this axis reveal a strong bias in the spatial origin of PV+ and SST+ cells such that strongly Wnt-responsive cells become SST+ interneurons and lower levels of Wnt produce PV+ cells. We demonstrate that Ryk signaling, which has been described in a number of biological contexts (Roy et al., 2018Roy J.P. Halford M.M. Stacker S.A. The biochemistry, signalling and diseaserelevance of RYK and other WNT-binding receptor tyrosine kinases.Growth Factors. 2018; 36: 15-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is at least partially responsible for the delineation between PV+ and SST+ cell fate, independent of canonical Wnt signaling through β-catenin or Shh signaling. Genetic ablation of Ryk compromises the ability of nearly half of cells to acquire PV+ and SST+ interneuron identity; the remaining cells no longer exhibit a population bias for PV+ over SST+. We further show that Ryk signaling is dynamically regulated throughout development and parallels the differential production of SST+ and PV+ interneurons over time. Indeed, the proportion of SST+ and PV+ interneurons can be regulated in an in vitro model of interneuron development (Au et al., 2013Au E. Ahmed T. Karayannis T. Biswas S. Gan L. Fishell G. A modular gain-of-function approach to generate cortical interneuron subtypes from ES cells.Neuron. 2013; 80: 1145-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by directly modulating Ryk signaling. Therefore, Ryk signaling is a critical component of interneuron cardinal specification that controls the relative proportions of PV+ and SST+ subtypes produced and thus enables proper microcircuit assembly. Previous work has shown that the initial specification of interneuron subtype identity is determined at the progenitor phase, prior to the exit from the cell cycle (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J.

In a variety of developmental contexts, morphogen gradients have been shown to create variation and diversity within progenitor fields, a process most thoroughly studied with regard to Shh signaling in the spinal cord (Briscoe and Ericson, 2001Briscoe J.

Similarly, a number of studies have indicated that Shh signaling within the MGE also biases interneuron subtype identity (Flames et al., 2007Flames N. Pla R. Gelman D.M. Rubenstein J.L. Puelles L.

Wnt has been found to play an important role in the expansion of the subventricular zone within the MGE (Gulacsi and Anderson, 2008Gulacsi A.A. Anderson S.A. Beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling regulates neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the PV+ interneurons that preferentially arise from this proliferative area (Glickstein et al., 2007Glickstein S.B. Moore H. Slowinska B. Racchumi J. Suh M. Chuhma N. Ross M.E.

This led us to investigate whether Wnt might play additional roles in patterning the MGE by providing graded signaling, as has been described elsewhere in the nervous system (Charron and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005Charron F. Tessier-Lavigne M. Novel brain wiring functions for classical morphogens: a role as graded positional cues in axon guidance.Development. 2005; 132: 2251-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, Lee and Jessell, 1999Lee K.J. Jessell T.M. The specification of dorsal cell fates in the vertebrate central nervous system.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 261-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Using publicly available CNS gene expression data from the Allen Institute, we performed an in silico screen and found that multiple Wnt ligands are expressed in close proximity to the MGE (Figure 1; Figure S1) (http://developingmouse.brain-map.org). Caudal to the MGE, Wnt7a and Wnt7b are both highly expressed in the superficial stratum of the prethalamic eminence as well as in the cortical hem (Figure 1D; Figure S1), where Wnt3a and Wnt5a are also expressed (Figure S1). Tcf7l2, a canonical Wnt-responsive transcription factor, is also present in the caudal aspect of the MGE mantle, where newborn interneurons begin their migration (Figure 1E). A Wnt reporter mouse expressing a destabilized histone 2B-eGFP fusion protein under the control of general Tcf/Lef promoter elements (Ferrer-Vaquer et al., 2010Ferrer-Vaquer A. Piliszek A. Tian G. Aho R.J. Dufort D. Hadjantonakis A.K. A sensitive and bright single-cell resolution live imaging reporter of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in the mouse.BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Wnt reporter) also shows enriched eGFP expression in the caudal aspect of the MGE, suggestive of a caudal-high, rostral-low Wnt gradient of responsiveness within the MGE (Figures 1F and 3A). Within the rostral aspect of the MGE, the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 (Secreted frizzled receptor protein 1) is expressed (Figure S2). Upon further investigation of genes with similar enrichment in the MGE to Nkx2-1, we discovered that a large number of genes display a caudal-rostral divergence in their expression pattern (Figure S2). We therefore hypothesized that this regionality may arise from differences in exposure to Wnt ligands, resulting in signaling gradients that underlie previously described regional variation in generation of interneuron cell types (Wonders et al., 2008Wonders C.P. Taylor L. Welagen J. Mbata I.C. Xiang J.Z. Anderson S.A. A spatial bias for the origins of interneuron subgroups within the medial ganglionic eminence.Dev.

Our lab has previously employed ultrasound backscatter microscopy (UBM) as a means of grafting donor ventral eminence tissue into specific substructures of host embryonic brain. Through such fate mapping, we demonstrated that donor eGFP+ MGE cells, when transplanted into wild-type recipient host MGE, migrate dorsally and integrate throughout the cortex alongside endogenous interneurons (Butt et al., 2005Butt S.J.

In utero fate mapping reveals distinct migratory pathways and fates of neurons born in the mammalian basal forebrain.Development. 2001; 128: 3759-3771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To directly examine whether rostral versus caudal MGE (rMGE and cMGE, respectively)-derived cortical interneurons assume different fates within the cortex, we used a similar UBM transplantation approach (Figure 2). From embryos ubiquitously expressing tdTomato, the caudal (high Wnt) and rostral (low Wnt) portions of embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) MGEs were microdissected and transplanted into the MGE of E13.5 unlabeled host embryos (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S3). Brains from animals receiving grafts were collected at postnatal day 21 (P21) when interneuron progenitors have fully matured. Transplanted cells were scored for expression of SST or PV by immunohistochemistry (Figure 2C). Compared to control transplants of the whole MGE (wMGE), rMGE and cMGE transplants were strongly biased for PV and SST, respectively (wMGE n = 8, 63% PV and 37% SST of identified cells, SD 4.5%, 25% unidentified of all labeled cells, rMGE n = 14, 71% PV and 29% SST of identified cells, 29% unidentified of all labeled cells, SD 7.3%, cMGE n = 4, 16% PV and 84% SST of identified cells, SD 2.4%, 23% unidentified of all labeled cells, chi-square test p value = 0.02, 0.0001, Figure 2D). Since the presence of SST+ cells was strikingly enriched in the cMGE, we sought to establish a more direct relationship between Wnt responsiveness in MGE progenitors and SST+ cell fate. To do so, we made use of the histone 2B-eGFP Wnt reporter mouse mentioned above (Figures 1F and 3A) (Ferrer-Vaquer et al., 2010Ferrer-Vaquer A. Piliszek A. Tian G. Aho R.J. Dufort D. Hadjantonakis A.K. A sensitive and bright single-cell resolution live imaging reporter of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in the mouse.BMC Dev. Biol. 2010; 10: 121Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In order to both identify cells that receive strong Wnt signaling at E12.5 and characterize them as they achieve their mature fate, we crossed the Wnt reporter onto a background ubiquitously expressing tdTomato. We then dissected MGEs from E12.5 embryos and used flow cytometry to capture cells with high levels of nuclear eGFP expression, indicating high levels of Wnt signaling activity (Figure 3C, green box; Figure S3). After transplanting flow cytometry-isolated nuclear eGFP+ cells into unlabeled hosts, transplanted cells, marked by their expression of tdTomato, were scored for marker expression at P21. Overwhelmingly, embryonic progenitors with high levels of Wnt activity gave rise to SST+ cells (Figure 3D) (9% PV+ and 91% SST+ of identified cells, 18% unidentified cells of total reporter labeled cells, n = 2, compared to wMGE p = 0.0003, unpaired Student’s t test). In order to establish a causal link between Wnt signaling and interneuron identity, we administered IWP2, a small molecule inhibitor of the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase (MBOAT) protein Porcupine (Porcn) (Chen et al., 2009Chen B. Dodge M.E. Tang W. Lu J. Ma Z. Fan C.W. Wei S. Hao W. Kilgore J. Williams N.S. et al.Small molecule-mediated disruption of Wnt-dependent signaling in tissue regeneration and cancer.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Porcupine is essential for the post-translational acylation and secretion of all secreted Wnts (Barrott et al., 2011Barrott J.J. Cash G.M. Smith A.P. Barrow J.R. Murtaugh L.C. Deletion of mouse Porcn blocks Wnt ligand secretion and reveals an ectodermal etiology of human focal dermal hypoplasia/Goltz syndrome.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Wnt proteins are lipid-modified and can act as stem cell growth factors.Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). Indeed, IWP2 injection into the ventricle of E12.5 Wnt reporter mice dramatically reduced Wnt reporter expression within 24 h (Figures 3A and 3B). We hypothesized that a reduction in Wnt signaling would mimic an expansion of the low Wnt rostral MGE and result in a proportional decrease of SST+ cells. To test this, we injected the ventricles of fluorescently labeled mice with IWP2 at E12.5 and collected MGE tissue 24 h later for transplantation into E13.5 host embryos (Figure 3A, red box). When we analyzed hosts at P21, we found that a reduction in Wnt signaling resulted in a dramatic increase of interneurons that adopted a PV+ fate compared to wMGE transplants (Figure 3D) (79% PV+ and 21% SST+, of identified cells, 27% unidentified cells of total reporter expressing cells, n = 4, p = 0.03 unpaired Student’s t test compared to wMGE). Canonical Wnt signaling requires the intracellular signaling molecule β-catenin. Under basal conditions, β-catenin is sequestered within the cytoplasm and targeted for degradation by GSK3-β. Binding of Wnt ligand to the Frizzled (FZD) family of Wnt receptors prevents β-catenin degradation, resulting in its accumulation and translocation to the nucleus where it initiates the expression of Tcf/Lefs to modulate gene expression (Cadigan and Waterman, 2012Cadigan K.M. Waterman M.L. TCF/LEFs and Wnt signaling in the nucleus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (473) Google Scholar; reviewed in Willert and Nusse, 2012Willert K. Nusse R. Wnt proteins.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a007864Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Previous work suggests that loss of canonical Wnt signaling influences proliferation in the MGE (Gulacsi and Anderson, 2008Gulacsi A.A. Anderson S.A. Beta-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling regulates neurogenesis in the ventral telencephalon.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MGE-specific knockout of β-catenin is late-embryonic lethal, however, preventing assessment of the mature cell types produced from the mutant MGE. To circumvent this lethality and to determine whether disrupting Wnt signaling through β-catenin affects cell-type specification in the MGE, we generated E12.5 MGE-specific knockouts of β-catenin (Brault et al., 2001Brault V.

https://openalex.org/W2955693042,"Healthy cardiomyocytes are electrically coupled at the intercalated discs by gap junctions. In infarcted hearts, adverse gap-junctional remodeling occurs in the border zone, where cardiomyocytes are chemically and electrically influenced by myofibroblasts. The physical movement of these contacts remains unquantified. Using scanning ion conductance microscopy, we show that intercellular contacts between cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts are highly dynamic, mainly owing to the edge dynamics (lamellipodia) of the myofibroblasts. Decreasing the amount of functional connexin-43 (Cx43) at the membrane through Cx43 silencing, suppression of Cx43 trafficking, or hypoxia-induced Cx43 internalization attenuates heterocellular contact dynamism. However, we found decreased dynamism and stabilized membrane contacts when cellular coupling was strengthened using 4-phenylbutyrate (4PB). Fluorescent-dye transfer between cells showed that the extent of functional coupling between the 2 cell types correlated with contact dynamism. Intercellular calcein transfer from myofibroblasts to cardiomyocytes is reduced after myofibroblast-specific Cx43 down-regulation. Conversely, 4PB-treated myofibroblasts increased their functional coupling to cardiomyocytes. Consistent with lamellipodia-mediated contacts, latrunculin-B decreases dynamism, lowers physical communication between heterocellular pairs, and reduces Cx43 intensity in contact regions. Our data show that heterocellular cardiomyocyte-myofibroblast contacts exhibit high dynamism. Therefore, Cx43 is a potential target for prevention of aberrant cardiomyocyte coupling and myofibroblast proliferation in the infarct border zone.-Schultz, F., Swiatlowska, P., Alvarez-Laviada, A., Sanchez-Alonso, J.

https://openalex.org/W2954809740,"Background Despite improvements in treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and spondyloarthritis (axSpA), several key unmet needs remain, such as fatigue. The objective of this study was to describe the severity of fatigue, disease characteristics and socioeconomic factors in people with RA, PsA and axSpA. Methods The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey collecting patient characteristics such as disease characteristics, socioeconomic factors and fatigue in people with RA, PsA and axSpA in Denmark. Respondents were consecutively recruited for the study over a six-month period in 2018 via routine visits to outpatient rheumatology clinics. Study nurses collected information on diagnosis, current disease-related treatment and disease activity from medical journals. People were invited to complete a questionnaire related to socioeconomic factors and containing the FACIT-Fatigue subscale. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SAS. Results We invited 633 people to participate, and 488 (77%) completed the questionnaire. Women constituted 62% of respondents, and the mean age was 53.5 years. Respondents had on average been diagnosed between 11 and 15 years ago. Overall, 79% had no changes to their disease-related treatment during the past year, and the average disease activity as indicated by DAS28 for RA and PsA was 2.48 and 2.36, respectively, and BASDAI for axSpA was 28.40. Fatigue was present in all three diagnoses (mean: 34.31). The mean fatigue score varied from respondents answering that they suffered from no or little fatigue (mean: 45.48) to extreme fatigue (mean: 10.11). Analyses demonstrated that the respondents were not considerably different from nonrespondents, and the study population is considered representative compared with Danish RA and axSpA patients in the Danish National Rheumatology Registry, the DANBIO database. Conclusion We found that the majority of the study population were fatigued (61%). They had low disease activity and few disease-related treatment changes."
https://openalex.org/W2955955113,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the epithelial chloride channel CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most common mutation is a deletion of three nucleotides leading to the loss of phenylalanine at position 508 (p.Phe508del) in the protein. This study evaluates eluforsen, a novel, single-stranded, 33-nucleotide antisense oligonucleotide designed to restore CFTR function, in in vitro and in vivo models of p.Phe508del CF. The aims of the study were to demonstrate cellular uptake of eluforsen, and its efficacy in functional restoration of p.Phe508del-CFTR both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the effect of eluforsen was investigated in human CF pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and human bronchial epithelial cells. Two mouse models were used to evaluate eluforsen in vivo. In vitro, eluforsen improved chloride efflux in CF pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell cultures and increased short-circuit current in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, both indicating restoration of CFTR function. In vivo, eluforsen was taken up by airway epithelium following oro-tracheal administration in mice, resulting in systemic exposure of eluforsen. In female F508del-CFTR mice, eluforsen significantly increased CFTR-mediated saliva secretion (used as a measure of CFTR function, equivalent to the sweat test in humans). Similarly, intranasal administration of eluforsen significantly improved nasal potential difference (NPD), and therefore CFTR conductance, in two CF mouse models. These findings indicate that eluforsen improved CFTR function in cell and animal models of p.Phe508del-CFTR-mediated CF and supported further development of eluforsen in human clinical trials, where eluforsen has also been shown to improve CFTR activity as measured by NPD."
https://openalex.org/W2955022665,"CircRNAs are involved in a variety of human diseases, however, the expression profiles and the potential diagnostic value of circRNAs in human acute Stanford type A aortic dissection (AAAD) remains largely unknown. In this study, high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to investigate the differentially expressed circRNAs, microRNAs (miRs) and mRNAs in human AAAD tissues (n = 10) compared with normal aortic tissues (n = 10). The results of RNA-Seq revealed that 506 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated (P<0.05, false discovery rate, FDR<0.05, fold change>2). The subsequent weighted gene correlation network analysis and the following co-expression network analysis revealed that tyrosine-protein kinase Fgr might play important roles in the occurrence and development of AAAD. According to the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network, we found that the upstream regulatory molecule of Fgr is circMARK3. Finally, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the serum circMARK3 as biomarkers for AAAD (cutoff value = 1.497, area under the curve = 0.9344, P < 0.0001, sensitivity = 90.0%, specificity = 86.7%). These results provided a preliminary landscape of circRNAs expression profiles and indicated that circMARK3 was a potential biomarker for AAAD diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2955231306,"The secreted protein, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), plays a central role in fetal and prenatal growth and development, and is regulated at the genetic level by parental imprinting, being expressed predominantly from the paternally derived chromosome in mice and humans. Here, IGF2/Igf2 and its locus has been examined in 19 mammals from 13 orders spanning ~166 million years of evolutionary development. By using human or mouse DNA segments as queries in genome analyses, and by assessing gene expression using RNA-sequencing libraries, more complexity was identified within IGF2/Igf2 than was annotated previously. Multiple potential 5’ non-coding exons were mapped in most mammals and are presumably linked to distinct IGF2/Igf2 promoters, as shown for several species by interrogating RNA-sequencing libraries. DNA similarity was highest in IGF2/Igf2 coding exons; yet, even though the mature IGF2 protein was conserved, versions of 67 or 70 residues are produced secondary to species-specific maintenance of alternative RNA splicing at a variable intron-exon junction. Adjacent H19 was more divergent than IGF2/Igf2, as expected in a gene for a noncoding RNA, and was identified in only 10/19 species. These results show that common features, including those defining IGF2/Igf2 coding and several non-coding exons, were likely present at the onset of the mammalian radiation, but that others, such as a putative imprinting control region 5’ to H19 and potential enhancer elements 3’ to H19, diversified with speciation. This study also demonstrates that careful analysis of genomic and gene expression repositories can provide new insights into gene structure and regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2956033661,"Previous studies have indicated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 6 may play an important role in skeletal system development and progression. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of BMP6 in cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation remains unknown. In this study, cartilage cells were isolated from shanks of chicken embryos and treated with different concentrations of Growth Hormone. Cell proliferation potential was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting and CCK-8 assays in vitro. The results showed that at 48 h, the Collagen II and BMP6 expression levels in 50 ng/μl GH-treated cartilage cells were significantly higher than in groups treated with 100 ng/μl or 200 ng/μl GH. We further observed that knockdown of BMP6 in cartilage cells led to significantly decreased expression mRNAs and proteins of Collagen II and Collagen X. Moreover, the suppression of BMP6 expression by a specific siRNA led to significantly decreased expression mRNA levels of IGF1R, JAK2, PKC, PTH, IHH and PTHrP and decreased protein levels of PKC, IHH and PTHrP. Taken together, our data suggest that BMP6 may play a critical role in chicken cartilage cell proliferation and differentiation through the regulation of IGF1, JAK2, PKC, PTH, and IHH-PTHrP signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2955251206,"Background HBV vaccine is known to offer protection against transmission of HBV infection. Health care workers are mandated to have this vaccination as part of their occupational health safety measures. Post vaccination response data for HCWs in our setting is not available. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the anti-HBs titre levels after Hepatitis B vaccination among HCWs from selected heath facilities in the Cape Coast Metropolis, Ghana. Methods A multicenter (3 selected sites) analytical cross-sectional study involving 711 HCWs was conducted. Five (5mls) of blood samples were collected from each study participant and the serum used for HBV immunological profile testing anti-HBs quantification by ELISA test (Fortress Diagnostics Limited, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom). Data analyses were performed using Stata version 14.0 software (STATA Corp, Texas USA). Results The median age of participants was 29 years (IQR = 26–35 years). Majority (80.9%, n = 575) took their vaccination from Government health facilities compared with 19.1% (n = 136) from private vaccination sources. A total of 7 (3 males and 4 females) were found to be HBsAg positive giving prevalence of 1%. In all, 8.2% (n = 58) of the HCWs had anti-HBs titre levels <10IU/ml giving a sero-protection rate of 91.8%. HCWs who received 3 doses of HBV vaccine were more likely to be sero-protected as compared to those who received only one dose in multivariate analysis (aOR = 3.39, 95%CI: 1.08–10.67), p<0.037). Gender, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were not found to be associated with sero-protection. Conclusion There is a high HBV vaccine efficacy among HCWs in the Cape Coast Metropolis of Ghana with higher prevalence of anti-HBs titre level associated with full vaccine dose adherence. Post vaccination antibody titre determination could be an integral part of HBV vaccination protocol for HCWs in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W2953422532,"We investigate the personalisation and prediction accuracy of mathematical models for white blood cell (WBC) count dynamics during consolidation treatment using intermediate or high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Ara-C is the clinically most relevant cytotoxic agent for AML treatment. We extend a mathematical model of myelosuppression and a pharmacokinetic model of Ara-C with different hypotheses of Ara-C’s pharmacodynamic effects. We cross-validate the 12 model variations using dense WBC count measurements from 23 AML patients. Surprisingly, the prediction accuracy remains satisfactory in each of the models despite different modelling hypotheses. Therefore, we compare average clinical and calculated WBC recovery times for different Ara-C schedules as a successful methodology for model discrimination. As a result, a new hypothesis of a secondary pharmacodynamic effect on the proliferation rate seems plausible. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of treatment timing on subsequent nadir values based on personalised predictions as a possibility for influencing/controlling myelosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2955530924,"Pedicles are often broken when screws are inserted into hard pedicles with small diameters or when the diameter of the screw itself is inadequate. However, there is a lack of biomechanical literature that addresses screw loosening as a result of broken pedicles or the resulting salvage of those screws. We performed a novel in vitro study to compare the pullout strength of screws between intact pedicles and two different types of broken pedicles; strategies to prevent screw loosening were also compared. Thirty L4 Sawbones were designed to represent intact pedicles, semi-pedicles, and nonpedicles and were prepared for screw insertion. Three sizes of polyaxial screws (diameter × length dimensions of 6.0 mm × 45 mm, 6.0 mm × 50 mm and 6.5 mm × 45 mm) were independently and randomly distributed into the intact-pedicle group (IP group, n = 30), the semi-pedicle group (SP group, n = 15), or the nonpedicle group (NP group, n = 15). The experiments were conducted across a minimum of five trials for each of the chosen screw sizes. We then analyzed the results of the imaging, pullout testing, and embedded bone volume. Any fractures or defects of the vertebrae caused by screw insertion were excluded from the study. The appropriate screw trajectory and insertional depth were confirmed using axial and sagittal X-ray imaging prior to screw pullout testing. A pullout strength of only 41% to 45% for the SP group and 29% to 39% for the NP group was retained following a broken pedicle. The use of longer or larger-diameter screws appears to be an effective salvaging procedure for the NP group (p < 0.05). The embedded bone volume percentage analysis indicated that, compared to the IP group, 68% to 76% of effective bone embedded into the screw threads in the SP group, and 58% to 65% in the NP group. There was no direct correlation between the pullout strength and the embedded bone volume; however, less effective embedded bone volume was associated with lower pullout strength. This study describes the evolution of the well-established screw pullout test being applied to the broken pedicle Sawbone testing model. The pedicle plays an important role in determining the pullout strength of a screw. However, a salvage procedure that utilizes a longer or larger-diameter screw might be a reliable clinical approach to address broken pedicles."
https://openalex.org/W2954947398,"Nectin and nectin-like (Necl) adhesion molecules are broadly overexpressed in a wide range of cancers. By binding to these adhesion molecules, the immunoreceptors DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1), CD96 molecule (CD96), and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) play a crucial role in regulating the anticancer activities of immune effector cells. However, within this axis, it remains unclear how DNAM-1 recognizes its cognate ligands. Here, we determined the structure of human DNAM-1 in complex with nectin-like protein-5 (Necl-5) at 2.8 A resolution. Unexpectedly, we found that the two extracellular domains (D1-D2) of DNAM-1 adopt an unconventional collapsed arrangement that is markedly distinct from those in other immunoglobulin-based immunoreceptors. The DNAM-1/Necl-5 interaction was underpinned by conserved lock-and-key motifs located within their respective D1 domains, but also included a distinct interface derived from DNAM-1 D2. Mutation of the signature DNAM-1 key motif within the D1 domain attenuated Necl-5 binding and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Altogether, our results have implications for understanding the binding mode of an immune receptor family that is emerging as a viable candidate for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2955311367,"DNA damage in lens cells is considered a critical trigger for the onset of age-related cataracts (ARCs). Among DNA repair pathways, the base excision repair (BER) pathway is responsible for mending single-strand breaks in DNA. In this case-control study with 993 ARC cases and 993 healthy controls, we genotyped 9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within microRNA (miRNA) regions of 6 BER pathway genes and examined their associations with ARC susceptibility. We identified rs4639:T > C in the Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2) gene as significantly associated with ARCs. Individuals carrying different rs4639 alleles had distinct NEIL2 expression in lens capsule tissues from ARC cases and controls. Bioinformatics predicts that the rs4639 T allele could disrupt hsa-miR-3912-5p binding. The results of the luciferase reporter assay were in concordance with this prediction. This study has added more evidence that SNP-modified posttranscriptional gene regulation by miRNA might be a potential pathogenic mechanism of ARCs. SNPs potentially affecting miRNA binding to the 3′UTR of BER pathway genes could contribute to discrepant disease susceptibility. NEIL2-rs4639T was strongly associated with a protective role in ARCs. This protective role might be fulfilled by maintaining normal expression of NEIL2 in the mediation of disrupted binding of rs4639T with hsa-miR-3912-5p. A further study to generate model systems (cell lines or animal models) with NEIL2 variants is warranted. The results provide 2 molecular targets (e.g., NEIL2 and hsa-miR-3912-5p) for intervention strategies of ARC in the future.—Kang, L., Zou, X., Zhang, G., Xiang, J., Wang, Y., Yang, M., Chen, X., Wu, J., Guan, H.

https://openalex.org/W2975923278,Seasonality of suicidal behavior has been widely reported in many epidemiological studies with a well replicated suicide peak in spring followed by a trough in winter season. Research from some regions over the past few decades has shown a diminishing seasonal pattern of suicides and this introduced a new perspective on the suicide study. Data on all suicide deaths from the period 1991 to 2015 was extracted from the South Korean National Death Registration data set which was made available by Statistics Korea. Our findings confirmed a strong seasonal effect of suicides in South Korea throughout the study period and a marked diminishing pattern was observed since the period of 2006–2010. The rhythm of suicides kept changing across the time intervals with a spring peak followed by a second peak in late summer/autumn. The seasonality varied across age groups and the seasonal effect among the Korean elderly suicides was still found to be significant though a diminishing pattern was observed recently.
https://openalex.org/W2953653897,"Although algae have been the focal point of biofuel research, studies on their biological activities have been limited. In recent years, however, the importance of algae as sources of functional ingredients has been recognized due to their health beneficial effects. In this study, we evaluated the antidepressant-like activities of ethanol extract of Aurantiochytrium sp. (EEA) in the forced swimming test (FST)-induced depression in ICR mice. Imipramine, a commercially available tricyclic antidepressant drug, was used as positive control. Animals were administered EEA orally for 14 consecutive days and were subjected to the locomotor activity testing. Additionally, changes in gene expression in mice brain were assessed by real-time PCR and microarray assays to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EEA. We found that the immobility time in FST was significantly reduced in the EEA-treated mice compared to that of in the control mice. Microarray and real-time PCR results revealed that EEA treatment induced changes in several genes in mice brain associated with pro-inflammation and dopaminergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic synapses. It has previously been reported that several cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which mediate neuroinflammation, are also responsible for indirectly altering brain neurotransmitter levels in neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in EEA-administered mice brain is considered to contribute to the enhancement of neurotransmitter systems-related gene expression in our study. Moreover, our in vitro study suggested that squalene, a component produced by Aurantiochytrium, was one of the active substances in EEA. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that Aurantiochytrium sp. can reduce neuroinflammation that may contribute to the modulation of the neurotransmitter systems, which could underlie its antistress and antidepressant effects."
https://openalex.org/W4247989283,"Reductions in cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) measured by near infra-red spectroscopy have been found during compensated hypovolemia in the lower body negative pressure (LBNP)-model, which may reflect reduced cerebral blood flow. However, ScO2 may also be contaminated from extracranial (scalp) tissues, mainly supplied by the external carotid artery (ECA), and it is possible that a ScO2 reduction during hypovolemia is caused by reduced scalp, and not cerebral, blood flow. The aim of the present study was to explore the associations between blood flow in precerebral arteries and ScO2 during LBNP-induced hypovolemia. Twenty healthy volunteers were exposed to LBNP 20, 40, 60 and 80 mmHg. Blood flow in the internal carotid artery (ICA), ECA and vertebral artery (VA) was measured by Doppler ultrasound. Stroke volume for calculating cardiac output was measured by suprasternal Doppler. Associations of changes within subjects were examined using linear mixed-effects regression models. LBNP reduced cardiac output, ScO2 and ICA and ECA blood flow. Changes in flow in both ICA and ECA were associated with changes in ScO2 and cardiac output. Flow in the VA did not change during LBNP and changes in VA flow were not associated with changes in ScO2 or cardiac output. During experimental compensated hypovolemia in healthy, conscious subjects, a reduced ScO2 may thus reflect a reduction in both cerebral and extracranial blood flow."

Among members of this channel family in Escherichia coli, the exact function and physiological role of the mechanosensitive channel homolog YbdG remain unclear. Characterization of YbdG's physiological role has been hampered by its lack of measurable transport activity. Using a nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis-aided screen in combination with next-generation sequencing, here we isolated a mutant with a point mutation in ybdG. This mutation (resulting in a I167T change) conferred sensitivity to high osmotic stress, and the mutant cells differed from WT cells in morphology during hyperosmotic stress at alkaline pH. Interestingly, unlike the cells containing the I167T variant, a null-ybdG mutant did not exhibit this sensitivity and phenotype. Although I167T was located near the putative ion-conducting pore in a transmembrane region of YbdG, no change in ion channel activities of YbdG-I167T was detected. Of note, introduction of the WT C-terminal cytosolic region of YbdG into the I167T variant complemented the osmo-sensitive phenotype. Co-precipitation of proteins interacting with the C-terminal YbdG region led to the isolation of HldD and FbaA, whose overexpression in cells containing the YbdG-I167T variant partially rescued the osmo-sensitive phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2955701040,"Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) is one of the most sensitive analysis techniques to measure long-lived radionuclides, reaching detection limits for isotopic ratios down to 10-15-10-16 in special cases. Its application portfolio covers nearly every field of environmental research, considering processes in the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and the cosmosphere. Normally, AMS measures the content of isotopes in comparison to a validated standard. However, in some cases like for example 60Fe, well characterized standard materials are difficult to produce due to the extreme rareness of the isotope. We report here on the manufacturing of a set of 60Fe standards, obtained by processing irradiated copper from a beam dump of the high-power proton accelerator (HIPA) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The isotopic ratios of the standards have been adjusted via a dilution series of a master solution, isotopic content of which has been characterized by Multi Collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). In total, we produced three samples with isotopic ratios of 1.037(6)·10-8, 1.125(7)·10-10 and 1.234 (7)·10-12, respectively. The latter had already been applied in three pioneering AMS studies investigating the remaining signal of injected matter of nearby super novae explosions in sediment archives."

The present study aimed to evaluate developmental shape changes of facial morphology based on a prospective, population-representative, Chinese cohort in Hong Kong. Methods A population-representative sample of Chinese in Hong Kong was followed. Serial facial images of over 260 participants were obtained at age 12, 15, and 18 years. Facial landmarks were digitized and the corresponding coordinates were submitted for Generalized Procrustes Analysis. The resultant Procrustes shape coordinates, which captured shape information encoded by the facial landmarks, were then used for statistical shape analyses. Results Small but significant developmental changes in mean facial shape were observed (p < 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons). Significant age-related changes in the magnitude of variance of facial shape were also observed (p < 0.05). Phenotypic growth trajectories representing developmental shape changes were similar in size (p > 0.05) between sexes but differed in direction (p < 0.05) in shape space and trajectory shape (p < 0.05). The magnitude of shape differences between sexes remained constant from 12 to 18 years. Results of frontal facial shape analyses after removing the effect of allometry were similar to results obtained before removal of allometry. For lateral facial configurations, allometric trajectories among the age-by-sex groups were similar in slope (p > 0.05) but varied in directions in the multidimensional shape space. Conclusions Our findings suggested significant age-related changes in facial shape and provided a dynamic view of developmental changes in sexual dimorphism of facial shape. Allometry contributed minimally to developmental changes in frontal facial shape. In addition, the allometric trajectories for lateral facial configurations were similar in rate of shape change but differed in their directions in shape space."

Patients also presented increased Vδ2 γδ T cell counts, especially during vaso-occlusive crisis, and a lower frequency of IFNγ-producing Vδ2 γδ T cells, except during crisis. iNKT cell counts and the frequency of IFNγ-producing iNKT cells were unchanged compared to controls. Our study revealed positive correlations between 1) the frequency of IFNγ-producing CD4+, CD8+ and Vδ2 γδ T cells and the number of hospitalizations for vaso-occlusive crisis in the previous year; 2) the frequency of IFNγ-producing iNKT cells and patients' age and 3) the frequency of IL-17-producing Vδ2 γδ T cells and hemoglobin S level.These results strongly suggest a role of innate-like T cells in sickle cell disease pathophysiology, especially that of IL-17-producing MAIT and γδ T cells."

The expression study of SOCS3 through real-time PCR analysis revealed, a 5.9 mean fold increase in SOCS3 expression in atopic cases in comparison to control cases. Moreover, IL-6 has, also, been found significantly enhanced in the serum level of atopic cases (26.4 pg/ml) as compared to control cases (3.686 pg/ml). Female population was found to be at a higher risk to develop atopic condition than male population as females exhibited higher expression of both SOCS3 and IL-6 than males. Furthermore, the polymorphic study of IL-6 promoter region (IL-6 174-G/C) in atopic population has reasserted the importance of SOCS3 and IL-6 in the diagnosis and prognosis of allergy. Expression of SOCS3 and IL-6 serum levels were found to be highly correlated. Therefore establishing the role of IL-6 (-174-G/C) polymorphism on the expression of SOCS3 and IL-6 in atopic cases. Notably, the study established SOCS3 and IL-6 as potential targets for the diagnosis/prognosis of allergy and for the development of reliable therapeutic strategies to control atopic conditions in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2955224299,"[18F]T807 is a potent tau protein imaging agent. In order to fulfill the demand from preclinical and clinical studies, we developed an automated one-pot two-step synthesis of this potent tau imaging agent and studied its stability, and dosimetry in mice and monkeys. We also conducted a preliminary study of this imaging agent in humans. Using this one-pot two-step method, the radiochemical yield (RCY) of [18F]T807 was 20.5 ± 6.1% (n = 15) at the end of bombardment (EOB) in a synthesis time of 70±5 min. The chemical and radiochemical purities were >90% and the specific activities were 151 ± 52 GBq/μmol. The quality of [18F]T807 synthesized by this method met the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) criteria. The stability test showed that the [18F]T807 injection was stable at room temperature for up to 4 h after the end of synthesis (EOS). The estimated effective dose of the [18F]T807 injection extrapolated from monkeys was 19 μSv/MBq (n = 2), while the estimated effective doses of the [18F]T807 injection extrapolated from fasted and non-fasted mice were 123 ± 27 (n = 3) and 94 ± 19 (n = 4) μSv/MBq, respectively. This one-pot two-step automated method produced the [18F]T807 injection with high reproducibility and high quality. PET imaging and radiation dosimetry evaluation in mice and Formosan rock monkeys suggested that the [18F]T807 injection synthesized by this method is suitable for use in human PET imaging studies. Thus, this method could fulfill the demand for the [18F]T807 injection in both preclinical and clinical studies of tauopathies, especially for nearby study sites without cyclotrons."

https://openalex.org/W2956042796,"You’ve probably heard the cliché “life is complicated.” Maybe you have even picked up Marie Kondo’s best-selling book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up or clicked on a link to a self-help article promising to guide you toward the recreation of a simpler you by cutting out excess baggage—the things you probably don’t really need to maintain your desired lifestyle. Perhaps some of these things are unnecessary redundancies within your home, which would only get in the way if you wanted to reconfigure the functionality of your living space. Synthetic biologists agree that sometimes life can be unnecessarily complicated and that, for scientific applications in controlled environments, simpler single-cell organisms can be more useful than naturally occurring strains. To this end, a recent paper by Jason Chin and colleagues reports the latest milestone achievement in this exciting field of genetic minimalization, which pushes the limits of what we might think is biologically possible (Fredens et al., 2019Fredens J. Wang K. de la Torre D. Funke L.F.H. Robertson W.E. Christova Y. Chia T. Schmied W.H. Dunkelmann D.L. Beránek V. et al.Total synthesis of Escherichia coli with a recoded genome.Nature. 2019; 569: 514-518Google Scholar). These scientists create a simpler, unnatural version of E. coli in which 3 of the 64 naturally occurring codons used across all domains of life are each replaced throughout the bacterial genome with synonymous codons from the remaining 61 (18,214 substitutions in total) to create the first ever 61-codon genome, Syn61. With the removal of these three codons (one stop codon and two for serine), three previously essential genes (for cognate tRNAs and a peptide release factor) could also now be removed. The researchers computationally designed the “compressed” genome using a refactoring and recoding approach and then completely synthesized and pieced it together about 108 kilobases at a time, to create a record-setting synthetic genome at nearly 4 million bases in size. Refactoring, a term borrowed from the world of software engineering, refers the process of rewriting existing code without changing its functional output. But in biology, cutting out “excess” bits of the genome is tricky business. Genomes are so densely coded with information that stretches of DNA are often multifunctional, as in the case of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). By changing even a few bases of DNA, you could produce multiple effects. Thus, genetic refactoring was required by the Chin group to dissociate overlapping ORFs so that subsequent codon recoding would be precise. Synthetic biologists can also use refactoring to eliminate non-essential regulatory and feedback elements, to produce simplified organisms that can be more easily manipulated and controlled. Recently, a refactoring approach was used by Tom Ellis and colleagues to re-engineer the widely studied yeast mating response pathway in S. cerevisiae and produce a broadly applicable, cell-based G protein-coupled receptor biosensor platform, easily reprogrammable for diverse applications (Shaw et al., 2019Shaw W.M. Yamauchi H. Mead J. Gowers G.F. Bell D.J. Öling D. Larsson N. Wigglesworth M. Ladds G. Ellis T. Engineering a Model Cell for Rational Tuning of GPCR Signaling.Cell. 2019; 177: 782-796.e27Google Scholar). Both yeast and bacteria, especially E. coli, which has long been considered the workhorse of molecular biology, are ideal starting points for the design of customized, living factories for the manufacturing of all kinds of products. A noteworthy example is the engineering of cells capable of completely synthesizing cannabinoids and their analogs from galactose, for pharmaceutical applications (Luo et al., 2019Luo X. Reiter M.A. d’Espaux L. Wong J. Denby C.M. Lechner A. Zhang Y. Grzybowski A.T. Harth S. Lin W. et al.Complete biosynthesis of cannabinoids and their unnatural analogues in yeast.Nature. 2019; 567: 123-126Google Scholar). The Ellis group is part of a large, collaborative, global effort across more than a dozen research labs to synthesize the entire S. cerevisiae genome, which will yield yet another milestone for the field. It’s often hard to define what’s necessary for life in a given environment. For most genomes, the functions of every base are not completely understood. Researchers have become fairly adept at identifying the protein-coding regions of genes, but many non-coding regions are also necessary for unknown reasons. Even for the protein-coding regions, context often matters since it affects the level and nature of protein expression. To determine whether the native genomic context matters for specific stretches of DNA, synthetic biologists have developed some strategies. An example recently used by Beat and Matthias Christen and colleagues in C. crescentus required re-introduction of synthetic essential DNA back into native cells episomally and subsequent transposon mutagenesis (Venetz et al., 2019Venetz J.E. Del Medico L. Wölfle A. Schächle P. Bucher Y. Appert D. Tschan F. Flores-Tinoco C.E. van Kooten M. Guennoun R. et al.Chemical synthesis rewriting of a bacterial genome to achieve design flexibility and biological functionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116: 8070-8079Google Scholar). If the synthetic DNA, removed from its natural context, was still able to contribute its essential function to the cell, the previously essential (and previously immutable) native copy of the DNA could then be mutagenized. Further highlighting our limited understanding of the genome, refactored and recoded organisms often do not grow as robustly as their parental strains. For example, Syn61 doubles 1.6× slower than its parental strain MDS42 (Fredens et al., 2019Fredens J. Wang K. de la Torre D. Funke L.F.H. Robertson W.E. Christova Y. Chia T. Schmied W.H. Dunkelmann D.L. Beránek V. et al.Total synthesis of Escherichia coli with a recoded genome.Nature. 2019; 569: 514-518Google Scholar). But as with naturally occurring organisms that have been transferred to laboratory settings, scientists can also reoptimize unnatural strains using adaptive laboratory evolution (Choe et al., 2019Choe D. Lee J.H. Yoo M. Hwang S. Sung B.H. Cho S. Palsson B. Kim S.C. Cho B.K. Adaptive laboratory evolution of a genome-reduced Escherichia coli.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 935Google Scholar). The recovery of robust functionality is important because the end goal of synthetic biology is usually to produce a more easily manipulatable strain for downstream applications. Poor performance could render the new synthetic organism useless. A minimal organism that performs well would provide not only an easier genome to work with but also one with newly freed up space or features, where exogenous modules then could be engineered back in. The tRNAs Chin and colleagues render no longer necessary in Syn61 (Fredens et al., 2019Fredens J. Wang K. de la Torre D. Funke L.F.H. Robertson W.E. Christova Y. Chia T. Schmied W.H. Dunkelmann D.L. Beránek V. et al.Total synthesis of Escherichia coli with a recoded genome.Nature. 2019; 569: 514-518Google Scholar) could potentially be repurposed to recognize an unnatural codon. The field is getting closer to creating a functional genetic code that incorporates unnatural nucleobases with another recent milestone achievement. Steven Brenner and colleagues have created a synthetic eight-letter (hachimoji) DNA molecule, where complementary unnatural bases (B, S, P, and Z) base paired with one another alongside the naturally occurring bases (A, T, G, and C), forming stable, structurally sound double helices, which could then be faithfully transcribed to eight-letter RNA (Hoshika et al., 2019Hoshika S. Leal N.A. Kim M.J. Kim M.S. Karalkar N.B. Kim H.J. Bates A.M. Watkins Jr., N.E. SantaLucia H.A. Meyer A.J. et al.Hachimoji DNA and RNA: A genetic system with eight building blocks.Science. 2019; 363: 884-887Google Scholar). The codon sequence themselves that are freed up by the Chin group because they are no longer used for serines or the amber stop (Fredens et al., 2019Fredens J. Wang K. de la Torre D. Funke L.F.H. Robertson W.E. Christova Y. Chia T. Schmied W.H. Dunkelmann D.L. Beránek V. et al.Total synthesis of Escherichia coli with a recoded genome.Nature. 2019; 569: 514-518Google Scholar) could also be repurposed. This idea of codon repurposing has been recently demonstrated by Paul Jaschke and colleagues (Vincent et al., 2019Vincent R.M. Wright B.W. Jaschke P.R. Measuring Amber Initiator tRNA Orthogonality in a Genomically Recoded Organism.ACS Synth. Biol. 2019; 8: 675-685Google Scholar). They took a compressed E. coli strain also lacking amber stop codons and repurposed the UAG codon as a novel, unique initiation codon by introducing an engineered tRNA that has a CUA anticodon and recruits N-terminal methionine. This amber initiator can be used to control a synthetic protein translation system that is orthogonal to the native AUG system. Repurposed codons and engineered tRNAs could also be used to incorporate unnatural amino acids in a site-specific way. Genetically reduced organisms can of course also be used to discover new biology. Just as the exercise of removing unnecessary items from your cluttered home will help you refocus on the things in your life that matter most to you, genetic reduction provides a simpler starting point for molecular biologists to identify essential genes and their functions. Using a genetically reduced strain of M. mycoides capri, the first live organism to be controlled by an entirely synthetic genome, Zaida Luthey-Schulten and colleagues developed a computer model to simulate the cell’s entire metabolic network, a feat that would have been much more difficult had they started with the native organism (Breuer et al., 2019Breuer M. Earnest T.M. Merryman C. Wise K.S. Sun L. Lynott M.R. Hutchison C.A. Smith H.O. Lapek J.D. Gonzalez D.J. et al.Essential metabolism for a minimal cell.eLife. 2019; 8: e36842Google Scholar). Using available biochemical data, candidate metabolic genes were identified and associated with specific cellular reactions to construct the in silico network. The model nominated both essential and non-essential candidate genes for further removal, many of which were verified experimentally by transposon mutagenesis. Interestingly, the model suggests genes that could be simultaneously removed, whereas transposon mutagenesis is only able to probe the individual essentiality of genes. Discrepancies between predicted and experimentally observed essentiality provided new hypotheses concerning, for example, the existence of yet-to-be-identified genes encoding specific metabolic activities. These clues, provided by computer simulations, will direct the pursuit of even simpler lifeforms. As synthetic biologists continue to reduce genomes and decrease the number of unknowns therein, they move us closer and closer to the day when scientists will truly be able to build an organism from the bottom up and easily reconfigure it with fewer surprises along the way. As the excess baggage is left behind, these efforts will thrust forward very practical, game-changing advances in biomanufacturing, biosensing, information storage, medicine, and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W2953403298,"Software solutions such as mRay allow review of radiological images on handheld devices. We investigated if the quality is adequate for evaluating CT scans of patients with suspected stroke.50 patients (Median age 80 years, 28 females) were retrospectively selected. All patients had undergone multidetector CT angiography ± perfusion and presented with clinical signs of acute stroke. Out of the 50 patients, 19 had large-vessel occlusion (LVO), 5 had intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), 10 had severe intracranial stenosis of at least one major vessel, 2 had intracranial tumor and 15 had no or an unrelated pathology. One experienced neuroradiologist and one resident scored the anonymized pictures separately on two handheld devices (iPhone 7 Plus, MED-TAB) equipped with mRay Software and on a PACS workstation. Each case was reviewed on all three devices with a break in-between of at least 12 weeks. The scoring on the traditional workstation was compared with the two handheld devices, regarding detection of early ischemic signs, LVOs, CBV/CBF-mismatch, ICHs and severe stenosis. Both raters were asked to rate the diagnostic quality of both handheld devices regarding detection of LVOs, ICHs, early ischemic signs and overall.All LVOs, intracranial tumors and ICHs were detected on both mobile devices. There was no significant difference in the rating of CCT and CBF ASPECTS between all three devices, while the sensitivity for detecting a CBF/CBV-mismatch was above 80% on both devices. Both raters assessed the diagnostic quality to be sufficient on both mobile devices to base treatment decisions on.Software solutions such as mRay for handheld devices provide adequate diagnostic quality for the review of CT scans of suspected stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2955310784,"In August 2016, new prescription guidelines were introduced in Hungary to reduce the co-payments for antibiotics among children aged 0-4. This study aims at analysing the implementation of this policy and its effect on the use of antibiotics.The analysis is based on administrative prescription records between January 2010-February 2018, covering the entire population of Hungary aged 0-7. Spatial autocorrelation indices are calculated and settlement level regression models are estimated to analyse the spatial variation in the application of the new guidelines. The effect of reduced co-payments on antibiotic use is estimated with a difference-in-differences type model: the treatment and control groups are children aged 0-4 and 5-7, respectively; the treatment and control periods are August 2016-February 2018 and January 2010-July 2016, respectively.The new prescription guidelines are more widely applied in settlements with higher per capita income and lower unemployment rate. Adherence to the new guidelines is spatially clustered. A 10-15% decrease in the out-of-pocket costs of antibiotics is estimated to increase the consumption of antibiotics by about 5% (95% CI: 2.63%-7.55%).In the absence of clear enforcement mechanisms, the adoption of the new prescription guidelines is selective, contradicting the aims of the policy of making antibiotics affordable for the poor children. The results point to the possible role of physicians' information networks in the application of prescription guidelines. The use of antibiotics among children aged 0-4 is responsive to the price subsidy of antibiotics."
