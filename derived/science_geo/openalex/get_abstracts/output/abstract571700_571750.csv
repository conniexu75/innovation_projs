https://openalex.org/W2533664860,"Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC (G4C2) in C9ORF72 is the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Transcripts carrying (G4C2) expansions undergo unconventional, non-ATG-dependent translation, generating toxic dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins thought to contribute to disease. Here, we identify the interactome of all DPRs and find that arginine-containing DPRs, polyGly-Arg (GR) and polyPro-Arg (PR), interact with RNA-binding proteins and proteins with low complexity sequence domains (LCDs) that often mediate the assembly of membrane-less organelles. Indeed, most GR/PR interactors are components of membrane-less organelles such as nucleoli, the nuclear pore complex and stress granules. Genetic analysis in Drosophila demonstrated the functional relevance of these interactions to DPR toxicity. Furthermore, we show that GR and PR altered phase separation of LCD-containing proteins, insinuating into their liquid assemblies and changing their material properties, resulting in perturbed dynamics and/or functions of multiple membrane-less organelles."

This suboptimal outcome is probably due in part to the complex network of immunosuppressive pathways present in advanced tumors, which are unlikely to be overcome by intervention at a single signaling checkpoint. Here we describe a combination immunotherapy that recruits a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells to eliminate large tumor burdens in syngeneic tumor models and a genetically engineered mouse model of melanoma; to our knowledge tumors of this size have not previously been curable by treatments relying on endogenous immunity. Maximal antitumor efficacy required four components: a tumor-antigen-targeting antibody, a recombinant interleukin-2 with an extended half-life, anti-PD-1 and a powerful T cell vaccine. Depletion experiments revealed that CD8+ T cells, cross-presenting dendritic cells and several other innate immune cell subsets were required for tumor regression. Effective treatment induced infiltration of immune cells and production of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor, enhanced antibody-mediated tumor antigen uptake and promoted antigen spreading. These results demonstrate the capacity of an elicited endogenous immune response to destroy large, established tumors and elucidate essential characteristics of combination immunotherapies that are capable of curing a majority of tumors in experimental settings typically viewed as intractable."
https://openalex.org/W2536398251,"Active neurons increase their energy supply by dilating nearby arterioles and capillaries. This neurovascular coupling underlies blood oxygen level-dependent functional imaging signals, but its mechanism is controversial. Canonically, neurons release glutamate to activate metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) on astrocytes, evoking Ca2+ release from internal stores, activating phospholipase A2 and generating vasodilatory arachidonic acid derivatives. However, adult astrocytes lack mGluR5, and knockout of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors that release Ca2+ from stores does not affect neurovascular coupling. We now show that buffering astrocyte Ca2+ inhibits neuronally evoked capillary dilation, that astrocyte [Ca2+]i is raised not by release from stores but by entry through ATP-gated channels, and that Ca2+ generates arachidonic acid via phospholipase D2 and diacylglycerol lipase rather than phospholipase A2. In contrast, dilation of arterioles depends on NMDA receptor activation and Ca2+-dependent NO generation by interneurons. These results reveal that different signaling cascades regulate cerebral blood flow at the capillary and arteriole levels."

The most prevalent form of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) involves expansion of the GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat located within the first intron of a gene designated C9orf72 (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011DeJesus-Hernandez M.

Unaffected individuals contain a modest number of the G4C2 repeats. Affected patients exhibit expansions to upward of 1,000 or more of the repeats. Various concepts have emerged concerning the molecular basis of disease pathophysiology, including impediments to expression of the C9orf72 gene itself (van Blitterswijk et al., 2015van Blitterswijk M.

Among the five poly-dipeptides encoded by the sense and anti-sense transcripts of the expanded repeat (GAn, GPn, GRn, PAn and PRn), two display significant toxicity—GRn and PRn (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I.

Missing to date are unbiased studies of the direct intracellular targets of GRn and PRn that may explain the toxicity of these poly-dipeptides. Here, we have used two complementary approaches to identify proteins bound by the PRn poly-dipeptide. Evidence is presented indicating binding of PRn to numerous proteins associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic puncta not surrounded by investing membranes, as well as nucleoli, nuclear pores, and intermediate filaments. Concordant data from Taylor and colleagues report a distribution of 514 PRn and GRn interacting proteins (Lee et al., 2016Lee K.-H. Zhang P. Mitrea D. Sarkar M. Freibaum B. Cika J. Coughlin M. Messing J. Molliex A. Maxwell B. et al.C9orf72 Dipeptide Repeats Impair the Assembly, Dynamics, and Function of Membrane-Less Organelles.Cell. 2016; 167 (this issue): 774-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, this issue), the identities of which overlap significantly with the PRn targets identified herein. These independent studies indicate that PRn toxicity may result from widespread impediments to cell organization and function. Common among PRn target proteins are low complexity (LC) domains shown herein to be both necessary and sufficient for PRn binding. In previous studies we have found that LC domains can polymerize into amyloid-like fibers (Kato et al., 2012Kato M. Han T.W. Xie S. Shi K. Du X. Wu L.C. Mirzaei H. Goldsmith E.J. Longgood J.

Cell-free formation of RNA granules: bound RNAs identify features and components of cellular assemblies.Cell. 2012; 149: 768-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). A key feature of LC-domain polymers is their lability to de-polymerization. Here, we have employed several independent assays giving evidence that PRn binding to its targets require that LC domains exist in a cross-β polymeric state. Most surprising among newly discovered targets of the toxic PRn poly-dipeptide are intermediate filament proteins. The PRn poly-dipeptide binds to polymeric forms of the LC domains located at the amino terminal ends of intermediate filament proteins. These and other data favor the possibility of direct interaction between RNA granules and intermediate filaments. Such observations may offer mechanistic insight into the manner in which RNA granules segregate to spatially restricted regions within eggs, embryos, or individual cells. A synthetic peptide consisting of 20 repeats of the PRn poly-dipeptide was modified to contain a benzophenone for photo-crosslinking, an alkyne moiety for the use of click chemistry, and an HA epitope (PR20BAH) for immunoprecipitation or western blotting (STAR Methods). This PR20BAH peptide readily enters cultured mammalian cells and displays toxicity indistinguishable from the PR20 peptide characterized in earlier studies (Figure S1) (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I. Xiang S. Kato M. Wu L. Theodoropoulos P. Wang T. Kim J. Yun J. Xie Y. McKnight S.L. Poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9orf72 repeats bind nucleoli, impede RNA biogenesis, and kill cells.Science. 2014; 345: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Cells treated with the PR20BAH peptide were exposed ± to UV light followed by lysis and click chemistry-mediated conjugation of the peptide to diazo-biotin. After acetone precipitation, the samples were resuspended in 7 M urea/4% SDS, mixed with streptavidin beads and recovered by centrifugation. Recovered materials were boiled in SDS sample buffer, resolved on denaturing SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized by silver staining (Figure 1A). Prominent silver-stained polypeptides were observed in samples exposed to both PR20BAH and ultraviolet light. Elimination of either peptide or UV light significantly diminished recovery of the majority of PR20-bound proteins.Figure 1Intracellular Targets of the PRn Poly-DipeptideShow full caption(A) Silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of HeLa cell proteins crosslinked to PR20BAH (STAR Methods).

Proteins recovered in this manner were extracted from SDS-PAGE gels, identified by shotgun mass spectrometry, and are listed in Table S1. Gene ontology analysis of the 1,240 proteins identified by mass spectrometry gave evidence of enrichment in proteins associated with cellular puncta not bound by investing membranes and intermediate filaments. Interaction of the PR20BAH probe with the former category of proteins, including RNA binding proteins and DEAD box RNA helicase enzymes, was anticipated from earlier studies (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I. Xiang S. Kato M. Wu L. Theodoropoulos P. Wang T. Kim J. Yun J. Xie Y. McKnight S.L. Poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9orf72 repeats bind nucleoli, impede RNA biogenesis, and kill cells.Science. 2014; 345: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). More surprising was apparent interaction of the probe with intermediate filament proteins. In addition to RNA binding proteins, RNA helicases and intermediate filaments, the PR20BAH probe cross-linked components of nuclear pores, nucleoli, and the nuclear lamina. As an alternative method of identifying PRn cellular targets, U2OS cells were programmed to conditionally express a PR100 poly-dipeptide containing three copies of a Flag epitope at its amino terminus (3xFlag:PR100). We further employed cryo-mill technology (Shi et al., 2015Shi Y. Pellarin R. Fridy P.C. Fernandez-Martinez J. Thompson M.K. Li Y. Wang Q.J. Sali A. Rout M.P. Chait B.T. A strategy for dissecting the architectures of native macromolecular assemblies.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Taylor et al., 2013Taylor M.S. LaCava J.

Following doxycycline-mediated induction of 3xFlag:PR100 expression, cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen and cellular materials were crushed and powdered in a cryo-mill (STAR Methods). Frozen powder was resuspended in a minimal amount of buffer, yielding extracts of roughly 100 mg/ml, and rapidly subjected to immunoprecipitation using beads appended with antibodies to the Flag epitope. PR100-dependent precipitation revealed multiple polypeptide bands not observed in the un-induced sample (Figure 1B). Proteins co-precipitating with the 3xFlag:PR100 polypeptide were excised from the gel and identified by shotgun mass spectrometry (Table S2). The top categories of the 177 PR100-bound proteins included RNA binding proteins, intermediate filament proteins, and DEAD box RNA helicase enzymes. The Venn diagram shown in Figure 1C compares proteins identified by both approaches. 72% of the 177 proteins co-precipitated with the 3xFlag:PR100 probe were also cross-linked to the PR20BAH probe (Table S3). The statistical probability of this level of overlap is exceedingly low (p = 7.2 × 10−103). Both categories of PRn-bound proteins were enriched for the inclusion of proteins containing low complexity (LC) domains. By use of a straightforward algorithm (SEG program) (Wootton, 1994Wootton J.C. Non-globular domains in protein sequences: automated segmentation using complexity measures.Comput. Chem. 1994; 18: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), the lists of proteins either cross-linked or co-precipitated by the PRn probes were inspected for species containing an LC domain of 50 or more amino acids. This algorithm can be deployed using amino acid windows variable in size. The 50 amino acid window we have employed is relatively stringent for the identification of LC domains and follows the recommendations articulated by others (Dyson and Wright, 2005Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Intrinsically unstructured proteins and their functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3023) Google Scholar). Compared with the human proteome, wherein LC domains are found in 10.3% of all proteins, 15.1% of PR20BAH cross-linked proteins contained LC domains, and 20.9% of 3xFlag:PR100-bound proteins contained LC domains. Of the 120 proteins found in both lists (Table S3), 21.7% contained LC domains. In summary, irrespective of method used, the PRn poly-dipeptide was found to interact preferentially with LC domain-containing proteins (Figure 1C). To more directly investigate polypeptide domains required for PRn interaction, three GFP:hnRNPA1 fusion proteins were prepared. One fusion protein linked GFP to the full-length hnRNPA1 protein, another linked GFP to the two RRM domains of hnRNPA1, and a third linked GFP to the C-terminal LC domain of hnRNPA1. Each fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, purified, and incubated with a synthetic peptide consisting of 20 PR dipeptide repeats linked to an HA epitope tag (PR20HA). Following incubation, the samples were immunoprecipitated with beads linked to antibodies to the HA epitope, eluted, electrophoresed on a denaturing SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized by Coomassie blue staining (Figure 1D). Clear evidence of PR20HA-mediated precipitation was observed for the GFP variant fused to either the intact hnRNPA1 polypeptide or the variant containing only the LC domain of hnRNPA1. By contrast, no precipitation was observed for the GFP fusion containing only the two, N-terminal RRM domains. These observations provide evidence for both the necessity and sufficiency of the LC domain of hnRNPA1 for interaction with the synthetic PR20HA poly-dipeptide. When incubated at neutral pH and physiologic ionic strength, the LC domains of numerous RNA binding proteins polymerize into labile, cross-β fibers. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid-like polymers may help organize intracellular structures not surrounded by investing membranes (Han et al., 2012Han T.W. Kato M. Xie S. Wu L.C. Mirzaei H. Pei J. Chen M. Xie Y. Allen J. Xiao G. McKnight S.L.

Knowing that targets of the toxic PRn poly-dipeptide are enriched for the inclusion of LC domains (Figures 1A–1C), and that LC domains are both necessary and sufficient for PRn binding (Figure 1D), the question arises as to whether PRn binding might require LC domains to exist in a cross-β polymeric state? Obvious utility might be found in the form of chemical agents capable of correlatively affecting labile cross-β polymers and intracellular puncta enriched in LC-bearing proteins. Aliphatic alcohols, including 1,6-hexanediol (1,6-HD), are known to melt nucleopores, RNA granules, polar granules, and certain other nuclear and cytoplasmic puncta not bound by investing membranes (Kroschwald et al., 2015Kroschwald S.

Knowing that these intracellular puncta are enriched in both PRn targets and LC sequences, we investigated the effects of four related aliphatic alcohols on LC domain polymers. In order to study the effects of aliphatic alcohols on labile, amyloid-like polymers formed from LC domains, we exposed mCherry:FUS hydrogel droplets to a series of aliphatic alcohols including 1,6-HD, 2,5-hexanediol (2,5-HD), 1,5-pentanediol (1,5-PD) and 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BD). As shown in Figure 2A, and the video accessible from Movie S1, mCherry:FUS hydrogel droplets were melted by 1,6-HD largely to the exclusion of the other three aliphatic alcohols. 1,5-PD required overnight incubation to melt mCherry:FUS hydrogel droplets, and no hydrogel melting was observed for either 2,5-HD or 1,4-BD. More quantitative assessment of polymer disassembly was conducted using light scattering assays. Fibrous, pre-gelation preparations of mCherry:FUS were monitored by light scattering as a function of exposure to the four aliphatic alcohols listed above. 1,6-HD attenuated light scattering in a concentration-dependent manner. mCherry:FUS polymers dissolved partially in a time-dependent manner when exposed to 5% 1,6-HD. More prominent melting was observed at 10% and 15% levels of 1,6-HD (Figure S2). Among the four aliphatic alcohols, little or no diminution in light scattering was observed for 2,5-HD or 1,4-BD (Figure 2B). Fiber melting was observed when mCherry:FUS polymers were exposed to 15% 1,5-PD, but to a lesser extent than the same concentration of 1,6-HD. In contrast to its ability to melt labile cross-β polymers formed from LC domains, 1,6-HD failed to affect the polymeric state of Aβ amyloid fibers (Figure 2C). The LC domains of RNA binding proteins participate in the formation of liquid-like droplets (Lin et al., 2015Lin Y. Protter D.S. Rosen M.K. Parker R.

This phenomenon of phase separation is believed to be reflective of the chemical forces involved in formation of intracellular puncta including RNA granules. Various lines of evidence have supported the hypothesis that cross-β polymerization of LC domains may participate in the formation of liquid-like droplets (Xiang et al., 2015Xiang S. Kato M. Wu L.C. Lin Y. Ding M. Zhang Y. Yu Y. McKnight S.L.

Two types of liquid-like droplets were used to test the effects of aliphatic alcohols on phase-separated protein samples. A fusion protein containing maltose binding protein (MBP) linked to the RNA binding domain of poly-pyrimidine track binding protein (PTB) and the LC sequence of hnRNPA2 was treated with TEV protease to remove the solubilizing MBP and simultaneously exposed to a synthetic RNA containing five PTB binding sites (STAR Methods). Liquid-like droplets began to appear within minutes after TEV protease cleavage and could be detected spectrophotometrically by light scattering or visualized by light microscopy. Samples of liquid-like droplets were exposed to four aliphatic alcohols at concentrations ranging from 0.5%–4%. As shown in Figure 2D, liquid-like droplets were melted most substantially by 1,6-HD, less so by 1,5-PD, and least by 2,5-HD or 1,4-BD. A similar pattern of effects was observed when the same four aliphatic alcohols were applied to liquid-like droplets formed by the LC domain of FUS. The LC domain of FUS became phase-separated into liquid-like droplets upon dilution of concentrated, urea solubilized protein into urea-free aqueous buffer (STAR Methods). Exposure of the FUS droplets to aliphatic alcohols resulted in melting as deduced by either light microscopy or light scattering. The rank order of droplet melting activity by the four aliphatic alcohols—1,6-HD > 1,5-PD > 2,5-HD = 1,4-BD—was the same for FUS liquid-like droplets as for melting of mCherry:FUS hydrogels (Figure 2A), mCherry:FUS pre-gelation polymers (Figure 2B), and hnRNPA2 liquid-like droplets (Figures 2C and 2D). Having observed a rank order of different aliphatic alcohols on the melting of hydrogels, cross-β polymers, and liquid-like droplets, we next tested the abilities of the four alcohols to melt various cellular structures. Cytoplasmic stress granules were visualized in cultured HeLa cells with antibodies to the TIA1 RNA binding protein, Cajal bodies were visualized with antibodies to coilin, and nuclear speckles were visualized with antibodies to the SC35 pre-mRNA splicing factor. Before fixation and immunoflourescent visualization of the various puncta, cells were exposed to either vehicle or 6%–8% levels of 1,6-HD, 2,5-HD, 1,5-PD, or 1,4-BD. Stress granules, Cajal bodies, and nuclear speckles were melted in response to 1,6-HD and 1,5-PD, but not 2,5-HD or 1,4-BD (Figure 3A). Similar studies were extended to visualize the effects of aliphatic alcohols on cytoskeletal structures including actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. None of the aliphatic alcohols were observed to perturb actin filaments or microtubules (Figure 3B). By contrast 1,6-HD and 1,5-PD markedly changed the cytoplasmic organization of both keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments. The prototypic network of intermediate filaments rapidly dispersed into hundreds of small puncta following brief exposure to 8% levels of either of the two aliphatic alcohols. No alterations in the intermediate filament networks of either keratin or vimentin were observed in cells treated with either 2,5-HD or 1,4-BD. Previous studies have shown that the PRn and GRn poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9orf72 repeat expansion bind to hydrogels composed of amyloid-like polymers of the LC domains of various RNA binding proteins (Kwon et al., 2014Kwon I.

However, it is still unknown whether Treg-mediated tolerance is antigen specific and how Treg specificity contributes to the selective loss of tolerance, as observed in human immunopathologies such as allergies. Here, we used antigen-reactive T cell enrichment to identify antigen-specific human Tregs. We demonstrate dominant Treg-mediated tolerance against particulate aeroallergens, such as pollen, house dust mites, and fungal spores. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of functional impairment of Treg responses in allergic donors. Rather, major allergenic proteins, known to rapidly dissociate from inhaled allergenic particles, have a generally reduced capability to generate Treg responses. Most strikingly, in individual allergic donors, Th2 cells and Tregs always target disparate proteins. Thus, our data highlight the importance of Treg antigen-specificity for tolerance in humans and identify antigen-specific escape from Treg control as an important mechanism enabling antigen-specific loss of tolerance in human allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2535017817,"Chromosomal rearrangements deregulating hematopoietic transcription factors are common in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we show that deregulation of the homeobox transcription factor gene DUX4 and the ETS transcription factor gene ERG is a hallmark of a subtype of B-progenitor ALL that comprises up to 7% of B-ALL. DUX4 rearrangement and overexpression was present in all cases and was accompanied by transcriptional deregulation of ERG, expression of a novel ERG isoform, ERGalt, and frequent ERG deletion. ERGalt uses a non-canonical first exon whose transcription was initiated by DUX4 binding. ERGalt retains the DNA-binding and transactivation domains of ERG, but it inhibits wild-type ERG transcriptional activity and is transforming. These results illustrate a unique paradigm of transcription factor deregulation in leukemia in which DUX4 deregulation results in loss of function of ERG, either by deletion or induced expression of an isoform that is a dominant-negative inhibitor of wild-type ERG function."

The PKD2 voltage-sensor domain retains two of four gating charges commonly found in those of voltage-gated ion channels. The PKD2 ion permeation pathway is constricted at the selectivity filter and near the cytoplasmic end of S6, suggesting that two gates regulate ion conduction. The extracellular domain of PKD2, a hotspot for ADPKD pathogenic mutations, contributes to channel assembly and strategically interacts with the transmembrane core, likely serving as a physical substrate for extracellular stimuli to allosterically gate the channel. Finally, our structure establishes the molecular basis for the majority of pathogenic mutations in Pkd2-related ADPKD."

Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin (Kornberg and Lorch, 1999Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Twenty-five years of the nucleosome, fundamental particle of the eukaryote chromosome.Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). The precise positioning and unique composition of nucleosomes at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) regulate gene expression (Jiang and Pugh, 2009bJiang C. Pugh B.F. Nucleosome positioning and gene regulation: advances through genomics.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Immediately upstream of these +1 nucleosomes, relative to the direction of transcription, often resides a nucleosome-free promoter region (NFR). Downstream, genic nucleosomes align to the +1 nucleosome with regular spacing to form arrays. In metazoans, the TSS of active genes resides ∼30–50 bp upstream of the +1 nucleosome edge (Schones et al., 2008Schones D.E. Cui K. Cuddapah S. Roh T.Y. Barski A. Wang Z. Wei G. Zhao K. Dynamic regulation of nucleosome positioning in the human genome.Cell. 2008; 132: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), whereas, in single-celled organisms like yeast, the TSS resides just inside the nucleosome border (Tsankov et al., 2010Tsankov A.M.

Dysregulation of chromatin is common in cancer cells (Wang et al., 2007Wang G.G. Allis C.D. Chi P. Chromatin remodeling and cancer, Part II: ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and understanding the processes (i.e., a “parts list” and instructions) by which nucleosomes become organized into chromatin may provide insights into oncogenic mis-regulation of genes. As with all massive cellular structures, a reasonable assumption is that proper nucleosome positioning across entire genomes arises from inordinately complex cellular processes. Indeed, no successful attempt has been made to reconstitute physiological nucleosome positions on a genomic scale with pure proteins. Nonetheless, many cellular structures and processes, like ribosomes, metabolic pathways, or DNA replication, are able to self-organize from their constituents thus making their in vitro reconstitution possible. This allows individual assembly stages to be dissected, defined, and the role of individual factors deciphered.

Critically, however, direct versus indirect roles are not readily apparent due to the ever-present complex milieu of cellular proteins and cannot identify the minimal set of components and core mechanisms that directly establish the primary structure of chromatin. Here, we take a biochemical approach toward reconstituting and understanding the basic pattern of physiological nucleosome positioning, simultaneously at >4,000 genes from budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), using purified proteins. Importantly, our findings are validated by recapitulation of known in vivo effects involving mutants, but we go beyond in vivo approaches as we demonstrate which remodeler contributions are direct, sufficient, and specific. We consolidate our observations into four biochemically identifiable architectural building stages regarding nucleosome organization at the 5′ ends of genes and identify the minimal sets of factors required to achieve each stage: (1) NFR formation, (2) +1 positioning, (3) downstream array alignment, and (4) physiological spacing. This provides a base framework by which the primary structure of chromatin self-organizes through the interplay of DNA sequence, histones, organizing factors, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, upon which other processes like transcription may work. The success of in vitro reconstitution critically hinges on how closely the result matches its in vivo counterpart. A variety of metrics describes the extent to which reconstituted nucleosome organization across a genome coincides with the in vivo positions. These include NFR width and depth, nucleosome dyad location and fuzziness, and distance between adjacent nucleosomes (spacing). This, coupled to the combinatorial reconstitution with up to six factors (including remodelers and nucleosome organizing factors [called general regulatory factors or GRFs]; Fourel et al., 2002Fourel G. Miyake T. Defossez P.A. Li R. Gilson E. General regulatory factors (GRFs) as genome partitioners.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41736-41743Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), presents a multi-dimensional graphical challenge wherein a separate representation of each of these metric risks losing contextual relationships with other linked metrics. Therefore, our analysis was conducted with three levels of abstraction: (1) heat maps of individual genes aligned by a native feature whose reconstitution was being examined and sorted by the relevant metric in the reference situation (e.g., intrinsic positioning by salt gradient dialysis), thereby preserving contextual relationships of metrics but being less quantitative; (2) an averaged profile, which provides a simpler more quantitative view, while preserving some context; and (3) a quantitative assessment of individual metrics (Tables S1 and S2), but lacking in context, and so must be interpreted with caution. During salt gradient dialysis (SGD) of purified histones and genomic DNA, nucleosomes will assemble across genes at intrinsically preferred positions. Some will be positioned at their proper physiological locations, but most will not (graphs 1 versus 2 in Figure 1A showing individual genes, Figure 1B showing gene averages, Figure 1C and Table S1 showing quantitated positions relative to Native, and Table S2 showing +1 nucleosome positioning strength that is the reciprocal of fuzziness) (Kaplan et al., 2009Kaplan N.

A packing mechanism for nucleosome organization reconstituted across a eukaryotic genome.Science. 2011; 332: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Less assembly occurs within promoters, which partially mimics the NFRs seen in vivo. As previously demonstrated (Zhang et al., 2011Zhang Z. Wippo C.J. Wal M. Ward E. Korber P. Pugh B.F. A packing mechanism for nucleosome organization reconstituted across a eukaryotic genome.Science. 2011; 332: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), addition of ATP and a crude whole-cell extract having essentially a complex and undefined mixture of proteins, reconstitutes on a genomic scale the basic pattern of canonically positioned NFRs, +1 nucleosomes, and arrays mainly downstream of +1 (Figures 1A and 1B, graph 3). The +1 position was reconstituted to within 5 bp of the native position for essentially all (N = 4,118) measured genes (Figure 1C) and with high precision (i.e., positioning strength at least as well as seen for Native, Table S2). However, there was some imprecision in the downstream arrays. To gain confidence that proper chromatin organization could be reconstituted on a genome-wide scale with purified histones, DNA, and individual active chromatin remodelers (Figure S1; Table S3), we first performed reconstitutions in extracts from isw1Δ isw2Δ chd1Δ cells missing a large number of remodeler ATPases, i.e., they lacked four (ISW1a, ISW1b, ISW2, and Chd1) of the major chromatin-remodeling complexes in yeast (Flaus et al., 2006Flaus A. Martin D.M. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. Identification of multiple distinct Snf2 subfamilies with conserved structural motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2887-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We then added back purified remodelers. Inasmuch as different remodelers have distinct remodeling activities (Bartholomew, 2014Bartholomew B. Regulating the chromatin landscape: structural and mechanistic perspectives.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 671-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), the relative amounts added were based on ATPase activity units, which all remodelers have in common. Similar to the respective in vivo phenotype (Gkikopoulos et al., 2011Gkikopoulos T. Schofield P. Singh V. Pinskaya M. Mellor J. Smolle M. Workman J.L. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. A role for Snf2-related nucleosome-spacing enzymes in genome-wide nucleosome organization.Science. 2011; 333: 1758-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, Ocampo et al., 2016Ocampo J.

The ISW1 and CHD1 ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers compete to set nucleosome spacing in vivo.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 4625-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this mutant extract failed to form well-aligned arrays (Figures 1A and 1B, graphs 3 versus 4), although NFRs and +1 nucleosomes were largely reconstituted but with somewhat less accuracy (peak position, Figure 1C; Table S1) and precision (positioning strength, Table S2). Thus, formation of the NFR and +1 nucleosome is biochemically separable from array formation/alignment and the former can be achieved in extracts without ISW1/2/Chd1 remodelers. Importantly, adding back purified ISW2 improved the accuracy and precision of +1 reconstitution (Figures 1A–1C, graphs 4 versus 9a, and S2A, graphs 4 versus 9a, b; Tables S1 and S2). ISW1a also had an effect (Figures 1A–1C, graphs 8a, and S2A, graphs 8a, b) but to a lesser extent (based on relative +1 peak height in Figures 1B and S2A and positioning strength in Table S2). Additionally, more regularly spaced nucleosomes were aligned just downstream of the +1 nucleosome, akin to wild-type extracts (Figures 1A and 1B, graphs 8a versus 3, and S2A, graphs 8a, b). Strikingly, each remodeler generated a different, characteristic inter-nucleosomal repeat length: equivalent to Native (∼170 bp) for ISW1a, but up to 30 bp longer for ISW2 (Table S1), which is approximately the lower limit of what ISW2 requires for sliding nucleosomes and is consistent with previous observations (Kagalwala et al., 2004Kagalwala M.N.

Biol. 2003; 23: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). When ISW1a was added together with ISW2 or other remodelers, ISW1a dominated in a concentration-dependent manner, thereby creating more properly spaced nucleosomes to the extent seen with ISW1a added alone (Figures 1A and 1B, graph 10a, S2A, graphs 10a, b, S2B, graphs 10c–g, and S2C, graphs 11-13). The dominance of ISW1a may be explained by its utilization of shorter linkers compared to ISW2 (Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007aGangaraju V.K. Bartholomew B.

That ISW1a generated tighter spacing than ISW2 from the same batch of chromatin is consistent with the “clamping activity” of ISWI type remodelers (Lieleg et al., 2015Lieleg C. Ketterer P. Nuebler J. Ludwigsen J. Gerland U. Dietz H. Mueller-Planitz F. Korber P. Nucleosome spacing generated by ISWI and CHD1 remodelers is constant regardless of nucleosome density.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 1588-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (i.e., these remodelers set a certain constant linker length independent of nucleosome density rather than equalize linker lengths according to nucleosome density). Addition of purified RSC (that presumably was not depleted in the isw1Δ isw2Δ chd1Δ extract), Chd1 or ISW1b, did not reconstitute aligned arrays (Figures 1A and 1B, graphs 4 versus 5–7), despite these remodelers being active (Figures S1B and S1C). This is consistent with RSC and ISW1b having nonexistent or weak nucleosome spacing activity in vitro (Gangaraju and Bartholomew, 2007aGangaraju V.K. Bartholomew B.

We conclude that in vivo-like basic nucleosome organization can be reconstituted across much of the 5′ ends of yeast genes using purified remodelers in the context of a deficient crude extract. Remarkably, the distinct genome-wide nucleosome organizing activities in building NFR/+1/array patterns become evident for ISW1a and ISW2. We next moved to reconstitutions with purified components only. First, we examined the impact of individual purified remodelers on intrinsic genome-wide nucleosome organization in the absence of crude extracts. With the notable exception of INO80, which we address further below, none of the remodelers created +1 nucleosomes or even +1 aligned arrays on their own (Figure 2A, graphs 4–9). However, all remodelers widened the intrinsically weak NFR, with RSC generating NFRs of at least physiological average widths (Figures 2B and S3A). Surprisingly, this was not accompanied by canonical −1/+1 nucleosome positioning, which defines NFR widths (Figure 2A, graph 5; Table S2). Thus, RSC on its own clears nucleosomes out of the NFR without the accuracy expected of canonical −1/+1 nucleosome positioning. This indicates that NFR clearance is biochemically distinct from canonical −1/+1 nucleosome positioning and array generation/alignment.Figure S3Symmetric NFR Widening by Purified Remodelers, Reconstitution over Rsc3 Motifs, and Orientation of GRF Sites, Poly(dT), and Poly(dA) Tracts, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Same as Figure 2C left, but for one replicate with each indicated remodeler.

How does RSC on its own specifically target promoters (Lorch et al., 2011Lorch Y. Griesenbeck J. Boeger H. Maier-Davis B. Kornberg R.D.

The Rsc3/30 subunits of the RSC complex may impart sequence-specific DNA binding (Badis et al., 2008Badis G. Chan E.T. van Bakel H. Pena-Castillo L. Tillo D. Tsui K. Carlson C.D. Gossett A.J.

Another possibility is that poly(dA:dT) tracts present in promoters partially destabilize nucleosomes, directly or indirectly, as has been widely demonstrated in vivo (Hartley and Madhani, 2009Hartley P.D.

Intrinsic histone-DNA interactions are not the major determinant of nucleosome positions in vivo.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). RSC might sample all nucleosomes but more effectively remove promoter nucleosomes because they are intrinsically unstable. Alternatively, nucleosome instability might play a minimal role in NFR formation in vivo, but instead poly(dA:dT) might directly activate RSC to displace nucleosomes (Kubik et al., 2015Kubik S. Bruzzone M.J. Jacquet P. Falcone J.L. Rougemont J. Shore D. Nucleosome stability distinguishes two different promoter types at all protein-coding genes in yeast.Mol.

Role of DNA sequence in chromatin remodeling and the formation of nucleosome-free regions.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2492-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because RSC translocates along one DNA strand in the 3′-5′ direction (Saha et al., 2005Saha A. Wittmeyer J. Cairns B.R. Chromatin remodeling through directional DNA translocation from an internal nucleosomal site.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), poly(dA) or poly(dT) on one strand could represent distinct directional signals for nucleosome removal by RSC. This concept has not been previously considered for RSC but could be tested now in the context of our data. Indeed, RSC led to greater nucleosome displacement (i.e., sliding or eviction) 5′ of poly(dA) compared to its 3′ side (and vice versa for poly(dT)) by ∼30 bp (Figure 2C). Asymmetric NFR widening did not occur with other remodelers, and only to a much lesser degree with SWI/SNF, which is highly related to RSC (Flaus et al., 2006Flaus A. Martin D.M. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. Identification of multiple distinct Snf2 subfamilies with conserved structural motifs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2887-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A). This suggests a mechanism whereby RSC, but not other remodelers, translates poly(dA:dT) orientation into directional displacement of nucleosomes (Figure 2D). Consequently, the canonical or average location of poly(dT) would be ∼30 bp upstream of poly(dA) when genes are aligned at their +1 nucleosomes (Figures 2A, graph 2, and S3C), as has been observed in vivo but has not been previously linked to directional action of RSC (de Boer and Hughes, 2014de Boer C.G.

Memory contextualization is fundamental for the selection of appropriate behavioral reactions needed for survival, yet the underlying neuronal circuits are poorly understood. By combining trans-synaptic viral tracing and optogenetic manipulation, we found that the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and the amygdala, two key brain structures encoding context and emotional experiences, interact via multiple parallel pathways. A projection from the vHC to the basal amygdala mediates fear behavior elicited by a conditioned context, whereas a parallel projection from a distinct subset of vHC neurons onto midbrain-projecting neurons in the central amygdala is necessary for context-dependent retrieval of cued fear memories. Our findings demonstrate that two fundamentally distinct roles of context in fear memory retrieval are processed by distinct vHC output pathways, thereby allowing for the formation of robust contextual fear memories while preserving context-dependent behavioral flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2537719889,"Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that exchange contents and undergo remodelling during cyclic fusion and fission. Genetic mutations in MFN2 (the gene encoding mitofusin 2) interrupt mitochondrial fusion and cause the untreatable neurodegenerative condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). It has not yet been possible to directly modulate mitochondrial fusion, in part because the structural basis of mitofusin function is not completely understood. Here we show that mitofusins adopt either a fusion-constrained or a fusion-permissive molecular conformation, directed by specific intramolecular binding interactions, and demonstrate that mitofusin-dependent mitochondrial fusion can be regulated in mouse cells by targeting these conformational transitions. On the basis of this model, we engineered a cell-permeant minipeptide to destabilize the fusion-constrained conformation of mitofusin and promote the fusion-permissive conformation, reversing mitochondrial abnormalities in cultured fibroblasts and neurons that harbour CMT2A-associated genetic defects. The relationship between the conformational plasticity of mitofusin 2 and mitochondrial dynamism reveals a central mechanism that regulates mitochondrial fusion, the manipulation of which can correct mitochondrial pathology triggered by defective or imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2532024005,"Stabilization of mutant p53 (mutp53) in tumours greatly contributes to malignant progression. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic approaches to destabilize mutp53. Here, through high-throughput screening we identify statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, as degradation inducers for conformational or misfolded p53 mutants with minimal effects on wild-type p53 (wtp53) and DNA contact mutants. Statins preferentially suppress mutp53-expressing cancer cell growth. Specific reduction of mevalonate-5-phosphate by statins or mevalonate kinase knockdown induces CHIP ubiquitin ligase-mediated nuclear export, ubiquitylation, and degradation of mutp53 by impairing interaction of mutp53 with DNAJA1, a Hsp40 family member. Knockdown of DNAJA1 also induces CHIP-mediated mutp53 degradation, while its overexpression antagonizes statin-induced mutp53 degradation. Our study reveals that DNAJA1 controls the fate of misfolded mutp53, provides insights into potential strategies to deplete mutp53 through the mevalonate pathway–DNAJA1 axis, and highlights the significance of p53 status in impacting statins’ efficacy on cancer therapy. Iwakuma and colleagues report that statins, through their action on the mevalonate pathway, lead to the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of misfolded mutant p53 by impairing its interaction with the Hsp40 family member, DNAJA1."
https://openalex.org/W2538282264,"Most migrating cells extrude their front by the force of actin polymerization. Polymerization requires an initial nucleation step, which is mediated by factors establishing either parallel filaments in the case of filopodia or branched filaments that form the branched lamellipodial network. Branches are considered essential for regular cell motility and are initiated by the Arp2/3 complex, which in turn is activated by nucleation-promoting factors of the WASP and WAVE families. Here we employed rapid amoeboid crawling leukocytes and found that deletion of the WAVE complex eliminated actin branching and thus lamellipodia formation. The cells were left with parallel filaments at the leading edge, which translated, depending on the differentiation status of the cell, into a unipolar pointed cell shape or cells with multiple filopodia. Remarkably, unipolar cells migrated with increased speed and enormous directional persistence, while they were unable to turn towards chemotactic gradients. Cells with multiple filopodia retained chemotactic activity but their migration was progressively impaired with increasing geometrical complexity of the extracellular environment. These findings establish that diversified leading edge protrusions serve as explorative structures while they slow down actual locomotion."

No targeted therapy is available against this subtype of cancer owing to a lack of validated molecular targets. We previously reported that signaling involving MYC-an essential, pleiotropic transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes-is disproportionally higher in triple-negative (TN) tumors than in receptor-positive (RP) tumors. Direct inhibition of the oncogenic transcriptional activity of MYC has been challenging to achieve. Here, by conducting a shRNA screen targeting the kinome, we identified PIM1, a non-essential serine-threonine kinase, in a synthetic lethal interaction with MYC. PIM1 expression was higher in TN tumors than in RP tumors and was associated with poor prognosis in patients with hormone- and HER2-negative tumors. Small-molecule PIM kinase inhibitors halted the growth of human TN tumors with elevated MYC expression in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) and MYC-driven transgenic mouse models of breast cancer by inhibiting the oncogenic transcriptional activity of MYC and restoring the function of the endogenous cell cycle inhibitor, p27. Our findings warrant clinical evaluation of PIM kinase inhibitors in patients with TN tumors that have elevated MYC expression."
https://openalex.org/W2535463226,"Recognition of histone covalent modifications by 'reader' modules constitutes a major mechanism for epigenetic regulation. A recent upsurge of newly discovered histone lysine acylations, such as crotonylation (Kcr), butyrylation (Kbu), and propionylation (Kpr), greatly expands the coding potential of histone lysine modifications. Here we demonstrate that the histone acetylation-binding double PHD finger (DPF) domains of human MOZ (also known as KAT6A) and DPF2 (also known as BAF45d) accommodate a wide range of histone lysine acylations with the strongest preference for Kcr. Crystal structures of the DPF domain of MOZ in complex with H3K14cr, H3K14bu, and H3K14pr peptides reveal that these non-acetyl acylations are anchored in a hydrophobic 'dead-end' pocket with selectivity for crotonylation arising from intimate encapsulation and an amide-sensing hydrogen bonding network. Immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that MOZ and H3K14cr colocalize in a DPF-dependent manner. Our studies call attention to a new regulatory mechanism centered on histone crotonylation readout by DPF family members."
https://openalex.org/W2532913608,"A functional crosstalk between epigenetic regulators and metabolic control could provide a mechanism to adapt cellular responses to environmental cues.

MOF regulates oxidative phosphorylation by controlling expression of respiratory genes from both nuclear and mtDNA in aerobically respiring cells. MOF binds mtDNA, and this binding is dependent on KANSL3. The mitochondrial pool of MOF, but not a catalytically deficient mutant, rescues respiratory and mtDNA transcriptional defects triggered by the absence of MOF. Mof conditional knockout has catastrophic consequences for tissues with high-energy consumption, triggering hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure in murine hearts; cardiomyocytes show severe mitochondrial degeneration and deregulation of mitochondrial nutrient metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Thus, MOF is a dual-transcriptional regulator of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes connecting epigenetics and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2536561555,"The functional rules for microRNA (miRNA) targeting remain controversial despite their biological importance because only a small fraction of distinct interactions, called site types, have been examined among an astronomical number of site types that can occur between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. To systematically discover functional site types and to evaluate the contradicting rules reported previously, we used large-scale transcriptome data and statistically examined whether each of approximately 2 billion site types is enriched in differentially downregulated mRNAs responding to overexpressed miRNAs. Accordingly, we identified seven non-canonical functional site types, most of which are novel, in addition to four canonical site types, while also removing numerous false positives reported by previous studies. Extensive experimental validation and significantly elevated 3' UTR sequence conservation indicate that these non-canonical site types may have biologically relevant roles. Our expanded catalog of functional site types suggests that the gene regulatory network controlled by miRNAs may be far more complex than currently understood."
https://openalex.org/W2534491056,"Targeting the acetyllysine ‘reader’ activity of BET family transcriptional coactivators has emerged as an anticancer modality. A new class of dimeric JQ1 derivatives displays enhanced potency for bivalent targeting of tandem bromodomains in BET proteins. Cellular signaling is often propagated by multivalent interactions. Multivalency creates avidity, allowing stable biophysical recognition. Multivalency is an attractive strategy for achieving potent binding to protein targets, as the affinity of bivalent ligands is often greater than the sum of monovalent affinities. The bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family of transcriptional coactivators features tandem bromodomains through which BET proteins bind acetylated histones and transcription factors. All reported antagonists of the BET protein BRD4 bind in a monovalent fashion. Here we describe, to our knowledge for the first time, a bivalent BET bromodomain inhibitor—MT1—which has unprecedented potency. Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest MT1 is an intramolecular bivalent BRD4 binder that is more than 100-fold more potent, in cellular assays, than the corresponding monovalent antagonist, JQ1. MT1 significantly (P < 0.05) delayed leukemia progression in mice, as compared to JQ1. These data qualify a powerful chemical probe for BET bromodomains and a rationale for further development of multidomain inhibitors of epigenetic reader proteins."

Here we describe the discovery and characterization of probe compound biBET, capable of engaging both bromodomains simultaneously in a bivalent, in cis binding mode. The evidence provided here was obtained in a variety of biophysical and cellular experiments. The bivalent binding results in very high cellular potency for BRD4 binding and pharmacological responses such as disruption of BRD4-mediator complex subunit 1 foci with an EC50 of 100 pM. These compounds will be of considerable utility as BET/BRD4 chemical probes.

https://openalex.org/W2537254995,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic properties of metformin, a first-line drug for type 2 diabetes, remain elusive. Here we report that metformin induces genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation by modulating the activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). Exposing cancer cells to metformin leads to hypermethylation of tumor-promoting pathway genes and concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation. Metformin acts by upregulating microRNA let-7 through AMPK activation, leading to degradation of H19 long noncoding RNA, which normally binds to and inactivates SAHH. H19 knockdown activates SAHH, enabling DNA methyltransferase 3B to methylate a subset of genes. This metformin-induced H19 repression and alteration of gene methylation are recapitulated in endometrial cancer tissue samples obtained from patients treated with antidiabetic doses of metformin. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism of action for the drug metformin with implications for the molecular basis of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer. This novel mechanism of action also may be occurring in normal cells."

On the basis of multidimensional and comprehensive molecular characterization (including DNA methylation and copy, and RNA and protein expression), 1023 NSCLC cases—519 from TCGA adenocarcinoma (AD) project and 504 from TCGA squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) project—were classified using a 'cluster-of-clusters' analytic approach. Patterns from TCGA NSCLC subsets were examined in independent external databases, including the PROSPECT (Profiling of Resistance patterns and Oncogenic Signaling Pathways in Evaluation of Cancers of the Thorax) NSCLC data set. Nine genomic subtypes of NSCLC were identified, three within SQCC and six within AD. SQCC subtypes were associated with transcriptional targets of SOX2 or p63. One predominately AD subtype (with a large proportion of SQCC) shared molecular features with neuroendocrine tumors. Two AD subtypes manifested a CpG island methylator phenotype. Three AD subtypes showed high p38 and mTOR pathway activation. AD subtypes associated with low differentiation showed relatively worse prognosis. SQCC subtypes and two of the AD subtypes expressed cancer testis antigen genes, whereas three AD subtypes expressed several immune checkpoint genes including PDL1 and PDL2, corresponding with patterns of greater immune cell infiltration. Subtype associations for several immune-related markers—including PD1, PDL1, CD3 and CD8—were confirmed in the PROSPECT cohort using immunohistochemistry. NSCLC molecular subtypes have therapeutic implications and lend support to a personalized approach to NSCLC management based on molecular characterization."

Anecdotally, digressions from a moral code are often described as a series of small breaches that grow over time. Here we provide empirical evidence for a gradual escalation of self-serving dishonesty and reveal a neural mechanism supporting it. Behaviorally, we show that the extent to which participants engage in self-serving dishonesty increases with repetition. Using functional MRI, we show that signal reduction in the amygdala is sensitive to the history of dishonest behavior, consistent with adaptation. Critically, the extent of reduced amygdala sensitivity to dishonesty on a present decision relative to the previous one predicts the magnitude of escalation of self-serving dishonesty on the next decision. The findings uncover a biological mechanism that supports a 'slippery slope': what begins as small acts of dishonesty can escalate into larger transgressions."

Although the 7S dodecamer is stabilized by covalent cross-linking, the molecular mechanism by which such cross-links are formed has not been revealed. Here, we aimed to identify the enzyme(s) that cross-links the 7S dodecamer and characterize its expression in the kidney glomerulus. Pharmacological inhibition of candidate extracellular matrix enzymes revealed that lysyl oxidase activity is required for cross-linking of 7S polypeptides. Among all lysyl oxidase family members, lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) was identified as the isoform cross-linking collagen IV in mouse embryonal PFHR-9 cells. Biochemical analyses revealed that LOXL2 readily promoted the formation of lysyl-derived cross-links in the 7S dodecamer but not in the NC1 domain. We also established that LOXL2 is the main lysyl oxidase family member present in the glomerular extracellular matrix. Altogether, we demonstrate that LOXL2 is a novel component of the molecular machinery that forms cross-linked collagen IV networks, which are essential for glomerular basement membrane stability and molecular ultrafiltration function."
https://openalex.org/W2537374939,"Myoferlin is a multiple C2-domain-containing protein that regulates membrane repair, tyrosine kinase receptor function and endocytosis in myoblasts and endothelial cells. Recently it has been reported as overexpressed in several cancers and shown to contribute to proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. We have previously demonstrated that myoferlin regulates epidermal growth factor receptor activity in breast cancer. In the current study, we report a consistent overexpression of myoferlin in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) over cells originating from other breast cancer subtypes. Using a combination of proteomics, metabolomics and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that myoferlin depletion results in marked alteration of endosomal system and metabolism. Mechanistically, myoferlin depletion caused impaired vesicle traffic that led to a misbalance of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids. This provoked mitochondrial dysfunction in TNBC cells. As a consequence of the major metabolic stress, TNBC cells rapidly triggered AMP activated protein kinase-mediated metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis. This reduced their ability to balance between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, rendering TNBC cells metabolically inflexible, and more sensitive to metabolic drug targeting in vitro. In line with this, our in vivo findings demonstrated a significantly reduced capacity of myoferlin-deficient TNBC cells to metastasise to lungs. The significance of this observation was further supported by clinical data, showing that TNBC patients whose tumors overexpress myoferlin have worst distant metastasis-free and overall survivals. This novel insight into myoferlin function establishes an important link between vesicle traffic, cancer metabolism and progression, offering new diagnostic and therapeutic concepts to develop treatments for TNBC patients."

In this work, we showed enrichment of CD133 in Group 3 MB is associated with increased rate of metastasis and poor clinical outcome. The signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway are selectively activated in CD133+ MBSCs and promote tumorigenesis through regulation of c-MYC, a key genetic driver of Group 3 MB. We screened compound libraries for STAT3 inhibitors and treatment with the selected STAT3 inhibitors resulted in tumor size reduction in vivo.

Because ES prevention is problematic, intervention is needed, yet the mechanisms that underlie ES remain largely unknown. So far, the role of early nutrition in brain programming has been largely ignored. Here, we demonstrate that essential 1-carbon metabolism-associated micronutrients (1-CMAMs; i.e., methionine and B vitamins) early in life are crucial in programming later cognition by ES. ES was induced in male C57Bl/6 mice from postnatal d (P)2–9. 1-CMAM levels were measured centrally and peripherally by using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Next, we supplemented the maternal diet with 1-CMAM only during the ES period and studied cognitive, neuroendocrine, neurogenic, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes in adult offspring. We demonstrate that ES specifically reduces methionine in offspring plasma and brain. Of note, dietary 1-CMAM enrichment during P2–9 restored methionine levels and rescued ES-induced adult cognitive impairments. Beneficial effects of this early dietary enrichment were associated with prevention of the ES-induced rise in corticosterone and adrenal gland hypertrophy did not involve changes in maternal care, hippocampal volume, neurogenesis, or global/Nr3c1-specific DNA methylation. In summary, nutrition is important in brain programming by ES. A short, early supplementation with essential micronutrients can already prevent lasting effects of ES.

They apply PSAP to cohorts of undiagnosed disease exomes and identify candidate disease variants for future study. Standard techniques from genetic epidemiology are ill-suited to formally assess the significance of variants identified from a single case. We developed a statistical inference framework for identifying unusual functional variation from a single exome or genome, what we refer to as the 'n-of-one' problem. Using this approach we assessed our ability to identify the causal genotypes in over 5 million simulated cases of Mendelian disease, identifying 39% of disease genotypes as the most damaging unit in a typical exome background. We applied our approach to 129 n-of-one families from the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, nominating 60% of 30 disease genes determined to be diagnostic by a standard clinical workup. Our method can currently produce well-calibrated P values when applied to single genomes, can facilitate integration of multiple data types for n-of-one analyses, and, with further work, could become a widely used epidemiological method like linkage analysis or genome-wide association analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2536308486,"Deletion or mutation of the gene encoding the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD is a common genomic aberration in multiple myeloma (MM). However, the functional consequence of CYLD loss and the mechanism underlying its putative role as a tumor suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of MM has not been established. Here, we show that CYLD expression is highly variable in myeloma cell lines and primary MMs and that low CYLD expression is associated with disease progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM, and with poor overall and progression free-survival of MM patients. Functional assays revealed that CYLD represses MM cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, CYLD acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and loss of CYLD sensitizes MM cells to NF-κB-stimuli and Wnt ligands. Interestingly, in primary MMs, low CYLD expression strongly correlated with a proliferative and Wnt signaling-gene expression signature, but not with an NFκB target gene signature. Altogether, our findings identify CYLD as a negative regulator of NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in MM and indicate that loss of CYLD enhances MM aggressiveness through Wnt pathway activation. Thus, targeting the Wnt pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy in MM with loss of CYLD activity."

Mechanisms of neurotransmitter transport within and around synapses govern the temporal characteristics and intensity of neural transmission (Amara and Kuhar, 1993Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J.

For several neurotransmitters, cellular reuptake following activity-dependent release is one of the most important determinants of signaling dynamics. Modulation of neurotransmitter reuptake therefore contributes to tuning neural network activity across the central nervous system (Castrén, 2005Castrén E. Is mood chemistry?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Potent addictive drugs such as cocaine act by inhibiting neurotransmitter reuptake transporters (Sulzer, 2011Sulzer D.

A particularly well-known example is the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of depression (Vaswani et al., 2003Vaswani M. Linda F.K. Ramesh S.

SSRIs competitively inhibit the serotonin transporter (SERT) and exert widespread effects ranging from reduction of pain and stress (Gorman and Kent, 1999Gorman J.M. Kent J.M.

Experimental analysis of neurotransmitter kinetics in vivo is critical to understanding how these processes influence neural function on a regional or global level. Efforts to characterize neurotransmitter reuptake and redistribution patterns could also facilitate better understanding of neuropharmacological therapies (Kirsch et al., 2002Kirsch I. Moore T.J.

Real-time measurements of serotonin (5HT), dopamine, and norepinephrine clearance in laboratory animals have been performed using chronamperometry and voltammetry (Bucher and Wightman, 2015Bucher E.S.

Because these measurements sample only discrete points in the brain, however, they are ill suited to large-scale mapping of kinetic parameters. Radioligand imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) do provide spatially comprehensive information about tracer distribution, and have been used to measure SERT in vivo (Huang et al., 2010Huang Y. Zheng M.Q. Gerdes J.M. Development of effective PET and SPECT imaging agents for the serotonin transporter: has a twenty-year journey reached its destination?.Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2010; 10: 1499-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). With competition-based strategies, slowly varying neurotransmitter concentrations can sometimes be estimated (Laruelle, 2000Laruelle M.

We previously introduced a family of imaging agents that enables mapping of extracellular neurotransmitter release using molecular-level fMRI (Brustad et al., 2012Brustad E.M. Lelyveld V.S. Snow C.D.

Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The imaging probes are paramagnetic proteins that brighten T1-weighted images in the absence, but not the presence, of bound monoamines, providing a means for quantifying concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Although the sensors must be invasively injected into the brain, their application in conjunction with MRI in animals permits molecular measurements over relatively large fields of view, with voxel volumes on the order of 0.1 μL and temporal resolution of seconds (Lee et al., 2014Lee T. Cai L.X. Lelyveld V.S. Hai A. Jasanoff A. Molecular-level functional magnetic resonance imaging of dopaminergic signaling.Science. 2014; 344: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For sensitivity reasons, our earlier in vivo studies were performed in the presence of neurotransmitter reuptake blockers, meaning that native monoamine reuptake rates could not be reliably inferred from the imaging measurements. We speculated, however, that a different experimental strategy based on coinfusion of a sensor and its analyte could enable measurements of reuptake even for neurotransmitters like serotonin that rarely reach concentrations detectable by previous methods. Here we put this idea to the test using a monoamine sensor called BM3h-2G9C6 (2G9C6), which displays a 0.7 μM dissociation constant for serotonin with more than 200-fold specificity compared with dopamine and norepinephrine (Brustad et al., 2012Brustad E.M. Lelyveld V.S. Snow C.D. Crook N. Jung S.T. Martinez F.M. Scholl T.J. Jasanoff A. Arnold F.H. Structure-guided directed evolution of highly selective p450-based magnetic resonance imaging sensors for dopamine and serotonin.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 422: 245-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that molecular imaging with this probe, in conjunction with compartmental modeling, enables three-dimensional mapping of serotonin transport in rat brains by fMRI. The method provides spatially resolved estimates of serotonin removal rates and their perturbation by monoamine transporter blockers, constituting a potentially powerful tool for in vivo analysis of neurochemistry and drug mechanisms. The MRI sensor 2G9C6 is an engineered mutant of the 53 kD bacterial cytochrome heme domain P450-BM3h. The sensor’s potency as an MRI contrast agent is expressed by its T1 relaxivity (r1). The 2G9C6 r1 at 37°C and 9.4 T undergoes a 5-fold reduction upon serotonin (5HT) binding in vitro, dropping from 0.99 mM−1 s−1 to 0.19 mM−1 s−1 with addition of saturating 5HT (Figure S1A). A straightforward approach to imaging 5HT transport in vivo could be based on analysis of MRI signal following coinjection of the sensor with exogenous 5HT in rats, a strategy that parallels earlier point-measurement studies with electrochemistry (Daws et al., 1997Daws L.C. Toney G.M. Davis D.J. Gerhardt G.A. Frazer A. In vivo chronoamperometric measurements of the clearance of exogenously applied serotonin in the rat dentate gyrus.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1997; 78: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our prediction was that gradual removal of 5HT bound to the sensor during and after infusion would increase the sensor’s mean relaxivity and produce a spatial profile of time-dependent, T1-weighted MRI signal increases that depend on diffusion, convection, and localized reuptake in the brain; these parameters could then be quantified using kinetic modeling approaches. Monitoring transport using the 5HT-bound sensor coinjection procedure optimizes sensitivity to 5HT reuptake versus release, and it enables the full dynamic range of the sensor to be exploited while also resulting in continuously buffered 5HT concentrations within physiologically relevant, low micromolar levels. To test our approach, we began by injecting 500 μM 2G9C6, either with or without equimolar 5HT, via paired cannulae implanted into the striatum of anesthetized rats (Figure 1A). The 2G9C6-5HT coinfusion condition was predicted to yield maximal free 5HT concentrations of 18 μM in the infusion cannula, as determined by the Kd of the sensor for 5HT. Infusions were performed over a 60 min period at a rate of 0.1 μL/min. MRI images were acquired continuously with 16 s per frame and in-plane resolution of 200 μm over six coronal 1 mm slices near the infusion cannula locations, both while the infusion was in progress and for a subsequent interval of 60 min. The injections themselves resulted in significant contrast enhancements over an approximately 3 mm diameter area (Figure 1B) that included regions of the caudate putamen (CPu), nucleus accumbens (Acb), lateral globus pallidus (LGP), lateral septum (LS), and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST). To further analyze these enhancements, we defined rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) around each infusion site and examined the magnitude of MRI signal changes in areas that received clearly discernible doses of contrast agent—defined as those voxels that showed greater than 2% signal increase during the injections, corresponding to at least roughly 1 μM 5HT-bound sensor or 0.2 μM 5HT-unbound sensor. Among such voxels across five animals, an average image-signal enhancement of 19.4% ± 4.6% was observed during infusion of 2G9C6 in the absence of 5HT, whereas a lesser enhancement of 10.5% ± 1.4% was observed during coinfusion of the MRI sensor with 5HT. If the infused 2G9C6-5HT complex remained intact, without dissociation or removal of 5HT, the 5-fold lower r1 of 2G9C6-5HT with respect to ligand-free 2G9C6 would have given rise to an approximately 5-fold lower signal change upon its injection. The fact that the 2G9C6-5HT signal change is only a factor of two lower therefore implies that close to 50% of the infused complex converts to the more MRI-visible 2G9C6, likely as a result of 5HT unbinding or removal during 2G9C6-5HT infusion. During the postinfusion period, molecular fMRI time courses observed in the presence versus the absence of 5HT differed qualitatively. In the absence of coinjected 5HT, clear decreases in MRI signal were observed for most voxels near the cannula tip (Figure 1B, top). In contrast, in the presence of coinjected 5HT, minimal signal decreases and in some cases MRI signal increases were observed following the injection period (Figure 1B, bottom). These effects could be quantified at the level of single voxels (Figure 1C) and show that the extent of postinjection signal change varied systematically with position in both +5HT and −5HT infusion conditions. Similar findings were obtained in each individual experiment; the data could be compared in the form of MRI signal changes averaged over animals in rectangular ROIs defined as in Figure 1A. Results of this analysis (Figure 1D) indicated that the average signal change following injection of 2G9C6 without 5HT was a decrease of 4.3% ± 0.7%, whereas the change following coinfusion with 5HT was an increase of 1.5% ± 0.8%. The molecular imaging time courses of Figure 1D were consistent with our prediction that 5HT reuptake would lead to MRI signal increases in the sensor neurotransmitter coinjection approach, but we sought to establish the contribution of SERT activity more directly. To do so, we again performed the injection of 2G9C6 in the absence or presence of coinfused 5HT, but now we did so in a separate group of five animals that were pretreated by systemic injection of the SSRI fluoxetine (FLX, 5 mg/kg). The average MRI time course from animals that received 2G9C6-5HT coinjection after FLX (Figure 1E) in fact displayed little or no evidence of 5HT unbinding from the sensor, as would be expected if SERT-catalyzed removal of 5HT was reduced. Voxel-level time courses obtained in the presence of FLX (Figure S1B) were also similar to those observed during and after 2G9C6 injection without 5HT (Figure 1C, left). Quantification of the postinjection MRI signal changes (Figure 1F) showed that an average signal decrease of 2.4% ± 0.4% was observed following coinjection of 2G9C6 in the presence of 5HT and FLX. This decrease was significantly different from the increase seen under comparable conditions in the absence of FLX (t test, p = 0.013), and was not significantly different from the percent signal decrease observed following injection 2G9C6 in the absence of 5HT (p = 0.8). These results confirm that neurotransmitter reuptake contributes importantly to the MRI signal observed in the period following injection of 2G9C6 with 5HT. FLX dependence of the molecular fMRI time courses could be resolved in individual brain regions. We examined image-signal dynamics in six anatomically defined ROIs corresponding to Acb, BST, CPu, LGP, and rostral and caudal subdivisions of LS (LSr and LSc, respectively; Figure 2A). MRI signals observed after infusion of 2G9C6-5HT in the presence or absence of FLX were compared for each ROI (Figure 2B). All regions except LSc showed substantially depressed MRI signal in the presence of FLX, consistent with inhibition of 5HT reuptake and its removal from the sensor. The largest responses to FLX were observed in Acb, CPu, and LSr. These data suggest that SERT-dependent 5HT transport parameters vary spatially and can be measured by MRI. The time courses are difficult to interpret rigorously in terms of 5HT unbinding from 2G9C6, however, because they reflect combined influences of diffusion, convection, and 5HT clearance over the course of the experiments. In order to extract quantitative voxel-level 5HT transport parameters from the molecular fMRI data, we devised a simple compartmental modeling approach (Figure 3A). The model accounted for five microscopic processes: (1) infusion of 2G9C6-5HT complex at the cannula tips, modeled as a constant influx during the 60 min injection period; (2) transformation from 2G9C6-5HT to unbound 2G9C6, modeled as a first-order rate process with a rate constant of kU, describing net 5HT removal; (3) diffusion of bound or unbound sensor between adjacent voxels, modeled using a fixed diffusion rate matched to reported values in the literature (Syková and Nicholson, 2008Syková E. Nicholson C. Diffusion in brain extracellular space.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 1277-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, Tao and Nicholson, 1996Tao L. Nicholson C. Diffusion of albumins in rat cortical slices and relevance to volume transmission.Neuroscience. 1996; 75: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar); (4) convection of bound and unbound sensor through the brain during the infusion period, modeled using individual convection rates for transfer out of each voxel; and (5) trapping of both bound and unbound sensor according to a single rate constant for each voxel. This last process was included because of our observation that MRI signal time courses did not return completely to their original baseline after injection (cf. Figure 1C), and because of postmortem histological evidence (Figure S2) suggesting intracellular localization of some of the MRI probe. Both of these phenomena were assumed to arise from endocytosis of the sensor. To keep the computations tractable, diffusion and convection of free 5HT were not explicitly modeled. Removal of 5HT from the brain interstitium is embodied in the conversion rate from 2G9C6-5HT to uncomplexed 2G9C6 without direct consideration of binding and unbinding of 5HT from the sensor. Omitting the kinetics of 5HT binding and unbinding from 2G9C6 was justified by stopped-flow measurements that revealed relatively short time constants for 5HT binding and unbinding from 2G9C6 (∼40 s, Figure S3), compared with the much slower observed changes in 2G9C6-related MRI contrast within each voxel. At equimolar or excess sensor concentrations, 5HT levels would be restricted to low, buffered levels determined by the balance of 2G9C6-5HT and 2G9C6 in each voxel. The modeling approach was able to simulate individual voxel MRI signal time courses with high accuracy (Figure 3B). R2 values averaged over voxels ranged from 0.85 to 0.95 for all animals; in each case, only voxels that showed minimal or negative signal change during contrast agent injection were excluded from the analysis. Comparison of observed and modeled image series also shows excellent agreement (Figure 3C), with both gross temporal features and spatial details reproduced in the best-fit simulation. The analysis procedure was applied to data obtained both in the absence and presence of FLX. In both cases, fitted convection constants ranged from 0 to 0.1 s−1. The spatial distribution of convection constants was approximately centrosymmetric and similar across animals, indicating reproducibility of the experimental and modeling approaches. Maps of 5HT unbinding rates kU were obtained from the compartmental modeling procedure. Figure 4A displays kU values averaged across animals in both the −FLX and +FLX conditions (both n = 5). Data obtained in the absence of FLX show that substantial 5HT unbinding is apparent across much of the area for which data were obtained, and that particularly high 5HT removal is observed in a dorsomedial region including LS, BST, and parts of LGP and CPu. Values of kU are sharply reduced in animals pretreated with FLX, although some areas appear less affected than others. Average 5HT unbinding rates were quantified in the six previously defined anatomical ROIs (Figure 4B). Consistent with the maps, mean kU values were highest for the LS regions, where the observed unbinding rates were significantly higher than in Acb, CPu, and LGP (p ≤ 0.037). All ROIs except BST showed significant reduction of average kU upon FLX treatment (p ≤ 0.049). Percent reduction in mean kU varied from 40% ± 16% for LSc to 74% ± 8% for Acb. Both ROI and voxel-level model fitting results, therefore, reveal significant but varying effects of FLX on 5HT removal kinetics. Kinetic modeling of the 2G9C6 molecular fMRI data also enables estimation of classical enzyme kinetic parameters (Figure 4C). By assuming a fast equilibrium between 2G9C6-5HT and 2G9C6 after the sensor infusion period, we determined effective free 5HT concentrations Seff, given by Kd[2G9C6-5HT]/[2G9C6]. We also computed effective velocities of 5HT removal Veff, given by kU[2G9C6-5HT]. Seff and Veff values are plotted for each ROI in the presence and absence of FLX (Figure 4D). The range of Seff values for each ROI results from time-dependent depletion of free 5HT during the postinfusion period. These estimated free 5HT concentrations range from 0 to 6 μM, consistent with the effects of sensor dilution and 5HT unbinding as the infused molecules spread throughout the brain during the imaging experiments. Corresponding 5HT removal velocities range from 0 to 20 nM/s. Veff values in the 10−9–10−8 M/s range are consistent with kinetic measurements from SERT-expressing cells (Blakely et al., 1991Blakely R.D. Berson H.E. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Caron M.G. Peek M.M. Prince H.K. Bradley C.C. Cloning and expression of a functional serotonin transporter from rat brain.Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) and 5HT clearance rates recorded by in vivo voltammetry (Dankoski et al., 2014Dankoski E.C. Agster K.L. Fox M.E. Moy S.S. Wightman R.M. Facilitation of serotonin signaling by SSRIs is attenuated by social isolation.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2014; 39: 2928-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several points about the graphs of Seff versus Veff are notable. First, Seff values are systematically higher in the +FLX condition for all ROIs, showing that our molecular imaging and modeling methods successfully measure this expected result of SSRI treatment. Second, the graphs of Seff versus Veff in both −FLX and +FLX conditions are approximately linear (R2 > 0.84), with only minimal evidence of asymptotic behavior even for the highest values of Seff. Although these graphs are partially constrained by the kinetic model, the absence of maximal Veff values even for effective 5HT concentrations over 1 μM suggests that the dominant mechanisms of 5HT clearance do not saturate with increasing [5HT]. This adds to previous evidence that 5HT transporters behave more like nonsaturating channels (DeFelice and Goswami, 2007DeFelice L.J. Goswami T. Transporters as channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 87-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Petersen and DeFelice, 1999Petersen C.I. DeFelice L.J. Ionic interactions in the Drosophila serotonin transporter identify it as a serotonin channel.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) than like conventional saturating Michaelis-Menten enzymes at 5HT concentrations above the reported Km values of 0.1–0.3 μM (Blakely et al., 1991Blakely R.D. Berson H.E. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Caron M.G. Peek M.M. Prince H.K. Bradley C.C. Cloning and expression of a functional serotonin transporter from rat brain.Nature. 1991; 354: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, Hagan et al., 2010Hagan C.E. Neumaier J.F. Schenk J.O. Rotating disk electrode voltammetric measurements of serotonin transporter kinetics in synaptosomes.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 193: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Finally, the FLX-dependent difference in slope for each ROI varies among regions, consistent with the calculated differences in kU (Figure 4B). Slopes of Seff versus Veff in principle indicate the rate constants for 5HT transport more directly than the kU values, and therefore provide further support for contributions of both FLX-inhibited and FLX-independent mechanisms to 5HT clearance in each region. A possible mechanism for FLX-independent 5HT removal from the brain is the nonspecific transport of 5HT by dopamine transporter (DAT) proteins. Electrochemical measurements and experiments in slices have shown that low micromolar 5HT concentrations can be taken up via DAT and packaged for re-release by dopaminergic neurons (Daws, 2009Daws L.C.

To assess the contribution of this route to the 5HT removal profiles obtained by molecular fMRI, we repeated the experiments of Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 in five additional rats treated with 20 mg/kg of the DAT inhibitor GBR-12909 (GBR). Like FLX, GBR administration inhibited the relative increase of MRI signal observed following coinjection of 5HT with the 2G9C6 sensor into rat brain (Figure 5A), consistent with partial suppression of 5HT reuptake. Kinetic analysis of the data following methods of Figure 3 yielded a spatial map of 5HT removal rates in the presence of GBR (Figure 5B). The quality of fits (R2 ≥ 0.85) was comparable to those obtained without drugs or in the presence of FLX. The distribution of kU values appeared intermediate between those values observed in the absence of drugs and in the presence of FLX (Figure 4A). Averaging the kU values over anatomically defin"

In this study, we present a series of high resolution crystal structures of Spa47 and use the structures to model an activated Spa47 oligomer, finding that ATP hydrolysis may be supported by specific side chain contributions from adjacent protomers within the complex. Follow-up mutagenesis experiments targeting the predicted active site residues validate the oligomeric model and determined that each of the tested residues are essential for Spa47 ATPase activity, although they are not directly responsible for stable oligomer formation. Although N-terminal domain truncation was necessary for crystal formation, it resulted in strictly monomeric Spa47 that is unable to hydrolyze ATP, despite maintaining the canonical ATPase core structure and active site residues. Coupled with studies of ATPase inactive full-length Spa47 point mutants, we find that Spa47 oligomerization and ATP hydrolysis are needed for complete T3SS apparatus formation, a proper translocator secretion profile, and Shigella virulence. This work represents the first structure-function characterization of Spa47, uniquely complementing the multitude of included Shigella T3SS phenotype assays and providing a more complete understanding of T3SS ATPase-mediated pathogen virulence. Additionally, these findings provide a strong platform for follow-up studies evaluating regulation of Spa47 oligomerization in vivo as a much needed means of treating and perhaps preventing shigellosis."

https://openalex.org/W2532761158,"The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently updating the tenth version of their diagnostic tool, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD, WHO, 1992). Changes have been proposed for the diagnosis of Transsexualism (ICD-10) with regard to terminology, placement and content. The aim of this study was to gather the opinions of transgender individuals (and their relatives/partners) and clinicians in the Netherlands, Flanders (Belgium) and the United Kingdom regarding the proposed changes and the clinical applicability and utility of the ICD-11 criteria of 'Gender Incongruence of Adolescence and Adulthood' (GIAA). A total of 628 participants were included in the study: 284 from the Netherlands (45.2%), 8 from Flanders (Belgium) (1.3%), and 336 (53.5%) from the UK. Most participants were transgender people (or their partners/relatives) (n = 522), 89 participants were healthcare providers (HCPs) and 17 were both healthcare providers and (partners/relatives of) transgender people. Participants completed an online survey developed for this study. Most participants were in favor of the proposed diagnostic term of 'Gender Incongruence' and thought that this was an improvement on the ICD-10 diagnostic term of 'Transsexualism'. Placement in a separate chapter dealing with Sexual- and Gender-related Health or as a Z-code was preferred by many and only a small number of participants stated that this diagnosis should be excluded from the ICD-11. In the UK, most transgender participants thought there should be a diagnosis related to being trans. However, if it were to be removed from the chapter on ""psychiatric disorders"", many transgender respondents indicated that they would prefer it to be removed from the ICD in its entirety. There were no large differences between the responses of the transgender participants (or their partners and relatives) and HCPs. HCPs were generally positive about the GIAA diagnosis; most thought the diagnosis was clearly defined and easy to use in their practice or work. The duration of gender incongruence (several months) was seen by many as too short and required a clearer definition. If the new diagnostic term of GIAA is retained, it should not be stigmatizing to individuals. Moving this diagnosis away from the mental and behavioral chapter was generally supported. Access to healthcare was one area where retaining a diagnosis seemed to be of benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2534140052,"The biological function of MAGEC2, a cancer/testis antigen highly expressed in various cancers, remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that expression of MAGEC2 induces rounded morphology and amoeboid-like movement of tumor cells in vitro and promotes tumor metastasis in vivo. The pro-metastasis effect of MAGEC2 was mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation. Mechanistically, MAGEC2 interacts with STAT3 and inhibits the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of STAT3 in the nucleus of tumor cells, resulting in accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3 and enhanced transcriptional activity. Notably, expression levels of MAGEC2 and phosphorylated STAT3 are positively correlated and both are associated with incidence of metastasis in human hepatocellular carcinoma. This study not only reveals a previously unappreciated role of MAGEC2 in promoting tumor metastasis, but also identifies a new molecular mechanism by which MAGEC2 sustains hyperactivation of STAT3 in the nucleus of tumor cells. Thus, MAGEC2 may represent a new antitumor metastasis target for treatment of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2534599324,"The amyloid hypothesis posits that the production of β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline associated with AD. Aβ is produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase. While nascent APP is well known to transit to the endosomal/ lysosomal system via the cell surface, we have recently shown that APP can also traffic to lysosomes intracellularly via its interaction with AP-3. Because AP-3 interacts with cargo protein via interaction with tyrosine motifs, we mutated the three tyrosines motif in the cytoplasmic tail of APP. Here, we show that the YTSI motif interacts with AP-3, and phosphorylation of the serine in this motif disrupts the interaction and decreases APP trafficking to lysosomes. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation at this motif can decrease the production of neurotoxic Aβ 42. This demonstrates that reducing APP trafficking to lysosomes may be a strategy to reduce Aβ 42 in Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2533811274,"Background The pathogenesis of multiple chronic visceral pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is not well known, and as a result current therapies are ineffective. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of spinal protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) on visceral pain sensitivity in rats with IBS to better understand the pathogenesis and investigate the effect of zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) as a therapy for chronic visceral pain. Methods Visceral hypersensitivity rats were produced by neonatal maternal separation (NMS). Visceral pain sensitivity was assessed by electromyographic (EMG) responses of abdominal muscles to colorectal distention (CRD). Spinal PKMζ and phosphorylated PKMζ (p-PKMζ) were detected by western blot. Varying doses of ZIP were intrathecally administered to investigate the role of spinal PKMζ in chronic visceral hypersensitivity. The open field test was used to determine if ZIP therapy causes spontaneous motor activity side effects. Results Graded CRD pressure significantly increased EMG responses in NMS rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). p-PKMζ expression increased in the thoracolumbar and lumbosacral spinal cord in the IBS-like rats with notable concomitant chronic visceral pain compared to control rats (p < 0.05). EMG data revealed that intrathecal ZIP injection (1, 5, and 10 μg) dose-dependently attenuated visceral pain hypersensitivity in IBS-like rats. Conclusions Phosphorylated PKMζ may be involved in the spinal central sensitization of chronic visceral hypersensitivity in IBS, and administration of ZIP could effectively treat chronic visceral pain with good outcomes in rat models."
https://openalex.org/W2534736627,"The refractivity and transparency of the ocular lens is dependent on the stability and solubility of the crystallins in the fiber cells. A number of mutations of lens crystallins have been associated with dominant cataracts in humans and mice. Of particular interest were γB- and γD-crystallin mutants linked to dominant cataracts in mouse models. Although thermodynamically destabilized and aggregation-prone, these mutants were found to have weak affinity to the resident chaperone α-crystallin in vitro To better understand the mechanism of the cataract phenotype, we transgenically expressed different γD-crystallin mutants in the zebrafish lens and observed a range of lens defects that arise primarily from the aggregation of the mutant proteins. Unlike mouse models, a strong correlation was observed between the severity and penetrance of the phenotype and the level of destabilization of the mutant. We interpret this result to reflect the presence of a proteostasis network that can sense protein stability. In the more destabilized mutants, the capacity of this network is overwhelmed, leading to the observed increase in phenotypic penetrance. Overexpression of αA-crystallin had no significant effects on the penetrance of lens defects, suggesting that its chaperone capacity is not limiting. Although consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that a chaperone network is required for lens transparency, our results suggest that αA-crystallin may not be efficient to inhibit aggregation of lens γ-crystallin. Furthermore, our work implicates additional inputs/factors in this underlying proteostasis network and demonstrates the utility of zebrafish as a platform to delineate mechanisms of cataract."
https://openalex.org/W2537316183,"Objective We hypothesized that compared to healthy controls, long-term abstinent substance dependent individuals (SDI) will differ in their effective connectivity between large-scale brain networks and demonstrate increased directional information from executive control to interoception-, reward-, and habit-related networks. In addition, using graph theory to compare network efficiencies we predicted decreased small-worldness in SDI compared to controls. Methods 50 SDI and 50 controls of similar sex and age completed psychological surveys and resting state fMRI. fMRI results were analyzed using group independent component analysis; 14 networks-of-interest (NOI) were selected using template matching to a canonical set of resting state networks. The number, direction, and strength of connections between NOI were analyzed with Granger Causality. Within-group thresholds were p<0.005 using a bootstrap permutation. Between group thresholds were p<0.05, FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons. NOI were correlated with behavioral measures, and group-level graph theory measures were compared. Results Compared to controls, SDI showed significantly greater Granger causal connectivity from right executive control network (RECN) to dorsal default mode network (dDMN) and from dDMN to basal ganglia network (BGN). RECN was negatively correlated with impulsivity, behavioral approach, and negative affect; dDMN was positively correlated with impulsivity. Among the 14 NOI, SDI showed greater bidirectional connectivity; controls showed more unidirectional connectivity. SDI demonstrated greater global efficiency and lower local efficiency. Conclusions Increased effective connectivity in long-term abstinent drug users may reflect improved cognitive control over habit and reward processes. Higher global and lower local efficiency across all networks in SDI compared to controls may reflect connectivity changes associated with drug dependence or remission and requires future, longitudinal studies to confirm."
https://openalex.org/W2534096822,"Scd6, a yeast homologue of human RAP55, is a component of messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) that repress translation by binding to translation initiation factors, and also is a decapping activator along with the binding partners Edc3 and Dhh1. Herein, we report that Scd6 is a substrate of the intrinsic protein arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1, in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that several arginine residues within the Scd6 RGG motif, which is important for mRNA binding, were methylated in Hmt1 dependent manner. Under stress conditions such as glucose starvation, Scd6 localized to cytoplasmic processing bodies (P-bodies) wherein translationally repressed mRNPs and untranslated mRNAs accumulate. Localization of Scd6 to P-bodies was impaired in hmt1 deletion mutant and in the presence of methylation-deficient substitution of Scd6. In addition, deletion of scd6 and dhh1 led to severe synthetic growth defect at high temperature. Methylation-deficient mutation of Scd6 suppressed the phenotypic defects of scd6 dhh1 double mutant, whereas methylation-mimic mutation did not, suggesting that the arginine methylation might negatively regulate Scd6 function relating to Dhh1. Therefore, the present data suggest that Hmt1-based arginine methylation is required for Scd6 localization and function."
https://openalex.org/W2538572901,"Background & Objective Pain is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson’s disease. As dopaminergic dysfunction is suggested to affect intrinsic nociceptive processing, this study was designed to characterize laser-induced pain processing in early-stage Parkinson’s disease patients in the dopaminergic OFF state, using a multimodal experimental approach at behavioral, autonomic, imaging levels. Methods 13 right-handed early-stage Parkinson’s disease patients without cognitive or sensory impairment were investigated OFF medication, along with 13 age-matched healthy control subjects. Measurements included warmth perception thresholds, heat pain thresholds, and central pain processing with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (erfMRI) during laser-induced pain stimulation at lower (E = 440 mJ) and higher (E = 640 mJ) target energies. Additionally, electrodermal activity was characterized during delivery of 60 randomized pain stimuli ranging from 440 mJ to 640 mJ, along with evaluation of subjective pain ratings on a visual analogue scale. Results No significant differences in warmth perception thresholds, heat pain thresholds, electrodermal activity and subjective pain ratings were found between Parkinson’s disease patients and controls, and erfMRI revealed a generally comparable activation pattern induced by laser-pain stimuli in brain areas belonging to the central pain matrix. However, relatively reduced deactivation was found in Parkinson’s disease patients in posterior regions of the default mode network, notably the precuneus and the posterior cingulate cortex. Conclusion Our data during pain processing extend previous findings suggesting default mode network dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease. On the other hand, they argue against a genuine pain-specific processing abnormality in early-stage Parkinson’s disease. Future studies are now required using similar multimodal experimental designs to examine pain processing in more advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2535238732,"The 5-item Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) was designed to measure general life satisfaction (LS). Here we examined the psychometric properties of the SWLS in a cohort of persons with Parkinson`s disease (PwPD) and age and gender matched individuals without PD. The SWLS was administered to PwPD and controls from the Norwegian ParkWest study at 5 and 7 years after the time of diagnosis. Data were analysed according to classical test theory (CTT) and Rasch measurement theory. CTT scaling assumptions for computation of a SWLS total score were met (corrected item-total correlations >0.58). The SWLS was reasonably well targeted to the sample and had good reliability (ordinal alpha, 0.92). The scale exhibited good fit to the Rasch model and successfully separated between 5 statistically distinct strata of people (levels of SWLS). The seven response categories did not work as intended and the scale may benefit from reduction to five response categories. There was no clinically significant differential item functioning. Separate analyses in PwPD and controls yielded very similar results to those from the pooled analysis. This study supports the SWLS as a valid instrument for measuring LS in PD and controls. However, Rasch analyses provided new insights into the performance and validity of the SWLS and identified areas for future revisions in order to further improve the scale."
https://openalex.org/W2539099060,"Recently we described a novel di-benzene-pyrylium-indolene (BAS00127538) inhibitor of Lipid II. BAS00127538 (1-Methyl-2,4-diphenyl-6-((1E,3E)-3-(1,3,3-trimethylindolin-2-ylidene)prop-1-en-1-yl)pyryl-1-ium) tetrafluoroborate is the first small molecule Lipid II inhibitor and is structurally distinct from natural agents that bind Lipid II, such as vancomycin. Here, we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of 50 new analogs of BAS00127538 designed to explore the structure-activity relationships of the scaffold. The results of this study indicate an activity map of the scaffold, identifying regions that are critical to cytotoxicity, Lipid II binding and range of anti-bacterial action. One compound, 6jc48-1, showed significantly enhanced drug-like properties compared to BAS00127538. 6jc48-1 has reduced cytotoxicity, while retaining specific Lipid II binding and activity against Enterococcus spp. in vitro and in vivo. Further, this compound showed a markedly improved pharmacokinetic profile with a half-life of over 13 hours upon intravenous and oral administration and was stable in plasma. These results suggest that scaffolds like that of 6jc48-1 can be developed into small molecule antibiotic drugs that target Lipid II."
https://openalex.org/W2532987359,"The purpose of these studies was to test the hypothesis that a selected polypharmacological approach for treating the prostanoid-mediated component of inflammatory diseases would produce a therapeutic effect superior to global inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis by aspirin-like drugs. The compound studied was AGN 211377, which had been previously shown to produce a superior effect on cytokine release from human macrophages compared with cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. AGN 211377 antagonizes prostanoid prostaglandin D2 (DP)1, DP2, prostaglandin E2 (EP)1, EP4, prostaglandin F2α, and throm boxane A2 receptors but not anti-inflammatory EP2, prostaglandin I2, or EP3 receptors. Established rodent models of ocular inflammatory diseases were used to determine therapeutic effects inliving animals. The drugs were administered systemically after predetermination of their blood levels to ensure bioavailability at an appropriate dose level. Whereas compounds selective for a single prostanoid receptor typically exhibited modest but statistically significant inhibition, AGN 211377 profoundly inhibited S-antigen-induced uveitis and laser-induced retinal neovascularization. Consistent with previous polypharmacological studies on chemokine/cytokine release from human macrophages, the prostanoid EP1 receptor played a permissive role in suppressing neovascularization and inflammation in vivo. Comparing AGN211377 with a close structural congener lacking EP1 antagonism(AGN 197727), AGN197727 was much less active than AGN211377, but pronounced anti-inflammatory and angiostatic effects were achieved by adding the EP1 antagonist compound(SC- 51322) to AGN 197727 in the systemic dosing regimen. Further, AGN 211377 produced superior anti-inflammatory activity compared with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent ketorolac. These results indicate the value of using a polypharmacological approach in the design of novel therapeutic agents in preference to compounds targeting a single receptor or enzyme. A compound such as AGN 211377 may represent more effective therapy than COX inhibitors in treating uveitis and ocular diseases where neo vascularization is a significant part of the pathology.—Woodward, D.

https://openalex.org/W2533093534,"Introduction Injury and psychological distress are public health priorities because of their high occurrence in the population. This study examines the longitudinal effects of injury characteristics on psychological distress. Methods Study participants were enrolled distance learning Thai adults (N = 42,785 at 2013 follow-up) residing nationwide. We analysed 2009 and 2013 data. Injury questions included injury prevalence, causes and levels of severity. Distress was measured using the standard Kessler-6. To assess the risk for post-injury distress, we used multinomial logistic regression investigating psychological distress in 2013 as an outcome including injury categories in both 2009 and 2013 as predictors, adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Results Overall injury was predictive of psychological distress. Both types of injury (traffic and non- traffic) associated with increasing psychological distress. Those that had experienced both types of injuries in the previous year had higher odds of developing psychological distress compared to those who experienced just one type. In 2013, adjusted psychological distress odds ratios were 1.46 [95% Confidence Interval 1.14–1.87] for traffic injury only; 1.26 [1.13–1.40] for non-traffic injury only; and 2.71 [2.19–3.35] for both traffic and non-traffic injuries. Increasing frequency of injury and increasing injury severity were also linked to elevated psychological distress among our Thai cohort members. Conclusions Our results revealed a significantly high risk of psychological distress following injury. With increasing occurrence of injury, especially traffic injuries in low and middle income countries such as Thailand, future policies should not only focus on physical care but also address psychological distress as an important consequence of injury."
