Here we tested the assumption that endogenous HSP70 activates the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway similar to HSP60 and pathogen-derived molecular patterns. We show that HSP70 induces interleukin-12 (IL-12) and endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) promoters in macrophages and that this is controlled by MyD88 and TRAF6. Furthermore, HSP70 causes MyD88 relocalization and MyD88-deficient dendritic cells do not respond to HSP70 with proinflammatory cytokine production. Using the system of genetic complementation with Toll-like receptors (TLR) we found that TLR2 and TLR4 confer responsiveness to HSP70 in 293T fibroblasts. The expanding list of endogenous ligands able to activate the ancient Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway is in line with the “danger hypothesis” proposing that the innate immune system senses danger signals even if they originate from self.

There are at least two lines of thought in regard to the nature of such stimuli. The first implies that “exogenous” pathogen-associated (hence, “foreign”) molecular patterns (PAMPs) are selectively recognized by germ line encoded Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which subsequently drive innate immune cell activation (1.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). In favor of this view, PAMPs such as bacterial lipopeptides, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, flagellin, and bacterial CpG-DNA are recognized by TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9, respectively (2.Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). Ligand-driven TLR activation causes consecutive recruitment of the adaptor molecule MyD88, the IL-1 receptor-associated kinases and the adaptor molecule TRAF6 (3.O'neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This ancient Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) signal pathway ultimately leads to activation of transcription factors that switch on production of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, costimulatory molecules from B7 family, and adhesion molecules, for example, endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1; E-selectin). Given the importance of IL-12 in cell-mediated immunity (4.Gately M.K. Renzetti L.M. Magram J. Stern A.S. Adorini L. Gubler U. Presky D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), the indispensability of costimulatory molecules for full activation of lymphocytes (5.Hunter C.A. Reiner S.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the role of adhesion molecules in recruiting leukocytes (6.Ebnet K. Vestweber D. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and forming the proper immunological synapses between interacting cells (7.Krummel M.F. Davis M.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), it becomes clear why TLRs have the central position in both innate and adaptive anti-infectious responses. dendritic cells pathogen-associated molecular patterns Toll-like receptors lipopolysaccharide Toll/IL-1 receptor tumor necrosis factor endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion molecule interleukin heat-shock protein bone marrow-derived dendritic cells enhanced green fluorescence protein phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate fetal calf serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay dominant negative Alternatively, it has been suggested that DCs act as sentinels of “endogenous” ligands released from cells undergoing unprogrammed necrotic death as opposed to “silent” programmed cell death, i.e. apoptosis (8.Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 9.Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). According to this view not the “foreign-ness” is sensed but the danger, thus the name “danger hypothesis” (10.Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Identification of endogenous danger signals will help to better understand how the immune system functions. First candidates in line are family members of intracellular HSPs, which, upon necrotic cell death might be released and thus could be able to activate DCs (11.Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 12.Somersan S. Larsson M. Fonteneau J.F. Basu S. Srivastava P. Bhardwaj N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For example HSP60 (13.Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar), HSP70 (14.Moroi Y. Mayhew M. Trcka J. Hoe M.H. Takechi Y. Hartl F.U. Rothman J.E. Houghton A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar), as well as gp96 (16.Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U. Hilf N. Arnold-Schild D. Rammensee H.G. Toes R.E. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) deliver activation signals to innate immune cells. Because induction of specific CD8 T cell responses by HSP·peptide complexes appears not to require adjuvants to confer immunogenicity to bound peptides (17.Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 657-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) the ability of HSPs to activate DCs may not only explain the immunogenicity of HSP·peptide complexes but also it represents a strong argument in favor of the danger hypothesis. Members of the HSP70 cytosolic group are either constitutively expressed (HSC70) or can be induced by a broad range of stress factors (HSP70). The inducible HSP70 has been recently characterized as a potent maturation stimulus for DCs (18.Kuppner M.C. Gastpar R. Gelwer S. Nossner E. Ochmann O. Scharner A. Issels R.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1602-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Driven by the quest to identify/compare the pathways through which exogenous and endogenous ligands activate innate immune cells, and encouraged by recent data on HSP60 signaling (19.Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Hacker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), we searched for further cases of dual specificity (endogenous and exogenous) of the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway by examining HSP70-triggered intracellular events. Our data define HSP70 as an endogenous stimulus for the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway that engages TLR2 and TLR4. A FLAG epitope-tagged C terminus of murine MyD88 (dnMyD88) was described previously (19.Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Hacker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The expression vectors for the C terminus of human TRAF6 (dnTRAF6), human flag-tagged TLR2, TLR4, and E-selectin (ELAM-1) promoter luciferase construct were gifts from Tularik, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA); murine TLR9 in pcDNA3 was a gift from S. Bauer (Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany); the human MD-2 expression vector was kindly provided by K. Miyake (Saga Medical School, Nabeshima, Japan). The luciferase reporter driven by a synthetic enhancer harboring 6 NF-κB binding consensus sites was a gift from P. Baeuerle (Munich, Germany). The IL-12p40 promoter (−703 to +53) luciferase construct was a gift from K. M. Murphy (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Recombinant human HSP70 was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). To control contamination with LPS, HSP70 preparations were boiled for 30–60 min where indicated. Phosphothioate-stabilized CpG oligonucleotide 1668 (TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT) was purchased from TIB Molbiol (Berlin, Germany). LPS fromEscherichia coli 055:B5 and PMA were from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany). The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was grown in VLE-RPMI medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin sulfate (all from Biochrom KG). 5–10 × 106 RAW264.7 cells were transfected by electroporation in a 400-μl final volume (RPMI/25% FCS) at 300 V and 960 microfarads in a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). 5 μg of reporter plasmids was used for transfection together with different amounts of specific expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. The overall amount of plasmid DNA was held constant at 20 μg per electroporation by addition of the appropriate empty expression vector. After electroporation, cells were washed and split into 12-well plates for subsequent stimulation and lysis. The human embryonic kidney fibroblasts 293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom KG) with the same supplements as for RAW264.7 macrophage cell cultures. For luciferase reporter assays the 293T cells were transfected by electroporation similar as RAW264.7 except that 200 V were used. 10 ng of 6× NF-κB luciferase reporter together with 0.1 μg of respective expression vector or empty control vector (as indicated in figure legend) per transfection were used. The overall DNA amount was held constant at 20 μg by addition of empty vector. For luciferase assays, transfected cells were stimulated as described in the Fig. 5 legend, lysed, and luciferase activity in extracts was measured with the Luciferase Assay System kit from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer's instruction. MyD88-deficient mice were a kind gift from S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (20.Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Gene-targeted mice deficient for TLR2 (TLR2−/−) were granted by Tularik Inc. (21.Werts C. Tapping R.I. Mathison J.C. Chuang T.H. Kravchenko V. Saint G.I. Haake D.A. Godowski P.J. Hayashi F. Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Aderem A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). C3H/HeJ mice (TLR4d/d) and C3H/HeN (TLR4+/+) were purchased from Harlan (Germany) for 5-fold backcrossing of TLR2−/− mice toward the C3H genetic background. Mice were genotyped for the point mutation of the TLR4 gene responsible for the amino acid exchange P712H of the intracellular domain of TLR4 and characteristic for the C3H/HeJ strain (22.Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). F1 generation mice of parent mice 5-fold backcrossed toward the C3H background carrying both the TLR2 and the TLR4 mutations heterozygously were used for further crossing. Offspring mice carrying one of each, the mutated or the wild type allele homozygously (TLR2+/+/TLR4+/+, TLR2−/−/TLR4+/+, TLR2+/+/TLR4d/d, TLR2−/−/TLR4d/d) were selected pairwise for further breeding. Age-matched groups of wild-type and mutant mice were used for the experiments. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were prepared as described previously (23.Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rossner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). For stimulation, nonadherent BMDC at days 6–7 were washed, plated at 3.8–7.5 × 105/ml, and after a 2-h rest cells were stimulated in triplicates for 20 h. IL-12p40 and TNFα levels in culture supernatants were determined by commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 7 × 105 RAW264.7 macrophages stably expressing MyD88-EGFP 2P. Ahmad-Nejad, manuscript in preparation. were plated 1 day before image collection on round glass slides in 12-well dishes in 10% FCS, VLE-RPMI medium containing 500 units/ml interferon γ. 3 h prior to stimulation, medium was exchanged with fresh 0% FCS-containing medium. Cells were stimulated as indicated in the legend of Fig. 3, washed, and formalin-fixed. Samples were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a Argon 488-nm laser, a Plan-Neofluar 40 1.3 oil lens, and LSM 510 version 2.02 software. Slices 1-μm thick were collected at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. Recruitment of the adaptor molecule MyD88 to the cytoplasmatic TIR domain of ligand-activated TLRs is considered as a crucial early step during initiation of the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway (3.O'neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To probe whether a dominant negative (dn) version of MyD88 influences HSP70-induced signaling, we first established experimental conditions for HSP70-driven macrophage activation. The macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 was chosen for luciferase reporter analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 human HSP70 dose-dependently caused induction of IL-12p40 (Fig. 1 A) and ELAM-1 (Fig. 1 B) promoters. No increase above basal expression was noted in parallel cultures after addition of heat-denatured HSP70, thus excluding potential LPS contamination. It was recently demonstrated that α2-macroglobulin receptor (CD91) functions as an uptake receptor for HSP70 (24.Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Because high amounts of α2-macroglobulin are present in FCS one could presume an inhibitory effect of serum on HSP70 interaction with macrophages. To probe for that possibility serum-free stimulation with HSP70 was performed. As shown in Fig. 1 this impaired IL-12p40 reporter activity but greatly enhanced ELAM-1 promoter induction by HSP70. Having defined conditions for HSP70-mediated macrophage activation we next analyzed whether transient overexpression of dominant negative variants of MyD88 and TRAF6 in RAW264.7 cells would affect HSP70-driven activation. As shown in Fig. 2 both dnMyD88 and dnTRAF6 dose-dependently suppressed ELAM-1 promoter activation triggered by HSP70. As a well-established MyD88- and TRAF6-dependent signal inducer, LPS was included for reference. Inhibition of cell activation by dominant negative molecules from the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway was significant but incomplete for both HSP70 and LPS, which could be explained by MyD88-independent signaling pathways (25.Horng T. Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 26.Fitzgerald K.A. Palsson-McDermott E.M. Bowie A.G. Jefferies C.A. Mansell A.S. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M.T. McMurray D. Smith D.E. Sims J.E. Bird T.A. O'Neill L.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Expression of dnMyD88 and dnTRAF6 in RAW264.7 was dose-dependent, as controlled by Western blotting (data not shown). To rule out unspecific or toxic effects of overexpressed dominant negative constructs, stimulation of cells by hypo-osmotic stress was used as a specificity control (Fig. 2). Because a dominant negative version of MyD88 suppressed HSP70-induced signaling, we next attempted to visualize HSP70-driven recruitment of MyD88 to subcellular sites where signaling is initiated. RAW264.7 macrophage clones stably expressing MyD88 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were selected and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy upon activation with HSP70 (5 μg/ml, 2-h stimulation). As shown in Fig. 3 A MyD88-EGFP was homogenously distributed within the cytoplasm in nonstimulated cells. Upon stimulation with HSP70, MyD88-EGFP became recruited to irregularly distributed endosome-like vesicular structures and partially to the cell membrane (Fig. 3 B). Heat-denatured HSP70 failed to cause any changes of MyD88 distribution within the cells (Fig. 3 C). These data confirmed the involvement of the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway and suggested that HSP70 may initiate signaling upon endocytosis as has been described for HSP60 (19.Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Hacker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Next we used cells from MyD88-deficient mice to verify the central role of MyD88 in cell activation by HSP70. HSP70 has been shown to stimulate murine antigen-presenting cells to produce IL-12p40 and TNFα (14.Moroi Y. Mayhew M. Trcka J. Hoe M.H. Takechi Y. Hartl F.U. Rothman J.E. Houghton A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the ability of HSP70 to trigger production of aforementioned cytokines in murine DCs derived from bone marrow (BMDC) of MyD88-defficient mice and of respective control mice. HSP70 dose-dependently caused BMDC from control mice to initiate IL-12p40 (Fig. 4 A) and TNFα (Fig. 4 B) production, yet responsiveness of MyD88-deficient BMDC was ablated. Heat-inactivated HSP70 showed no stimulatory activity for DCs. To control that wild-type and knock-out DCs were responsive, the MyD88-independent TNFα inducer PMA was used (Fig. 4 B). Stimulation under serum-free conditions was performed synchronously, to test for potential enhancement of the stimulatory capacity of HSP70. Serum deprivation affected cytokine production at higher HSP70 concentrations (Fig. 4). This result might be explained by a negative impact on cytokine production of the stress imposed by serum deprivation. Indeed, stimulation with PMA under FCS-free conditions resulted in reduced TNFα production, supporting this explanation. Overall, these results confirmed that signaling for HSP70-driven cytokine production occurs via the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway. The essential role of MyD88 and TRAF6 in HSP70-triggered cell activation suggested an involvement of Toll-like receptors. To analyze this possibility we first utilized genetic complementation with TLRs of the HSP70-unresponsive human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line 293T. Cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter driven by a synthetic enhancer harboring 6 NF-κB binding consensus sites. Upon cotransfection with TLR2 the cells gained responsiveness to HSP70 (and LPS (27.Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar)) but not to heat-inactivated HSP70 (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, cotransfection of TLR4 alone was ineffective, yet cotransfection of TLR4 plus MD-2, a coreceptor of TLR4 in case of LPS signaling (28.Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Fukudome K. Miyake K. Kimoto M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar), resulted unequivocally in responsiveness (Fig. 5 A). The grade of HSP70-induced NF-κB activity was comparable to that caused by LPS, implying that stimulatory potential of endogenous ligand HSP70 is as high as that of the potent microbial stimulus LPS. Gain of function was TLR-specific, because TLR9 conferred responsiveness to bacterial CpG-DNA but not to HSP70 or LPS (Fig. 5 A). We also analyzed a potential role of serum components in this reductionist genetic complementation system. Although the absence of FCS-enhanced TLR2 mediated “gain of function” dose-dependently, TLR4 plus MD-2-mediated HSP70 responsiveness was not influenced by serum and the dose of the stimulus (Fig. 5 B). It is possible that TLR4/MD-2 is more sensitive to HSP70 engagement and that the concentration range we used for stimulation represents a functional plateau where positive effects of serum deprivation may disappear. On the other hand, one or more FCS components might affect primarily TLR2-mediated signaling, for example, by competing for receptor-mediated endocytosis of HSP70 (24.Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Because genetic complementation with TLR2 or TLR4 plus MD-2 resulted in gain of function to HSP70, we also analyzed responsiveness to HSP70 of BMDC from TLR2-deficient (TLR2−/−) and TLR4-mutant mice (TLR4d/d) (Fig. 6,A and B). To control for equal stimulatory conditions, IL-12p40 production in response to CpG-DNA was measured, known to be dependent on TLR9 but not on TLR2 or TLR4 (Fig. 6 C). TLR2−/−/TLR4d/d and TLR2+/+/TLR4d/d BMDC failed to produce either IL-12p40 or TNFα in response to HSP70, yet HSP70 responsiveness of TLR2−/−/TLR4+/+ BMDC was not affected. These results raise the question, whether TLR2 requires cooperation with yet undefined cofactor that is absent in BMDC but present in 293T cells. This is, for example, the case for TLR4, which requires MD-2 for sensing LPS. Heat-shock protein·peptide complexes do not require adjuvants to elicit peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses (17.Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 657-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This raises the question whether certain HSPs not only chaperonize peptides mirroring the antigenic repertoire of (tumor) cells they originate from but also act as endogenous adjuvants able to deliver maturation signals to antigen-presenting DCs. The cosegregation of immunogenicity of cancers with higher levels of expression of HSP70 without change in the antigenic repertoire of the cancer cells is a case in point (29.Melcher A. Todryk S. Hardwick N. Ford M. Jacobson M. Vile R.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that during evolution recognition of “dangerous” microbial molecular patterns by TLRs might have been modeled on a more ancient mechanism of responsiveness to HSPs signaling danger when released from cells undergoing unprogrammed necrotic death (8.Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 9.Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). This thesis would imply dual specificities within TLR family members able to sense both exogenous PAMPs as well as endogenous HSPs. For HSP60 this prediction was recently substantiated, because HSP60 activates innate immune cells via TLR2 and TLR4 (19.Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Hacker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Here we extended our studies to stress-inducible HSP70 known to deliver robust activation signals to macrophages and DCs (14.Moroi Y. Mayhew M. Trcka J. Hoe M.H. Takechi Y. Hartl F.U. Rothman J.E. Houghton A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4458) Google Scholar, 18.Kuppner M.C. Gastpar R. Gelwer S. Nossner E. Ochmann O. Scharner A. Issels R.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1602-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We found that inhibition of MyD88 and TRAF6 impairs the ability of HSP70 to activate RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, murine MyD88-deficient BMDC failed to produce cytokines in response to HSP70. Overall, these data imply that HSP70 activates innate immune cells via the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway. The α2-macroglobulin receptor (CD91) has been reported to function as an uptake receptor of HSP70 (24.Basu S. Binder R.J. Ramalingam T. Srivastava P.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 303-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). α2-Macroglobulin and/or other CD91 ligands present in serum may thus compete with HSP70 for CD91 and thus inhibit HSP70·APC interaction. Furthermore, we reported that the ability of HSP60 to activate DCs depends on endocytosis of HSP60 both being blocked by serum (19.Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Hacker H. Wagner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31332-31339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Here we describe recruitment of MyD88-EGFP to endosome-like vesicular structures after stimulation of macrophages with HSP70 implying that endocytosis of HSP70 may precede signaling (Fig. 3 A). This conclusion bears a caveat, because TLR2-transfected fibroblasts showed a clear and dose-dependent inhibitory effect of serum on the activity of HSP70 whereas TLR4 plus MD-2-transfected cells did not (Fig. 5 B). It could be that HSP70 activates TLR2 only upon endocytosis, whereas TLR4 is activated independently of internalization, as has been shown for CpG-DNA and LPS, respectively.2 This question needs to be addressed by analyzing whether inhibition of endocytosis differentially affects HSP70-driven activation of TLR2-transfected versus TLR4 plus MD-2-transfected cells. Experimentally, TLR2 conferred responsiveness of 293T cells to HSP70, yet TLR2-deficient BMDC responded to HSP70. Because TLR4-defective BMDC were completely unresponsive toward HSP70, we conclude that TLR2 does not autonomously function as a HSP70 receptor. Whether a coreceptor is missing or a threshold concentration for HSP70-TLR2 signaling is much higher in BMDC needs to be analyzed. As reported for HSP60 (19.Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) we show here that HSP70 also acts as an endogenous TLR ligand. It follows that during evolution TLR family members have been selected as receptors for different HSPs released from necrotic cells. Because sequences and structures are homologous only between members of a given HSP subfamily, the question arises why different HSPs engage selectively TLR2 and TLR4. This intriguing question may only be solved by analyzing TLR·HSP interactions at the molecular level. Because of its robust inflammatory response the innate immune system can now be characterized as being highly reactive to HSPs released from dying cells. Furthermore, the ancient Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway originally thought to alert toward invading pathogens turns out to additionally be a sensor of endogenous ligands. In essence, our data support the danger hypothesis (10.Matzinger P. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) because the immune system does not appear to care whether danger signals originate from the self or the non-self. In addition we anticipate practical implications. Different expression of heat-shock proteins has been described in malignantversus normal human tissue (12.Somersan S. Larsson M. Fonteneau J.F. Basu S. Srivastava P. Bhardwaj N. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4844-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene transfer of HSP70 into B16 and CMT93 melanoma cells enhanced tumor immunogenicity (29.Melcher A. Todryk S. Hardwick N. Ford M. Jacobson M. Vile R.G. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Our finding that HSP70 activates the Toll/IL-1 receptor signal pathway classifies HSP70 as an endogenous natural adjuvant, similar to LPS. It follows that the immunogenicity of tumors, at least in part, may be linked to their ability to release the endogenous adjuvant HSP70. The notion that typing of individual tumors for their endogenous HSP70 content represents a basis for therapeutic protocols aimed at increasing HSP70 release and thus tumor immunogenicity needs to be analyzed.

In this study, we show that the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway plays an important role in the regulation of Bax subcellular localization. We found that LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, blocked the effects of serum to prevent Bax translocation to mitochondria and that expression of an active form of PI3K suppressed staurosporine-induced Bax translocation, suggesting that PI3K activity is essential for retaining Bax in the cytoplasm. In contrast, both U0126, a MEK inhibitor, and active MEK had little effect on Bax localization. In respect to downstream effectors of PI3K, we found that expression of active Akt, but not serum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (SGK), suppressed staurosporine-induced translocation of Bax, whereas dominant negative Akt moderately promoted Bax translocation. Expression of Akt did not alter the levels of Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or phosphorylated JNK under the conditions used, suggesting that there were alternative mechanisms for Akt in the suppression of Bax translocation. Collectively, these results suggest that the PI3K-Akt pathway inhibits Bax translocation from cytoplasm to mitochondria and have revealed a novel mechanism by which the PI3K-Akt pathway promotes survival.

Apoptosis plays a critical role in the normal development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis (1.Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar, 2.Meier P. Finch A. Evan G. Nature. 2000; 407: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The regulation of mitochondrial membrane integrity and the release of cytochromec from mitochondria are important processes during apoptosis (3.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar) and are controlled by the Bcl-2 family (5.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar, 6.Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family includes both pro- and antiapoptotic members that possess up to four conserved Bcl-2 homology domains designated BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (5.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar,6.Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Many of the antiapoptotic members, including Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, contain all four domains, whereas the proapoptotic members, including Bax and Bak, lack the BH4 domain, and the other proapoptotic members, so-called “BH3 domain only proteins,” including Bid, Bim and Bad, contain only the BH3 domain. One of the intriguing aspects of the Bcl-2 family is their subcellular localization and translocation. For example, antiapoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and proapoptotic members such as Bak localize predominantly at mitochondria and regulate the mitochondrial membrane integrity and cytochrome c release. On the other hand, other proapoptotic members such as Bax, Bid, and Bad reside in cytoplasm in healthy cells (5.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). In response to apoptotic stimuli, these cytosolic proapoptotic members redistribute to mitochondria and promote cytochrome c release. For example, active caspase-8 cleaves p22 Bid into p15 Bid, which translocates to mitochondria (7.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 8.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). For Bad, the localization is regulated by phosphorylation; survival signals induce phosphorylation of Bad, resulting in 14-3-3 binding and sequestration from its mitochondrial target, Bcl-XL (9.Datta S.R.

Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Therefore, the loss of survival signals translocates Bad to mitochondria through dephosphorylation (11.Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. McKeon F. Bobo T.

After translocation to mitochondria, Bax induces cytochromec release either by forming a pore through oligomerization or by opening a channel called voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) 1The abbreviations used are: VDACvoltage-dependent anion channelNGFnerve growth factorILinterleukinPI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinasePtdInsphosphatidylinositolSGKserum and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolGFPgreen fluorescent proteinJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinasePDK3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinasevia direct interaction (13.Saito M.

Recent studies have suggested that Akt inhibits apoptosis at a premitochondrial level because it inhibits cytochrome c release and alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential (41.Kennedy S.G.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1406-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which Akt inhibits the premitochondrial events of apoptosis are not fully understood (41.Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In this study, we asked which molecules activated by growth factors are responsible for regulation of Bax subcellular localization. We found that PI3K activity is essential for retaining Bax in the cytoplasm and also demonstrated that Akt, but not SGK, is capable of suppressing Bax translocation to mitochondria. These results suggest that the PI3K-Akt pathway plays a critical role in inhibiting Bax translocation to mitochondria. We obtained LY294002 from Calbiochem, U0126 from Promega, staurosporine from ICN Biomedicals, MitoTracker CMXRos, Hoechst33258, and Hoechst33342 from Molecular Probes, and Z-VAD-CH2DCB from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Mouse Bax cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into EcoRI and KpnI sites of pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH). The constructs encoding p35, constitutively active Akt (myristylated Akt lacking the pleckstrin homology domain, residues 4–125), dominant negative (3A) Akt with a K179A/T308A/S473A mutation, p110CAAX (the membrane-targeted catalytic subunit of PI3K), constitutively active MEK with a S218D/S222D mutation, constitutively active SGK with a S422D mutation, dominant negative (2A) SGK with a T256A/S422A mutation, and FKHRL1 have been described previously (33.Park J.

DsRed-Mit was constructed by inserting synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning a mitochondrial targeting sequence of human cytochrome c oxidase into BamHI and NheI sites of the pDsRed-N1 vector (CLONTECH). HeLa cells were incubated with 50 μm Z-VAD-CH2DCB in the absence of serum for 6 h, treated with or without 10 μm LY294002 or 10 μm U0126 for 30 min, and then stimulated with 10% serum. After 10 or 90 min, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lysed in an extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin), and then subjected to immunoblotting. COS-1 cells were transfected with GFP-Bax and p35 together with various constructs using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 h. Cells were next treated with 1 μm staurosporine for 3 or 6 h and then subjected to immunoblotting. HeLa cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were incubated with or without 50 μmZ-VAD-CH2DCB in the absence of serum for 6 h, treated with or without 10 μm LY294002 or 10 μmU0126 for 30 min, and then stimulated with 10% serum. After 48 h, cells were pretreated with 100 nm MitoTracker CMXRos for 30 min, washed with PBS, and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were soaked with a blocking solution (PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.4% Triton X-100) for 30 min and incubated with anti-Bax antibody for 1 h and then with Alexa-488 anti-rat IgG antibody for 30 min in the blocking solution. The cells exhibiting strong punctate staining of Bax, which overlapped with the distribution of MitoTracker CMXRos, were counted as the cells with mitochondrially localized Bax. These cells usually had very low levels of diffuse Bax staining in the cytoplasm. COS-1 cells were transfected with GFP-Bax and p35 together with various constructs and incubated for 10 h. Cells were then treated with 10 μm LY294002, 10 μm U0126, or staurosporine for the indicated times. The localization of GFP-Bax was detected by fluorescence microscope. COS-1 cells were transfected with various constructs for 1 day and treated with 1 μmstaurosporine for the indicated times. Then the cells were washed with PBS, scraped into an isotonic buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with the protease inhibitors described above, and homogenized using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect a heavy membrane pellet, which contained mitochondria. The pellet was washed with the isotonic buffer and resuspended into RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors, and the debris was then removed by a brief centrifugation. Recent studies have suggested that some survival-promoting conditions can suppress Bax translocation to mitochondria (20.Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.D. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 26.Putcha G.V. Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether serum treatment can also suppress Bax translocation in HeLa cells because serum is known to promote survival. To examine this, intracellular localization of endogenous Bax was detected by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 1, Bax localized diffusely in the cytoplasm in the presence of serum. In contrast, serum deprivation induced Bax translocation from cytoplasm to mitochondria as revealed by localization of Bax at mitochondria visualized by a mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker CMXRos (Fig. 1, A and B). Addition of 50 μm Z-VAD-CH2DCB, a wide spectrum caspase inhibitor, had little effect on Bax translocation induced by serum deprivation (data not shown). These results demonstrated that serum is necessary for retaining Bax in the cytoplasm and that Bax translocation by serum deprivation is a caspase-independent event. It has been shown that the PI3K-Akt pathway and the MAPK pathway play important roles in growth factor-promoted cell survival by inhibiting several steps of apoptosis signaling depending on cell types and contexts (28.Datta S.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether it also inhibits premitochondrial steps, including Bax translocation and cytochrome c release. On the other hand, active Akt has been shown to inhibit UV-induced cytochrome crelease in Rat1 fibroblasts (41.Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), whereas PI3K activity has been reported to be dispensable for NGF-mediated suppression of Bax translocation in sympathetic neurons (45.Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Putcha G.V. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7228-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it remains unclear so far which molecules are responsible for growth factor suppression of Bax translocation to mitochondria. To examine whether PI3K or MEK (the activator of MAPK) mediates serum suppression of Bax translocation, HeLa cells were treated with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, or with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, in the presence of serum. Treatment with 10 μm LY294002 resulted in the promotion of Bax translocation to mitochondria (Fig. 2B) under the conditions in which phosphorylation of Akt, but not of MAPK, was effectively blocked (Fig. 2A). In contrast, treatment with 10 μmU0126, which effectively blocked MAPK phosphorylation under the same conditions, had no effect on Bax localization (Fig. 2, A andB). These results suggest that PI3K, but not MEK, is required for retaining Bax in the cytoplasm of serum-stimulated HeLa cells. Under the same experimental conditions, both serum deprivation and LY294002 treatment resulted in induction of apoptosis in the absence of caspase inhibitor as judged by pyknotic nuclei, whereas U0126 treatment did not (Fig. 2C, left panel). Moreover, most of the cells with mitochondrial endogenous Bax exhibited pyknotic nucleus, whereas most of the cells with cytoplasmic Bax displayed healthy nucleus (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results confirmed that Bax translocation correlated well with apoptosis in the system analyzed. To further examine whether PI3K activity is important for retaining Bax in the cytoplasm, we utilized a GFP-Bax fusion protein to monitor Bax localization in real time. In all experiments using GFP-Bax, p35, a pan-caspase inhibitor, was co-transfected to protect cells from undergoing apoptosis because ectopic expression of Bax results in activation of the caspase cascade, which might amplify the upstream apoptotic signals of Bax translocation (46.Gao C.F. Ren S. Zhang L. Nakajima T. Ichinose S. Hara T. Koike K. Tsuchida N. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 265: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In control and U0126 (10 μm)-treated COS-1 cells, GFP-Bax typically displayed a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, GFP-Bax gradually redistributed to mitochondria in response to LY294002 (10 μm) treatment (Fig. 3, A andB). These results suggest that endogenous PI3K activity, but not MEK activity, is necessary for retaining GFP-Bax in the cytoplasm in this system as well. We next investigated whether activation of PI3K is sufficient for inhibiting Bax translocation induced by staurosporine treatment. Staurosporine induced GFP-Bax translocation to mitochondria within several hours, but expression of p110CAAX, a membrane-targeted catalytic subunit of PI3K, resulted in a marked inhibition of Bax translocation (Fig. 3, A andC). In contrast, expression of active MEK with a S218D/S222D mutation had no effect on Bax translocation (Fig. 3, A andD). These results suggest that activation of PI3K is sufficient for retaining Bax in the cytoplasm of COS-1 cells. To dissect the downstream pathway of PI3K, we first tested whether Akt suppresses Bax translocation as Akt often mediates the effects of PI3K in promoting survival (28.Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar, 30.Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). In fact, our results suggest that Akt plays an essential role in serum promotion of survival in the system analyzed (see Fig. 4D). We found that expression of active Akt, which had a myristylation sequence at the N terminus and lacked the pleckstrin homology domain, inhibited GFP-Bax translocation to mitochondria induced by staurosporine treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). In addition, a dominant negative Akt (3A), with a K179A/T308A/S473A mutation, enhanced GFP-Bax translocation moderately but reproducibly (Fig. 4C). A previous study has shown that expression of active Akt decreases the levels of Bax protein induced by nitric oxide in primary hippocampal neurons (47.Matsuzaki H. Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Miyake S. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2037-2046PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this study, the levels of endogenous Bax and GFP-Bax did not alter by expression of Akt (Fig. 5), suggesting that Akt suppression of Bax translocation is not due to a reduction of Bax protein. In primary hippocampal neurons and IL-3-dependent Baf-3 cells, the PI3K-Akt pathway has been shown to induce Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which play critical roles in promoting survival of these cells (47.Matsuzaki H. Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Miyake S. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2037-2046PubMed Google Scholar,48.Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Mathieu A.L. Low W. Blanquier B. Marvel J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that expression of Bcl-2 is capable of inhibiting etoposide- and Fas-induced Bax translocation to mitochondria (17.Nomura M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Narita M. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Murphy K.M. Streips U.N. Lock R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17225-17228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Akt inhibition of Bax translocation is mediated by an increase in the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins. However, the expression of active Akt did not alter the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins under the conditions used in this study (Fig. 5), indicating that the suppression of Bax translocation by Akt is not due to increased expression of these antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.Figure 5Akt does not affect the protein levels of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL. COS-1 cells were transfected with GFP-Bax and p35 together with various constructs and incubated for 10 h. The transfection efficiency was about 75%, measured by monitoring the expression of GFP-Bax. Cells were treated with 1 μm staurosporine for 3 h and then subjected to immunoblotting with anti-Bax, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bcl-XL, and anti-tubulin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further confirm the effects of Akt on Bax translocation, localization of endogenous Bax was assessed by subcellular fractionation after transfection of Akt constructs. As shown in Fig. 6, 6 h of staurosporine treatment in control (vector-transfected) cells increased the levels of Bax in the mitochondrial fraction. Twelve hours of staurosporine treatment resulted in redistribution of ∼30% of endogenous Bax to the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 6). In contrast, little Bax protein was detected in the mitochondrial fraction when active Akt, but not kinase-negative (3A) Akt, was expressed in up to 12 h of staurosporine treatment (Fig. 6). The level of the VDAC in the mitochondrial fraction did not alter. These results suggest that active Akt inhibits endogenous Bax translocation to mitochondria. SGK, another downstream effector of PI3K-PDK1, is a kinase structurally related to Akt and has a substrate specificity very similar to Akt (33.Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Because SGK also appears to play a role in promoting cell survival (33.Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 44.Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), we examined the possible involvement of SGK in regulation of Bax localization. Expression of active SGK, with a S422D mutation, did not inhibit GFP-Bax translocation to mitochondria induced by staurosporine treatment (Fig. 7A). In addition, a dominant negative (2A) SGK, with a T256A/S422A mutation, did not enhance Bax translocation (Fig. 7B). We confirmed the expression of these SGK mutants by immunoblotting and phosphorylation of co-transfected FKHRL1, a substrate of SGK (Fig. 7C). Therefore, SGK appears not to mediate the effect of PI3K in suppressing Bax translocation. In sympathetic neurons, NGF inhibits premitochondrial steps of apoptosis signaling (26.Putcha G.V. Deshmukh M. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7476-7485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Tsui-Pierchala et al.(45.Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Putcha G.V. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7228-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that PI3K activity is required for inhibiting an early death event proximal to c-Jun phosphorylation (most likely catalyzed by JNK) but not for inhibiting Bax translocation in NGF suppression of apoptosis. However, in COS-1 cells, activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway did not block staurosporine-induced JNK activation (Fig. 8) but did antagonize the staurosporine-induced Bax translocation (Fig. 4), suggesting that the main targets of the PI3K pathway in these two systems are different. Because our data indicate that activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway is sufficient for inhibiting Bax translocation, it is plausible that there is a redundant pathway in addition to the PI3K pathway downstream of NGF to block Bax translocation. The molecular mechanism of Bax subcellular redistribution is a matter of controversy. Previous reports have suggested that it involves conformational change of Bax induced by cytosolic alkalization and Bax dimerization (27.Khaled A.R. Kim K. Hofmeister R. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14476-14481Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 49.Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). However, we found that GFP-Bax translocation was not induced by cytoplasmic pH values ranging between 6.6 and 8.6 when adjusted by nigericin, a proton ionophore, and extracellular pH (data not shown). In addition, it has been shown by NMR experiments that no conformational change of Bax can be detected within a potential intracellular pH range (50.Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). These data may suggest that there is no direct link between intracellular pH change and Bax translocation to mitochondria. Therefore, we do not assume that Akt regulates Bax localization via controlling intracellular pH. Thus far, we have not been able to determine which Akt target mediates its regulation of Bax. It is unlikely that Bax is a direct target of Akt because Bax does not contain the RXRXX(S/T) motif, the consensus sequence required for Akt phosphorylation (51.Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). How Akt regulates Bax awaits further investigation. In conclusion, we show in this study that the PI3K-Akt pathway regulates Bax translocation to mitochondria in serum-stimulated HeLa and GFP-Bax-expressing COS-1 cells. This finding may account for why Akt inhibits cytochrome c release at a premitochondrial level. Because Bax is a key molecule regulating apoptosis, our results may have revealed an important nexus between apoptotic and survival signals. We thank Drs. Masayuki Miura, Richard Roth, Brian Hemmings, Anne Brunet, and Michael Greenberg for p35, Akt, SGK, and FKHRL1 plasmids and Jun Sunayama and members of the Gotoh laboratory for encouragement and helpful discussions."

The anti-apoptotic activity of galectin-3 was also demonstrated in galectin-3-deficient mice. Peritoneal macrophages from galectin-3-deficient mice were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli than those from control mice (20Hsu D.K. Yang R.Y. Yu Z. Pan L. Salomon D.R. Fung-Leung W.P. Liu F.T.

The ability of galectin-3 to protect cells against apoptosis induced by agents working through different mechanisms suggests that galectin-3 regulates the common apoptosis commitment step. During the past decade, explosive progress has been made toward understanding the molecular basis for the regulation of the apoptosis commitment step. Two major apoptotic pathways (intrinsic and extrinsic pathways) have been defined. Intrinsic apoptotic signaling induces cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. Cytosolic cytochrome c initiates the formation of an ∼700-kDa complex called the “apoptosome,” which consists of cytochromec, caspase adaptor proteins such as Apaf-1, and caspases (21Cain K.

Apoptosome formation results in caspase activation, a commitment step for apoptosis induction. Extrinsic apoptotic signals are mediated by cell-surface death receptors, including Fas, tumor necrosis factor, and TRAIL receptor families. The death domain of the death receptor initiates the formation of the “death-inducing signaling complex,” where caspases are activated (reviewed in Ref.24Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5085) Google Scholar). Although a critical role for galectin-3 in apoptosis inhibition is now well documented, neither the functional site nor the molecular mechanism of how galectin-3 regulates apoptosis is understood. In this study, we investigate the subcellular localization of galectin-3 and its anti-apoptotic actions during intrinsic apoptosis in human breast epithelial cells (BT549). Here, we report that galectin-3 translocates to the perinuclear mitochondrial membranes and inhibits cytochrome c release following a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Whereas caspase activation is drastically down-regulated by galectin-3 overexpression in BT549 cells, exogenous cytochrome c effectively activates caspases in a cell-free system established from galectin-3-overexpressing cells. This suggests that galectin-3 protection of mitochondrial integrity is critical for its ability to down-regulate caspases. We identified synexin as a galectin-3-interacting protein using the yeast two-hybrid system and provide evidence that synexin is involved in galectin-3 translocation to the functional site for its anti-apoptotic actions. The human breast cancer cell line BT549 was obtained from Dr. E. W. Thompson (Vincent T. Lombardi Cancer Research Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D. C.). Galectin-3-transfected BT549 cells (BT549Gal-3) were previously established by introducing an expression vector containing human galectin-3 cDNA into parental BT549 cells (15Akahani S. Nangia-Makker P. Inohara H. Kim H.-R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5272-5276PubMed Google Scholar,16Kim H.-R. Lin H.M. Biliran H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4148-4154PubMed Google Scholar). The neomycin-resistant control vector-transfected BT549 cells are referred to as BT549neo. Cells were cultured using Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.5 μg/ml Fungizone in a 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were lysed in cell extract buffer (CEB) (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.03% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 10 min, and 50 μl of the cytosolic fraction was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl of caspase buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 25 μm acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA). Using a Spectra Maxi Germini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA), 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorescence, released by caspase activity, was measured at 460 nm using 360-nm excitation wavelength. Caspase activity was normalized per microgram of protein determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cells were plated on coverslips in 12-well plates. After 24 h of apoptosis induction, the cells were incubated with medium containing 250 nm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with anti-fade solution (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Fluorescent staining of the mitochondrial membrane was examined with a Nikon Labophot microscope fitted with a digital video camera (Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) or a Zeiss LSM 310 microscope in the confocal mode. Cells were harvested at 0, 24, and 48 h following treatment with 25 μm cisplatin; resuspended in ice-cold CEB containing 250 mm sucrose and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany); and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were then passed through a 26½-gauge syringe 15 times and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-cytochrome c antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The intensity of the bands was quantified using the Bio-Rad Quantity One program. Cells were cultured on coverslips to 75% confluency. Apoptosis was induced by treatment with 25 μm cisplatin for 24 h or with 0.5 μm staurosporine for 150 min or by growth factor withdrawal for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS three times, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, washed with PBS-S (PBS containing 0.1% saponin), and then incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS-S for 1 h. After six washes with PBS-S, cells were incubated with rat anti-galectin-3 antibody (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) or anti-cytochrome c antibody (clone 6H2.B4, BD PharMingen) for 2 h at room temperature. After six washes with PBS-S, the coverslips were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) for 1 h. After six washes with PBS-S, the coverslips were mounted upside down with anti-fade solution, sealed, and examined under a Zeiss LSM 310 microscope in the confocal mode. Cell lysates were prepared using SDS lysis buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), and 20% glycerol). The lysates were boiled for 5 min and then clarified by a 20-min centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein samples in SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) were boiled for 5 min and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline/Tween, the blot was incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The antigen was detected using the ECL detection system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Mitochondria were isolated as previously described (25Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N.

Briefly, BT549Gal-3 and BT549neo cells were homogenized in CEB containing 250 mm sucrose to protect mitochondria by 20 strokes using a type B Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ). Homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 3 × 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min; the pellet, which contained mitochondria, was lysed in SDS lysis buffer; and 20 μg of mitochondrial proteins was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cells were lysed in CEB using a Dounce homogenizer as previously described (26Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S.

The protein concentration of the lysate was measured using the BCA protein assay kit and adjusted to 4 μg/μl. To activate caspase, cytochromec (purified from bovine heart; Sigma) was added to cell-free extracts to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C. DEVDase activity was measured as described above. The yeast expression vector pEG202 (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), which contains the coding sequences for the LexA DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–202) and the yeast HIS3 gene, was used to express the bait fusion proteins. The galectin-3 cDNA insert containing the full-length coding sequences was excised from the previously constructed plasmid pcDNA10-galectin-3 (15Akahani S. Nangia-Makker P. Inohara H. Kim H.-R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5272-5276PubMed Google Scholar) and fused in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain. The correct orientation and in-frame fusion were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The bait plasmid containing the LexA-galectin-3 fusion protein was designated as pLG52. All yeast media were prepared as described (28Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). Minimal dropout media contained either 2% glucose (Glc) or 2% galactose (Gal) plus 2% raffinose (Raf). The dropout media lacked uracil, histidine, tryptophan, or leucine and are designated as −Ura, −His, −Trp, or −Leu, respectively. Minimal medium containing 0.16 mg/ml X-gal was used to test lacZreporter gene expression. YPD medium contained yeast extract, peptone, and 2% dextrose. The bait plasmid pLG52 was introduced intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain RFY206 (MATa his3Δ200 leu2-3lys2Δ201 ura3-52 trp1Δ::hisG) (29Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brent R. Hames B.D.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by growth on Glc−Ura−His dropout medium. Expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using both anti-LexA and anti-galectin-3 antibodies. To test whether the bait alone would activate the reporter gene LEU2, the bait strain was mated with RFY231 (MATαtrp1Δ::hisG his3 ura3-1 leu2::3Lexop-LEU2) (30Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) containing theTRP1 vector pJG4-5 (27Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar), which was also used to express the cDNA library. The number of diploids grown on Gal/Raf−Ura−His−Trp−Leu (Leu+ colony) and Gal/Raf−Ura−His−Trp (colony-forming units) plates was counted. The ratio of Leu+ colonies versus total colony-forming units was 7.5 × 10−7, indicating that the background was low and that the bait plasmid was suitable for yeast two-hybrid screening. The human prostate tumor cDNA library cloned into the pJG4-5 plasmid was obtained from OriGene Technology Inc. (Rockville, MD) and maintained in yeast strain RFY231. The bait strain was mated with the RFY231/pJG4-5 cDNA library as previously described (30Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Bartel P.L. Fields S. The Yeast Two-hybrid System. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996Google Scholar). Out of 2 × 107 diploid colony-forming units, 244 Leu+colonies were selected. Leu+ colonies were printed onto four indicator plates: Glc−Ura−His−Trp−Leu, Gal/Raf−Ura−His−Trp−Leu, Glc/X-gal−Ura−His−Trp, and Gal/Raf/X-gal−Ura−His−Trp. The colonies that showed galactose-dependent Leu+ and LacZ+ phenotypes were further analyzed. Plasmids were rescued from the galactose-dependent Leu+and LacZ+ colonies by a yeast mini-prep method as previously described (28Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Expression Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed using primers BCO1 (5′-CCA GCC TCT TGC TGA GTG GAG ATG-3′) and BCO2 (5′-GAC AAG CCG ACA ACC TTG ATT GGA G-3′) to amplify the insert. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes AluI andHaeIII to avoid sequencing identical clones. The mini-prep DNA was then transformed into Escherichia coli KC8 and purified. The purified prey plasmid DNAs from the galactose-dependent Leu+ and LacZ+colonies were introduced back into yeast strain RFY231, and transformants were mated with RFY206/pSH18-34 containing the bait plasmid pLG52 or other randomly chosen baits (LexA fusion bait plasmids pRFHM1 (32Finley Jr., R.L.

Diploids were printed onto four indicator plates as described above. The clones that specifically interacted with pLG52 but not with other baits were sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST search program. LB medium containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with an overnight culture of HMS-174 cells transformed with the plasmid containing the human galectin-3 cDNA insert. When the bacterial cells were grown to an absorbance of 0.5, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added. Cells were then incubated for an additional 4 h and harvested by centrifugation at 1250 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with PBS and suspended in 100 mmice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.241 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication; the lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 20 min; and the supernatants were passed through an asialofetuin affinity column (22, inner diameter, × 100 mm). The column was made by linking the asialofetuin to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and was well equilibrated in phosphate buffer (10 mm phosphate, 1 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.2)). The column was washed with 3–5 column volumes of phosphate buffer, and the bound protein was eluted with 0.2 m lactose. Eluted fractions were quantitated using the BCA protein assay reagent and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using anti-galectin-3 antibody. The expression plasmid pGEX-KG-synexin for the GST-synexin fusion protein was obtained from Dr. Carl E. Creutz (University of Virginia). The GST expression plasmid pGST-4T3 was obtained from Dr. Brooks (Wayne State University). The GST and GST-synexin fusion proteins were prepared as previously described (34Brownawell A.M. Creutz C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22182-22190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of the GST and GST-synexin fusion proteins was induced in E. coli XL-1Blue cells by 100 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in 50 ml of PBST1 (1× PBS with 1% Triton X-100), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 10000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml (50% slurry) of reduced GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the beads six times with PBS, the binding proteins were eluted three times with 1 ml of 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer 10K dialysis cassette (Pierce). In vitro binding of galectin-3 to synexin was examined by GST pull-down assay as previously described (35Park J.W. Voss P.G. Grabski S. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3595-3602Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, GSH-Sepharose beads were pretreated with bacterial lysates. 1 μg of GST or GST-synexin proteins in 500 μl of PBST1 was absorbed to 50 μl of the pretreated beads (50% slurry) for 2 h, and then the beads were washed three times with PBST1. Then, 1 μg of recombinant human galectin-3 proteins in 500 μl of PBST05 (1× PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100) was incubated with the GST or GST-synexin beads in the absence or presence of 20 μg of bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 2 h. In a control experiment, 1 μg of galectin-3 protein in 500 μl of PBST05 was heat-denatured by boiling for 5 min, followed by quenching on ice. After washing the beads six times with PBST05, the binding proteins were eluted with 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (5′-GGA TAG CCT GGG TAT GAC ATT C-3′), complementary to the human synexin mRNA sequences surrounding the ATG translation start site, and the control oligonucleotides containing scrambled nucleotide sequences (5′-CTT ACA GTA TGG GTC CGA TAG G-3′) were synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography at Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). To detect cells into which the oligomers were introduced, the antisense oligonucleotides were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine at the 3′-end (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with oligonucleotides using Effectene (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2 μg of antisense or scrambled oligonucleotides was mixed with 120 μl of EC buffer and 16 μl of enhancer by vortexing for 1 s, followed by incubation for 4 min at room temperature. The DNA was vortexed with 20 μl of Effectene for 1 min, followed by incubation for 10 min. The DNA/Effectene solution was mixed with 800 μl of growth medium and overlaid onto cells grown in six-well plates to 70% confluency. In control experiments, cells were treated with the Effectene mixture without oligonucleotides or with antisense or scrambled oligonucleotides without Effectene. After 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed in SDS lysis buffer for immunoblot analysis or in caspase lysis buffer for caspase activity assay. For transfection with tetramethylrhodamine-labeled antisense oligonucleotides, cells grown on a coverslip in a 12-well plate were treated with the DNA/Effectene mixture (1 μg of oligonucleotide, 60 μl of EC buffer, 8 μl of enhancer, 10 μl of Effectene, and 400 μl of medium). After 6 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium; and 24 h later, the cells were treated with 0 and 0.5 μmstaurosporine for 150 min and then stained with anti-galectin-3 antibody/FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Mitochondrial events critical for apoptosis include the disruption of electron transport, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and release of cytochrome c (23Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, 36Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar), resulting in caspase activation. To examine whether galectin-3 protects mitochondrial integrity, we stained BT549neo and BT549Gal-3 cells with MitoTracker Red, which selectively stains mitochondria and serves as a marker for the mitochondrial membrane potential (37Kim H.-R. Li Y. Luo G. Kessel D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3429-3432PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of galectin-3 in BT549Gal-3 cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.1A). Thirty-six hours of treatment with 25 μm cisplatin resulted in the loss of mitochondrial structure in BT549neo cells (Fig. 1, B andC). In contrast, the mitochondria in cisplatin-treated BT549Gal-3 cells retained the fibrillar fluorescence pattern, as observed in the untreated cells (Fig. 1, D andE), suggesting that galectin-3 overexpression protects cells against the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. As predicted from the loss of mitochondrial integrity, the immunoblot analysis of cytosolic cytochrome c showed that the level of cytochromec released from the mitochondria was elevated in BT549neo cells compared with BT549Gal-3 cells following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 1F). After 48 h of treatment, a >10-fold increase in cytosolic cytochrome c was detected in BT549neo cells, whereas only an ∼1.6-fold increase was observed in BT549Gal-3 cells. To exclude the possibility that cytochrome c was released to the cytosolic fractions during the preparation of cellular homogenates, we performed immunostaining of cytochrome c in control and apoptotic cells. The majority of BT549neo cells exhibited diffuse cytochrome c staining following treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 2B) or staurosporine (Fig. 2D) or after growth factor withdrawal (Fig. 2C). In contrast, cytochrome c staining in BT549Gal-3 cells remained punctate following the same treatment (Fig. 2, F–H). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of cells co-stained with anti-cytochrome cantibody/FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and with MitoTracker Red confirmed that cytochrome c remained in the mitochondria in BT549Gal-3 cells following apoptotic stimuli, as shown byy"

In this study, we show that TGF-β prevents pro-inflammatory cytokine production through inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB. Blockade of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling by the MEK-1/2 inhibitor PD 98059 reversed the inhibitory effects of TGF-β, suggesting that cross-talk between MAPKs is essential for this response. Further investigation indicated that TGF-β activated ERK, which in turn up-regulated MAPK phosphatase-1, thereby inactivating p38 MAPK. On the other hand, TGF-β maintained or slightly increased production of the CC chemokine MCP-1, which is regulated predominantly by AP-1. Although SB 203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, and dominant-negative p38 MAPK both increased AP-1 transcription, lack of effect of TGF-β on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated SAPK/JNK phosphorylation along with a demonstrated inhibition of TGF-β-induced AP-1 activation by dominant-negative Smad3 suggest that TGF-β-stimulated AP-1 activation was not caused by inhibition of p38 MAPK but rather through the activation of Smads.

The findings that anti-TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies largely reversed the inhibitory effect of apoptotic cell uptake and that exogenous TGF-β down-regulated the synthesis of the same pro-inflammatory mediators indicated that TGF-β plays an important role in the suppressive effect of interaction between apoptotic cells and macrophages (3.Fadok V.A.

Following activation, p38 MAPK is capable of modulating functional responses through phosphorylation of transcription factors, such as ATF-2, and activation of other kinases. It has been reported that p38 MAPK is involved in the transcriptional regulation of interleukin-1-β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 expression (25.Hobbie S. Chen L.M. Davis R.J. Galan J.E. J.

Furthermore, translational regulation of cytokine mRNA by p38 MAPK has also been suggested (28.Xiao Y.Q. Someya K. Morita H. Takahashi K. Ohuchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R.

Most of the pro-inflammatory cytokines are regulated by NF-κB, and recently, it has been found that p38 MAPK regulates NF-κB-driven gene expression, in part, by increasing the association of the basal transcriptional factor, TATA-binding protein, with the C terminus of p65 subunit of NF-κB and increasing the binding of TATA-binding protein to the TATA box (30.Carter A.B. Knudtson K.L. Monick M.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30858-30863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Previously we have demonstrated that the suppression of inflammatory mediator production (through the induction of TGF-β) in macrophages that have ingested apoptotic cells is a general phenomenon that does not depend on the nature of apoptotic target, the macrophage activation state, or the type of stimulus used (2.McDonald P.P. Fadok V.A. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed an LPS-stimulated macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, to investigate the signaling pathway used by TGF-β for inhibition of p38 MAPK and regulation of NF-κB- or AP-1-dependent transcription and hence pro-inflammatory mediator production. Using LPS to activate ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK in RAW 264.7 cells, we demonstrate that the balance between ERK and p38 MAPK is dysregulated by simultaneous TGF-β-stimulated ERK activation, which results in the up-regulation of MAPK phosphatase (MKP)-1, thereby causing the dephosphorylation of LPS-stimulated p38 MAPK. Reduced p38 MAPK activation is then associated with decreased NF-κB-driven gene transcription and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. On the other hand, under these conditions the LPS/JNK/c-Jun pathway and TGF-β/Smad pathway synergistically increased AP-1-driven gene transcription. TGF-β1 was from R & D Systems. LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) was from List Biological Laboratories. SB 203580, PD 98059, Ro 31-8220, Dapi, and 1 × Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set I were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. LipofectAMINE Plus reagent was from Invitrogen. Anti-p38 MAPK phospho-specific antibody was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Phospho-ERK (E-4), ERK-2 (K 23), p38 (c-20), MEK-3 (N-20), MEK-6 (N-19) (K-19), MKP-1 (v-15) antibodies, and recombinant fragment of activated transcription factor 2 (ATF-2-(1–96)) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody was from New England Biolabs. Rabbit anti-MKK-6 polyclonal antibody was from Chemicon International. Phospho-MKK-3/MKK-6 (Ser189/207) was from Cell Signaling. Purified anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fcγ III/II Receptor) (2.4G2) was from Pharmingen. RAW 264.7 (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated endotoxin free fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. An aliquot of each drug solution was added to the medium, and the final concentration of the vehicle in the medium was adjusted to 0.1% (v/v). The control medium contained the same amount of the vehicle. Immunoblotting analysis was carried out as described previously with some modification (24.Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L.

Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (3.0 × 105 cells/well) were plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate and incubated overnight. Following stimulation, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 × Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set I), resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with phospho-specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight and incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm equal loading of proteins in each lane, the membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C and reprobed with corresponding antibodies against the native proteins. p38 MAPK activity measurements were performed essentially as described (24.Frasch S.C.

Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate and incubated overnight. After stimulation, the cells were lysed in 500 μl of RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg/ml anti-p38 (c-20) antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction mix containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 200 μm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, and 500 ng of ATF-2-(1–96) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated with 4× Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. p38 MAPK activity was visualized as the phosphorylation of the ATF-2 fragment by autoradiography. pNF-κB-Luc (κB4, 6x, CLONTECH) and pAP-1-Luc (AP-1, 7x, Stratagene) luciferase reporter gene constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Annemie Van Linden. cDNA for p38α was amplified by PCR from an HL60 cDNA library (Stratagene) and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pBC KS− (Stratagene). The K287M mutation was made using the Altered Sites IIin vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) to produce a kinase-dead form of p38α. The resultingBamHI/XhoI fragments were inserted into pcDNA3 downstream of a FLAG epitope tag to yield dominant-negative pcDNA3-FLAG-p38(α)KM plasmid. The wild-type pXL-Smad3 and dominant-negative pXL-Smad3A were described previously (31.Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells (3.0 × 105 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum were plated in each well of a 12-well tissue culture plate and cultured overnight. Transfection was carried out by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. pSV-β-galactosidase vector (Promega) was co-transfected as internal control to measure differences in transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 4 h after LPS stimulation using a luciferase assay system (Promega) and Galacto-Light (Tropix), respectively. RAW 264.7 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in a 4-well tissue culture plate on glass coverslips and incubated overnight. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PD 98059 (50 μm) for 60 min, followed by TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 60 min. The cells were then stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 15 min and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% glutaraldehyde and 0.2% saponin. The fixed cells were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 10 μg/ml anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fcγ III/II Receptor) (2.4G2), 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature, washed once with PBS, and incubated for additional 30 min in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% saponin, and 1:100 dilution of anti-MKP-1. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% saponin, 1:1000 Dapi, and 1:1000 Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Fc fragment-specific (Jackson ImmunResearch). The cells were then rinsed three times in PBS, and the coverslips were mounted onto the slides. The mounted RAW cells were viewed with a fluorescence microscope using a 63× Zeiss water objective. Confocal images were achieved using Slidebook v.3.0.4.5 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). Previously, we demonstrated that in human macrophages or mouse J774 macrophages, apoptotic cell binding and ingestion results in the early release of TGF-β and that this cytokine contributes to the decreased production of TNF-α and several chemokines (1.Fadok V.A.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 6164-6172PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that blockade of p38 MAPK by the p38 inhibitor SB 203580 also inhibited the LPS-stimulated generation of TNF-α and MIP-2, whereas once again the CC chemokine MCP-1 was increased (Fig. 1). Because of the facts that most of the pro-inflammatory mediators are regulated by the transcription factor NF-κB and that MCP-1 is known to be regulated through AP-1 (32.Finzer P. Soto U. Delius H.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we then examined the role of TGF-β in regulating NF-κB- and AP-1-driven gene transcription by measuring NF-κB- and AP-1-dependent promoter activity. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with pNF-κB-luc or pAP-1-luc reporter construct, and 48 h later, the cells were pretreated with SB 203580 or TGF-β for 1 h. Reporter gene activity was determined 4 h after LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, LPS increased NF-κB-driven luciferase activity by 5-fold. However, in the cells pretreated with either SB 203580 or TGF-β, LPS-induced luciferase activity was markedly inhibited. In contrast, either LPS or TGF-β alone slightly increased the luciferase activity for AP-1, but the combination of LPS and TGF-β resulted in about 10-fold increase (Fig. 2 B). We next sought to confirm that p38 MAPK was involved in the regulation of NF-κB-driven gene transcription in RAW 264.7 cells. The cells were transfected with an empty vector or the dominant-negative pcDNA3-FLAG-p38(α)KM plasmid. Overexpression of the transfected p38 MAPK was evaluated using Western blot analysis based on the different molecular weights of the transfected FLAG-tagged p38 MAPK and endogenous p38 MAPK (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig. 2 D, LPS significantly increased luciferase activity for NF-κB in cells co-transfected with pNF-κB-luc and an empty vector. The luciferase activity for NF-κB was markedly suppressed in cells transfected with dominant-negative p38 MAPK. These results indicated that p38 MAPK inhibition induces a pattern of pro-inflammatory mediator regulation remarkably similar to the effect of TGF-β in macrophages. From these observations, it seemed likely that TGF-β might act in part by inhibiting p38 MAPK activation.Figure 2Effects of TGF -β on NF-κB- and AP-1-driven gene transcription.RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with pNF-κB-luc (A) or pAP-1-luc (B). After 48 h, the cells were incubated in the presence or absence of SB 203580 (10 μm) or TGF-β (10 ng/ml) for 60 min, followed by incubation with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h. C, RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with an empty vector or dominant-negative p38 MAPK expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-p38 (c-20) antibody. The results shown are representative of three experiments. D, overexpression of dominant-negative p38 MAPK inhibited NF-κB-driven gene transcription. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently co-transfected with pNF-κB-luc, together with either an empty vector or the dominant-negative p38 MAPK expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 h and harvested. All the luciferase assays, which were normalized to β-galactosidase, are expressed as fold increase from control. The values are the means ± S.E. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initially, the time course of LPS-stimulated macrophage activation was determined (Fig. 3 A). RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) at various time points before measurement of ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK phosphorylation. ERK phosphorylation was observed at 5 min, reached maximum at 15 min, and declined at 60 min. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was detectable at 5 min, reached maximum at 15 min, and declined rapidly from 30 min to control level at 60 min. Phosphorylation of JNK, however, was only observed at 15 and 30 min. Pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with TGF-β for 1 h dose-dependently inhibited LPS-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), and this effect was confirmed in p38 MAPK activity assays (Fig. 3 B, lower panel). In contrast, treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with TGF-β induced phosphorylation of ERK even in the absence of LPS. This reached a maximum at 60 min and declined at 120 min (Fig. 3 C). No detectable phosphorylation of p38 MAPK or JNK was seen with TGF-β alone (data not shown). Blockade of ERK activation by PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of its upstream activator MEK-1/2, increased the LPS-stimulated p38 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). This finding suggested that cross-talk between ERK and p38 might contribute to the TGF-β effects. In addition, inhibition of LPS-stimulated p38 MAPK by SB 203580 resulted in a reciprocal increase of ERK and JNK phosphorylation, showing the potential for cross-inhibition in the other direction (from p38 to ERK or JNK) as well (Fig. 4 A). We next examined whether TGF-β inhibits p38 MAPK by activating ERK. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the TGF-β-stimulated ERK phosphorylation was blocked by PD 98059, confirming that TGF-β stimulates ERK activation through MEK/ERK pathway. Importantly, preincubation of RAW 264.7 cells with PD 98059 for 60 min before treatment of the cells with TGF-β resulted in reversal of the TGF-β-mediated suppression of p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 4 C). These findings suggested that TGF-β inhibits p38 MAPK by activating ERK. To determine whether TGF-β inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB-driven gene transcription through effects on ERK, we transfected RAW 264.7 cells with a pNF-κB-luc plasmid and pretreated the transfected cells with PD 98059 for 60 min before TGF-β and LPS treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, PD 98059 pretreatment in the absence of TGF-β had no effect on LPS-induced luciferase activity. Consistent with the finding that PD 98059 reversed the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on p38 MAPK activation, the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on LPS-induced luciferase activity for NF-κB was completely abrogated by PD 98059 pretreatment. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on LPS-stimulated MIP-2 or TNF-α production was completely abrogated by PD 98059 pretreatment (data not shown). It has been demonstrated that MKK kinases and MKKs are the upstream activators for p38 MAPK phosphorylation (35.Nick J.A. Avdi N.J. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Worthen G.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4867-4875PubMed Google Scholar). Because both MKK-3 and MKK-6 activate p38 MAPK, we performed Western blots using a phospho-MKK-3,6 antibody to see whether the suppression of p38 MAPK by TGF-β is through its upstream activators. As shown in Fig. 6 A, LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of MKK-3 and MKK-6 (seen as a single band) reached a maximum at 15 min. To determine which of the MKKs is responsible for the LPS-stimulated phosphorylation, RAW 264.7 cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with MKK-3 or MKK-6 antibody before blotting with phospho-MKK-3,6 antibody. A detectable increase in phosphorylation of MKK-3 was observed in cells exposed to LPS when compared with unstimulated cells, whereas no phosphorylation of MKK-6 was detected (Fig. 6 B). In addition, Western blot performed on the whole cell lysates using three different MKK-6-specific antibodies (see “Antibodies and Reagents”) failed to detect the protein (data not shown), suggesting that MKK-6 is not constitutively expressed in macrophages. We next evaluated whether TGF-β also inhibits LPS-stimulated MKK-3 phosphorylation. No inhibition was seen (Fig. 6 C). To our surprise, both TGF-β and SB 203580 caused an increase in LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of MKK-3 (Fig. 6 C). These findings suggested that the blockade of p38 MAPK by TGF-β is at the level of p38 MAPK itself, e.g. not through inhibition of its upstream protein kinases. Moreover, it raises the possibility of a negative feedback loop to regulate the upstream activator MKK-3 by p38 MAPK itself. ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK activation requires dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues within the motifs TGY, TEY, and TPY, respectively (36.Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of either residue results in the complete loss of their activity. Inhibition of MAPKs is principally mediated in vivo by members of a family of dual specificity phosphatases. Among them, MPK-1 is up-regulated by ERK and preferentially inactivates p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK (37.Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 38.Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To evaluate its potential role in TGF-β-mediated p38 MAPK inhibition, we initially examined levels of MKP-1 after TGF-β treatment. TGF-β alone resulted in induction of MKP-1, which was detectable at 30 min and reached maximum at 1 h (Fig. 7 A, top panel). LPS stimulation resulted in induction of MKP-1 from 30 min (Fig. 7 A, middle panel). Pretreatment with TGF-β for 1 h before LPS stimulation caused an earlier induction of MKP-1 at 15 min and reached maximum at 30 min (Fig. 7 A, bottom panel). To determine whether TGF-β induction of MKP-1 plays a role in the inactivation of p38 MAPK, the MEK-1/2 inhibitor was first examined for its ability to prevent MKP-1 up-regulation. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the increase in MKP-1 (which is correlated with the inhibition of p38 MAPK by TGF-β was reversed by PD 98059. The effect of TGF-β in MKP-1 induction was also observed by nuclear staining. As shown in Fig. 7 C, LPS stimulation caused a slight increase in nuclear accumulation/up-regulation of MKP-1 compared with unstimulated control. TGF-β alone or in combination with LPS treatment resulted in a significant increase in nuclear accumulation of MKP-1, which was reduced to control level by PD 98059 pretreatment. It has been reported that the selective protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro 31-8220, inhibits MKP-1 expression (39.Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To further support the involvement of MKP-1 in inac"

Given that these monoclonal antibodies blocked EIIIA function we reasoned that the peptide comprising the C-C′ loop region (EDGIHEL) could encode a sequence that bound cell surface receptors, possibly integrins.

MOLT-3 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Cell adhesion assays were performed as previously described (47.Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble recombinant FN III repeats (10 μg/ml in PBS) were coated on the wells of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Corning-Costar) at 4 °C overnight. Wells were washed with PBS and blocked by 1% BSA in DMEM (for SW480) or RPMI 1640 (for MOLT-3) at 37 °C for 1 h. SW480 cells were detached using EDTA (20 mm in PBS), washed, and resuspended in serum-free DMEM. MOLT-3 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 250 μm MnCl2. For blocking experiments, cells were preincubated either with Y9A2 (10 μg/ml) or P4C2 (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 15 min or with various concentrations of synthetic peptides for 30 min at 4 °C before plating. Cell suspensions (100 μl/well of 50,000 cells/ml in serum-free medium with 0.5% BSA) either with or without pretreatments were then plated directly into wells. Plates were centrifuged (top side up) at 10 × g for 5 min followed by incubation for 1 h (for SW480) or 90 min (for MOLT-3) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Nonadherent cells were removed by centrifugation (top side down) at 48 × g for 5 min. Adherent cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v in 1% formaldehyde and 20% methanol) for 1 h at room temperature followed by washes with PBS. Stained cells were dissolved by 2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined in a ThermoMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA). Experiments were conducted in triplicate and included BSA-coated wells as a blank. When EIIIA-specific mAbs were employed as the competitors for cell adhesion, EIIIA-coated wells were pretreated with various dilutions of these mAbs as denoted in figure legends. Unbound antibodies were removed by washes with PBS prior to the addition of cells. Alternatively, the EIIIA proteins (1 μm in PBS) were covalently linked to maleic anhydride Reacti-Bind microplates at 4 °C overnight. Protein-coated wells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS) (106 cells/ml) and labeled with 2 μm BCECF-AM (2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluoresceintetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester) at room temperature for 30 min. Labeled cells were then washed with serum-free DMEM and resuspended in 0.5% BSA-DMEM. Prior to plating, MOLT-3 cells were pretreated with 250 μmMnCl2 on ice for 30 min. Cells (5 × 104cells/well) were allowed to adhere to the coated wells at 37 °C for 60 min (for SW480 cells) or 90 min (for MOLT-3 cells). Nonadherent cells were removed by centrifugation (top side down) at 48 ×g. Adherent cells were resuspended in 200 μl of DMEM (SW480 cells) or RPMI 1640 (MOLT-3 cells), and fluorescence was quantified with a fluorometric plate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation wavelength 485 nm and emission wavelength 538 nm. GST-tagged wild type and deletion mutants of the EIIIA segment were purified as previously described (26.Liao Y.-F. Wieder K.G. Classen J.M. Van De Water L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17876-17884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteins were re-attached to 200 μl of glutathione-agarose (50% slurry) in microfuge tubes at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation, followed by three washes with PBS. Bovine thrombin (100 μl of 100 unit/ml) was added to protein-attached agarose beads and incubated at room temperature for 2–4 h. Cleaved EIIIA segments were separated from glutathione-agarose beads by centrifugation, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of AEBSF (100 mm). The purity of the cleaved EIIIA segments was examined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Protein concentrations of the cleaved products were quantified by the BCA protein assay reagent kit. To test MAP kinase activation, MOLT-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with SITE+3 serum replacement medium for 3 days. Anti-α4integrin mAb (HP2/1, 2 μg/ml) and histidine-tagged EIIIA segment (100 μg/ml) were coated onto 6-well plates (1 ml/well) at 4 °C overnight. On the day of the experiment, MOLT-3 cells were washed with RPMI 1640 and resuspended in RPMI 1640,0.5% BSA at 2 × 106 cells/ml. This was followed by pretreatment with 250 μm MnCl2 at 4 °C for 30 min prior to plating. Protein-coated wells were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS. Mn2+-treated MOLT-3 cells were layered onto the protein-coated wells, allowed to settle at 4 °C for 30 min, and then brought to 37 °C for the time specified before being placed on ice. After the reactions were terminated, the medium was aspirated and nonadherent cells were removed by brief centrifugation (plate inverted) at 48 × g. Adherent cells were lysed in ice-cold cell extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were scraped off the plates and transferred to microfuge tubes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min following extensive vortexing. Postnuclear supernatants were collected and analyzed by Western blotting as described below. Clarified cell extracts were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% dithiothreitol, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. Samples were then analyzed by Western blotting (26.Liao Y.-F. Wieder K.G. Classen J.M. Van De Water L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17876-17884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved in precast Tris glycine polyacrylamide gels (4–20%) (Invitrogen) in duplicate. Separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were treated with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) at room temperature for 2 h. Following a brief rinse, one of the duplicate membranes was probed with an anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody, and the other was probed with an anti-p44/42 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution in SuperBlock (Pierce), respectively) for 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by washes in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). Subsequently, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 in SuperBlock) at room temperature for 1 h. Following three washes in PBST, the immunoblots were then incubated with Supersignal (Pierce) chemiluminescence substrate for 5 min and exposed to a phosphor cassette. Images of the blots were processed with the Molecular Image System GS-525 using Multi-Analysis software version 1.1 (Bio-Rad). Sequence comparisons revealed that the C-C′ loop region within the EIIIA segment resembled the ligand binding site for integrin α9β1 in the third FN-III repeat of tenascin-C. This finding prompted us to determine whether or not the EIIIA segment could be a novel ligand for integrin α9β1. We conducted cell adhesion assays with SW480 cells that had been stably transfected with either an α9-expression plasmid (SW-α9) or empty vector (SW-mock) (46.Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wells were coated with recombinant fusion proteins representing either the EIIIA segment alone or the fourth type III repeat, FN-III4, alone. Cells were then allowed to adhere to coated wells either in the presence or absence of Mn2+, and the specificity of α9β1-mediated adhesion was evaluated by an α9β1-blocking mAb, Y9A2. We found that the SW-α9 cells exhibited significant adhesion to the EIIIA segment but not to FN-III4, and this adhesion was blocked by Y9A2 (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, this inhibition was specific for α9β1. Neither anti-α5 nor anti-αvβ5blocking antibody inhibited this adhesion (Fig. 1 A, inset), and SW-mock transfected cells that express native α2β1, α3β1, α5β1, αvβ1, and αvβ5 did not adhere to EIIIA-coated wells (Fig. 1 B) or FN-III4 (inset). Pretreatment with Mn2+ did not significantly enhance the adhesion of either SW-mock or SW-α9 cells to EIIIA (Fig. 1 B) or to FN-III4 (inset). The α9-mediated adhesion to EIIIA was strictly dependent on the concentration of EIIIA used to coat the wells (Fig. 1 C). A number of ligands for α9β1, including osteopontin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF), tissue transglutaminase (tTG), and blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), have also been observed to bind the closely related integrin α4β1. Because the EIIIA segment bound α9-transfected cells, we sought to determine whether or not α4β1 also served as a receptor for the EIIIA segment. MOLT-3 cells were used because of their significant expression of α4β1 and their lack of α9β1 (37.Takahashi H. Isobe T. Horibe S. Takagi J. Yokosaki Y. Sheppard D. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23589-23595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mn2+-pretreated MOLT-3 cells significantly adhered to the EIIIA segment but only minimally to FN-III4. MOLT-3 cells without the pretreatment of Mn2+ did not adhere to either FN segment (Fig. 2 A). The adhesion of Mn2+-treated MOLT-3 cells to the EIIIA segment was blocked by an anti-α4 mAb, P4C2 (Fig. 2 A). Complete inhibition of MOLT-3 cells adhesion to the EIIIA segment was observed with either anti-α4 and anti-β1 blocking antibodies or with CS-1 peptide, a specific ligand for integrin α4 (Fig. 2 B), indicating that this adhesion was specifically mediated by integrin α4β1rather than other β1 integrins. Several mAbs to EIIIA have been shown to block the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as well as the process of chondrogenesis (see Introduction). The epitopes for these EIIIA-specific mAbs reside in the C-C′ loop of EIIIA (26.Liao Y.-F. Wieder K.G. Classen J.M. Van De Water L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17876-17884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To examine whether and to what extent these mAbs blocked α9β1- and α4β1-mediated cell attachment to the EIIIA segment, we preincubated the EIIIA segment with either monoclonal antibodies IST-9 or 3E2. We observed a dramatic inhibition of the adhesion of either SW-α9 or MOLT-3 to the EIIIA segment (Fig. 3). These data provide further support for a specific interaction between the EIIIA segment and integrins α9β1 and α4β1. These results also raise the possibility that the ligand binding sites within EIIIA for α9β1 and α4β1include the C-C′ loop region. To define further the sequences within the EIIIA segment essential for the binding of integrins α9β1 and α4β1, we tested whether and to what extent these integrins mediated cell binding to a panel of EIIIA deletion mutants previously generated (26.Liao Y.-F. Wieder K.G. Classen J.M. Van De Water L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17876-17884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). These deletion mutants of the EIIIA segment were generated as GST-tagged recombinant proteins. Their GST tags were subsequently removed by thrombin cleavage to eliminate possible interference of the GST moiety in adhesion assays. SW-α9 cells exhibited significant adhesion to the wild type EIIIA segment and six other deletion mutants examined, though the levels of adhesion to each deletion construct varied (Fig. 5 A). Adhesion to all fragments was inhibited by Y9A2 and reduced to the basal levels observed with the SW-mock cells. Interestingly, two of the shorter deletion mutants, EIIIA24–66 and EIIIA30–57, which include the C-C′ sequence, supported adhesion, albeit at reduced levels, suggesting that the optimal ligand binding site for α9β1 in the EIIIA segment could require both the C-C′ loop and additional flanking sequences. These differences were not due to differential adhesion of the deletion mutant to plastic. Significant SW-α9 cell adhesion to deletion mutants was also observed when thrombin-cleaved fusion proteins were coupled covalently to plastic using maleic anhydride-activated microtiter plates (data not shown).Figure 5The differential adhesion of cells expressing integrin α9β1or α4β1to the deletion mutants of the EIIIA segment. Wild type (WT) and deletion mutants (EIIIA1–66,EIIIA17–66, EIIIA17–90, EIIIA30–90,EIIIA24–66, and EIIIA30–57) of the EIIIA segment (1 μm in PBS) were coated on 96-well microtiter plates at 4 °C overnight. The amino acids included in truncated mutant rat EIIIA segment are numbered from their N to C termini as denoted. A, transfected SW480 cells were allowed to attach to protein-coated wells at 37 °C for 60 min followed by the removal of nonadherent cells by centrifugation. For blocking experiments, SW-α9 cells were pretreated with anti-α9mA"

In addition to its role in muscle contraction, its juxtaposition to the plasma membrane suggests additional functions of the Z-disc in sensing and transmitting external and internal signals. Recently, we described two novel striated muscle-specific proteins, calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2, that bind α-actinin on the Z-disc and serve as intracellular binding proteins for calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase shown to be integral in cardiac hypertrophy as well as skeletal muscle differentiation and fiber-type specification. Here, we describe an additional member of the calsarcin family, calsarcin-3, which is expressed specifically in skeletal muscle and is enriched in fast-twitch muscle fibers. Like calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2, calsarcin-3 interacts with calcineurin, and the Z-disc proteins α-actinin, γ-filamin, and telethonin. In addition, we show that calsarcins interact with the PDZ-LIM domain protein ZASP/Cypher/Oracle, which also localizes to the Z-disc.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar and 2.Faulkner G. Lanfranchi G. Valle G. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The Z-disc delineates the border of the individual sarcomeric unit and cross-links thin filaments via antiparallel binding of filamentous actin to α-actinin, thereby providing a means to transmit force longitudinally. The Z-disc not only serves as the interface of the sarcomere and the cytoskeleton via association with intermediate filament proteins such as desmin, but it also resides in close proximity to the plasma membrane and its associated receptors and ion channels, suggesting that it has additional functions in the transmission and sensing of external and internal signals. Given this central role in the structural integrity and function of striated muscle, it is not surprising that mutations in several proteins that are either Z-disc components or bind to Z-disc proteins have been implicated in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and/or muscular dystrophy, including actin (3.Olson T.M.

Moreover, several loss of function studies in genetically engineered mice demonstrate the central importance of additional Z-disc proteins in muscle; targeted ablation of muscle LIM protein (MLP) leads to severe myofibrillar disarray with subsequent dilated cardiomyopathy (8.Arber S.

Z-disc alternatively spliced PDZ motif protein hemagglutinin limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Calcineurin is a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, which plays an important role in striated muscle signal transduction (for review, see Ref. 11.Olson E.N.

Its function has been studied most extensively in T-lymphocytes, where it dephosphorylates members of the nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) family of transcription factors, resulting in their nuclear translocation and activation of target genes. In cardiac muscle, calcineurin has been shown to be activated by hypertrophic agonists such as angiotensin II (12.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), as well as intrinsic defects of the sarcomere (13.Sussman M.A. Welch S. Gude N. Khoury P.R.

Constitutive activation of calcineurin in hearts of transgenic mice is sufficient to induce severe hypertrophy, ultimately leading to heart failure and sudden death. In skeletal muscle, calcineurin activation has been shown to promote differentiation and fiber-type specialization toward a slow-twitch program (14.Delling U. Tureckova J. Lim H.W. De Windt L.J.

Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 12: 2499-2509Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify tissue-specific modulators of calcineurin signaling, we previously conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen with the catalytic subunit of calcineurin as bait and discovered the first two members of a novel striated muscle-specific protein family, calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Calsarcin-1 is expressed in cardiac muscle and oxidative skeletal muscle fibers (types I and IIa), while in the adult, calsarcin-2 is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle and predominantly in fast-twitch fibers. Calsarcin-2 has also been independently reported as FATZ (filamin-, actinin-, and telethonin-binding protein of the Z-disc) (17.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Comelli A. Salamon M. Bortoletto G. Ievolella C. Treviisan S. Kojic S. Vecchia F.D. Laveder P. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Biol.

Beggs A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1595-1600PubMed Google Scholar). Calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 proteins bind calcineurin and are localized to the Z-disc, suggesting that they direct its subcellular localization in striated muscle cells, which may be critical to activate calcineurin and to associate it with its downstream effectors. Here we describe calsarcin-3, the third member of the calsarcin family, which is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and is enriched in fast-twitch muscle fibers. Similar to calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2, calsarcin-3 interacts with calcineurin and Z-disc proteins such as α-actinin, γ-filamin, and telethonin. In addition, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify novel calsarcin-binding proteins in skeletal muscle and found that calsarcins also interact with ZASP (19.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J.

Dev. 2000; 92: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggest that calsarcin family proteins may serve a dual role by linking key Z-disc proteins such as α-actinin, γ-filamin, and telethonin and localizing calcineurin signaling to the sarcomere. A human genomic DNA data base (GenBankTM) was searched with the calsarcin-1 protein sequence using the tBlastN algorithm of the BLAST search program to identify potential calsarcin-related sequences. A cDNA fragment encoding calsarcin-3 was cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) utilizing a human skeletal muscle library (CLONTECH). This fragment was subsequently used to screen 5 × 106 clones of the same library for calsarcin-3 full-length cDNA. In addition, a mouse skeletal muscle bacteriophage cDNA library (CLONTECH, λTriplEx2) was screened for mouse calsarcin-3 with a probe corresponding to its open reading frame. Multiple tissue Nothern Blots (CLONTECH) containing mouse and human poly(A)+ RNA were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes corresponding to the open reading frame of mouse and human calsarcin-3, respectively. Serial washes were conducted with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C for 24–48 h with an intensifying screen. A peptide consisting of the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids (NH2-MIPKEQKEPVMAVPGDLAEPVP-COOH) of calsarcin-3 was synthesized (Biosynthesis) and used to generate antisera in rabbits. The NH2 terminus was chosen to generate an isoform-specific antiserum, since this part of the protein does not display significant homology to the other two calsarcin family members (Fig. 1B). IgG was purified from rabbit serum using protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and subsequently used for immunostaining of skeletal muscle cryosections. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. 2 × 105 cells were transfected with 1 μg of expression plasmids for full-length and truncated forms of calsarcin-1, calsarcin-2, and calsarcin-3, calcineurin A-α, α-actinin-2, γ-filamin (amino acids 2133–2725, a fragment that we have previously identified to be sufficient to mediate interaction with calsarcin-2 in yeast (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)), 2N. Frey and E. N. Olson, unpublished observations. telethonin and ZASP, respectively, using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Calsarcin peptides were fused with a NH2-terminal HA-epitope or a COOH-terminal Myc-epitope as indicated. Calcineurin, α-actinin-2, γ-filamin, telethonin, and ZASP were fused with NH2-terminal FLAG-epitopes. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in ELB buffer, containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 250 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were briefly sonicated, and debris was removed by centrifugation. Tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2–3 h at 4 °C using protein A/G-agarose and 1 μg of the appropriate antibody (monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), monoclonal anti-Myc, and polyclonal anti-HA (both Santa Cruz)). Subsequently, the pellet was washed with ELB buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene membranes and immunoblotting using anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, or anti-HA-antibodies, as indicated. A full-length human calsarcin-1 cDNA, fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (plasmid pAS1, CLONTECH), was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of approximetaly 1 × 106 clones of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH), as described (12.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). Briefly, clones displaying differential growth on selective plates, lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, were picked and replated for β-galactosidase assays. Positive clones were grown in selective medium lacking leucine, and plasmid DNA was isolated and subsequently electroporated into DH10B Escherichia coli(Invitrogen). The obtained clones were sequenced and retransformed with the calsarcin-1 construct to confirm the interaction. In addition, one of the identified clones, full-length ZASP/Cypher-2/Oracle, was cloned into the GAL4-DNA-binding domain-containing vector pAS1 and tested for β-galacosidase activation with human calsarcin-1, calsarcin-2, calsarcin-3, and α-actinin, which were cloned into pACT2 (CLONTECH), containing a cassette encoding the GAL4-transactivation domain. The subcellular localization of calsarcin-3 was determined in cryosections of mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle tissue using indirect immunofluorescence. Cryosections were air-dried and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and blocking in 3% horse serum for 1 h. Primary antibodies (BSYN2021 (polyclonal anti-calsarcin-3) at a dilution of 1:100, monoclonal anti-sarcomeric actinin (Sigma) at 1:200, monoclonal anti-skeletal myosin slow (1:1000) and fast (1:100) (Sigma)) were incubated for 1 h. Secondary antibodies conjugated to either fluorescein or Texas Red (Vector laboratories) were also incubated for 1 h at a dilution of 1:250. An in silico search of the data base (GenBankTM) using the tBLASTN algorithm with the calsarcin-1 protein sequence revealed two genomic fragments on human chromosome 5 that contained two highly homologous sequence stretches encoding a calsarcin-related protein we named calsarcin-3 (GenBankTM accession numbers AC022091 andAC008453). Primers matching these sequences were designed to PCR-amplify a partial cDNA (∼350 bp) from human skeletal muscle cDNA. Subsequently, this fragment was used as a probe to isolate a full-length cDNA from a human skeletal muscle library. We identified and sequenced multiple identical cDNA clones, encompassing a 1.0-kb transcript (GenBankTM accession number AF480443), that predicts an open reading frame of 251 amino acids (Fig. 1). The 5′-end of the open reading frame matches a human brain expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession numbers AL037981/AL037982). However, this expressed sequence tag predicts a premature stop codon, presumably due to the presence of unspliced intronic sequences. According to the draft of the human genome, calsarcin-3 maps to chromosome 5q31 and encompasses 7 exons, spanning ∼19 kb (data not shown). Mouse calsarcin-3 cDNA was cloned by screening a mouse skeletal muscle bacteriophage library. Four independent overlapping clones of a combined length of 913 bp were identified, predicting a single open reading frame of 245 amino acids (GenBankTM accession number AF480442). Sequence comparison revealed 75% identity between human and mouse calsarcin-3 (Fig. 1A). As previously described for calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), calsarcin-3 also displays the highest amino acid homology to the other calsarcins at its NH2 and COOH termini, while the intervening sequences are less well conserved (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, none of the highly conserved calsarcin domains shows any significant homology to other proteins in the database. Probing of multiple tissue Northern blots with specific probes for human and mouse calsarcin-3 revealed a skeletal muscle-restricted pattern in both species (Fig. 2), while no detectable expression was observed in the adult heart. Mouse calsarcin-3 displayed a single major transcript of ∼3.5 kb and a minor transcript of ∼4.0 kb. In contrast, several human calsarcin-3 transcripts were detected, suggesting more complex regulation of the human calsarcin-3 gene. However, our cDNA library screens did not identify additional or alternative coding sequences. We previously reported that calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 interact with calcineurin as well as the Z-disc proteins α-actinin-2/3 and the muscle-specific filamin-isoform, γ-filamin (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Another sarcomeric protein, telethonin/T-Cap, which is also localized to the Z-disc (22.Valle G. Faulkner G. De Antoni A. Pacchioni B. Pallavicini A. Pandolfo D. Tiso N. Toppo S. Trevisan S. Lanfranchi G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 23.Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunke K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmannn B. Granzier H. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), has also been shown to interact with calsarcin-2 (17.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Comelli A. Salamon M. Bortoletto G. Ievolella C. Treviisan S. Kojic S. Vecchia F.D. Laveder P. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41234-41242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether calsarcin-3 is similarly capable of mediating these diverse protein-protein interactions. Indeed, we found that calsarcin-3 coimmunoprecipitated with calcineurin, telethonin, α-actinin-2, and γ-filamin (Fig. 3). Calsarcin-1, the cardiac calsarcin isoform, also interacts with telethonin, suggesting a potential role for this association in cardiac tissue, where telethonin is expressed at high levels. To map the domains of calsarcin-3 that mediate its many protein-protein interactions, we created several deletion mutations and tested their abilities to coimmunoprecipitate with calcineurin, telethonin, α-actinin-2, or γ-filamin. Deletion of the COOH-terminal 141 amino acids of human calsarcin-3 (mutant 1–110) did not affect the ability to interact with any of these partners (Fig. 4). These interactions were also unaffected by a further deletion of the first 36 amino acids (mutant 37–110), which are not highly conserved among calsarcin isoforms. In contrast, deletion of the NH2-terminal 109 amino acids (mutant 109–251) eliminated binding to γ-filamin, calcineurin, and telethonin, but it did not abolish the interaction with α-actinin-2. Since this mutant did not overlap with mutants 1–110 or 37–110, these results suggested the existence of two independent α-actinin-binding domains. Further deletions revealed that amino acids 186–207, which are highly conserved, are necessary for α-actinin binding of the COOH-terminal portion of the protein (compare mutants 109–207 and 109–186). To further pinpoint the protein-protein interaction regions, we added back regions of the protein to mutant 109–251, which was only able to mediate interaction with actinin. Addition of amino acids 73–109 to this construct (mutant 73–251) restored the ability to bind γ-filamin, but not calcineurin or telethonin. Further extension of this construct to residue 50 (mutant 50–251) restored calcineurin and telethonin binding. This same region also mediated binding to α-actinin-2 in the absence of the more COOH-terminal binding site (mutant 50–186) located between amino acids 186–207. However, further deletion of this construct to residue 110 (mutant 50–110) rendered a molecule that still bound calcineurin, telethonin, and γ-filamin, but was not sufficient to interact with α-actinin. The latter finding may be due to the small size of the mutant peptide or to altered secondary structure, since both NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions of this mutation confer again the ability to bind α-actinin. In our previous study, we mapped the calcineurin-binding domain on calsarcin-1 to the COOH terminus of the molecule (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To directly compare the calcineurin binding properties of calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-3, we generated an additional series of calsarcin-1 deletion mutants and performed coimmunoprecipitations. While calsarcin-3 mutant 109–251 did not bind calcineurin, the corresponding calsarcin-1 construct (amino acids 100–264) was able to bind calcineurin (data not shown), suggesting a structural difference between these calsarcin isoforms accounts for these findings. Moreover, further deletion of the last 34 amino acids of calsarcin-1 abolished calcineurin binding, but not α-actinin binding (data not shown), consistent with our previous mapping of the COOH-terminal calcineurin and α-actinin interaction domains (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A calsarcin-1 deletion construct encompassing amino acids 1–100 was also able to mediate interaction with both calcineurin and α-actinin-2 (data not shown), indicating that, similar to calsarcin-3, calsarcin-1 contains an additional NH2-terminal binding site for these molecules. To identify additional novel protein-protein interactions for calsarcin-3, we fused the full-length calsarcin-3 protein and several NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain to perform yeast two-hybrid screens of a skeletal muscle cDNA library. However, all calsarcin-3 constructs tested autoactivated the GAL4-dependent β-galactosidase reporter in yeast and therefore could not be used for a library screen (data not shown). Therefore, we used a calsarcin-1 bait that had previously been used to successfully screen a cardiac library (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) to screen a human skeletal muscle library, assuming that potential newly identified partners might also bind calsarcin-3. From this screen, we identified nine clones of ZASP/Cypher/Oracle, a recently described striated-muscle specific protein (19.Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 20.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E.

Dev. 2000; 92: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), containing a PDZ domain and three LIM domains. Several splice variants of ZASP have been identified, all of which share the NH2-terminal PDZ-domain. However, all clones identified in our yeast screen encoded for the shortest isoform (ZASP/cypher-2), consisting of 283 amino acids and lacking the three COOH-terminal LIM domains. All nine clones strongly interacted with calsarcin-1 in a β-galactosidase assay in yeast. Moreover, in a reverse experiment in which ZASP was fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain, we detected a strong interaction with all three calsarcins as well as α-actinin-2, which served as a positive control, since it had been shown previously (20.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) to interact with ZASP (Table I). None of these calsarcin or α-actinin GAL4-transactivation domain fusions displayed any background activation of β-galactosidase when cotransformed with a plasmid encoding the GAL4-DNA-binding domain only (Table I). We also attempted to assess the interaction of the longest ZASP/Cypher splice variant, encompassing 723 amino acids (ZASP/Cypher-1) with calsarcins in yeast. However, a fusion of Cypher-1 and the GAL4 DNA-binding domain autoactivated the β-galacosidase reporter and therefore could not be tested (data not shown).Table IInteraction of calsarcins with ZASP/Cypher in yeast two-hybrid assayGal4-DBDCalsarcinα-Actinin123GAL4-ZASP−++++GAL4−−−−−A ZASP splice variant (amino acids 1–283) that lacks the three COOH-terminal LIM domains (ZASP/Cypher-2) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle library using calsarcin-1 as a bait.

ZASP/Cypher-2 strongly activated a β-galactosidase reporter when cotransformed with calsarcin proteins and α-actinin. In contrast, when cotransformed with the GAL4-DNA binding domain alone, no background activity was observed. Open table in a new tab A ZASP splice variant (amino acids 1–283) that lacks the three COOH-terminal LIM domains (ZASP/Cypher-2) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a skeletal muscle library using calsarcin-1 as a bait. To assess the ability of this protein to also bind calsarcin-2 and calsarcin-3, ZASP/Cypher-2 was fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (DBD) and tested against calsarcin 1–3, as well as α-actinin-2, which were fused to the GAL4-transactivation domain. ZASP/Cypher-2 strongly activated a β-galactosidase reporter when cotransformed with calsarcin proteins and α-actinin. In contrast, when cotransformed with the GAL4-DNA binding domain alone, no background activity was observed. The interaction of ZASP/Cypher-2 with calsarcin-1, calsarcin-2, and calsarcin-3 was confirmed in mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitations (Fig. 5, middle panels). In addition, ZASP/Cypher-1 also coimmunoprecipitated with calsarcin-1, calsarcin-2, and calsarcin-3 (Fig. 5, right panels), suggesting that the calsarcin interaction is not isoform-specific. Cypher-2 is by far the most abundant isoform in skeletal muscle (20.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which may explain why our yeast two-hybrid screen only identified Cypher-2 clones. To analyze the subcellular localization of calsarcin-3 in skeletal muscle, we used an NH2-terminal peptide of mouse calsarcin-3 to generate an antibody that did not recognize other calsarcins. Antiserum BSYN2021 revealed a strong Z-disc staining pattern in cryosections of mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle, as assessed by colocalization with sarcomeric α-actinin (Fig. 6A,panels a–c). Preimmune serum was used as a negative control (data not shown). Since the BSYN2021 antiserum worked only poorly in Western blot experiments, we further assessed its specificity by immunostaining of tissue culture cells. BSYN2021 antiserum strongly recognized mouse calsarcin-3 overexpressed in COS or C2C12 cells, while neither human calsarcin-3 or the other calsarcin isoforms were detected, confirming its specific immunoreactivity with mouse calsarcin-3 (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that in addition to its cardiac expression, calsarcin-1 is specifically expressed in oxidative skeletal muscle fibers (type I slow and IIa fast), while calsarcin-2 appears to be a predominantly fast-twitch isoform (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To determine whether calsarcin-3 is expressed in a fiber type-specific fashion, we examined cross-sections of mouse hindlimb muscles by immunofluorescence. Costaining with calsarcin-3 antiserum and antibodies directed against slow (Fig. 6B, panels b and c) and fast (Fig. 6B, panels e and f) skeletal muscle myosin revealed a preferential expression of calsarcin-3 in fast-twitch myofibers. This study presents the initial description of a novel member of the calsarcin family, calsarcin-3, which is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle and is enriched in fast-twitch muscle fibers. Like calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2, calsarcin-3 is localized to the Z-disc and has the ability to bind several other Z-disc proteins, in particular α-actinin, γ-filamin, telethonin, and calcineurin A. In addition, we demonstrate that ZASP (Cypher, Oracle), which has also been shown to bind α-actinin and to be localized to the Z-disc (20.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), is a calsarcin-binding protein as well. Consistent with the latter finding, Zhou et al. (10.Zhou Q. Chu P.-H. Huang C. Cheng C.-F. Martone M.E. Knoll G. Shelton G.D. Evans S. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) demonstrated recently that ZASP mutants lacking the actinin-binding PDZ domain still localize to the Z-disc, suggesting that it may associate with additional Z-disc proteins. Our data suggest that calsarcins may provide this link. Given the relatively small size of calsarcin proteins, it is surprising how many different protein-protein interactions they are capable of mediating. Our domain mapping studies, which demonstrate overlap of several protein interaction domains on calsarcin-3, suggest that some of these interactions could be mutually exclusive rather than simultaneous. It has recently been shown that the phosphorylation status of telethonin's COOH terminus controls its interaction with the potassium channel subunit minK (24.Furukawa T. Ono Y. Tsuchiya H. Katayama Y. Bang M.-L. Labeit D. Labeit S. Inagaki N. Gregorio C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting that signal-dependent mechanisms may influence protein-protein interactions among Z-disc proteins. We are currently investigating whether similar mechanisms regulate calsarcin's choice of partners. Calsarcins display considerable homology in their amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions, suggesting a conservation of functional properties and protein-binding domains. For example, we demonstrated that a COOH-terminal domain, which is highly conserved between calsarcin-3 (amino acids 186–207) and calsarcin-1 (amino acids 179–200), mediates α-actinin binding on both proteins. In contrast, we previously mapped the calcineurin binding region of calsarcin-1 to the COOH terminus of the protein (16.Frey N. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14632-14637Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), while the domain mapping studies of calsarcin-3 indicate that calcineurin binds the region from residues 50–110, but not the COOH terminus. To address this apparent discrepancy we investigated additional calsarcin-1 deletions and found that, while we were able to confirm the COOH-terminal calcineurin binding site on calsarcin-1, both calsarcin-isoforms share an additional NH2-terminal calcineurin-binding domain. Moreover, the COOH terminus of calsarcin-2 (residues 163–299) was shown to be sufficient for γ-filamin binding (18.Takeda F. Vander Woude D.L. Tong H.-Q. Thompson T.G. Watkins S.C. Kunkel L.M. Beggs A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1595-1600PubMed Google Scholar), while we were unable to demonstrate interaction of the COOH-terminal 141 amino acids of calsarcin-3 with γ-filamin. It is currently unclear whether these findings also reflect distinct properties of calsarcin-3 as compared with the other calsarcins or whether differences in the assays used for mapping are responsible for the apparent discrepancies (i.e.yeast versus mammalian cells, NH2-terminalversus COOH-terminal fusions of tagged proteins, etc.). Additional experiments with various deletions of calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 will therefore be necessary to further dissect the complex protein-protein interactions of the calsarcin family. What could be the function of calsarcin proteins in cardiac and skeletal muscle in vivo? The colocalization and direct interaction with several key Z-disc proteins such as α-actinin and γ-filamin suggests that calsarcins serve to cross-link these proteins, thereby likely contributing to the formation and maintanance of the Z-disc. Furthermore, the interaction with the phosphatase calcineurin, a key transducer of calcium signals that control many aspects of muscle growth and function (reviewed in Ref. 11.Olson E.N. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), points to an additional role of calsarcins in cellular signaling. In light of the vast differences of calcium ion concentrations in muscle cells not only between contraction and relaxation but also among different compartments of the myocyte, it is likely that calcineurin's subcellular localization is critical for its proper activation by calcium/calmodulin. Calsarcins could serve this role by tethering calcineurin to the Z-disc, which may also be important for the association with its substrates. The latter notion is supported by a recent report showing that the transcription factor NFATc, which is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, is also localized to the Z-disc in unstimulated skeletal muscle fibers and becomes translocated to the nucleus in response to chronic electric stimulation (25.Liu Y. Cseresnyes Z. Randall W.R. Schneider M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The localization of calcineurin to the Z-disc in cardiomyocytes has been confirmed by others (26.Zou Y. Yao A. Zhu W. Kudow S. Hiroi Y. Shimoyama M. Uozumi H. Kohmoto O. Takahashi T. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yasaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that isoproterenol stimulation of cardiomyocytes, which induces hypertrophy through activation of calcineurin, results in translocation of calcineurin from the Z-disc to the nucleus (26.Zou Y. Yao A. Zhu W. Kudow S. Hiroi Y. Shimoyama M. Uozumi H. Kohmoto O. Takahashi T. Shibasaki F. Nagai R. Yasaki Y. Komuro I. Circulation. 2001; 104: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The association of signaling molecules with the Z-disc is not without precedence and is perhaps not surprising given the close spatial association of the Z-disc with the sarcolemma/t-tubule system. Certain protein kinase C isoforms have also been been localized to the Z-disc (27.Robia S. Ghanta J. Robu V.G. Walker J.W. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2140-2151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Of note, the LIM domains of ZASP/Cypher are capable of directly binding protein kinase C (20.Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that ZASP may link protein kinase C to the Z-disc in an analagous fashion to the association of calsarcin and calcineurin. Moreover, the finding that telethonin and the potassium channel minK can interact (24.Furukawa T. Ono Y. Tsuchiya H. Katayama Y. Bang M.-L. Labeit D. Labeit S. Inagaki N. Gregorio C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) adds another layer of complexity to this multiprotein complex and further suggests a close relationship of the Z-disc and signal transduction cascades. It is therefore interesting to speculate that calsarcins might play a role in mechanosensing and mediation of stretch-associated signals in striated muscle tissue. The importance of the Z-disc in striated muscle is further supported by the association of several Z-disc proteins with muscle disease. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are a clinically heterogenous group of diseases, characterized by muscle weakness, eventually progressing to wasting of limb muscles (reviewed in Ref. 28.Zatz M. Vainzof M. Passos-Bueno M.R. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2000; 13: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Genetically, dominant (LGMD1) and recessive (LGMD2) forms can be differentiated. Interestingly, the calsarcin-interacting Z-disc protein telethonin has been shown to cause LGMD2G (7.Moreira E.S. Wiltshire T.J. Faulkner G. Nilforoushan A. Vainzof M. Suuzuki O.T. Valle G. Reeves R. Zatz M. Passos-Bueno M.R. Jenne D.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Moreover, several proteins associated with the muscle-specific filamin isoform, γ-filamin, have been shown to result in muscular dystrophy as well, including another novel Z-disc protein, myotilin (LGMD1A (6.Hauser M.A. Horrigan S.K.

The close proximity and/or direct interaction of calsarcins with these disease gene products raises the possibility that mutations in calsarcins may also cause muscular dystrophies. Intriguingly, a distinct myopathy, vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness with autosomal dominant distal myopathy (VCPDM), has been mapped to chromosome 5q31 (33.Feit H. Silbergleit A. Schneider L.B.

Taken together, we propose a dual role for calsarcin-3, and calsarcins in general, which is to support the structural integrity of the Z-disc and to target calcineurin-dependent signaling pathways to the sarcomere. Loss of function studies will allow further dissection of calsarcins' functions in vivo. We are grateful to J. Shelton for help with mouse cryosections, J. Eamma for technical assistance, A.

https://openalex.org/W2133408841,"Abstract Geranylgeranylation of RhoA small G-protein is essential for its localization to cell membranes and for its biological functions. Many RhoA effects are mediated by its downstream effector RhoA kinase. The role of protein geranylgeranylation and the RhoA pathway in the regulation of endothelial cell survival has not been elucidated. The hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin depletes cellular pools of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesol pyrophosphate and thereby inhibits both geranylgeranylation and farnesylation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to lovastatin (3 μm-30 μm) for 48 h, and cell death was quantitatively determined by cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments as well as caspase-3 activity. The assays showed that lovastatin caused a dose-dependent endothelial cell death. The addition of geranylgeraniol, which restores geranylgeranylation, rescued HUVEC from apoptosis. The geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor GGTI-298, but not the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277, induced apoptosis in HUVEC. Cell death was also induced by a blockade of RhoA function by exoenzyme C3. In addition, treatment of HUVEC with the RhoA kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and HA-1077 caused dose-dependent cell death. Y-27632 did not inhibit other well known survival pathways, such as NF-κB, ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt. However, there was an increase in p53 protein level concomitant with Y-27632-induced cell death. Unlike the apoptosis induced by TNF-α, which occurs only with inhibition of new protein synthesis, apoptosis induced by inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, geranylgeranyltransferase, or RhoA kinase was blocked by cycloheximide. Our data indicate that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation and RhoA pathways induce apoptosis in HUVEC and that induction of p53 or other proapoptotic proteins is required for this process."

Gross S.S. Semin. Nephrol. 1999; 19: 215-229PubMed Google Scholar). Within cells, NO itself and NO-derived reactive nitrogen species are capable of reacting with various molecular targets that include complex biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, as well as low molecular weight compounds (23.Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). One of the important molecular targets of NO are protein tyrosine residues, which can be modified to fairly stable 3-nitrotyrosines upon reacting with nitrating species. Protein nitration is believed to be a selective process with respect to both the proteins and the specific protein tyrosine residues that can undergo this posttranslational modification (24.Souza J.M. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. Raman C.S. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Nitration of protein tyrosine residues has been shown to alter the functions of a variety of proteins under physiological and pathophysiological conditions bothin vitro and in vivo (23.Davis K.L.

A. 1997; 94: 11233-11237Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and analysis of the molecular sequence of PKCε reveals that it harbors multiple tyrosine residues. Therefore, we hypothesized that nitration of PKCε on tyrosine residues may contribute to NO-induced activation of PKCε. Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) is a well characterized nitrating species that is produced under physiological conditions when NO reacts with superoxide anion (O2⨪) (29.Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Because the reaction of NO with O2⨪ to form ONOO− occurs at a near diffusion-limited rate, generation of ONOO− will predominate in any setting where NO and O2⨪ are released concomitantly. Considering the fact that that cardiac myocytes have several potential sources of O2⨪, which among others include mitochondria and NADPH oxidase (30.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar), it stands to reason that ONOO− can play a role as a mediator of NO donor-induced nitration of PKCε. Translocation and subcellular redistribution of PKCε have been recognized as important molecular events for the activation of this isozyme (1.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 2.Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 31.Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The particulate translocation of PKCε is known to be facilitated by its interaction with a specific anchoring protein termed receptor for activated Ckinase 2, or RACK2 (32.Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D.

Importantly, the interaction of PKCε with RACK2 is crucial for mediating PKCε activation and function (6.Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

Accordingly, we postulated that tyrosine nitration may serve to promote the interaction between PKCε and its RACK2, thereby leading to enhanced expression and activity of PKCε in the particulate fraction. In the present study, we investigated whether NO induces PKCε activation and translocation in adult cardiac myocytes and elucidated the cellular mechanisms of this event. Cardiomyocytes were treated with the NO donorS-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP), which was previously shown to induce PKCε activation and cardiac protection in vivo (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y. Li R.C.X. Banergee S. Dawn B. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The translocation and activation of PKCε, as well as the posttranslational modification of this isozyme such as tyrosine nitration, were characterized both in cultured cardiac cells in vitro and in a rabbit model of NO preconditioning in vivo. We found that NO induces activation, translocation, and nitration of PKCε. Furthermore, nitration of PKCε enhances PKCε-RACK2 interactions and facilitates PKCε translocation. The present study was performed in accordance with guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville School of Medicine and with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Department of Health and Human Services, publication [NIH] 86–23). M199 medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Type II collagenase was from Worthington. SNAP, SIN-1, and Ebselen were fromCalbiochem. Mouse monoclonal antibody against PKCε and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and nitrotyrosine immunoblotting control were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rat monoclonal anti-TCP-1α (anti-RACK2) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-detecting reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad Laboratories. All other reagents were from Sigma. Adult rabbit cardiac myocytes were isolated using a modification of the method of Haddad et al. (34.Haddad J. Decker M.L. Hsieh L.C. Lesch M. Samarel A.M. Decker R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C19-C27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using collagenase type II digestion. This method yielded 80–85% rod-shaped cardiac myocytes, generating an average total of 4–6 × 107 cells per rabbit heart. This method has been employed previously to study PKCε-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in rabbit cardiomyocytes (35.Li R.C.X. Ping P. Zhang J. Wead W.B. Cao X. Gao J. Zheng Y. Huang S. Han J. Bolli R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1679-H1689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, isolated myocytes were plated onto laminin-coated 100-mm dishes at subconfluence (2 × 106 cells/dish) and cultured overnight at 37 °C in M199 medium with 2% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. The medium was replaced with serum-free M199 medium supplemented with taurine (5 mm), creatine (5 mm), and carnitine (5 mm), and the cells were cultured under the serum-starved conditions for 3 h prior to performing the treatments with a nitric oxide donor. Cardiomyocytes obtained from the same rabbit were divided into the following groups: a control group, in which only the vehicle (Me2SO) was added to the medium; three groups in which the cells were incubated for 40 min with different concentrations of the NO donor SNAP obtained by diluting the stock solution of SNAP in the culture medium (2, 20, or 100 μm final concentrations of SNAP); a group in which the cells were pretreated for 10 min with the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin at a 50 μm concentration before the treatment with 20 μm SNAP; and a group in which the peroxynitrite scavenger Ebselen was added at a concentration of 2 μm 10 min prior to the treatment with 20 μm SNAP. The SNAP stock solution was prepared freshly by dissolving it in Me2SO prior to each experiment. After the treatment, the medium was removed, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the bottoms of the dishes, and frozen at −80 °C. The cell samples were processed for the assessment of protein expression and phosphorylation activity of PKCε. The myocytes were resuspended and homogenized by glass-glass homogenization in sample buffer containing 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). The total cellular proteins in the homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 40 min; the supernatants were removed (cytosolic fractions), and the pellets were resuspended in the above sample buffer (particulate fractions). The protein concentrations in the cytosolic and particulate fractions of the samples were determined using the method of Bradford. The subcellular distribution and translocation of PKCε were assessed by standard Western immunoblotting techniques as previously described (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y. Li R.C.X. Banergee S. Dawn B. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of proteins from the cytosolic and the particulate fraction of each cell sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10% denaturing gel and were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Gel transfer efficiency and equal loading of protein were monitored by Ponceau staining of the nitrocellulose membranes. Background blocking was performed by incubating the membranes with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline. Monoclonal antibodies against PKC isoform ε were used to assess its subcellular distribution and translocation. Monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies were used to detect protein tyrosine nitration. Monoclonal anti-TCP-1α antibodies were used to determine RACK2 protein expression. The protein signal was visualized using standard ECL methods. To carry out immunoprecipitations, 5 μg of anti-PKCε antibodies were incubated with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads for 40 min at 4 °C as described previously (36.Pass J.M. Zheng Y.T. Wead W.B. Zhang J. Li R.C.X. Bolli R. Ping P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H946-H955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-PKCε antibodies were substituted with IgG in controls. The protein A/G-agarose-anti-PKCε complex was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with 1000 μg of proteins from the particulate fractions of the cell samples overnight at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently subjected to Western immunoblotting using either anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (to detect tyrosine nitration of PKCε protein), anti-RACK2 antibodies (to assess its co-immunoprecipitation with PKCε), or anti-PKCε antibodies. The phosphorylation activity of PKCε was determined using a previously employed method (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y. Li R.C.X. Banergee S. Dawn B. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21.Vondriska T.M. Zhang J. Song C. Tang X.L. Cao X. Baines C.P. Pass J.M. Wang S. Bolli R. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of proteins from the particulate fraction were immunoprecipitated overnight with PKCε monoclonal antibodies. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to a phosphorylation assay using a PKCε-selective peptide substrate (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV). Recombinant PKCε and RACK2 proteins were generated as described previously (36.Pass J.M. Zheng Y.T. Wead W.B. Zhang J. Li R.C.X. Bolli R. Ping P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H946-H955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Ping P. Zhang J. Pierce Jr., W.M. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the interactions of PKCε and RACK2 were determined. For the PKCε-RACK2 in vitro binding assay, 96-well flat-bottomed ELISA plates were coated with either 10, 100, 500, 5, 10, or 50 ng of recombinant purified RACK2 dissolved in PBS (50 μl/well) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 200 μl of 4% bovine serum albumin (w/v) blocking buffer for 2 h at 37 °C to minimize any nonspecific binding. After washing the ELISA plates three times with PBS, 40 ng of recombinant purified PKCε was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C (final volume, 50 μl per well). PKCε protein had either been left untreated (control), pretreated with 2 μm concentration of the ONOO− donor SIN-1 in 15 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min (SIN-1-treated), or pretreated with 60 μg/ml phosphatidylserine and 100 nm phorbol myristate acetate (PS plus PMA-treated) for 30 min at room temperature. After allowing binding of PKCε to RACK2, the wells were washed three times with PBS, and 50 μl of anti-PKCε primary antibody (1:400 in bovine serum albumin blocking buffer) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) was used to wash the plates three times to remove any weakly, nonspecifically bound proteins, after which 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1:3500) were added to each well. The plates were again incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed 3 times with PBST. The bound antibodies were detected by incubating the reaction wells with TMB detection reagent for 30 min at room temperature and, for a greater sensitivity, subsequent acidifying using 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4. The optical density was measured on an ELISA plate reader at a single wavelength of 450 nm. To explore the functional significance of PKCε nitration, we used a well established conscious rabbit model of NO-induced cardioprotection as described previously (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J.

Briefly, male New Zealand White rabbits (Myrtle's Rabbitry Inc., Thompson Station, TN; 2.0–2.5 kg, age 3–4 months) were given the NO donor diethylenetriamine/NO (DETA/NO, 0.1 mg/kg intravenously every 25 min for 75 min; total dose of 0.4 mg/kg). This dose of DETA/NO has been shown to trigger rapid activation of PKCε and to induce protection against myocardial infarction and stunning 24 h later (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y.

Cardiac tissue samples were taken at 30 min after the last dose of DETA/NO, a time point when marked PKCε activation by DETA/NO was previously demonstrated (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L.

Differences between groups were analyzed using Student'st test for unpaired data. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. We have previously reported that NO released by NO donors induces preconditioning in rabbit hearts by activating PKCε in an isozyme-specific manner (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y. Li R.C.X. Banergee S. Dawn B. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 21.Vondriska T.M. Zhang J. Song C. Tang X.L. Cao X. Baines C.P. Pass J.M. Wang S. Bolli R. Ping P. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1306-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of NO donors on PKCε in isolated adult rabbit cardiac myocytes, we treated the cells with SNAP, an NO donor that has been shown to afford cardioprotection in rabbits (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y. Li R.C.X. Banergee S. Dawn B. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 38.Shinmura K. Tang X.L. Takano H.

Res. 1998; 83: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were incubated with one of the three increasing concentrations of SNAP (2, 20, and 100 μm) for 40 min, and the changes in the PKCε expression in the particulate fraction were subsequently determined. SNAP treatment induced a significant, concentration-dependent, translocation of PKCε from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction of the cells (Fig. 1). This effect of SNAP was similar to that induced by PMA (data not shown). Pretreatment of the cells with the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin at a concentration of 50 μm prevented the SNAP-induced translocation of PKCε, demonstrating that this effect of SNAP was due to NO release. Similarly, pretreatment of the cells with the peroxynitrite scavenger Ebselen at a concentration of 2 μm for 10 min prior to SNAP application attenuated the translocation of ε protein, implicating a role of a secondary peroxynitrite formation in mediating the effects of SNAP on PKCε. We next examined whether SNAP treatment of cardiomyocytes led to changes in the kinase activity of particulate PKCε parallel to the changes in its subcellular distribution. The ability of PKCε to phosphorylate its specific peptide substrate was measured in the particulate fractions of samples treated with different concentrations of SNAP. The results were compared with PKCε activity in Me2SO-treated control samples and samples that were pretreated with oxyhemoglobin or Ebselen. We found that SNAP induced a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation activity of PKCε in the particulate fraction (Fig. 2). Pretreating cardiac myocytes with either oxyhemoglobin or Ebselen before treating them with 20 μm SNAP attenuated the SNAP-induced activation of PKCε, suggesting that this effect was dependent on the release of NO and on the secondary formation of ONOO−. We then proceeded to test whether NO produced during SNAP treatment of myocytes induced a posttranslational modification of PKCε on tyrosine residues. We postulated that the activation of PKCε by SNAP, as manifested by both increased particulate PKCε expression and increased PKCε phosphorylation activity, might be associated with the secondary production of ONOO−, which has been shown to induce nitration of tyrosine residues on proteins (23.Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 25.Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Therefore, formation of 3-nitrotyrosines on PKCε in response to treatment with SNAP was evaluated by immunoprecipitating PKCε from the particulate fractions and then immunoblotting the precipitates with anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibodies. A 20 μm concentration of SNAP, which significantly activated PKCε (Fig. 2), induced a greater than 3.3-fold increase in the amount of tyrosine nitration on this PKC isoform compared with controls (Fig. 3). Scavenging of NO by oxyhemoglobin or ONOO− by Ebselen markedly attenuated the effect of SNAP. These data support the concept that SNAP-induced nitration of PKCε on its tyrosine residues was mediated by release of NO and secondary formation of ONOO−. To determine whether NO induces tyrosine nitration of PKCε in vivo, we examined tissue samples from hearts treated with DETA/NO and control hearts treated with the vehicle. The dose of DETA/NO was previously documented to induce activation of PKCε and protection against myocardial infarction (15.Ping P. Takano H. Zhang J. Tang X.L. Qui Y. Li R.C.X. Banergee S. Dawn B. Balafanova Z. Bolli R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 587-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 39.Takano H. Tang X.L. Qiu Y. Guo Y. French B.A. Bolli R. Circ.

We observed a significant increase in the amount of tyrosine nitration on PKCε in hearts treated with DETA/NO when compared with the controls (Fig. 4). These data d"

We investigated the p53-related functions of the hDkk-1 gene by studying its response to DNA damage and its modulation of apoptosis in human glioma cells. Various chemotherapeutic and other agents that induce DNA adducts and compromise its integrity (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), cisplatin, H2O2 and UV rays) enhanced the expression of hDkk-1 significantly. The damage-induced increase in hDkk-1 mRNA levels occurred in many human tumor cell lines, irrespective of their p53 gene status. The human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG, which had undetectable hDkk-1 expression, was engineered to express moderate levels of the hDkk protein by stable transfection. The engineered cells did not show any morphological changes, but underwent marked apoptosis after ceramide treatment. Further, the DNA cross-linking drugs BCNU and cisplatin, but not the microtubule poison vincristine, induced significant cell death in U87MG/hDkk cells, and this was accompanied by altered Bcl-2/Bax expression and a reduction in the amount of telomere DNA as visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. These results show that hDkk-1 is a pro-apoptotic gene and suggest that it may play important roles in linking the oncogenic Wnt and p53 tumor suppressor pathways."

Chem. 1989; 264: 17213-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is no exception to this rule (27Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of proteolytic processing in the mechanism of MMP activationin vivo remains poorly understood. In most cases, the physiological role of GelB is inferred based on its correlation with enzyme expression, although neither enzyme activation nor the appearance of a proteolytically activated form has been demonstrated (28Zhi L.

Proteolytically activated species of GelB have not been found in the in vivo model of dermal-epidermal separation triggered by antibodies to the hemidesmosomal protein BP-180 (28Zhi L. Zhou X.

The data gleaned from the literature demonstrate no evidence of proteolytically activated species of GelB in a number of normal and pathological conditions. For example, an increased level of GelB, exclusively in its proenzyme form, was found in samples of synovial fluid and tissue from patients with inflammatory arthritis (29Ahrens D. Koch A.E. Pope M. Stein-Picarella M. Niedbala M.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 39: 1576-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mice injected with lymphoma cells expressing GelB developed thymic lymphoma more rapidly than those injected with control lymphoma cells; however, no activated enzyme form was detected (30Aoudjit F. Masure S. Opdenakker G. Potworowski E.F. St-Pierre Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 82: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of GelB has been found to be conducive to the formation of metastases by murine prostate tumor cells, but the presence of activated enzyme was not evident (31Sehgal G. Hua J. Bernhard E.J. Sehgal I. Thompson T.C. Muschel R.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 591-596PubMed Google Scholar). GelB was implicated in the pathogenic mechanism of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (32Gijbels K. Proost P. Masure S. Carton H. Billiau A. Opdenakker G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), whereas only the proform of the enzyme was present in cerebrospinal fluid. Expression of GelB in the placenta is developmentally regulated, and it is commonly accepted that this enzyme plays an important role in implantation, placental development, and the invasion of the trophoblast into the uterine epithelium (34Vu T.H.

Again, there is no evidence of a proteolytically activated species of GelB in human placental tissue (35Simonovitz S. Hurwitz A. Dushnik M. Anteby E. Geva-Eldar T. Yagel S. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1994; 171: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 39Niu R. Okamoto T. Iwase K. Nomura S. Mizutani S.

Is expression of GelB incidental to the processes of tissue metabolism, or does a nonproteolytic mechanism of GelB activation exist? Here we report that the mere binding of the GelB proenzyme to gelatin or type IV collagen substrates induces its enzymatic activity without cleavage of its propeptide. These results, together with the in situ zymography experiments on tissue sections of human placenta, suggest that GelB activation in vivo may occur via an alternative mechanism. The proform of GelB enzyme was purified from conditioned medium of transfected p2AHT2a cells as described previously (27Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomer and dimer forms of the enzyme were separated by elution from gelatin-Sepharose (Sigma) affinity column using a 0–10% Me2SO gradient. Purified enzyme was activated with stromelysin (MMP-3) (MMP-3/MMP-9 ratio = 1:40 (w/w)) at 37 °C for periods of 1–3 h in 5 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.005% Brij-35 and 1 mm CaCl2. The activated stromelysin used for GelB activation was obtained by treatment of stromelysin proenzyme withl-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin at 1:20 (w/w) ratio for 20 min at 20 °C. Trypsin was inhibited with an 8-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor before the addition of stromelysin to the MMP-9 activation reaction. Fresh tissue of human term placenta was a kind gift of Dr. Yoel Sadovsky (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University School of Medicine). Frozen sections of tissue were blotted to remove excess liquid and incubated with either TBS (control), TBS containing 1–10 nm TIMP-1, or inhibitory mouse monoclonal antibodies to human GelB (clone GE-213; Chemicon International) or gelatinase A (MMP-2) (clone CA-4001; Chemicon International) at a concentration of 5–60 μg/ml for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were dipped into an autoradiography emulsion (NTB2; Eastman Kodak Co.) diluted 2.5 times with Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 4 mm CaCl2 and preheated to 40 °C. In a separate experiment, slides were incubated with emulsion containing 5 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2. The coated slides were incubated in a humid chamber for 16–32 h, developed, and photographed under the light microscope. The transparent pattern on a black background reflects zones of gelatinolytic activity. Frozen sections of human term placenta were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and incubated with monoclonal antibodies to human GelB (clone GE-213; Chemicon International), human gelatinase A (clone CA-4001; Chemicon International), rabbit anti-mouse GelB (Chemicon International catalogue number AB19047), and collagen type IV (clone col-94; Sigma) as indicated. The reactions were developed with secondary antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffinPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (catalogue number 711-095-152) and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated AffinPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (catalogue number 715-025-150), both from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. 96-Well plates (Costar Tissue culture or Dynex Technologies Microfluor 2) were incubated overnight at room temperature with 150 μl/well Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing either enzyme immuno assay grade gelatin (Bio-Rad; 1 mg/ml) or 150 μl of 125 μg/ml bovine type IV collagen (CC083; Chemicon International). The plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) for 1 h and washed with the same buffer. Various forms of GelB were added at the indicated concentrations in 100 μl of TBS buffer containing 0.005% Brij-35, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C with agitation. The bound enzyme was extracted with 100 μl of 12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 40% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 0.02% bromphenol blue and analyzed using either gelatin zymography or Western blot as described previously (44Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. He A. Kronberger C. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6579-6587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control experiments using [35S]methionine metabolically labeled pro-GelB and active GelB enzymes demonstrated the 95% effectiveness of the extraction method (data not shown). Quantitation of each sample was accomplished by scanning gels with a UMAX UC1260 scanner and analyzing the images by comparison with the known concentration of MMP-9 enzyme using Collage 2.7 software. Measurement of GelB activity against the fluorogenic peptide substrate MCA-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Calbiochem) was performed in Microfluor 2 plates filled with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5) buffer (100 μl/well) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Brij-35, and 10–30 μm substrate. The reaction was monitored with a fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B) running FLDM software at λex 328 nm and λem 393 nm at room temperature. To assay the activity of bound GelB against gelatin, a mixture of cold gelatin and denatured [3H]collagen (rat type I; 0.28 mCi/mg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was adjusted to a final total protein concentration of 2.8 μCi/100 μg/ml and used to coat the 96-well FlashPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described above. Fifty μl of pro-MMP-9 or activated MMP-9 dimer at a concentration of 1.4 mg/ml in TBS containing 0.005% Brij-35 and 0.5 mm EDTA were added to the well in triplicate, and plates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. Unbound enzyme was removed using three washes with cold TBS buffer containing 0.005% Brij-35 and 5 mmCaCl2. The last wash was replaced with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2. The digestion of gelatin was measured by counting the radioactivity associated with the well during the 0–70 min time interval using a Packard TopCount scintillation counter. Wells containing GelB bound to gelatin were preincubated with TIMP-1 for 15 min at room temperature in 100 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.005% Brij-35, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The fluorogenic peptide substrate was then added to the wells, and enzymatic activity was measured as described above.Ki values for pro-GelB and activated GelB were calculated with the assumption that the binding of TIMP-1 to the immobilized enzyme is simple noncooperative binding and that the remaining enzyme activity at any inhibitor concentration is proportional to the remaining free enzyme. Hence, the remaining enzyme activity at any inhibitor concentration is given by the following equation: a0 × {1 −i0/(1 + Ki ×i0)}, where a0 is the activity in the absence of inhibitor, Ki is the inhibitory binding constant, and i0 is the concentration of free inhibitor. GelB is secreted in a proenzyme form and can be activated in vitro by proteolytic processing of the propeptide (27Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B. J. Biol.

To address this apparent incongruity, we have investigated the gelatinolytic activity in human placenta in situ. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections from term placenta revealed the presence of GelB at the placental villus margin, corresponding with the location of the trophoblast bilayer, with minimal expression in the villus core (Fig.1A). A small quantity of gelatinase A was also found (Fig. 1B). Double immunostaining with antibodies against GelB and type IV collagen showed a complete overlap of the two proteins at the trophoblast basal membrane (Fig. 1,C−E). In addition, microcapillaries inside the villi devoid of type IV collagen also have a small amount of GelB (Fig.1E). Comparison of immunohistochemical staining of sections of placental villi with an in situ zymogram assay (Fig.2) revealed that the gelatinolytic activity and GelB were co-localized. Inclusion of EDTA in emulsion completely abolished the gelatinolytic activity in this assay. Preincubation of the tissue sections with TIMP-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”) inhibited gelatinolytic activity at TIMP-1 concentrations as low as 3 nm. This activity was also inhibited (Fig. 2B) in a dose-dependent fashion by preincubation of the sections with monoclonal inhibitory antibody against GelB (clone GE-213). Inhibition could be observed at an antibody concentration of 5 μg/ml (data not shown), whereas almost complete inhibition was achieved at an antibody concentration of 60 μg/ml. Monoclonal inhibitory antibody against gelatinase A (clone CA-4001) had no noticeable effect on the in situgelatinolytic activity (Fig. 2C). These observations suggest that the gelatinolytic activity in term placenta is due to the presence of GelB. We next examined whether an active form of GelB, as judged by the presence of lower molecular mass enzyme species, could be detected in the placenta tissue. The extracts from excised tissue sections were subjected to zymogram and Western blot analysis (Fig.3). Both monomer and dimer forms of GelB were found to have a molecular mass corresponding to that of an unprocessed proenzyme form. These data, together with the immunohistochemical staining and in situ zymography results, suggest that the GelB present in human placenta is enzymatically active, despite the fact that its proteolytically activated form cannot be detected.Figure 3Zymogram and Western blot analysis of MMP-9 extracted from tissue sections of human placenta.

The results presented in Fig.4 show the effect of gelatin substrate binding on the activity of GelB compared with the enzyme in solution. Average specific activities of pro-GelB and activated GelB (either free or gelatin-bound) are summarized in TableI. No significant changes in specific activity were observed upon binding to gelatin of proteolytically activated GelB. In contrast, binding of GelB proenzyme to gelatin induced an approximate 600-fold increase in specific activity compared with that of the proenzyme in solution. The specific activity of bound proenzyme, however, was about 10-fold lower than that of activated GelB. We next examined whether the increase in activity upon binding of GelB proenzyme to gelatin could be attributed to the appearance of the proteolytically activated enzyme species. To investigate this possibility, SDS extracts of gelatin-bound enzyme were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig.5). The control experiments with [35S]methionine-labeled enzyme showed that 95% of the gelatin-bound enzyme is recovered using the SDS extraction procedure (data not shown). Because the activity of bound proenzyme was 10-fold lower than that of activated GelB, the amount of activated enzyme in the extracts is expected to reach a level of at least 10%. The quantitative comparison of the extracts with mixtures of pro-GelB and activated GelB of known ratios (Fig. 5) showed that the amount of the activated enzyme form in the extracts did not exceed 0.25–0.5%. This number is at least 20-fold lower than that expected if the activity of the bound proenzyme is to be explained by the presence of the proteolytically activated enzyme species. These results suggest that the increase in proteolytic activity of GelB upon binding to gelatin can be attributed to an enzyme with an unprocessed propeptide.Table ISpecific activities of soluble and substrate-bound gelatinase BSpecific activity1-aSpecific activity is expressed in nm cleaved substrate/min/ng enzyme.

The wells of FlashPlates were coated with [3H]gelatin, and its release was followed after binding of the enzyme. The specific activity of the bound enzyme (Table I) was calculated based on the amount of released gelatin and the amount of enzyme bound to a well, determined as described above after extraction. The results of this experiment show that both pro-GelB and activated GelB were active against [3H]gelatin with specific activities of 27.5 and 242.5 pg gelatin/min/ng, respectively. The ratio of specific activities of bound activated versus GelB proenzyme against [3H]gelatin is in good agreement with that obtained for the peptide substrate. To further characterize the gelatin-bound GelB, we examined the inhibitory activity of TIMP-1 against both proenzyme and activated forms of the enzyme (Fig. 6). The GelB bound to gelatin-coated wells was incubated with TIMP-1 (concentration, 0–30 nm). Fitting the inhibition curves to the equation for simple noncooperative binding gave Ki values of 9.3 ± 3.4 and 2.2 ± 1.0 nm for the activated and proenzyme forms, respectively. These results show that the enzymatic activity of either enzyme form when bound to gelatin was inhibited by TIMP-1 with similar kinetics. Although gelatin presents a most effective substrate for the study of gelatinases, GelB can bind a number of extracellular matrix components, including laminin, fibrin, and type I and type IV collagens (52Allan J.A. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,55Olson M. Toth M. Gervasi D.C. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Hence, we compared the effect of GelB proenzyme binding to gelatin and to type IV collagen on its enzymatic activity. The results indicate that binding to either substrate induces proteolytic activity of the proenzyme to a similar degree, whereas the GelB propeptide remained unprocessed (data not shown). Matrix metalloproteases are secreted as proenzymes and can be activated in solution by a variety of agents. Initially, we showed (24Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Roswit W.T. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5886-5889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,48Stricklin G.P. Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.T. Eisen A.Z.

Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 217-223PubMed Google Scholar) that activation of purified pro-MMP1, induced by either partial proteolysis or treatment with organomercurial compounds, resulted in the removal of the propeptide with a corresponding loss in molecular mass of the active enzyme species. Since then, it has been established that activation of all known enzymes of this family is accompanied by the proteolytic processing of a propeptide, with removal of the conserved cysteine residue triggering a “cysteine switch” activation mechanism (25Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The more detailed analysis of the pathway of MMP-1 activation using organomercurials (24Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Roswit W.T. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5886-5889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Stricklin G.P. Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.T. Eisen A.Z.

Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 217-223PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the initial activation of the proenzyme occurred without a loss of molecular mass. Subsequently, the enzyme undergoes autoproteolytic conversion to a 44-kDa intermediate and finally to the 42-kDa stable active enzyme (48Stricklin G.P. Jeffrey J.J. Roswit W.T. Eisen A.Z. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 49Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. He S.M. Wilhelm C. Eisen A.Z. Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 217-223PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicates that enzyme activity can develop even in the presence of the unprocessed propeptide. Mutagenesis of the conserved propeptide sequence in stromelysin (MMP-3) produced enzyme variants with an increased tendency to undergo spontaneous activation (50Sanchez-Lopez R. Nicholson R. Gesnel M.-C. Matrisian L.M. Breathnach R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11892-11899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also suggesting that destabilizing the propeptide may lead to the development of proteolytic activity. Purified GelB can be converted in vitro to an active form by cleavage of the propeptide by metalloproteases MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, tissue kallikrein, and plasminogen activator (34Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 115-148Google Scholar). The role of proteolytic processing of the propeptide in the physiological activation mechanism of GelB remains unclear (see “Introduction”). Using in situ zymography and inhibitory antibodies in combination with immunohistochemistry, we have shown that GelB expressed in human placental tissue is co-localized with type IV collagen and is enzymatically active. This occurs despite the fact that its proteolytically processed forms cannot be detected in tissue extracts. We have also shown that the mere binding of GelB to gelatin- or type IV collagen-coated surfaces was sufficient to induce proteolytic activity of the enzyme. Activation of the proform of GelB, resulting from its binding to a substrate, is not accompanied by a loss of its NH2-terminal propeptide, indicating that its activation is due to a conformational change. Absence of a detectable amount of NH2-terminal-truncated species in this model also suggests that the enzymatically active proform of GelB that is bound to gelatin is not capable of autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide under these conditions. The specific activity of bound pro-GelB against the peptide substrate is about 600-fold higher than the background specific activity of pro-GelB in solution. However, it is about 10-fold lower than that of either free or bound proteolytically activated enzyme. The simplest explanation for the relatively low specific activity of bound pro-GelB is that a conformational change induced by binding results in a lesser accessibility of its active center compared with the enzyme with a processed propeptide. However, this interpretation is not plausible because the ratios of specific activities of bound activated GelB to bound proenzyme against the small peptide substrate and high molecular mass substrate, gelatin, are essentially the same. Similar inhibition of activated and proenzyme forms of GelB bound to gelatin by TIMP-1 also argues against this possibility. Alternatively, one can speculate that only a fraction of substrate-bound pro-GelB is activated, so that interaction with only a subset of the heterogeneous binding sites can support the conformational rearrangements needed for enzyme activation. Heterogeneous, low and high affinity collagen type I binding sites for pro-MMP-9 with Kd values in the 6 × 10−13 to 9 × 10−8m range have been reported (52Allan J.A. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 365-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Denatured collagen, gelatin, may present an even more complex mixture of binding sites (53Collier I.E. Saffarian S. Marmer B.L. Elson E.L. Goldberg G. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2370-2377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of latent gelatinase A, an enzyme closely related to GelB, reveals that the propeptide of this molecule interacts with the fibronectin-like gelatin binding domain through hydrogen bonding and a salt bridge (54Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Hence, binding of the fibronectin-like domain to gelatin can potentially disrupt its interaction with the propeptide, destabilizing its interaction with the active center and consequently leading to enzyme activation. Our results suggest that binding of pro-GelB to the extracellular matrix in vivo may represent a physiological pathway of enzyme activation. GelB can potentially bind a number of extracellular matrix molecules and cell surface receptors (51Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Which of these interactions can mediate GelB activation remains to be elucidated. Further investigation of the relationship between GelB binding and activation is needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of its physiological function.

Here we show that TcGPXI activity can also be linked to trypanothione reduction by an alternative pathway involving the thioredoxin-like protein tryparedoxin. The presence of this new pathway was first detected using dialyzed soluble fractions of parasite extract. Tryparedoxin was identified as the intermediate molecule following purification, sequence analysis, antibody studies, and reconstitution of the redox cycle in vitro. The system can be readily saturated by trypanothione, the rate-limiting step being the interaction of trypanothione with the tryparedoxin. Both tryparedoxin and TcGPXI operate by a ping-pong mechanism. Overexpression of TcGPXI in transfected parasites confers increased resistance to exogenous hydroperoxides. TcGPXI contains a carboxyl-terminal tripeptide (ARI) that could act as a targeting signal for the glycosome, a kinetoplastid-specific organelle. Using immunofluorescence, tagged fluorescent proteins, and biochemical fractionation, we have demonstrated that TcGPXI is localized to both the glycosome and the cytosol. The ability of TcGPXI to use alternative electron donors may reflect their availability at the corresponding subcellular sites.

Members of the family Kinetoplastida cause a variety of diseases that afflict humans including African sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei), Chagas' disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and visceral/cutaneous leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp). The search for new drug targets is a priority because existing chemotherapeutic regimes are unsatisfactory. One potential Achilles heel is the apparent limited ability of these parasites to deal with reactive oxygen species such as the superoxide anion and various hydroperoxides (1.Docampo R. Chem. Biol. Inter. 1990; 73: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 2.Flohe L. Hecht H.J. Steinert P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 966-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A number of drugs in current use are believed to mediate part of their activity by inducing oxidative stress either directly by increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (e.g. nifurtimox) (3.Moreno S.N.

Therefore, the functional analysis of the oxidative defense pathways in these parasites may be of importance in terms of improved chemotherapy. In most eukaryotes glutathione plays a central role in protecting cells from oxidative damage. Reducing equivalents are transferred from NADPH to the hydroperoxide by the concerted action of glutathione reductase, glutathione, and glutathione-dependent peroxidases. Trypanosomatids lack glutathione reductase, and this pathway is modified (Fig. 1). They possess an analogous redox system centered upon the trypanosomatid-specific thiol trypanothione. Here trypanothione, a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine (N 1The abbreviations used are: TcGPXIT. cruzi glutathione-dependent peroxidase ITcGPXIIT. cruzi glutathione-dependent peroxidase IIgGAPDHglycosomal glyeraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRFPred fluorescent proteineGFP enhanced green fluorescent proteinRACE, rapid amplification of cDNA endsPBSphosphate-buffered saline1The abbreviations used are: TcGPXIT. cruzi glutathione-dependent peroxidase ITcGPXIIT. cruzi glutathione-dependent peroxidase IIgGAPDHglycosomal glyeraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseRFPred fluorescent proteineGFP enhanced green fluorescent proteinRACE, rapid amplification of cDNA endsPBSphosphate-buffered saline ,N 8-bisglutathionylspermidine), is maintained as dihydrotrypanothione by the activity of the NADPH-dependent flavoprotein trypanothione reductase. Dihydrotrypanothione has been shown to drive distinct pathways. In these pathways, reducing equivalents are transferred from dihydrotrypanothione to the hydroperoxide via a two-step oxidoreductase cascade involving either tryparedoxin and peroxiredoxin enzymes (Fig. 1 A) or glutathione and glutathione-dependent peroxidases (Fig. 1 B) (9.Nogoceke E.

These enzymes can metabolize hydrogen peroxide and short chain organic hydroperoxides generated within different compartments of the cell; one peroxiredoxin has a cytosolic location (T. cruzi cytoplasmic peroxiredoxin), and the other is found in the mitochondrion (T. cruzi mitochondrial peroxiredoxin) (11.Wilkinson S.R. Temperton N.J. Mondragon A. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8220-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For the glutathione system, we have identified two T. cruziglutathione-dependent peroxidases, TcGPXI1 and TcGPXII (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.Wilkinson S.R. Kelly J.M. Kelly J.M. Molecular Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Chagas' Disease.

Although both enzymes are members of the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione-dependent peroxidase subgroup of glutathione-dependent peroxidases, they can be distinguished from each other on the basis of sequence and their substrate specificity; both enzymes can metabolize fatty acid and phospholipid hydroperoxides, but only TcGPXI can metabolize short chain hydroperoxides. Neither TcGPXI nor TcGPXII can metabolize hydrogen peroxide (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14.Wilkinson S.R. Kelly J.M. Kelly J.M. Molecular Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Chagas' Disease. Eurekah.com/Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2002Google Scholar). The identification of these distinct pathways demonstrates that T. cruzi does possess an effective enzymatic hydroperoxide metabolizing capability, a question that until recently had been open to debate (18.Carnieri E.V.S. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This led us to speculate that some other pathway may act as an additional source of reducing equivalents for this enzyme. Here we describe the purification and identification of a tryparedoxin molecule that acts as an alternative redox shuttle between trypanothione and TcGPXI. We also demonstrate that TcGPXI has dual localization in T. cruzi and is present in both the glycosome and the cytosol. This distribution may account for the ability of TcGPXI to scavenge reducing equivalents from different sources. T. cruzi(MHOM/BR/78/Silvio - X10/6 or CL-Brener) epimastigotes were grown at 28 °C in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) containing the supplements previously described (19.Kendall G. Wilderspin A.F. Ashall F. Miles M.A. Kelly J.M. EMBO J. 1992; 9: 2751-2758Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recombinant T. cruzi were maintained in the same medium containing either 200 μg of G418 ml−1 alone or 100 μg of G418 ml−1 with 20 μg of hygromycin ml−1 where appropriate. T. cruzi genomic DNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using the proteinase K/SDS method (20.Kelly J.M. Hyde J.E. Protocols in Molecular Parasitology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Google Scholar). Intact T. cruzi chromosomes for contour clamped homogenous electric field analysis were extracted using an agarose-embedding technique (21.Gibson W.C. Miles M.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1299-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). T. cruzi total RNA was prepared using the guanidinum thiocyanate lysis method (20.Kelly J.M. Hyde J.E. Protocols in Molecular Parasitology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and fractionated on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. Recombinant His-tagged TcGPXI was purified from Escherichia coli BL-21 on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column as described (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Tryparedoxin (designated TcTPNI) was purified as follows. 15 liters of epimastigotes in the late logarithmic phase of growth were harvested, washed, and resuspended in argon-saturated, ice-cold buffer 1 (20 mmbis-Tris propane, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (100 μg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg ml−1 E-64, 0.5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 1.7 μg ml−1 pepstatin A). The cells were lysed by repeated (three times) rounds of freeze thawing, the debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the clarified lysate was concentrated using Centriprep YM-3 columns (Amicon). The retenate was then dialyzed extensively (twice for 2 h; once overnight) against argon-saturated buffer 2 (20 mmbis-Tris propane, pH 7.2) at 4 °C. The extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a step gradient of KCl (0, 35, 70, and 300 mm in buffer 2). The redox active fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively against argon-saturated buffer 3 (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) at 4 °C. The sample was loaded onto a 2′,5′ ADP-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences), and the active, flow through fraction was collected. This was concentrated on Centricon YM-3 columns (Amicon) and then dialyzed extensively against buffer 4 (25 mmTris·Cl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol) at 4 °C. The sample was loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–300 mm) in buffer 4. Amino acid sequencing was carried out by Severn Biotech. Because tryparedoxin was shown to be amino-terminally blocked, the protein was first treated with 2% dithiothreitol and then cleaved with CNBr in 70% formic acid. Peptides were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer linked to a 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. A DNA fragment containingTcTPNI was identified by a 3′-RACE approach using T. cruzi cDNA prepared from epimastigote mRNA with the primer ANCdT-RACE (GAATTCGATATCGGTACCT16). The cDNA was used as template in amplification reactions with a sense primer (TPNI-1; aagcttTCCGCCTCCTGGTGCCCG) designed to a sequence generated by theT. cruzi genome project (GenBank™accession number AI110351) and an antisense primer (ANC-RACE; GAATTCGATATCGGTACC). Restriction sites were incorporated into the primers to facilitate cloning of the amplified product into pBluescript KS(−) (Stratagene). A derivative of TcTPNI was amplified from T. cruzi genomic DNA using the primers TPNI-3 (agatctTGGTTTGGCGAAGTACCTC) and TPNI-4 (aagcttTTAGTCGGACCAGGGGAA). The product was cloned into the BglII andHindIII sites of the E. coli expression vector pTrcHis-C (Invitrogen). E. coli XL-1 Blue, transformed with the plasmid pTrcHis-TPNI, was grown in NZCYM broth (Sigma) containing 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin at 37 °C with aeration. When the culture was in the mid-logarithmic phase of growth, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were grown for a further 3 h at 37 °C before harvesting the cells by centrifugation. Recombinant His-tagged TcTPNI was affinity-purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix column under native conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The cell lysis, column wash, and elution steps were all carried out in the presence of protease inhibitors (see above). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay system (Pierce). Trypanothione-dependent peroxidase activity was measured by monitoring NADPH oxidation (18.Carnieri E.V.S. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A standard reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADPH, 0.5 μm trypanothione reductase, 20 μmtrypanothione, 2 μm recombinant TcGPXI, and 1 μm TcTPNI (recombinant or trypanosome-derived) was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The background rate of NADPH oxidation was determined, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of cumene hydroperoxide (Sigma). The enzyme activity was calculated using a ε value of 6220 m−1 cm−1. The peroxidase activity caused by auto-oxidation of trypanothione and any co-purified E. coli proteins was negligible. Glutathione-dependent TcGPXI peroxidase activity was carried out as described (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding a TcGPXI (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number AJ313314) was amplified from T. cruzi CL-Brener genomic DNA using the primers GPXI-1 (actagtGTTGGATCCATGTTTCGTTTCGGTCAATTG) and GPXI-2 (atcgatGGGAAGCTTTCAAATCCTAGCACCACCAA). Restriction sites were incorporated into the primers to facilitate cloning of the amplified product into the T. cruzi expression vector pRIBOTEX (22.Martinez-Calvillo S. Lopez I. Hernandez R. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 199: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The open reading frame encoding the red fluorescent protein (RFP) was amplified from the plasmid pDsRED1-C1 (CLONTECH) using the primers RED-1 (gatatcATGGTGCGCTCCTCCAAGAA) and RED-2 (gatcagTTATCTAGATCCGGT) and cloned into the T. cruziexpression vector pTEX (25.Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Smith K. Hunter K.J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding the carboxyl-terminal region (last 31 amino acids) of TcGPXI was amplified from the expression vector pTrcHis-GPXI (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and then cloned in-frame with the RFP. The entire gene fusion was then transferred across into the vector pTEX-HYGb. 2E. V. Bromley, unpublished data. The open reading frame encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) minus its stop codon was amplified from the plasmid pEGFP (CLONTECH) using the primers GFP1 (ctgcagGTCGACTTCTCTAGAG) and GFP2 (TAATGCGGCCGCTTCTCGAGTATCGATACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCAT) and cloned into pTEX (23.Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this context, the sequence immediately 3′ to eGFPencodes the carboxyl terminus of T. cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGADPH) (last 51 amino acids). A ClaI site between these two sequences was cleaved and end-filled using the DNA polymerase I (Klenow) fragment, and the vector was religated. This produced an in-frame fusion ofeGFP gene with the 3′ gGAPDH sequence. The above plasmids were introduced into T. cruzi by electroporation and selected using the conditions previously described (24.Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Nickoloff J.A. Methods in Molecular Biology: Electoporation Protocols for Microorganisms. 47. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 349-359Google Scholar). Epimastigotes in the logarithmic phase of growth were seeded at 5 × 105ml−1 into Nunclon multiwell plates (24 wells) in 2 ml of growth medium supplemented with the agent under investigation. After 5 days of growth at 27 °C, the cell density of each culture was determined, and the concentration of hydroperoxide that inhibited parasite growth by 50% (IC50) was established (25.Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Smith K. Hunter K.J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. The His-tagged TcGPXI or T. cruzi-derived TcTPNI proteins were excised from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel and macerated in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The resultant material was suspended in Freund's complete adjuvant, sonicated (six times for 10 s), and then inoculated into mice (BALB/c). At 2-week intervals further inoculations were carried out using gel-purified protein suspended in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. After a total of five inoculations, the mice were bled, and the specificity of the antiserum was tested. For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, T. cruzi in the exponential phase of growth were harvested, washed in 137 mm NaCl, 4 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl (PBS) and fixed with paraformaldehyde (2% (w/v) in PBS). Parasites (2.5 × 105/well) were air-dried onto a microscope slide and then permeablized with methanol for 2 min at −20 °C followed by a 30 min incubation in PBS containing 1% saponin and 10 mg ml−1heat-treated RNase. The cells were then blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), diluted in PBS, and probed with either preimmune or antiserum against TcGPXI diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After 1 h, the slides were extensively washed in PBS and then incubated for a further 1 h with anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. The parasite DNA was then stained using propidium iodide (10 μg ml−1) in PBS containing 1% saponin and 10 mg ml−1 heat-treated RNase. The parasites were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope. Parasites expressing fluorescent proteins were harvested, fixed, and dried onto microscope slides as described above. DNA was stained using PBS containing 1% saponin, 10 mg ml−1 heat-treated RNase, 5 μm TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes) before analysis as described above. Fractionation studies were carried out on T. cruzi cells in the exponential phase of growth as described (26.Cannata J.J. Valle E. Docampo R. Cazzulo J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 6: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes were washed once in 25 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 1 mmEDTA, 0.32 m sucrose (buffer A) and then resuspended in buffer A (5 × 109 cells ml−1) containing protease inhibitors (see above). Silicon carbide was added to the cell paste, and the cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. Differential centrifugation was carried out to remove abrasive (100 ×g; 3 min) and nuclei/cell debris (1000 × g; 10 min). A final centrifugation (14,500 × g; 10 min) produced a “large granule” pellet. Linear density gradients from 0.4 to 2 m sucrose in 25 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA were layered upon a 2.5 m sucrose cushion. The large granule fraction was resuspended in buffer A and applied to the top of the gradient. Isopycnic centrifugation was then carried out using a SW40 rotor in a Beckman L8–80 ultracentrifuge at 200,000 × g for 150 min at 4 °C. 0.75-ml fractions were collected, and the activities of trypanothione reductase (25.Kelly J.M. Taylor M.C. Smith K. Hunter K.J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), NADP+ isocitrate dehydrogenase (27.Rutter G.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and hexokinase (28.Easterby J.S. Qadri S.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were determined. For glutathione-dependent peroxidase (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) activity, the fractions were first dialyzed extensively against 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA prior to analysis. TcGPXI can metabolize a wide range of hydroperoxides using glutathione but not trypanothione as the direct electron donor (12.Wilkinson S.R. Meyer D.J. Kelly J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 755-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether an alternative factor could also act as an electron donor to TcGPXI, we measured the activity of a recombinant form of the enzyme in the presence of T. cruzi cell extract dialyzed extensively against 100 mmHEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 using cumene hydroperoxide as substrate. NADPH oxidation was observed when trypanothione and excess trypanothione reductase were added to the assay. This reconstitution of TcGPXI activity showed that a factor(s) within the extract could act as a redox shuttle between trypanothione and TcGPXI. To identify this molecule, 15 liters of T. cruzi epimastigotes in the late logarithmic phase of growth (Fig. 2) were harvested and lysed by three rounds of freeze thawing, and the extract was clarified. Separation of the lysate on a DEAE-Sepharose column resulted in the binding of this factor to the matrix as a fraction that could be readily eluted using 35 mm KCl (“Experimental Procedures”). The active fractions were purified further on an ADP-Sepharose column to remove any NADPH/NADH binding enzymes and then fractionated on a Mono Q column. Elution of the proteins bound to the Mono Q matrix using a linear NaCl gradient enabled the isolation of a 16-kDa protein (Fig. 2) that was able to link TcGPXI activity to the reduction of trypanothione. The overall yields of the final purification are given in Table I. Based on the purification it would appear that the 16-kDa protein is relatively abundant constituting ∼3% of the total soluble protein within T. cruzi.Table IYields and purification of tryparedoxinVolumeTotal activityProteinSpecific activityYieldPurification(ml)(nmol NADPH oxidized min−1 )(mg)(nmol NADPH oxidized min−1 mg−1 )(%)(fold)Crude extract5.00163065.325.01001DEAE-Sepharose6.0015599.0173.2966.92′, 5′-ADP-Sepharose2.007434.0185.6467Mono Q1.084810.7686.83027.5TcTPNI was purified from T. cruzi epimastigotes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab TcTPNI was purified from T. cruzi epimastigotes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Preliminary attempts at amino acid sequencing of the 16-kDa protein demonstrated that the factor was blocked at its amino terminus (“Experimental Procedures”). After cleavage with CNBr, a peptide was sequenced and shown to be identical to part of a tryparedoxin molecule that we had cloned previously and designated as TcTPNI. Sequence analysis revealed that TcTPNI has extensive identity (51–63%) to tryparedoxins from other trypanosomatids and lower identity (33%) to a second tryparedoxin from T. cruzi (designated TcTPNII) (Fig. 3). TcTPNII is also distinct from other tryparedoxins in that it contains an insertion in the sequence, the role of which has yet to be determined. One feature that all tryparedoxins share is the motif WCPPC located near their amino terminus (Fig. 3, region A). This motif has been shown to play a crucial role in oxidoreductase redox activity (29.Gommel D.U. Nogoceke E. Morr M. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohe L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Analysis of TcTPNI using PSORT did not identify any potential targeting signals, consistent with previous observations that these molecules are cytosolic in Crithidia fasciculata and T. brucei(13.Tetaud E.

The genomic organization of TcTPNI within T. cruzi was investigated by Southern hybridization and by contour clamped homogenous electric field analysis (data not shown). This indicated that TcTPNI is single copy and is located on a 1.4 megabase pair chromosome. To confirm that TcTPNI could function as a redox shuttle, the full-length TcTPNI gene was ligated into the vector pTrcHis-C (Invitrogen) and expressed in E. coli XL-1Blue after isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. In this system, the recombinant TcTPNI is tagged at its amino terminus with a histidine-rich sequence and an epitope detectable with the anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) and can be identified as an 18-kDa protein within the soluble fraction of E. coliextracts (data not shown). The recombinant fusion protein could be readily purified by one round of affinity chromatography on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. Using recombinant TcTPNI, a series of assays were carried out aimed at reconstituting the peroxidase pathway (Fig. 4). The components of the tryparedoxin-mediated hydroperoxide metabolizing pathway were added sequentially to the reaction mixture, and TcGPXI activity was measured by following the change in NADPH oxidation. When any of the constituents of the pathway were missing, no activity was detected. In situations where all the components of this pathway (trypanothione reductase, trypanothione, TcTPNI, and TcGPXI) were present, TcGPXI activity was restored. The pathway could not be reconstituted when recombinant His-tagged TcTPNII was used in place of TcTPNI. These experiments clearly demonstrate that TcTPNI is part of the flux of reducing equivalents from trypanothione to TcGPXI. Western blot analysis was also carried out to confirm that TcTPNI was the same factor as the 16-kDa protein that was purified from the parasite. Antiserum generated against the 16-kDa T. cruzi-derived molecule (“Experimental Procedures”) was use"

The signaling pathways activated by Ras proteins are those controlled by its direct effectors such as the serine-threonine protein kinase Raf-1, the exchange factor for other GTPases Ral-GDS, and the lipid kinase PI3K. As a consequence of Ras activation, a number of additional enzymes are affected, including several members of the serine-threonine intracellular proteins kinases as well as enzymes related to phospholipid metabolism regulation such as phospholipases A2 and D, and choline kinase. The precise mechanisms by which ras oncogenes impinge into these later molecules and their relevance to the onset of the carcinogenic process is still not fully understood. Here we have investigated the mechanism of regulation of choline kinase by Ras proteins and found no direct link between PLD and choline kinase activation. We provide evidence that Ras proteins regulate the activity of choline kinase through its direct effectors Ral-GDS and PI3K, while the Raf pathways seems to be not relevant in this process. The importance of Ras-dependent activation of choline kinase is discussed."

The protein level and enzymatic activity of 15-LOX2 have been shown to be down-regulated in prostate cancers compared with normal and benign prostate tissues. The biological function of 15-LOX2 and the role of loss of 15-LOX2 expression in prostate tumorigenesis, however, remain unknown. We report the cloning and functional characterization of 15-LOX2 and its three splice variants (termed 15-LOX2sv-a, 15-LOX2sv-b, and 15-LOX2sv-c) from primary prostate epithelial cells. Western blotting with multiple primary prostate cell strains and prostate cancer cell lines reveals that the expression of 15-LOX2 is lost in all prostate cancer cell lines, accompanied by decreased enzymatic activity revealed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Further experiments show that the loss of 15-LOX2 expression results from transcriptional repression caused by mechanism(s) other than promoter hypermethylation or histone deacetylation. Subsequent functional studies indicate the following: 1) the 15-LOX2 product, 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, inhibits prostate cancer cell cycle progression; 2) 15-LOX2 expression in primary prostate epithelial cells is inversely correlated with cell cycle; and 3) restoration of 15-LOX2 expression in prostate cancer cells partially inhibits cell cycle progression.

Animal and epidemiological studies suggest a strong link between fat (in particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids) intake/content in the diet and prostate cancer development and progression (1Giovannucci E.

The major polyunsaturated fatty acids in the human diet is linoleic acid, which is the precursor to arachidonic acid (AA).1 AA is metabolized via three major biochemical pathways as follows: the cyclooxygenase pathway leading to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane; the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway giving rise to various hydroperoxy and hydroxy (HETE) fatty acids as well as leukotrienes; and the P450-dependent epoxygenase pathway generating epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. AA itself and many of its metabolites (i.e. eicosanoids) are involved in growth-promoting signaling, which may help drive cell proliferation and promote tumor development (4Tang D.G. Chen Y.

G., La, E., Kern, J., and Kehrer, J. P. (2002) Biol. Chem. 383, in pressGoogle Scholar).AA is metabolized to a variety of bioactive hydroperoxy and hydroxy fatty acid molecules via LOX. To date at least 18 different LOX sequences have been published, but the biological functions for most of these LOXs remain unknown (10Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 11Kuhn H. Thiele B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In human prostate, four LOX molecules, i.e. 5-LOX, 12-LOX, 15-LOX1, and 15-LOX2, have been reported at the mRNA, protein, or activity level (12–23). Different LOXs have been proposed to play different contributory roles in prostate tumorigenesis, e.g. 5-LOX being a survival factor (12Ghosh J. Myers C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 13Anderson K.M. Seed T. Vos M. Mulshine J. Meng J. Ou W. Alrefai D. Harris J.E. Prostate. 1998; 37: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), 12-LOX being a proangiogenic factor (16Nie D. Tang K. Diglio C.A. Honn K.V. Blood. 2000; 95: 2304-2311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 15-LOX1 somehow affecting p53 functions (18Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These three LOXs have been reported to be up-regulated in prostate cancer cells (14Gupta S. Srivastava M. Ahmad N. Sakamoto K.

Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although, in many cases, this correlation has not been corroborated by simultaneous measurement of protein (or mRNA) expression and enzymatic activities.15-LOX2 is yet another LOX molecule implicated in prostate cancer development. Cloned first by Brash and colleagues (19Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), 15-LOX2 is most homologous (∼80% amino acid identity) to murine 8-LOX and shows only ∼40% identity to human 5-LOX, 12-LOX, or 15-LOX1 (19Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A splice variant of 15-LOX2 with an in-frame 87-bp deletion has also been reported (20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 15-LOX2 metabolizes exclusively AA to produce 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) (19Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). 15-LOX2 shows an interesting tissue expression pattern, i.e. only in prostate, lung, skin, and cornea (19Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This tissue-restricted expression pattern suggests that 15-LOX2 may play a role in the normal development of prostate and the other three tissues, and its abnormal expression/function could contribute to tumorigenesis in some of these tissues. Indeed, work by Shappell and co-workers (21Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Jack G.S. Brash A.R. Olson S.J. Manning S. Coffey C.S. Smith Jr., J.A. Shappell S.B. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) indicates that both 15-LOX2 protein expression and its enzymatic activity are decreased in prostate cancer tissues, and the expression levels of 15-LOX2 are inversely correlated with the pathological grade and Gleason scores of the patients. These findings suggest that 15-LOX2 may normally help maintain the differentiated phenotype of prostate epithelial cells and that loss of 15-LOX2 expression may contribute to prostate cancer development and progression. The major goal of our study is to elucidate the biological functions of 15-LOX2 in normal prostate development as well as in prostate cancer development. In this paper we provide evidence that 15-LOX2 is a negative cell cycle regulator in normal prostate epithelial cells, which may explain why it is advantageous for prostate cancer cells to lose its expression.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of the present study are as follows: 1) 15-LOX2 is the major LOX expressed in NHP cells, which also express at least three 15-LOX2 splice variants; 2) 15-LOX2 protein expression is lost and its enzymatic activity greatly reduced in all prostate cancer cells examined; 3) loss of 15-LOX2 expression results from transcriptional repression via mechanisms other than promoter hypermethylation or histone deacetylation-induced chromatin compaction; 4) 15-LOX2 product, 15(S)-HETE, preferentially inhibits cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells; and 5) most importantly, 15-LOX2 expression in NHP cells is inversely correlated with cell cycle progression. Restoration of 15-LOX2 expression in prostate cancer cells induces cell cycle arrest. Together, these data provide strong evidence that 15-LOX2 may be an endogenous negative cell cycle regulator in NHP cells, which explains, in part, why it is advantageous for prostate cancer cells to suppress its expression.NHP Cells Express Abundant 15-LOX2 and at Least Three Splice VariantsSeveral arachidonate LOXs, including 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX-1, have been reported to be up-regulated in prostate cancer cells (see Introduction). 15-LOX2, by contrast, is the first LOX found to be expressed abundantly in normal prostate but decreased or lost in prostate cancers in vivo (see Refs. 21Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and 22Jack G.S. Brash A.R. Olson S.J. Manning S. Coffey C.S. Smith Jr., J.A. Shappell S.B. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and see Supplemental Fig. 1). 15-LOX2 gene is localized on chromosome 17p13.1, a region where 12-LOX and 15-LOX1 genes also reside (44Krieg P. Marks F. Furstenberger G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 15-LOX2 gene consists of 14 exons (Table II; see Ref. 44Krieg P. Marks F. Furstenberger G. Genomics. 2001; 73: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a structural organization similar to those of 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX1 (10Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 11Kuhn H. Thiele B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 15-LOX2 has at least three splice variants. 15-LOX2sv-a, which is identical to the splice variant previously identified (20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), is missing exon 9. Three-dimensional modeling of 15-LOX2sv-a structure, based on the crystallography data of 15-LOX1, suggests that a complete α-helix made of exon 9 is removed from the substrate-binding pocket (20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, 15-LOX2sv-a possesses reduced specific activity in metabolizing AA compared with 15-LOX2 (20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistent with its reduced enzymatic activity, we found that 15-LOX2sv-a also has a reduced biological (i.e.inhibiting BrdUrd incorporation) activity compared with 15-LOX2. Whether 15-LOX2sv-b and 15-LOX2sv-c have reduced enzymatic activities is currently under further investigation, although we did observe that the transfected 15-LOX2sv-b did not significantly inhibit the BrdUrd incorporation or cell proliferation (Fig. 8 and data not shown).On Western blotting, we could variably detect three bands that migrate immediately below the 15-LOX2 band in NHP cells (e.g. Fig. 1and Fig. 3b). Based on their relative molecular weight, these three bands may represent 15-LOX2sv-a, 15-LOX2sv-c, and 15-LOX2sv-b, respectively. These splice variants are generally expressed at much lower levels than 15-LOX2; with 1 μg of mRNA we could not detect their message (Fig. 2b), and their protein levels are also lower and variable (Fig. 1 and Fig. 3b). However, unlike 15-LOX2, these splice variants are still expressed in prostate cancer cells at variable levels. Interestingly, at least one more upper band and two other lower bands are also detected only in NHP but not in cancer cells (Fig. 1, arrowheads). Whether they also represent 15-LOX2 splice variants remains to be determined. When we performed PCR cloning with K-H primers, we detected several additional bands in addition to the three splice variants, 2S. Tang and D. G. Tang, unpublished observations. suggesting that there are probably more 15-LOX2 splice variants.The biological functions of these splice variants are unclear. Like all other alternatively spliced products (45Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), they may help regulate and fine-tune the biological functions of the parental 15-LOX2. Because these splice variants have reduced enzymatic activities (20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but still can bind substrate (i.e. AA), it is conceivable that, under certain circumstances, they may function to “sink” AA so as to adjust the availability of AA to 15-LOX2.15-LOX2 Expression Is Lost in All Prostate Cancer Cells ExaminedThat 15-LOX2 plays an important role in maintaining normal prostate homeostasis is also supported by the fact that prostate cancer cells lose its expression in vivo (21Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Jack G.S. Brash A.R. Olson S.J. Manning S. Coffey C.S. Smith Jr., J.A. Shappell S.B. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) andin vitro (this study). The decrease or loss of 15-LOX2 expression in prostate cancer tissues occurs in the precursor lesion, high grade PIN (see Refs. 21Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar and 22Jack G.S. Brash A.R. Olson S.J. Manning S. Coffey C.S. Smith Jr., J.A. Shappell S.B. Hum. Pathol. 2000; 31: 1146-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar and Supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that this may represent an early event in prostate tumorigenesis.It is remarkable that all prostate cancer cells examined lost the expression of 15-LOX2. Even SV40-immortalized but non-transformed prostate epithelial cells lose 15-LOX2 expression. 3B. Bhatia and D. G. Tang, unpublished observations. Accompanying the loss of 15-LOX2 expression, prostate cancer cells also show reduced expression of 15-LOX2 splice variants. The decreased 15-LOX2 message (Fig. 4a) and protein (not shown) in TP1 primary carcinoma cells again suggest that suppression of 15-LOX2 expression may represent an early event in prostate tumorigenesis. The loss of 15-LOX2 protein expression leads to much less 15(S)-HETE production in prostate cancer cells compared with NHP cells (Table I). The low amount of 15(S)-HETE in prostate cancer cells may come from residual 15-LOX2 splice variants and/or 15-LOX1.The loss of 15-LOX2 protein expression in cultured prostate cancer cells could result from transcriptional repression; Northern blotting fails to reveal and RT-PCR reveals only low levels or no 15-LOX2 mRNA expression in these cells (Fig. 2). Epigenetic gene silencing mechanisms, as a consequence of promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation-induced chromatin over-compaction, account for the transcriptional suppression of numerous mammalian (including some LOX) genes (37Jones P.A. Takai D. Science. 2001; 293: 1068-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar, 39Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar, 46Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, 15-LOX-1 expression in human colorectal carcinoma cells appears to be regulated by histone acetylation (46Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, these mechanisms do not seem to be responsible for the transcriptional silencing of 15-LOX2 in prostate cancer cells, as inhibitors of DNA methylation and/or HDAC could not relieve this suppression. Another potential mechanism for the loss of 15-LOX2 expression in prostate cancer cells is due to gene mutation, especially when considering that 15-LOX2 locus (17p13.1) is very close to p53 gene locus (17p13.2), which is frequently mutated in advanced prostate cancers (47Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, that suppression of 15-LOX2 protein expression occurs in precursor lesions (i.e. high grade PIN) and in primary carcinoma cells (TP1) casts some doubts on this possibility. 15-LOX1 mRNA expression is silenced during erythroid differentiation as a result of regulation at the 3′-untranslated region by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (48Ostarek D.H. Ostarek-Lederer A. Shatsky I.N. Hentze M.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Whether similar mechanisms involving RNA-binding proteins or transcription factors exist to silence the 15-LOX2 gene expression in prostate cancer cells is one of our ongoing research projects.What Is the Biological Function of 15-LOX2?Because 15-LOX2 is abundantly expressed in NHP cells but is lost in prostate cancer cells, the molecule may normally function by helping maintain the differentiated phenotype of prostate epithelial cells, restrict cell cycle progression, induce apoptosis of damaged or worn-out cells, or limit the migratory (or invasive) cellular behavior. These functions may not be mutually exclusive. One clue to 15-LOX2 function(s) comes from an analysis of the effect of its product, 15(S)-HETE, on prostate (cancer) cell proliferation and survival. At ≥25 μm, 15(S)-HETE induces apoptosis, and, at <25 μm, 15(S)-HETE reduces the number of cells in S-phase. 15(S)-HETE was recently shown to have a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on colony formation of PC3 cells in soft agar with an IC50 at ∼30 μm (23Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503PubMed Google Scholar). This value is very similar to our data. It is unlikely that the 15(S)-HETE effect on prostate cancer cells is caused by nonspecific fatty acid cytotoxicity (9Tang, D. G., La, E., Kern, J., and Kehrer, J. P. (2002) Biol. Chem. 383, in pressGoogle Scholar), because several other related eicosanoids tested show very different or even opposite effects. It is worth pointing out that the effective inhibitory dose(s) of 15(S)-HETE on prostate cancer cells are high (Table I) (23Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503PubMed Google Scholar). This is not very surprising because, very possibly, only a small fraction of 15(S)-HETE administered actually gets inside cells. Moreover, eicosanoids including 15(S)-HETE have been proposed to exert some of their biological functions through activating nuclear hormone receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activating receptors (PPAR), and the effective doses for eicosanoid activation of PPAR are at the 20–50 μm range (23Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N.

Therefore, if 15(S)-HETE is exerting its inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cells via PPARγ (23Shappell S.B. Gupta R.A. Manning S. Whitehead R. Boeglin W.E. Schneider C. Case T. Price J. Jack G.S. Wheeler T.M. Matusik R.J. Brash A.R. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 497-503PubMed Google Scholar, 50Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Wilson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), one would have to use high doses of this agonist. Cultured NHP cells produce ∼30 ng of 15(S)-HETE/5 million cells when given exogenous AA (Table I), which corresponds to ∼20 pmol of intracellular 15(S)-HETE/106 cells. Whether this concentration is high enough to produce any biological effect and how much endogenous 15(S)-HETE is produced by cultured NHP cells or NHP cells in vivo remain unknown. The biological function(s) of 15-LOX2, if mediated through its enzymatic activity, will be influenced by the availability of its substrate, AA. It is conceivable that under stimulated conditions both the concentration of free AA and the enzymatic activity of 15-LOX2 (20Kilty I. Alison L. Vickers P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) may be up-regulated, leading to an increased 15(S)-HETE production and resultant cell cycle arrest and/or cell death.Interestingly, NHP cells are more resistant to 15(S)-HETE-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Table III and Fig. 5b). This makes sense as these cells normally express abundant 15-LOX2 and produce endogenous 15(S)-HETE. This differential response may partially explain why prostate cancer cells lose 15-LOX2, because 15(S)-HETE is inhibitory to their clonal expansion. That TP1 primary carcinoma cells show more sensitive response than NHP2 cells, which are isolated from the same patient as TP1 cells (24Chopra D.P. Grignon D.J. Joiakim A. Mathieu P.A. Mohamed A. Sakr W.A. Powell I.J. Sarkar F.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), to 15(S)-HETE again supports the notion that decreased/lost 15-LOX2 expression and activity may represent an early molecular event during prostate tumorigenesis.But what is the biological function(s) of 15-LOX2? Immunofluorescent staining surprisingly reveals that log-phase NHP cells heterogeneously express 15-LOX2, and this heterogeneity is even reflected among cells within one clone. Because most 15-LOX2+ cells are larger than 15-LOX2− cells and also because 15(S)-HETE induces cell cycle arrest, we suspect that 15-LOX2 expression may be inversely correlated with cell cycle progression. Two lines of experiments subsequently confirmed this hypothesis. First, in log-phase NHP cell cultures, <2% 15-LOX2+ cells are BrdUrd+, whereas ∼35% 15-LOX2− cells are BrdUrd+. The very few 15-LOX2+ cells that are BrdUrd+ show low levels of 15-LOX2 expression, suggesting that perhaps 15-LOX2 protein expression has to reach a certain threshold to arrest cell cycle. Second, when NHP2 cells are subjected to starvation, there is an up-regulation in 15-LOX2 expression, from ∼13 to 35%, and there is a corresponding decrease in the number of cells in S-phase, from ∼35 to <2%. Although both sets of experiments do not establish whether it is the 15-LOX2 accumulation that arrests cell cycle or it is the cell cycle arrest that accumulates 15-LOX2, the observations do suggest that 15-LOX2 expressionis correlated with cell cycle arrest. Because ∼65% of NHP2 cells are not in cell cycle and only 13–20% of this population of cells express 15-LOX2, these results suggest that either 15-LOX2 expression is only one of the contributing factors in arresting cell cycle or, perhaps, 15-LOX2 protein is degraded before the cells are about to exit G1.Subsequent expression studies provide convincing evidence that 15-LOX2 expression does cause cell cycle arrest; restoration of 15-LOX2 expression in prostate cancer cells that have lost 15-LOX2 expression inhibits cell cycle progression and proliferation, leading to reduced cell number. 15-LOX2 overexpression in HEK 293, PPC-1, PC3, and Du145 cells for 3–5 days does not result in increased apoptosis. Even further overexpression of 15-LOX2 in NHP2 cells does not lead to apoptosis.3 These observations suggest that, under unstimulated conditions, 15-LOX2 expression is not pro-apoptotic. This conclusion is consistent with the fact that NHP cells in vivo and in vitro express abundant 15-LOX2. This conclusion is also consistent with the effect of 15(S)-HETE, which only causes apoptosis when used at non-physiologically high concentrations. Together, these results suggest that, under basal conditions, perhaps only certain amounts of 15(S)-HETE can be produced, due to limited availability of AA, from either endogenous (in NHP cells) or exogenous (in transfected cancer cells) 15-LOX2 to help induce cell cycle arrest. These results also predict that, under stimulated conditions when increased AA becomes available, 15-LOX2 might cause cell apoptosis.In summary, in this study we provide evidence that 15-LOX2 is a negative cell cycle regulator in normal prostate epithelial cells. Because normal adult prostate epithelial cells proliferate extremely slowly in vivo (47Abate-Shen C. Shen M.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), the abundant expression of 15-LOX2 may help keep these cells in a relatively quiescent and differentiated state. That some 15-LOX2 also seems to localize to cell-cell borders (Fig. 6c) suggests that 15-LOX2 may also exert its biological functions via other mechanisms. Future studies will be directed toward understanding how 15-LOX2 (or its product) interacts with the cell cycle machinery and how prostate cancer cells suppress its expression. Lipid signaling molecules markedly modulate prostate tumorigenesis. Animal and epidemiological studies suggest a strong link between fat (in particular, polyunsaturated fatty acids) intake/content in the diet and prostate cancer development and progression (1Giovannucci E.

The immune response of mammals to multicellular parasite infections and allergens is characterized by the recruitment of eosinophils (1.Meeusen E.N.T. Balic A. Parasitol.

Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The role eosinophils play in both parasite infections and allergic reactions remains controversial, and little is known of the specific function of eosinophil constituents in combating multicellular parasites or exacerbating allergic responses. The presence of eosinophils and eosinophil-derived products in the respiratory tract does, however, correlate with the pathological manifestations of allergic asthma (2.Kay A.B. Barata L. Meng Q. Durham S.R. Ying S. Int. Allergy Immunol. 1997; 113: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3.Greenhalgh C.J. Jacobs H.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Immunol.

Allergy. 2002; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).One of the limitations in the study of eosinophils is the scarcity of this cell population in normal individuals and the difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers of unmanipulated cells from allergic tissues. Sheep offer a unique experimental system in which large numbers of eosinophils can be obtained using the relatively non-invasive procedure of mammary infusion of allergens followed by “milking” of the mammary gland to obtain the inflammatory cells recruited into the lumen (5.De Monchy J.G.

Invest. 1991; 87: 1470-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Using this experimental system, the present study describes the identification of a novel galectin (galectin-14) specifically expressed by eosinophils. The expression of galectin-14 was up-regulated in the lung tissue of sensitized sheep challenged with house dust mite extract (HDM), 1The abbreviations used are: HDMhouse dust mite extractBALbronchoalveolar lavageMAL mammary lavagePFS, pyrogen-free salineGSTglutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyTCFtranscription factorSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationRTreverse transcriptaseBSAbovine serum albuminUTRuntranslated regionPBSphosphate-buffered saline1The abbreviations used are: HDMhouse dust mite extractBALbronchoalveolar lavageMAL mammary lavagePFS, pyrogen-free salineGSTglutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyTCFtranscription factorSTATsignal transducer and activator of transcriptionCRDcarbohydrate recognition domainMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationRTreverse transcriptaseBSAbovine serum albuminUTRuntranslated regionPBSphosphate-buffered saline and the protein was released into the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid.Galectins are carbohydrate binding proteins that have been increasingly implicated in both adaptive and innate immune responses. The eosinophil-specific expression of galectin-14 and its secretion into the lumen of the lung in a sheep asthma model indicates that it may play an important role in regulating the activity of eosinophils during allergic responses and further highlights the importance of carbohydrate binding proteins during inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll experimental animal procedures and collection of tissues and cells were approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne.Collection of Mammary Lavage (MAL) SamplesTo induce eosinophil migration into the mammary gland, mature non-lactating Merino ewes were primed every 2 weeks by intramammary infusions of 1 mg of solubilized house dust mite extract (HDM, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd., Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), rested for 3–4 weeks and challenged with an intramammary infusion of 1 mg of solubilized HDM. MAL was collected 2 days post-HDM challenge by infusion of sterile pyrogen-free saline (PFS, Baxter Healthcare Pty. Ltd., New South Wales, Australia) followed by milking of the gland as described previously (3.Greenhalgh C.J. Jacobs H.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 4.Bischof R.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed in PFS. The proportion of eosinophils in the leukocyte suspensions, as determined by Giemsa-stained cytospots, varied from 75 to 90%.Other sheep received a single intramammary infusion of lipopolysaccharide, and MAL cells were collected at 24 h and 5 days, which results in an initial influx of predominantly neutrophils (24 h), followed by macrophage infiltration at day 5 (3.Greenhalgh C.J. Jacobs H.J. Meeusen E.N.T. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 7.McDowell G.H. Lee C.S. Lascelles A.K. Res. Vet. Sci. 1969; 10: 13-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Collection of Lung Tissue and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Samples4- to 5-month-old parasite-free female merino-cross lambs were sensitized by three subcutaneous injections of 50 μg of HDM, solubilized in PFS with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant (1:1). Sheep that showed a high HDM-specific IgE serum response were challenged 2–3 weeks later with 1 mg of solubilized HDM, in the lower left lung lobe using a fiber optic bronchoscope (Pentax FG-16×, 5.5 mm OD). The right lung lobe of the same sheep was challenged with PFS only as a control. BAL samples were collected from each challenge and control lung site before and 6–48 h post-challenge, by gently adding and aspirating 5 ml of PFS through the bronchoscope port. Sheep were sacrificed, and lung tissue samples were collected after the final BAL sample collections (∼48 h post-challenge) for histology. Cells within the BAL were quantified using a Neubauer hemacytometer, and eosinophil numbers were determined on Giemsa-stained cytospots.Larger BAL leukocyte populations required for RNA preparation were collected from whole lung lavage of left and right lung lobes by occluding the entrance to one lung lobe with a Foley catheter as described previously (8.Dunphy J. Horvath A. Barcham G. Balic A. Bischof R. Meeusen E. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2001; 82: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lung tissue was also collected from each lung lobe for RNA preparation and histology.Peripheral Blood LeukocytesPeripheral blood was drawn from the jugular vein of sheep into plastic tubes containing EDTA-Na2 (BDH Merck, Victoria, Australia). Red blood cells were lysed with TAC (0.17 m Tris/0.16 mNH4Cl, pH 7.2) at 37 °C, and the remaining leukocytes were washed in PBS, and resuspended in 1% BSA/PBS.RNA PreparationTotal RNA was purified from 0.1–1 g of tissue or ∼1 × 108 cells using a standard guanidinium thiocyanate, phenol/chloroform extraction (9.Chomczynski P.

The PCR primer that resulted in amplification of the partial galectin-14 cDNA was DisplayPROBEsEu4 (see Table I). PCR products of interest were re-amplified and subcloned into pGEM-Teasy (Promega) before being sequenced using the BIG DYE terminator mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Table IPrimers and adapters utilized in low stringency and conventional RT-PCRNameSequenceAnnealing temperature°CO-extension primerGGTACCGCAGTCTACGAGACCAGT55–60DisplayPROBEsEu4ATGAGTCCTGACCGAAAG55–60G14 5′UTRATTCCTGTTGCAGAAGTCTACCTGGACA54G14 3′UTRGAACATCTTCCACACGGTAGGGGT54G14 5′pGEXAGGATCCATGCAGAGCGAAAGTGGTCACGA59G14 3′pGEXCGGCGGCCGCTTAAATCTGGAAGCTGATAT59The sequences of adapters and primers used in low stringency or conventional RT-PCR are shown.

Open table in a new tab Construction and Screening of a MAL cDNA LibraryThe SMART cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH) was used as instructed by the manufacturer to prepare a cDNA library representing mRNA expressed in an eosinophil-rich leukocyte population as described previously (8.Dunphy J. Horvath A. Barcham G. Balic A. Bischof R. Meeusen E. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2001; 82: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LE392 cells were infected with the pTriplEx2 phage library, and the plaques screened with the originalgalectin-14 partial RT-PCR cDNA. The32P-labeled galectin-14 cDNA probes were generated from the RT-PCR clone using Klenow and the Giga-prime kit (Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia). The hybridization and wash conditions used were the same as for Northern blot analysis (see below). At least 1 × 106 plaque-forming units were used for each primary screen.Once individual plaques of interest were isolated in tertiary screens, the λTriplEx2 phage was converted into pTriplEx2 plasmid (as instructed in the SMART cDNA manual). The cDNA were then sequenced using the 5′-sequencing primer of pTriplEx2 (supplied by Invitrogen).Amplification of Galectin-14 cDNA, Containing the Full Putative Coding RegionTwo RT-PCR primers were designed within the putative 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) ofgalectin-14 (G145′UTR and G143′UTR, see Table I). ∼1.25 μg of MAL cell total RNA was used as a template for reverse transcriptase. 2–10 μl of the RT mix was used as a template for 30 PCR cycles. The PCR used 0.25 μm of each primer, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase in a total volume of 100 μl. The 30 PCR cycles utilized a denaturation step of 95 °C for 30 s, an annealing temperature of 54 °C for 1 min, and an extension temperature of 74 °C for 1 min. An additional denaturation of 5 min preceded the 30 cycles, and a prolonged extension of 10 min completed the PCR. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-Teasy and sequenced as above.Northern Blot HybridizationsApproximately 10 μg of total RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by capillary action. Membranes were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in Church buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2/1% BSA/7% SDS/2 mm EDTA). 32P-Labeledgalectin-14 cDNA probes were generated as described above. Probes were hybridized to the membranes in Church buffer overnight at 65 °C. The membranes were washed at high stringency in 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS at 37–42 °C.Production of Recombinant Galectin-14 in Escherichia coliTo produce recombinant galectin-14 the entire coding region of the mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into the E. coli GST expression vector pGEX-6P-2 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The RT-PCR primers used incorporated four nucleotide changes to alter codon usage to that preferred by E. coli (Table I (10.Kane J.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar)). The protease deficient E. coli strain BL-21 was used to express recombinant galectin-14 in the form of a GST fusion protein. Expression was induced by addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2–3 h at 34 °C. The fusion protein was then isolated using a glutathione-Sepharose column and cleaved with PreScission protease on the column as instructed by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The cleaved and purified galectin-14 recombinant protein contained an additional 5 amino acids at its NH2 terminus (remnants of the vectors cleavage and multiple cloning sites; GPLGS). The relative purity of the protein preparation was confirmed by Coomassie Blue-stained reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4), and the protein was NH2-terminally sequenced to confirm that it was in-frame and cleaved appropriately. The NH2-terminal sequencing confirmed the first 24 residues and indicated that the preparation was relatively pure. Uncleaved recombinant GST-galectin-14 fusion protein and recombinant GST alone were also produced as described above, except the preparations were eluted from the glutathione columns intact and were not treated with PreScission protease.Production of Galectin-14 Monoclonal AntibodiesBALB/c mice were given intraperitoneal injections of ∼5 μg of cleaved and purified recombinant galectin-14 once a month for 3 months, initially in complete Freund's adjuvant and subsequently in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Spleen cells from immune mice were fused with NS-1 myeloma cells using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and supernatants screened for galectin-14 binding by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positive hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution at least three times before being converted to DM10 media alone. Ascitic fluid was produced by giving pristine primed BALB/c mice an intraperitoneal injection of 1 × 107hybridoma cells. Four mAbs were generated that showed negative reaction with another recombinant ovine galectin (Ovgal11 (11.Dunphy J.L. Balic A. Barcham G.J. Horvath A.J. Nash A.D. Meeusen E.N.T. J. Biol.

Membranes were incubated with mAb supernatant for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), for at least 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected using 1.5 mm3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma Chemical Co.) or ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).ImmunocytochemistryFor cytospots, 1 × 105 cells were added to a cytocentrifuge chamber and centrifuged at ∼90 × g for 5 min. The slides were dried and fixed in 95% ethanol for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by submerging slides in 1.5% H2O2/PBS for 10 min. Slides were incubated with mAb for 1–2 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber, followed by the secondary antibody, for 1 h. Conjugate binding was detected by incubating slides with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for 10 min at room temperature. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and EosinY.Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and processed to paraffin. Sections were pre-blocked with normal sheep serum/PBS for 20 min prior to immunochemical staining as above.Flow CytometryCells were processed for surface expression of galectin-14 using standard procedures (3.Greenhalgh C.J.

Cells were resuspended in wash buffer (1% BSA/0.05% azide/PBS) and transferred in 50-μl aliquots to a 96-well V-bottomed plate. Following centrifugation, 100 μl of permeabilization buffer (wash buffer supplemented with 0.5% saponin; Sigma) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 10 min. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in 0.5% saponin at room temperature. Cells were incubated with 50 μl of the primary antibody for 20 min, washed twice with permeabilization buffer, resuspended in 10 μl of 10% normal sheep serum/0.1% saponin/PBS, and incubated for 10 min, followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Silenus) for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with permeabilization buffer, once with wash buffer and resuspended in PBS for analysis on a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson).Hemagglutination AssaysTrypsin-treated, glutaraldehyde fixed rabbit erythrocytes were prepared and tested in an agglutination assay according to the method of Nowak et al. (12.Nowak T.P. Haywood P.L. Barondes S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 68: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Agglutination assays were performed in 96-well V-shaped microtiter plates with serial 2-fold dilutions of samples in 25 μl of DES (0.15m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol), 50 μl of 0.5% (w/v) BSA in 0.15 m NaCl and 25 μl of a 4% suspension of rabbit erythrocytes. The plates were shaken vigorously for 30 s, and agglutination was read after the plates had stood at room temperature for 1 h. Agglutinated erythrocytes formed a “mat” on the bottom of the well. For assessment of the inhibitory effects of saccharides, lactose, galactose, and N-acetyl-glucosamine were serially diluted in 25 μl of 0.15 m NaCl prior to the addition of recombinant protein in DES, 25 μl of 1% (w/v) BSA in 0.15 m NaCl, and 4% erythrocytes in PBS. The minimum concentration of GST-galectin-14, which gave mat formation (0.28 μm) was used in the saccharide inhibition assay.DISCUSSIONA full-length cDNA encoding a novel galectin was isolated from ovine eosinophil-rich leukocyte populations by RT-PCR and cDNA library screening. Previously some galectins have been referred to as carbohydrate binding proteins, S-type lectins, S-Lac lectins, galaptins, or simply lectins (L) with a reported molecular weight; however, the current nomenclature is to name all members of this family of β-galactoside binding proteins “galectins,” numbered in sequential order as they are discovered (16.Kasai K. Hirabayashi J. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Hence we suggest this molecule be named galectin-14. The predicted protein sequence of galectin-14 demonstrates most similarity to galectin-9/ecalectin (17.Hirashima M. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2000; 122 (Suppl. 1): 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, galectin-14 is not likely to be the ovine homologue of galectin-9/ecalectin, because it demonstrates a different pattern of expression, and the highest overall amino acid identity it exhibits to any galectin-9/ecalectin isoform is only 58%. A comparison between galectin-14 and galectin-9 variants also reveals that there are 23 non-conservative substitutions of residues that are conserved in the galectin-9 sequences cloned from three different species (human, mouse, and rat (18.Türeci Ö.

Chem. 1997; 272: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)).Galectins are carbohydrate binding proteins and can be classified as proto, tandem-repeat, or chimera types. Unlike the galectin-9 variants, which are tandem-repeat-type galectins, galectin-14 is clearly a proto-type galectin containing only one CRD. In addition, galectin-14 has an extended NH2 terminus (12 residues longer than that of the galectin-9 variants). This extended NH2 terminus is unusual for galectins, currently the only other galectin reported to have an extended NH2 terminus is galectin-3 (Mac2, epsilon binding protein (22.Cherayil B.J. Weiner S.J. Pillai S. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1959-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). However, the NH2 terminus of galectin-14 is much shorter than that of galectin-3 and does not contain a proline and glycine-rich repetitive sequence, indicating that galectin-14 should not be classified as a chimera-type galectin.Galectin-14 is expected to exhibit a similar carbohydrate binding specificity to the most well characterized galectins. It contains six of the seven residues reported to be important for sugar recognition and binding by galectin-1 (14.Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15.Ahmed H. Fink N.E. Pohl J. Vasta G.R. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the amino acid substitution that does occur is a conservative change. Additionally, the arginine residues known to be important for sugar binding, hemagglutination, and eosinophil chemotactic activity of ecalectin/galectin-9 are also conserved in galectin-14 (Arg65 and Arg239 of ecalectin (23.Matsushita N. Nishi N. Seki M. Matsumoto R. Kuwabara I. Liu F.-T. Hata Y. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8355-8360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). The chemotactic activity of ecalectin/galectin-9 appears to require both CRDs (23.Matsushita N. Nishi N. Seki M. Matsumoto R. Kuwabara I. Liu F.-T. Hata Y. Nakamura T. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8355-8360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Hence, galectin-14, which only contains a single CRD, is not likely to exhibit chemotactic activity via a similar mechanism to ecalectin. However, recombinant galectin-14 does exhibit hemagglutination activity, and studies using GST-galectin-14 fusion protein demonstrate that this activity can be inhibited by sugars. This suggests that galectin-14 contains a functional CRD and that it may homodimerize. Recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation regulates the carbohydrate binding activity of galectin-3 (24.Yoshii T. Fukumori T. Honjo Y. Inohara H. Kim H.-R. C. Raz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 6852-6857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if the putative post-translational processing of galectin-14 also regulates carbohydrate binding specificity.Western blot analysis of both recombinant and endogenous galectin-14 indicate that the protein can self-aggregate, which would provide a mechanism through which galectin-14 could cross-link binding partners such as mucins (see below). It has previously been shown that galectins 1, 2, and 3 homodimerize, and galectin-3 can self-aggregate into larger complexes (25.Cho M. Cummings R.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13081-13088Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26.Yang R.-Y. Hill P.N. Hsu D.K. Liu F.-T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4086-4092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how galectins self-associate and what effect this has on their function has been difficult to ascertain. In the case of galectin-3 both the NH2 terminus and CRD may be involved in self-association, but the presence of ligand inhibits self-association through the CRD. The extended NH2 terminus of galectin-14 does not contain a repetitive sequence like that of galectin-3, residues known to be necessary for galectin-1 homodimerization, nor any obvious motifs that may be involved in self-association such as a coil-coil domain. The galectin-14 aggregates are also unlikely to occur due to disulfide bonds, because these aggregates appeared to be resistant to reducing agents.The distribution of galectin-14 mRNA and protein indicates that galectin-14 is specifically expressed by eosinophils and not other leukocytes, although expression on the rare basophil cannot at present be excluded. In contrast to the previously isolated ovine galectin-11, which was induced in epithelial tissue after allergic stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract (11.Dunphy J.L. Balic A. Barcham G.J. Horvath A.J. Nash A.D. Meeusen E.N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32106-32113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), expression of galectin-14 seems to be constitutive in all eosinophils examined (blood, tissue, MAL, and BAL). The only other galectin known to be expressed at high levels in eosinophils is galectin-10, also known as the Charcot-Leyden crystal (27.Ackerman S.J. Corrette S.E. Rosenberg H.F. Bennett J.C. Mastrianni D.M. Nicholson-Weller A. Weller P.F. Chin D.T. Tenen D.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 456-468PubMed Google Scholar). However, galectin-14 exhibits little identity to this galectin (25% amino acid identity) and is not likely to have similar functions.Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry indicate that galectin-14 is localized to the cytoplasm (and possibly nuclei) of eosinophils and is not found on the cell surface of any leukocytes. This differs from galectin-3, which is expressed at high levels on the surface of macrophages (28.Sano H. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Apgar J.R. Kuwabara I. Yamanaka T. Hirashima M. Liu F.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2156-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), or galectin-1, which is released from thymic epithelial cells and then binds to carbohydrate motifs on the surface of thymocytes (29.Baum L.G. Pang M. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Delegeane A. Uittenbogaart C.H. Fukuda M. Seilhamer J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).Like all other known galectins, galectin-14 lacks an obvious targeting peptide but appears to be externalized. Possibly, as postulated for galectins 1 and 3, galectin-14 may be released into the extracellular environment in vesicles after accumulating under the plasma membrane (30.Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 31.Mehul B. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once released at sites of inflammation, there are many carbohydrate motifs galectin-14 may interact with, including the highly glycosylated mucins, whose composition and expression is known to be altered in the lung lavage during allergic responses such as asthma (32.Dabbagh K. Takeyama K. Lee H.M. Ueki I.F. Lausier J.A. Nadel J.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6233-6237PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Longphre M. Li D. Gallup M. Drori E. Ordonez C.L. Redman T. Wenzel S. Bice D.E.

Galectin-14 binding partners may also include extracellular matrix components such as laminin, which are already known to be bound by other g"

We report evidence for two additional sialyltransferases, SiaA, and LsgB, that affect N-acetyllactosamine containing glycoforms. Mutations in genes we have designated siaA and lsgBaffected only the sialylated glycoforms containingN-acetylhexosamine. A mutation in siaA resulted in the loss of glycoforms terminating in sialyl-N-acetylhexosamine and the appearance of higher molecular weight glycoforms, containing the addition of phosphoethanolamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, andN-acetylneuraminic acid. Chromosomal complementation of thesiaA mutant resulted in the expression of the original sialylated LOS phenotype. A mutation in lic3A resulted in the loss of sialylation only in glycoforms lackingN-acetylhexosamine and had no effect on sialylation of the terminal N-acetyllactosamine epitope. A double mutant insiaA and lic3A resulted in the complete loss of sialylation of the terminal N-acetyllactosamine epitope and expression of the higher molecular weight sialylated glycoforms seen in thesiaA mutant. Mutation of lsgB resulted in persistence of sialylated glycoforms but a reduction inN-acetyllactosamine containing glycoforms. A triple mutant of siaA, lic3A, and lsgB contained no sialylated glycoforms. These results demonstrate that the sialylation of the LOS of H. influenzae is a complex process involving multiple sialyltransferases.

Haemophilus influenzae frequently colonizes the human nasopharynx. Up to 80% of the population harbor this organism as part of their normal flora (1.Turk D.C. Sell S.H. Wright P.F. Haemophilus influenzae: Epidemiology, Immunology, and Prevention of Disease. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1982: 3-9Google Scholar). Although normally an innocuous inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract, H. influenzae is an opportunistic pathogen. The diseases caused by the organism can be ordered in two groups based on the presence or absence of a capsule. Encapsulated or typeable organisms, which range from capsule types a–f, can cause systemic infections such as bacteremia, septicemia, and bacterial meningitis (1.Turk D.C. Sell S.H. Wright P.F. Haemophilus influenzae: Epidemiology, Immunology, and Prevention of Disease. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1982: 3-9Google Scholar, 2.Pittman M. J. Exp.

LOS is a complex glycolipid containing three main regions: lipid A, core, and a variable branched region (10.Preston A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The core region is a conserved structure containing a phosphorylated Kdo residue linked to three heptose residues, whereas the variable branched region contains a heterogeneous mix of hexoses and N-acetylhexosamines as well as other factors, such as phosphoethanolamine (PEA), phosphorylcholine, and NeuAc (11.Flesher A.R.

LOS differs from its enterobacterial counterpart, lipopolysaccharide, in that the variable branched region or O-antigen is a nonrepeating unit (10.Preston A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A great deal of work has been undertaken to understand the biosynthesis and role of LOS in pathogenesis (10.Preston A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). H. influenzae LOS is very heterogeneous and contains a number of phase-varying epitopes (17.Inzana T.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1983; 148: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18.Patrick C.C. Kimura A. Jackson M.A. Hermanstorfer L. Hood A. McCracken Jr., G.H. Hansen E.J. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 2902-2911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phase variation is known at least in part to occur through a process of slipped-strand mispairing (19.Weiser J.N. Love J.M. Moxon E.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 657-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Three well characterized loci involved in LOS expression and phase variation, designated lic1, lic2, andlic3, phase-vary through this mechanism (20.Maskell D.J. Szabo M.J. Butler P.D. Williams A.E.

Phase variation may play a role for the bacterium in the evasion of the host immune response. LOS structures have also been found to mimic human blood group antigens, such as the Pk antigen and paragloboside (23.Mandrell R.E. McLaughlin R. Aba Kwaik Y. Lesse A. Yamasaki R. Gibson B. Spinola S.M. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may be another method for bacterial immune evasion. The lsg (lipooligosaccharidesynthesis genes) locus is another region involved in LOS biosynthesis (24.Spinola S.M. Kwaik Y.A. Lesse A.J. Campagnari A.A. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seven genes are in the locus, six of which have identity to various glycosyltransferases and one that acts as a regulator (25.Phillips N.J.

This locus is not controlled by the slipped strand mispairing mechanism. Through studies expressing chimericHaemophilus structures in Escherichia colilipopolysaccharide, we know that this locus is involved in the expression of a terminal N-acetyllactosamine structure (25.Phillips N.J.

One of the genes in this locus, lsgB, has homology (27% identity, 46% similarity) to the sialyltransferase in Neisseria meningitidis.

This gene, which we callsiaA, was studied for its possible role in LOS sialylation. We report evidence that siaA is a sialyltransferase inH. influenzae and that lsgB is required for the biosynthesis of a third, distinct sialylated glycoform, and our evidence strongly suggests that LsgB is the third sialyltransferase.

Restriction enzymes were purchased from either New England Biolabs or Promega. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed with either Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or the Expand Long Template kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All plasmid constructs were maintained in either E. coli DH5α or DH10B (Invitrogen). Gel purification was performed with SeaPlaque GTG-agarose (BioWittaker Molecular Applications) using standard protocols. DNA was digested to completion with the appropriate restriction enzymes, fractionated in 0.7% agarose gels, and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Southern blots were hybridized with probes generated by the random primed digoxygenin DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All blots were processed by following the digoxygenin protocols. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with Kodak XAR-5 or BMR-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). DNA was sequenced with an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer using fluorescent terminator dye tags at the DNA Sequencing Facility (University of Iowa). Analysis of the sequence was performed using various programs of the Wisconsin GCG package and the Jellyfish software package developed by Biowire.com (available on the World Wide Web at www.biowire.com). Similarity searches against DNA and protein sequence data bases were performed with the FASTA, BLAST, or BLASTX algorithms. Using the DNA sequence from the H. ducreyi lst gene (33.Bozue J.A. Tullius M.V. Wang J. Gibson B.W. Munson Jr., R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4106-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), an open reading frame (ORF) in the H. influenzae Rd data base named HI0871 was identified, which contained 48% identity and 59% similarity over the length of the predicted protein sequence. HI0871 was renamed siaA. Primers were made to amplifysiaA and some flanking DNA from strain 2019 based on the Rd sequence from the TIGR data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.tigr.org/). A 4.3-kb product was amplified using the Expand Long Template PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and primers HSTR8 (5′-CTG CAA AAT ACA GAT AAA GCA ACA CTG GGG-3′) and HSTR9 (5′-CAG CGG CAA GAA ATA TAG GGT TAG AAA AAG C-3′), which was then TA-cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), forming pHS89-21. This insert was sequenced (accession number AY061634). The 4.3-kb DNA fragment was then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript KS II−(Stratagene), forming pHS89-103. The insertional mutant ofsiaA was constructed by cloning a PstI-digested kanamycin antibiotic resistance gene from pBSL86 into a uniqueNsiI site in the middle of siaA, forming pHS89-103K6. The orientation of the kanamycin gene was discerned with a restriction digest and was found to be transcribed in the same direction as siaA (data not shown). pHS89-103K6 was linearized with ScaI and transformed into strains A2 and 276.4 (34.Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were obtained and analyzed using both PCR with internal siaA primers HSTR1 (5′-GAT GTT ATT TTT ATT TTT GTT A-3′) and HSTR2 (5′-ACT TAG GGT GTA TTT TGG TTC C-3′) and Southern blots (data not shown). Primers SiaBU2 (5′-CGG ACT ATC ATA ACG GGC-3′) and SiaBD2 (5′-CTC AGA ATT CGG GCT TCG-3′) were designed based on the H. influenzae Rd genome. A 1.5-kb DNA fragment was amplified from NTHi 2019 and TA-cloned into pCR2.1, and both DNA strands were sequenced. This new plasmid, called pSiaB2, contained a 675-base pair ORF with 95% identity to HI1279 from H. influenzae Rd. This plasmid was digested with SspI, which cuts at a unique site after nucleotide 276. A spectinomycin resistance cassette gene was digested with SmaI from pABR3 and ligated into the SspI site of pSiaB2, forming pSiaB2Spec. This new construct was digested with NotI to linearize the DNA and then transformed into strain A2 using the MIV method (34.Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were obtained and tested using PCR and Southern hybridization to confirm the proper insertion of the spectinomycin cassette in siaB (data not shown). A 3456-bp BamHI-BsbI fragment of H. influenzae A2 DNA containing lsgA,-B, -C, and -D was cloned into pGEM3zf+. A 502-bp (BsrGI-XcmI)region of lsgB was deleted and replaced by an erythromycin cassette. This new plasmid was called pGEMLOS2ABCDerm. This plasmid was digested with NdeI and transformed into strains A2 and A2STFL3A using the MIV method (34.Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were obtained and tested using PCR and Southern hybridization to confirm the proper insertion of the erythromycin cassette in lsgB (data not shown). The mutants were designated strains A2lsgB and A2STFL3AlsgB. Primers iraF (5′-AGG GGG ATA AAA CAA AGG-3′) and iraR (5′-GGC AAG TCC CTG TTC AAA-3′) for PCR were designed from the published H. influenzae Rd genome. These primers were used to amplify an intergenic region between bases 794506 and 796038. Amplification resulted in a PCR product of ∼1.6 kb from the genome of NTHi strain 2019. The product was then cloned into the vector pTAV1 via TA cloning. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was elucidated and compared with sequences included in the genome data base. The resolved consensus sequence was entered into MacVector to identify useful restriction sites. One SphI site was predicted that would cut the cloned region into 711- and 822-base fragments and could be used to linearize pIRA. The presence of the unique SphI site was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion of pIRA. The plasmid pCMR containing a chloramphenicol resistance cassette possessing the consensus uptake sequence for Haemophilus transformation was kindly provided by Dr. Terrence Stull (35.Whitby P.W. Morton D.J. Stull T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 158: 57-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the necessary SphI sites, the chloramphenicol resistance cassette was excised from pCMR using PstI, gel-purified, and then ligated into the vector pBSL15 that had been previously cut with PstI. The resulting plasmid was named pHiCM1. Finally, the chloramphenicol resistance cassette was excised from pHiCM1 by cleavage with SphI, gel-purified, and ligated into the SphI site of pIRA, forming pIRACM. Insertion was confirmed by PCR and by sequencing the cloning junctions. A 2.5-kb EcoRV DNA fragment was excised from pHS89-103, gel-purified, and blunt end-ligated into the SfoI site of pIRACM, forming pSAIRCM. This construct was used as a template for PCR using primers iraR and iraF, and the resulting PCR product was transformed into A2STF using the MIV method (34.Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for with both kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Verification that both the full-length and the mutant forms of siaA were present on the chromosome was performed with PCR using primers HSTR1 and HSTR2 and with Southern blots (data not shown). A control strain was constructed in a similar fashion by transforming A2STF with pIRA. The insertion into the chromosome was confirmed with Southern blots, and the resultant strain was named A2STFIRA (data not shown). Primers 0352ELTU1 (5′-ATG TCC AAA AGC AGC CAA CCA AAT AAA CCC-3′) and 0352ELTL1 (5′-CAA CGC CGA AAT CAA CCC AAA TAG AAA GCC-3′) were designed using the H. influenzae Rd genome data base and a 4.6-kb DNA fragment containing the HI0352 ORF (lic3A) was amplified from strain A2 using PCR. The DNA fragment was TA-cloned into pCR2.1 and was named p0352EX. Both DNA strands were sequenced, and a unique SwaI site was found after nucleotide 683 of the 981-nucleotide lic3A sequence. A nonpolar chloramphenicol cassette (pRSM1775), which was constructed in a manner similar to that described by Menard et al. (36.Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) using the chloramphenicol gene (cat) from pACYC184, 2J. A. Bozue and R. S. Munson, Jr., unpublished data. was digested withSmaI and cloned into the SwaI site oflic3A. This construct was named p0352EXCM. The nonpolar cassette contains translation stop codons in all three reading frames upstream from the start codon of cat. Five bases after thecat stop codon, there is a Shine-Dalgarno sequence followed by a start codon, which is in-frame with the remainder of thelic3A gene. The insertion sites of the chloramphenicol cassette were sequenced to ensure proper insertion and orientation. p0352EXCM was linearized by digestion with BamHI and transformed using the MIV method (34.Herriott R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into strains A2 and A2STF, forming strains A2L3A and A2STFL3A respectively. Proper insertion into the chromosome of these strains was confirmed with PCR amplification using primers to the lic3A sequence and Southern hybridization (data not shown). The LOS was prepared by a modification of the Hitchcock and Brown method (37.Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Organisms were grown on solid media supplemented with 20 μg/ml of NeuAc. The organisms from a single plate were suspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer to a finalA 65"
https://openalex.org/W2054154819,"Glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) catalyzes the first committed step in the pathway for biosynthesis of hexosamines in mammals. A member of the N-terminal nucleophile class of amidotransferases, GFAT transfers the amino group from the l-glutamine amide tod-fructose 6-phosphate, producing glutamic acid and glucosamine 6-phosphate. The kinetic constants reported previously for mammalian GFAT implicate a relatively low affinity for the acceptor substrate, fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P, <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> 0.2–1 mm). Utilizing a new sensitive assay that measures the production of glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P), purified recombinant human GFAT1 (hGFAT1) exhibited a <i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> for Fru-6-P of 7 μm, and was highly sensitive to product inhibition by GlcN-6-P. In a second assay method that measures the stimulation of glutaminase activity, a <i>K</i> <sub>d</sub> of 2 μm was measured for Fru-6-P binding to hGFAT1. Further, we report that the product, GlcN-6-P, is a potent competitive inhibitor for the Fru-6-P site, with a <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> measured of 6 μm. Unlike other members of the amidotransferase family, where glutamate production is loosely coupled to amide transfer, we have demonstrated that hGFAT1 production of glutamate and GlcN-6-P are strictly coupled in the absence of inhibitors. Similar to other amidotransferases, competitive inhibitors that bind at the synthase site may inhibit the synthase activity without inhibiting the glutaminase activity at the hydrolase domain. GlcN-6-P, for example, inhibited the transfer reaction while fully activating the glutaminase activity at the hydrolase domain. Inhibition of hGFAT1 by the end product of the pathway, UDP-GlcNAc, was competitive with a<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> of 4 μm. These data suggest that hGFAT1 is fully active at physiological levels of Fru-6-P and may be regulated by its product GlcN-6-P in addition to the pathway end product, UDP-GlcNAc."
https://openalex.org/W2087993487,"We employed cDNA microarrays to identify the differentially expressed genes in a cisplatin-sensitive parental (2008) human ovarian carcinoma cell line and its cisplatin-resistant variant (2008/C13*). Differential expression of five genes was found in the 2008/C13* cells, a result confirmed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The five genes were identified as fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin and skeletal muscle-type tropomyosin, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein J and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant-A. Treatment of the 2008 cells with cisplatin (at its IC50 concentration of 2 μm) induced expression of these genes, as determined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis using gene-specific primers. In contrast, treatment of the drug-resistant 2008/C13* cells with cisplatin (at its IC50 concentration of 20 μm) did not lead to the induction of any of the aforementioned genes. Most importantly, constitutive overexpression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (but not the other genes) in the 2008 cells led to induction of cisplatin resistance, clearly indicating its role in the development of the resistance phenotype in the 2008/C13* cells. The development of cisplatin resistance in the transfected cells was associated with an increase in the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase enzyme activity. Although at present it is not clear how dihydrodiol dehydrogenase is involved in cisplatin resistance, the identification of this gene as a causal factor suggests the existence of a hitherto undefined pathway resulting in cisplatin resistance.

Cisplatin 1The abbreviations used are: cisplatincis-diamminedichloroplatinumGSHreduced glutathioneRTreverse transcription is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs. It is effective in the treatment of ovarian, testicular, bladder, head and neck, and small cell lung cancers (1.Loehrer P.J. Einhorn L.H. Ann. Intern. Med. 1984; 100: 704-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The basis of its therapeutic effect is generally considered to be the covalent binding of it to nucleophilic sites on cellular macromolecules, including DNA. Cisplatin reacts at the N7-position of guanosine and forms intrastrand and interstrand cross-links (2.Pinto A. Lippard S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 780: 167-180PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, its efficacy is restricted due to the existence of intrinsic tumor cell resistance or by the acquisition of tumor cell resistance subsequent to drug treatment (3.Timmer-Bosscha H. Mulder N.H. de Vries E.G.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). An improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which cisplatin resistance develops is necessary for this drug to be used most effectively. cis-diamminedichloroplatinum reduced glutathione reverse transcription A large body of data from experimental and clinical studies suggests that the mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance are multifactorial. They include decreased drug accumulation (4.Andrews P.A. Velury S. Mann S.C. Howell S.B. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 68-73PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Loh S.Y. Mistry P. Kelland L.R. Abel G. Harrap K.R. Br. J.

In addition, alterations in oncogene expression and signal transduction pathways have also been proposed to be associated with cisplatin resistance (12.Dempke W. Volgt W. Grothey A. Hill B.T. Schmoll H.J. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2000; 11: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the altered expression of several other genes has been observed, but how these lead to cisplatin resistance is still poorly defined. Most of these genes were found to confer cisplatin resistance after they were artificially overexpressed in cells using gene transfection. They include c-fos, Ha-ras, c-myc, Her-2/neu, and Bcl-2, Bcl-XL (13.Chatterjee D. Liu C.J. Northey D. Teicher B.A. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1995; 35: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Math C. Widschwendter M. Kaern J. Jurgensen N.P. Windbichler G. Zeimet A.G. Trop C. Daxenbichler G. Br. J.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, their disparate biochemical functions have made it difficult to define whether these genes play a primary or secondary role in the development of cisplatin resistance. To identify the multiple changes occurring during the development of cisplatin resistance, a sensitive method was required that would measure genome-wide alterations in gene expression in a single well defined step. Indeed, utility of techniques such as suppressive subtraction hybridization in a cisplatin-resistant head and neck cell line (16.Johnsson A. Zeelenberg I. Min Y. Hilinski J. Berry C. Howell S.B. Los G. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and genome wide screening in yeast (17.Burger H. Capello A. Achenk P.W. Stoter G. Brouwer J. Nooter K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have resulted recently in the identification of changes in the expression of such unlikely drug resistance candidate genes as cytochrome oxidase I, ribosomal protein 28 S, elongation factor 1α, α-enolase, hsp70, PDE2, and ZDS2. However, the differential expression of these genes was not confirmed by quantitative PCR and/or Northern blot in either study. In addition, the effect of drug exposure on the expression of these “genes associated with cisplatin-resistance” was not investigated, and transfectants were not tested for drug resistance. In the present study, we employed the cDNA microarray from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (2400 genes) to reveal the differentially expressed genes in cisplatin-resistant cells as compared with the sensitive, parental cells. The recent development of DNA microarray technology has enabled the measurement of temporal gene expression levels. We used the parental human ovary carcinoma cell line 2008 and its cisplatin-resistant variant 2008/C13* cell line in our study. The 2008/C13* cells have been generated by in vitro selection of parental human ovarian carcinoma cells (2008) in the presence of increasing concentrations of cisplatin (18.Andrews P.A. Albright K.D. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1895-1901PubMed Google Scholar). The 2008/C13* cells exhibit between a 9- and 12-fold resistance to cisplatin (Ref. 19.Zinkewich-Peotti K. Andrews P.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1902-1906PubMed Google Scholar and this article), and their resistant phenotype is stable (i.e.it does not require the continuous presence of cisplatin to maintain the resistance phenotype). We have identified five genes that were highly overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant 2008/C13* cells compared with cisplatin-sensitive 2008 cells by the cDNA microarray technique. They include two isoforms of tropomyosin, fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin and skeletal tropomyosin, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein J, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant A. Their differential expression (in the 2008/C13* cells) was further confirmed with semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and the effect of transfecting these genes into the parental cell line was investigated. Cisplatin, camphorquinone, and (S)-(+)-1-indanol were purchased from Aldrich. 1-Acetonaphthenol, dicumarol, NADP+, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma. Cell culture reagents and gentamycin were obtained from Cellgro (Herndon, Virginia). RNAzol B was purchased from Tel-test Inc (Friendswood, TX). MessageClean kit was obtained from Gene Hunter Corp. (Nashville, TN). The human cDNA microarray system (spotted with 2400 genes) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Taq DNA polymerase, Omniscript reverse transcriptase, and RNeasy columns were all obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The human ovarian carcinoma cells A2780 and SKOV-3 as well as the cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant 2008 and 2008/C13*, respectively, were grown in RPMI (Rosewell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamycin at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. These cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. To analyze the effect of drug treatment on the expression of the five candidate drug-resistant genes, cells in log-phase growth were plated at 80% confluence in a 100-mm tissue culture dish and incubated overnight. Next day, the cells were treated with varying concentrations of cisplatin for various time periods before RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAzol B reagent followed by chloroform extraction, isopropanol precipitation, and a 75% (v/v) ethanol wash. For the cDNA microarray application, the total RNA was treated with DNase I (MessageClean kit, Gene Hunter), then further purified using an RNA binding silica membrane spin column purification step (RNeasy column, Qiagen) by following the manufacture's instructions. The integrity of the total RNA was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, total RNA (1 μg) from untreated and drug-treated cells was first subjected to reverse transcription followed by PCR as described below. DNA-free total RNA (2 μg) from the 2008 and the 2008/C13* cells was used in the cDNA microarray analysis. The generation of labeled probes, hybridization, and signal detection was performed exactly as described by the supplier of the human cDNA microarray system I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, total RNA extracted in parallel from the parental (2008) and the cisplatin-resistant cells (2008/C13*) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA (complementary DNA) labeled with either biotin or dinitrophenyl using avian myeloblastosis virus RT. To assess the efficiency of the reverse transcription reaction, the incorporation of the biotin and dinitrophenyl into cDNA was compared with previously labeled, control cDNAs of known concentration, as described in detail in the protocol provided by the manufacturer of the kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After assessing the efficiency of the reverse transcription, equal proportions of the labeled cDNA were mixed and hybridized to the microarray overnight at 65 °C. Biotin and dinitrophenyl cDNAs hybridized to the array were sequentially detected using a cyanine 3-tyramide and cyanine 5-tyramide fluorescent reporter molecules. The tyramide signal amplification detection is a highly sensitive system that allows utilization of as little as 2–4 μg of total RNA and permits detection of as few as 1.2 copies (of messenger RNA) per cell of a gene. Slide scanning, normalization, and ratio determination were performed by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. RNA isolated from cisplatin-sensitive (2008) and -resistant cells (2008/C13*) were used for cDNA synthesis. Each reverse transcription reaction consisted of 1 μg of RNA, 4 units of Omniscript RT, 1 μm oligo-dT primer, 0.5 mm dNTP, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, and 1× RT buffer. Reverse transcription was performed at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, cDNA equivalent to 40 ng and 100 ng of starting RNA from each cell line was amplified by PCR using gene-specific primer pairs. Each PCR reaction consisted of 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase, and 0.2 mm gene-specific forward and reverse primers. All the components of the RT and the PCR reaction were purchased from Qiagen. The primers used were designed by the Primer Express, version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems, CA), and are shown in Table I. The PCR conditions were as follows; an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for the number of cycles optimized for each primer (Table I) to ensure that the product intensity fell within the linear phase of amplification, and then a final elongation step was performed for 10 min at 72 °C. RT-PCR amplification of glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase transcript was used as the internal control to verify that equal amounts of RNA were used from each cell line. The PCR products were separated on a 2.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis in 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer. An HaeIII digest of φ-X174 DNA was used as a standard marker.Table IDNA sequence of the forward and reverse primers, annealing temperature used, and number of cycles performed for the RT-PCR-mediated confirmation of the differential expression of the cisplatin-resistance associated genes identified by cDNA microarrayGene identityPrimersAnnealing temperatureNo. of cyclesFibroblast muscle-type tropomyosinForward: 5′-ggaagctggtgatcctggaa-3′ Reverse: 5′-cagacctctcggcaaactctg-3′55 °C35Skeletal β-tropomyosinForward: 5′-tggacaacgcactcaatgaca-3′ Reverse: 5′-tgaagccagtgccagagtgg-3′55 °C35Apolipoprotein JForward: 5′-gttccaccaacaacccctcc-3′ Reverse: 5′-tcttcgccttgcgtgaggt-3′55 °C28Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase var.

Thus, primer pairs from the mRNA sequence of each of the candidate genes (using the full-length sequence data from the sequence deposited in the GenBank™ data base; see Table II) were designed to enable us to generate a full-length cDNA. These were then cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector (pCR3.1, Invitrogen). Orientation of the full-length cDNA as well as its sequence were determined by restriction enzyme digestion and automated DNA sequencing, respectively. The expression vector with the insert in the right orientation were then transfected (20.Parekh H.K. Simpkins H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5203-5206PubMed Google Scholar) into sub-confluent parental human ovarian carcinoma cells (2008, A2780, or SKOV-3) using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were propagated in a medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418 sulfate) for 3 weeks. Individual G418-resistant colonies were picked (20 colonies for each transfection experiment), grown, and screened for the expression of the recombinant message using the RT-PCR procedure described above. The clones that expressed a high level of the recombinant message were then subjected to growth inhibition assays in the presence of different concentrations of cisplatin. The cytotoxic effects of cisplatin were assessed using a tetrazolium dye as described previously (20.Parekh H.K. Simpkins H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5203-5206PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIGenes that demonstrated elevated expression levels in the cisplatin-resistant 2008/C13* cells in two independent microarray hybridization experimentsGenBank™ accession numberGene descriptionFold increase in the 2008/C13* cellsExp 1Exp 2M12125Fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin5.215.2X06825mRNA for skeletal β-tropomyosin6.613.4U05598Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase50.530.6M86609Dihydrodiol dehydrogenase50.051.6J02908Apolipoprotein J10.56.1M21248Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant A9.15.0D50372mRNA for myosin regulatory light chain6.37.6L10678Profilin II5.413.0AJ001531mRNA for neurotrypsin6.65.0 Open table in a new tab RNA (0.1–2 μg) isolated from the cisplatin-sensitive (2008) and -resistant (2008/C13*) cells were spotted onto Nylon membrane. After air-drying the membrane, it was placed in a UV-cross-linker (Stratagene) set at optimal cross-link. Prehybridization was carried out for 4 h as described previously (20.Parekh H.K. Simpkins H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5203-5206PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed with radiolabeled full-length dihydrodiol dehydrogenase cDNA overnight. This was followed by 1× low stringency wash and 2× high stringency washes at 55 °C as described previously (20.Parekh H.K. Simpkins H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5203-5206PubMed Google Scholar). The nylon membrane was than exposed to Eastman Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C for 36 h and then developed on the X-Omat. Thereafter, the blot was stripped and hybridized with radiolabeled ubiquitin cDNA to ensure equal RNA concentrations. After high stringency washes at 65 °C (2×), the blot was exposed as before for 24 h and developed on the X-Omat. The dihydrodiol dehydrogenase enzyme activity was measured in the cytosol fraction of the 2008, 2008/C13*, and the dihydrodiol dehydrogenase-transfected 2008 cells as described previously (21.Ciaccio P.J. Stuart J.E. Tew K.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 845-853PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of formation (and in some case, the rate of disappearance) of NADPH at 340 nm (extinction coefficient, 6500 m−1 cm−1) was assessed. For isolation of the cytosolic fraction, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cell/dish and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then washed (3×) with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA (Buffer A). After a brief centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in Buffer A containing a protease inhibitor mixture and homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer with a tight-fitting pestle. The lysed homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant fraction thus obtained was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to separate the cytosol fraction (supernatant) from the microsomal fraction (pellet). Aliquots of the cytosolic fraction were immediately stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration of the cytosol fraction was determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding assay using commercially available Bio-Rad protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard. The cytosolic fractions were then assayed for dihydrodiol dehydrogenase activity essentially as described previously (21.Ciaccio P.J. Stuart J.E. Tew K.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 845-853PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture consisted of 4 mm NADP+ (or 0.16 mmNADPH), 100 mm potassium phosphate, indicated concentrations of the substrates, and the cytosolic fraction. The reaction was started by addition of substrate, and the disappearance of NADPH at 25 °C was monitored with the aid of a Beckman DU-70 recording spectrophotometer. An assay mixture containing all of the components except the substrate served as the blank. Initial rates of NADPH disappearance were determined in duplicate. Polyclonal antibody that was reactive to the four subtypes of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase was used. For immunocytochemistry, freshly trypsinized cells (∼1,000 cells) were spotted onto a sterilized coverslip in a 6-well plate. After incubating at 37 °C for 4 h, most of the cells adhered to the coverslip, and an additional 1 ml of medium was added to fully cover the cells. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested by a brief wash with warm phosphate-buffered saline twice, air-dried, and then fixed with cold acetone/methanol. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously by the immunoperoxidase method (22.Hsu N.Y. Ho H.C. Chow K.C. Lin T.Y. Shih C.S. Wang L.S. Tsai C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2727-2731PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 0.2% sodium azide in 3% H2O2. The slides were incubated with the antibodies to dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and then with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako, Carpenteria, CA). The chromogenic reaction was visualized by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and aminoethylcarbazole (Sigma), and the crimson precipitate was identified as positive staining. The samples were counterstained with hematoxylin, and the slides were mounted with glycerol gelatin. Each batch had a positive and a negative control to ensure the staining quality. The parental human ovarian carcinoma cell line 2008 and its cisplatin-resistant variant 2008/C13* were used in cDNA microarray experiments as the source of the two different gene pools. Furthermore, to ascertain the reproducibility of the technique, the microarray assay was repeated employing DNA-free total RNA prepared from two different cultures of each cell line at two different time points. To avoid possible differences caused by different labeling patterns, the labeling pattern was inverted when the experiment was repeated. Only those genes whose fluorescence ratio was at least 5-fold over background levels (in both cell lines) were considered in the final selection of differentially expression. Furthermore, a gene was considered as being differentially expressed only if its comparative signal (i.e. cyanine 3 to cyanine 5 ratio) demonstrated a greater than 5-fold increase/decrease. In addition to these quality control features, an experiment was considered valid only if the control genes spotted on the microarray (three plant genus-specific genes) and ∼100 housekeeping genes) gave a composite cyanine-3 to cyanine-5 ratio of 1, i.e. the expression levels of these genes (as indicated by the fluorescence intensity) had to be similar in both cell lines, thus indicating that the amount of input total RNA from the two cell lines used for the differential expression analysis was similar. Thus, in the first experiment, we found 32 genes (increased at least 5-fold) when cDNA from 2008 cells was compared with that from the 2008/C13* cells. After the second experiment, a total of nine genes were identified that were differentially expressed in both experiments (Table II). These genes were all expressed at higher levels in the cisplatin-resistant cell line 2008/C13* as compared with their expression in the cisplatin-sensitive 2008 cells. Four of these nine genes belong to the family of proteins involved in maintaining the cytoskeletal architecture of a cell, viz. two isoforms of tropomyosin (fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin and skeletal β-tropomyosin), profilin II, and the myosin regulatory light chain. The drug detoxifying enzyme dihydrodiol dehydrogenase spotted at two different locations/slide was also consistently identified as being overexpressed (>30-fold) in the 2008/C13* cells. In addition, up-regulation of apolipoprotein J (>6-fold), an inhibitor of programmed cell death, was also observed in the 2008/C13* cells. A > 5-fold up-regulation of a variant form of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (variant A) and neurotrypsin, a serine protease, was also demonstrated by the cDNA microarray analysis. To confirm the differential expression of the nine genes (Table II), semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis was employed. Total cellular RNA from the 2008 and the 2008/C13* cell lines was used for the RT-PCR analysis. Nine gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the corresponding cDNA fragment of ∼200 base pair. The PCR cycle numbers were optimized for each primer to ensure that the comparison of the level of expression of each gene was within the linear phase of amplification. Furthermore, to ensure that an equal amount of RNA was used for each RT-PCR reaction, primers for glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were employed as an internal control. The observed PCR product intensity for each of the experimental primer pairs was normalized against the PCR product intensity observed with the glyceraldehyde 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The abundance of the PCR product was semi-quantified by densitometric scanning of the ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, and the cDNA fragment corresponding to each amplified gene was compared between the 2008 and 2008/C13* cells. Six of the nine genes were confirmed to be highly overexpressed (3–50-fold) in the 2008/C13* cells as compared with the 2008 cells (Fig. 1). These six genes code for five different proteins. They are two isoforms of tropomyosin, fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin and skeletal β-tropomyosin, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein J, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant A. The mRNA expression of the two isoforms of tropomyosin was negligible in the 2008 cells but significantly up-regulated in the 2008/C13* cells. The other four genes were expressed at basal levels in the 2008 cells, and their expression was found to be up-regulated in 2008/C13* cells. In contrast, the expression of the neurotrypsin gene, profilin II gene, and the myosin regulatory light chain gene was found to be similar in the 2008 and the 2008/C13* cells. The reasons for the discrepancies between the differences in gene expression observed by cDNA microarray analysis and the similar levels of expression observed with semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis (for neurotrypsin, profilin II and myosin regulatory light chain) is not known at present. However, it clearly demonstrates the importance of confirming differential expression observed in a cDNA microarray analysis with RT-PCR or Northern blotting techniques. In addition to the semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique, we also assessed the expression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in the 2008 and the 2008/C13* cells by dot-blot analysis using a full-length dihydrodiol dehydrogenase cDNA as probe. RNA concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 μg from both the cell lines were used in this study. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the expression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase mRNA was at least 5-fold higher in the 2008/C13* cells compared with the 2008 cells. An ubiquitin probe was used as a control (Fig. 2 B) to assess equal loading of RNA between the two cell lines. When combined, the microarray and RT-PCR techniques demonstrated that six genes were overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant 2008/C13* cells. It was of interest to know whether this overexpression was directly associated with drug treatment and whether such treatment would alter their expression in parental cells treated with cisplatin. Thus, 2008 cells were treated with 2, 5, 10, and 25 μmcisplatin for 6 and 24 h, and the expression of each of the six candidate genes was assessed by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis using gene-specific primers. The expression of the fibroblast muscle-type tropomyosin and skeletal β-tropomyosin was strongly induced by cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3). The expression of these two genes was increased after 6 h of cisplatin treatment and was observed to be cisplatin dose-dependent, i.e. the level of induction (10–50-fold) was directly correlated with the dose of cisplatin. In contrast, the level of expression of the other genes was found to be elevated only after 24 h of cisplatin treatment (dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, 3–5-fold; apolipoprotein J, 2–10-fold; and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2–5-fold). No significant change in the expressions of these genes was observed 6 h after exposure to cisplatin. In contrast to the effects of cisplatin treatment observed in the 2008 cells, treatment of 2008/C13* cells did not result in significant changes in the mRNA levels of any of the afo"

To investigate the pathophysiological role of LRP in the central nervous system, we examined the effects of activated α2-macroglobulin (α2M*), a ligand of LRP, on intracellular calcium signaling in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Neuronal effects of α2M* (50 nm) were assessed by a comparison of calcium signals produced in control and α2M*-pretreated neurons byN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid. α2M* pretreatment significantly decreased the calcium signals to NMDA, whereas little change was observed for the signals to α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid. Native α2M, which is not a ligand for LRP, did not affect signals to NMDA. The receptor-associated protein prevented α2M*-induced decrease of calcium responses to NMDA, suggesting that α2M* exerted its effects through an LRP-mediated pathway. Experiments changing calcium sources demonstrated that α2M* pretreatment altered calcium responses to NMDA by primarily changing extracellular calcium influx and subsequently affecting calcium release from intracellular calcium stores. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that α2M* caused a reduction in the levels of the NMDA receptor subunit, NMDAR1. These results suggest that α2M* can alter the neuronal response to excitatory neurotransmitters and that α2M* pretreatment selectively reduced the calcium responses to NMDA by down-regulating the NMDA receptor.

Although α2M* can be a neurotrophic factor, little is known about the neuronal function of α2M* on intracellular calcium signaling. To assess α2M* potential in the CNS, we examined the chronic and acute effects of α2M* exposure on an important neuronal function in hippocampus of the brain: calcium signaling in response to stimulation of glutamate receptors. Calcium plays an important role in both physiological and pathological processes. Physiologically, calcium is an important intracellular second messenger and controls a variety of neuronal functions. However, excessive intracellular calcium is associated with neurotoxicity (18.Choi D.W. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar, 19.Gibbons S.J. Brorson J.R.

Here, the effects of α2M* were examined in cultured hippocampal neurons, which were grown in relative isolation from other cell types. The hippocampal neurons expressN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate subtypes of glutamate receptors. Glutamate is the main excitatory transmitter in the CNS and is known to play an important role in neuronal degeneration (18.Choi D.W. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar, 22.Mattson M.P. Rydel R.E. Lieberburg I. Smith-Swintosky V.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Calcium signaling elicited by activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors were assessed using selective agonists. α2M* pretreatment substantially decreased the calcium signals produced by NMDA stimulation but not by AMPA stimulation or K+ depolarization. The decline of calcium signals was due primarily to a reduction in the influx of extracellular calcium. The effects of α2M* were mediated by LRP and were associated with reduced levels of NMDAR1. These results suggest that the elevated levels of α2M*, for example around plaques in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, could significantly influence NMDA receptor-mediated processes and neuronal function in the CNS. Hippocampal neurons from 19-day-old embryonic Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated by a standard enzyme treatment protocol (24.Qiu Z. Parsons K.L. Gruol D.L. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6688-6699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi were dissociated in calcium-free saline and plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated tissue culture dishes at the density of 1.5 × 106 cell/ml. The neurons were grown in minimum Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 30 mm glucose and 25 μm penicillin-streptomycin. Medium with 10% horse serum was replaced every 3 days. Treatment with 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (20 μg/ml) on the third day after plating minimized non-neuronal cell proliferation. The cultures survive for about 20 days in a standard CO2 incubator. 50 nm α2M* was added to primary neuronal cultures 6 or 8 days after plating, in which half the culture media was replaced with medium containing 2% horse serum during α2M* pretreatment. Control cultures (sister cultures) were not pretreated with α2M* or other LRP ligands. The neurons were observed throughout the first 10 days in culture. The α2M*-containing medium was replaced by physiological saline before calcium measurements were made. The composition of the physiological saline was 140 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 0.33 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.3. Similar pretreatment protocol was applied to compounds native α2M (50 nm), lactoferrin (500 nm), and receptor-associated protein (RAP) (500 nm). Intracellular calcium was determined for individual cells using standard microscopic fluo-3 digital imaging (25.Minta A. Kao J.P.Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Qiu Z. Sweeney D.D. Netzeband J.G. Gruol D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10445-10456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, hippocampal neurons were loaded with 1 μm fluo-3/acetoxymethyl for 30 min and incubated in dye-free saline solution for an additional 45 min at room temperature to allow cleavage of acetoxymethyl ester. The culture dish was then mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped for fluo-3 video imaging. Live video imagines of selected microscopic fields were recorded with photomultiplier (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and digitized by computer. Images were formed by a pixel-by-pixel of the 488-nm wavelength-excited imaging. Real time digitized display, image acquisition, and calcium measurements are made with Bio-Rad imaging time course software (Imaging Research Inc.). The somata of ∼5–10 cells in each microscopic field were individually measured. Intracellular calcium levels were estimated by converting fluorescent intensity to intracellular calcium concentration using the following formula: [Ca2+]i =K d(F −F min)/(F max −F), where F = measured signal,F max = measured signal for a saturated calcium solution, and F min = measured signal for a calcium free solution. Calibration was done in vitro using fluo-3 salt (100 μm) in solutions of known calcium concentration (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Calibration of the fluo-3 signal in neurons required making measurements under saturating calcium concentrations and was facilitated by introducing extracellular calcium into cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 (Molecular Probes). The calcium calibration in vivo was consistent with calcium calibration in vitro. To avoid photo-bleaching and cell damages of fluo-3, 1 s of optical recording was followed by a 3-s break. Analysis of base-line data indicated that little or no bleaching of fluo-3 fluorescence occurred. The calcium calibration in vivo was applied to all pilot experiments that showed the alteration of calcium levels in order to demonstrate that the change of calcium signals was not the consequence of a change in fluo-3 loading. All experiments were performed at room temperature (∼23 °C). Cells were stimulated with micropressure application of either NMDA (100 μm) or AMPA (50 μm), selective agonists for the NMDA and AMPA subtypes of glutamate receptors, respectively. The agonists were dissolved in bath saline and applied by a brief (1 s) micropressure pulse from drug pipettes (1–3-μm tip) placed under visual control near target neurons. 150 mm K+ (K+ substituted for Na+ in physiological saline), which causes membrane depolarization, was applied in the same manner. A dye was included in the treatment solutions to monitor neuronal exposure, demonstrating that the agonist or K+ was rapidly distributed over an area sufficient to expose the target neurons. For NMDA stimulation the cell bath and agonist solutions were magnesium-free physiological saline containing 5 μm glycine. For the stimulation of AMPA and K+ depolarization, the bath contained normal physiological saline. In some experiments the neurons were exposed to antagonists or other drugs by bath exchange. These drugs includedd(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), nimodipine, EGTA, caffeine, and ifenprodil. For analysis of the NMDA receptor subunits, cell lysates were prepared from the primary rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 4 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3% Triton-X. The total cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant was analyzed by immunoblot as described (17.Qiu Z. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Rebeck G.W. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1393-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27.Luo J. Wang Y. Yasuda R.P. Dunah A.W. Wolfe B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein (∼5 μg) were separate by SDS-PAGE (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The monoclonal antibody for NMDA receptor subunit, NMDAR1, was a generous gift from Dr. Anthone Dunah, Massachusetts General Hospital. The concentration of antibody NMDAR1 used for immunoblot in this study was 1 μg/ml. From the same blots, actin was detected by specific monoclonal antibody (AC-40; Sigma) to assure that equal protein was present in each lane. Immunoreactivity was detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG developed with chemiluminescent reagent and exposed to film. Film were scanned with a Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer, and relative levels of NMDAR1 were determined for α2M*-pretreated and untreated cultures. Human recombinant α2M (Sigma) was activated in methylamine (100 mm) at 1 mg/ml as stock solution and stored at −20 °C for no more than 2–3 weeks. NMDA and AMPA were obtained from Tocris Neuramin, and stored as stock solutions at concentrations of 50 and 1 mm, respectively. APV (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at a concentration of 10 mm as stock solution. Stock solutions of nimodipine (20 mm; Sigma) were also prepared in Me2SO. The final concentration of Me2SO was not more than 0.05% in cell bath solution. In control experiments 0.05% Me2SO alone had no effects on calcium levels. EGTA (Sigma) was applied at a concentration of 1 mm to titrate the extracellular calcium. Caffeine, ifenprodil, and lactoferrin were purchased from Sigma. Human recombinant RAP was prepared from a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as described (28.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium signals were quantified by measurement of peak amplitude. The decay phase of intracellular calcium signaling, Ca30, was also analyzed in some experiments. Resting calcium level was subtracted from all peak amplitude values and Ca30 amplitude values on an individual cell basis. Each protocol consists of two or three culture sets of hippocampal neurons in which 5–15 neuronal somata in each field were measured. Data from several cultures were pooled for statistical analyses. Values are expressed as the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Fisherpost-hoc test for multiple comparisons determined statistical significance. p < 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference. Glutamate receptor-mediated calcium influx has been suggested to be an important factor in neurodegenerative processes, with the NMDA receptor as the subtype primarily associated (18.Choi D.W. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar, 21.Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. Chan S.L. Leissring M.A. Shepel P.N. Geiger J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether α2M* could alter calcium signaling after stimulation with NMDA. Fig. 1 A shows typical intracellular calcium recordings from the hippocampal neurons in control cultures and in cultures chronically exposed to α2M* (50 nm) for 48 h. In both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons, the calcium response evoked by NMDA was characterized by a rapid initial peak and a slower recovery phase. The amplitudes of the calcium signals were significantly smaller in α2M*-pretreated neurons compared with controls. Mean values for the populations of neurons studied are shown in Fig. 1 B. α2M* pretreatment substantially decreased the peak calcium amplitudes to NMDA stimulation by 56% in the cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition to its effects on the NMDA response, α2M* also decreased resting calcium levels by 17% (Fig. 1, A and B). To control for nonspecific effects of α2M*, we examined the influence of native α2M (which is not an LRP ligand) on the calcium responses to NMDA. In contrast to activated α2M, native α2M did not influence the calcium response to NMDA (Fig. 1, C and D). This result indicates that α2M must be activated to decrease the calcium response to NMDA. The effect of APV, an NMDA receptor competitive antagonist, was tested to determine whether the intracellular calcium responses to NMDA in both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons were entirely induced by activation of NMDA receptors. After the neurons were incubated in saline containing APV (10 μm) for 15 min, NMDA did not induce a visible increase of the intracellular calcium in either control (Fig. 1 E) or α2M*-pretreated neurons (Fig. 1 F). These results indicate that the intracellular calcium changes produced by NMDA stimulation were specifically induced by NMDA receptor activation in both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons. To test whether an acute treatment with α2M* produced effects similar to the chronic pretreatment, α2M* was applied by micropressure or bath application at a standard dose (50 nm) and a larger dose (500 nm) to neurons in hippocampal cultures. In addition, the response to NMDA stimulation was monitored during acute bath addition of α2M* (Fig. 2). There was no visible intracellular calcium response to α2M* stimulation when applied by micropressure pulse at the concentration of 50 nm (Fig. 2 A).Panels C and D in Fig. 2 are representative recordings of intracellular calcium signals to NMDA stimulation in the absence (panel C) and in the presence (panel D) of 50 nm α2M*; panel E shows averaged data of both resting levels and peak calcium amplitude. Acute α2M* treatment at the concentration of 50 nm also did not reduce the calcium responses to NMDA as seen for chronic α2M* pretreatment. However, at the higher concentration (500 nm), α2M* dramatically reduced the amplitude of spontaneous intracellular calcium oscillations in hippocampal neurons when applied by micropressure pulse (Fig. 2 B). The spontaneous intracellular calcium oscillations in neurons were characterized with synchronization of the calcium oscillations across neurons in a given field. Panel F and G in Fig. 2 are representative recordings of intracellular calcium responses to NMDA stimulation in the absence (panel F) and in the presence (panel G) of 500 nm α2M*. Besides its dramatic reduction of the amplitude of spontaneous intracellular calcium oscillations, acute application of α2M* at 500 nm significantly decreased the intracellular calcium responses to NMDA (by 33%) and resting calcium levels (by 14%) (Fig. 2 H). The levels of resting calcium in both control and chronic α2M*-treated neurons were determined by averaging the mean of intracellular calcium within the individual oscillations from the same field. These data indicate that a high concentration of α2M* produced acute effects on neuronal calcium signaling that were not seen at lower concentrations. RAP is a protein that facilitates the proper folding and trafficking of LRP within the early secretory pathway (29.Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). RAP antagonizes the binding of all known LRP ligands to this receptor in vitro (30.Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test if the tremendous decline in calcium responses to NMDA by α2M* was due to an LRP-mediated pathway, we co-incubated cultures with RAP (500 nm) to block the interactions between LRP and α2M*. Fig. 3 A shows a representative recording and the averaged data of the effects of RAP on the α2M*-induced alteration of the calcium responses to NMDA. α2M* substantially decreased the calcium responses to NMDA, and this change was eliminated by co-culture with RAP. RAP alone caused no change in the neuronal calcium responses to NMDA (Fig. 3 B). Although α2M* and RAP both bind LRP, only α2M* affected calcium responses to NMDA. We therefore tested another LRP ligand, lactoferrin, which is of particular interest due to its association with calcium signals in blood monocytes (31.Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C, with the representative recordings and averaged data, shows that lactoferrin pretreatment substantially decreased calcium responses to NMDA. Averaged data shows a 17% decline in resting levels and 67% decline in peak amplitude, which is similar to the α2M*-induced reduction in calcium signals. To test if the reduced calcium signaling by lactoferrin was due to enhanced LRP-mediated pathway, we co-incubated cultures with 500 nm RAP. RAP treatment abolished the effects of lactoferrin on calcium responses to NMDA (Fig. 3 C). This result suggests that lactoferrin and α2M* share the common pathway, LRP, for altering the calcium responses to NMDA. Although RAP inhibited the effects of chronic treatment with 50 nm α2M* (Fig. 2), it had no effects on the intracellular calcium signaling produced by acute treatment with 500 nmα2M* (data not shown). Thus, LRP is involved in the chronic, but not acute, effects of α2M* under these conditions. Hippocampal neurons express multiple subtypes of glutamate receptors. Therefore, it was of interest to know if the response evoked by another glutamate receptor agonist was affected by the chronic α2M* pretreatment. We examined the effects of α2M* on the intracellular calcium responses to AMPA, shown in Fig. 4 A, B(representative recordings), and C (mean values). Similar to NMDA, AMPA increased intracellular calcium, which was characterized by an initial peak but quick recovery phase in both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons. However, α2M* pretreatment did not change the calcium signaling of neurons to AMPA. This result indicates that α2M* alters the intracellular calcium responses to NMDA but not to AMPA. Activation of NMDA receptors can cause a membrane depolarization that activates voltage-sensitive calcium channels, resulting in an enhanced calcium signal. An alteration of this signal by α2M* pretreatment could contribute to the reduced calcium response to NMDA in the α2M*-pretreated neurons. To test this possibility, the effect of α2M* pretreatment on calcium signals produced by K+depolarization in hippocampal neurons was investigated. Representative recordings are shown in Fig. 4, D and E, and mean values are shown in Fig. 4 F. Similar to AMPA, both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons show an initial peak and quick recovery phase in the intracellular calcium signaling in response to K+ depolarization. α2M* pretreatment had no effect on the K+-evoked calcium signaling, suggesting that activation of only voltage-sensitive calcium channels did not contribute to the altered intracellular calcium responses to NMDA in α2M*-pretreated neurons. The results summarized in Fig. 4 demonstrate that α2M* did not affect calcium entry after stimulation of AMPA receptors or voltage-sensitive calcium channels. LRP has a binding site for calcium, which may allow LRP to act as a sensor of extracellular calcium levels (32.Herz J. Hamann U. Rogne S. Myklebost O. Gausepohl H. Stanley K.K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that extracellular calcium levels may alter the calcium binding to LRP and subsequently affect calcium influx through NMDA-gated calcium channels. Therefore, we examined the effect of lowering physiological extracellular calcium levels on the response to NMDA by EGTA titration. Results are summarized in Fig. 5. Lowering extracellular calcium from 2.2 to 0.22 mm reduced the response to NMDA in both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons. Similar effects were observed in the calcium response to NMDA (Fig. 5, A and B) in both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons. The peak calcium amplitude was decreased by 79% in control and by 85% in α2M*-pretreated neurons (Fig. 5 C). Similar reductions were observed in the decay phase, such as 30 s after stimulation (Ca30), in both control and α2M*-pretreated neurons (75 versus 85%) (Fig. 5 D). These results indicate that extracellular calcium is an important component of the NMDA response, and the effects of α2M* on the calcium responses to NMDA depend on the activation of NMDA receptors (Figs. 1, E and F) rather than on the concentration of extracellular calcium. However, we found no indication that altered extracellular calcium levels reduced the calcium signaling of neurons to α2M* pretreatment, which suggested that the binding site for calcium of LRP may not play an important role in the different calcium responses to NMDA induced by α2M*. α2M* did not affect the calcium response to KCl (Fig. 4), indicating that calcium signals from only voltage-sensitive calcium channels did not contribute to the altered intracellular calcium responses to NMDA in α2M*-pretreated neurons. However, activation of NMDA receptors can cause a membrane depolarization that activates voltage-sensitive calcium channels, contributing to the calcium signal. To determine whether α2M* affected calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels subsequent to the activation of NMDA receptor, we used an L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker, nimodipine (5 μm), in control and α2M*-pretreated neurons. Similar reductions were observed in average peak calcium amplitude in control and α2M*-pretreated neurons (48 versus 49%,p > 0.05), whereas the difference between control and α2M*-pretreated neurons was eliminated by nimodipine in Ca30 calcium amplitude (88 versus 57%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5, E and F). These results suggested that the L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels contribute not only to the intracellular calcium responses to NMDA in both groups but also partly to the reduced intracellular calcium response to NMDA in the neurons chronically treated with α2M*. Calcium release from intracellular calcium stores could also contribute to NMDA-induced intracellular calcium response in hippocampal neurons. Such release could be trigged by extracellular cal"
https://openalex.org/W2066722683,"Calmodulin-dependent activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase is generally considered to follow a transient increase in intracellular calcium levels. However, a number of physiological stimuli (e.g. endothelial shear-stress, insulin) are known to activate endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) via a non-classical, “calcium-independent” pathway. Recent findings demonstrate that such stimuli elicit the phosphorylation of a C-terminal residue in eNOS (Ser1179 in the bovine isoform), rendering eNOS active at resting levels of intracellular calcium. However, the mechanistic basis for this mode of eNOS activation remains unknown. Protein modeling led us to consider that the C terminus of eNOS may fulfill an autoinhibitory function that can be disrupted by phosphorylation of serine 1179. To test this possibility we contrasted the phenotype of wild type bovine eNOS with that of a mutant lacking C-terminal residues 1179–1205 (CΔ27 eNOS). Despite no observed difference in calmodulin affinity, CΔ27 eNOS exhibited a 5-fold reduction in EC50 for calcium and a 2–4-fold increase in maximal catalytic activities. In these phenotypic properties, CΔ27 accurately mimics phospho-Ser1179 wild type eNOS. We conclude that the C terminus imposes a significant barrier to the activation of eNOS by calmodulin binding and that this barrier can be functionally disabled by Ser1179phosphorylation-elicited enzyme activation.

J. Vasc. Res. 1994; 31: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). NOS isoforms are functionally distinguished by their modes of regulation. Two Ca2+-dependent mammalian isoforms of NOS, neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial (eNOS), remain dormant until Ca2+/CaM binding is elicited by transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+. In contrast, Ca2+-independent NOS (iNOS) is continuously active, due to a remarkably high affinity for CaM even at low resting levels of intracellular Ca2+ (2Cho H.J. Xie Q.W. Calaycay J.

The three isoforms are further differentiated by their maximal rates of NO synthesis; nNOS and iNOS exhibit severalfold greater activity than eNOS (3Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Limited proteolysis studies revealed that the ACE is physically displaced upon CaM binding to cNOS and that synthetic ACE-derived peptides inhibit both CaM binding and NOS activation. Homology-based molecular modeling provided structural predictions consistent with an interaction between the ACE and bound CaM on cNOS. A model was posed whereby the ACE reversibly docks with a site on cNOS that impedes CaM binding and hence, enzyme activity. Binding of CaM to cNOS was postulated to displace the ACE by virtue of domain overlap, thereby eliciting enzyme activation. Support for this prediction was subsequently provided by demonstrations that deletion of the entire ACE from eNOS (5Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Deletion of the ACE from eNOS also caused an increase in the maximal rate of NO synthesis to a level comparable with that of wild type nNOS and iNOS (5Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

That such sites exist within the reductase domain is suggested by the finding that Ca2+/CaM-dependent control of electron flux remains intact in isolated eNOS- and nNOS-derived reductase domains (9Abu-Soud H.M.

Despite the lack of a solved high-resolution structure for a complete NOS reductase domain, three-dimensional homology-based models of NOS reductase subdomains have been developed considering the many related proteins in the protein structure database (4Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Roberts D.L. Djordjevic S. Wang M. Shea T.M. Masters B.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 368-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only two regions of eNOS cannot be reliably modeled due to the lack of suitable structural homologs. These completely unknown structural elements are: (1) the aforementioned 45-amino acid ACE peptide in the FMN-binding subdomain and (2) a C-terminal peptide that is partially sequence-conserved within NOS isoforms and which extends beyond the C terminus of the highly conserved NOS-homolog, cytochrome P-450 reductase (CPR). Notably, the two C-terminal residues of CPR, Trp-Ser, are substituted in all NOSs with Phe-Gly, followed by 21–42 amino acids depending on NOS isoform. The peptide extension of NOSs is found in no other FAD-containing flavoprotein that otherwise bears NOS-homology. The C-terminal peptide of NOSs is not essential for NO synthesis but is profoundly important for efficient NOS catalysis. Deletion of the entire C-terminal extension (i.e. all residues beyond the CPR C-terminal homolog, Phe-Gly) was reported to have no significant effect (12Xie Q.W. Cho H. Kashiwabara Y. Baum M.

When devoid of bound Ca2+/CaM, C-terminally truncated eNOS and nNOS were observed to produce low levels of NO (6–7% of that with full-length NOSs containing bound Ca2+/CaM) while reducing artificial electron acceptors at a 7–21-fold accelerated rate (14Roman L.J. Martasek P. Miller R.T. Harris D.E. de La Garza M.A. Shea T.M. Kim J.J. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29225-29232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, CaM binding to C-terminally truncated eNOS and nNOS was observed to inhibit, rather than enhance, reductase activities (14Roman L.J. Martasek P. Miller R.T.

Given the profound consequences of C terminus removal on NOS enzymatic activities, a regulatory function for the eNOS C terminus is conceivable. Studies have shown that endothelial shear-stress elicits Akt/PKB-dependent phosphorylation of a conserved serine that lies 27 amino acids from the C terminus of eNOS (Ser1179 in bovine eNOS); this modification triggers eNOS activation even at low physiological levels of Ca2+ and enhances maximal catalytic activity by 2-fold in vivo (15Fulton D.

Herein, we have expressed and characterized a truncated bovine eNOS mutant lacking Ser1179 and the subsequent 26 C-terminal amino acids. Evidence is presented in support of a key regulatory role for the unphosphorylated C-terminal peptide in maintaining eNOS in a catalytically inactive state at basal levels of Ca2+. Activation of eNOS by phosphorylation of Ser1179 in vivo can be explained by a loss of autoinhibitory C-terminal peptide function and consequent activation of electron transfer into and between reductase domain flavins. Calmodulin was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and (6 R)-5,6,7,8 tetrahydrobiopterin from Schirks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). I125-labeled CaM was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Terrific broth, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and chloramphenicol were purchased from Invitrogen. 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and GFB membrane-clad 96-well microfiltration plates were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Bovine heart cytochrome c, β-lactoglobulin, CaM-Sepharose resin and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. eNOS was purified from Escherichia coli harboring pGroELS and pCW-eNOS expression vectors (26Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An overnight culture of pCW-eNOS/pGroELS was used to inoculate 0.5-liter volumes of terrific broth containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml) in 2.8 liters of Fernbach flasks. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.8 at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. To enhance heme biosynthesis, δ-aminolevulinic acid was added (0.5 mm final), and cultures were grown for another hour. Riboflavin (3 μmfinal) and ATP (1 mm final) were then added to the cultures, and eNOS expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final). Cultures were grown in the dark at 25 °C for an additional 48 h, and bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. Pellets were stored at −70 °C until eNOS purification. Purification of eNOS was accomplished by a modification of the method of Martasek et al. (26Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L.J. Gross S.S. Sessa W.C. Masters B.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, eNOS-containing bacterial pellets were resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin and 20 mm CHAPS), subjected to lysis by pulsed sonication, and then centrifuged to sediment particulate matter (120,000 ×g, for 1 h). The supernatant was applied to a 2′5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B column that had been pre-equilibrated in buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl). The column was then washed with 20-column volumes of buffer B followed by 20-column volumes of buffer B containing high salt (600 mm NaCl). eNOS protein was eluted with high salt buffer B that additionally contained 10 mm NADPH. This NaCl concentration of the eNOS-containing eluate was reduced to 100 mm by repeated concentration/dilution in buffer B using a centrifugal filter device (Biomax-100K, Millipore). The concentrated and desalted NADPH eluate was further purified by affinity chromatography on a calmodulin-Sepharose column as previously described (27Black S.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Quantification of eNOS protein was determined spectrophotometrically based on heme content, calculated using an extinction coefficient of 74 mmol−1 cm−1 for A444-A550 of the dithionite-reduced CO-bound eNOS heme-chromophore (28Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26907-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of full-length bovine eNOS cDNA was performed using a QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene; La Jolla, CA). Briefly, the mutagenesis of eNOS cDNA was carried out in the pCW-eNOS expression vector using two synthetic oligonucleotide primers (forward: 5′-CTCCTGCAGGGAAAATCACGGGTACGTATACG-3′, reverse: 5′-CGTATACGTACCCAGTGATTTTCCCTGCAGGAG-3′) to introduce a stop codon (TAG) in place of the codon that encodes Ser1179 in wild type eNOS. Introduction of the desired stop codon was confirmed by dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing performed by the Cornell University DNA Sequencing Core Facility. CaM binding to eNOS was analyzed in 96-well microfiltration plates containing GFB membrane filter-bottoms that had been prewashed with binding buffer (10 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 100 μm CaCl2, and β-lactoglobulin 0.5%, pH 7.2). Incubations contained binding buffer, BH4 (10 μm) and dithiothreitol (1 mm), supplemented with desired concentrations of125I-labeled CaM in a total volume of 100 μl. In some cases, Ca2+-buffer solutions were additionally added. Binding reactions were initiated by the addition of eNOS at the desired concentrations and allowed to proceed for 20 min at 25 °C. Binding was terminated by rapid vacuum filtration, and filters were washed twice with 100 μl of ice-cold assay buffer before air drying under vacuum. Bound radioactivity was determined in a Microbeta Plus 96-well liquid scintillation counter (Wallac) after addition of 25 μl of scintillation mixture to each well (Optiphase Supermix, Wallac). Specific binding of CaM was calculated as the component of total binding that was lost when samples were co-incubated with the calcium-chelator EGTA (5 mm) or upon inclusion of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled CaM. Equilibrium binding constants and association and dissociation kinetic rates were quantified by computer-assisted non-linear least squares regression analysis using Prism 2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). NO synthesis was deduced using the Griess assay for quantification of nitrite, a stable oxidation product of NO. Assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates using a 100-μl total sample volume. All wells containedl-arginine (1 mm), calmodulin (100 nm), CaCl2 (100 μm), BH4 (10 μm), Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.6), and eNOS at the desired concentrations. Reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH (1 mm). After one h at 37 °C, 10 μl of lactate dehydrogenase was added (20 μl of lactate dehydrogenase slurry in 0.5 ml of 500 mm pyruvate), and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Griess reagent (freshly made 1:1 mix of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid and 0.1%N-(1-napthyl)-ethylenediamine) was added as a 100-μl volume and A550 was determined within 10 min. The level of nitrite in samples was assessed by comparison with sodium nitrite standards. For experiments that assess the Ca2+dependence of NO synthesis, reactions were carried as above, except that reaction buffer was substituted (10 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.2) containing varying ratios of EGTA-Ca2+ to give desired Ca2+ concentrations (described below). Stock solutions of “zero” free Ca2+ (10 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2) and 40 μm free Ca2+ (10 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mmCaCl2, pH 7.2) were prepared. Solutions of defined free Ca2+ (0–40 μm) were then prepared by mixing varying ratios of the two solutions (29Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar). The free Ca2+concentration was quantified by ratiometric fluorometry using fura-2. Assays of eNOS reductase domain activity were carried out in 96-well microtiter plate format in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Reaction progress was monitored continually for 30 min at 15-s intervals by following the rate of increase in A550 and A405 for cytochrome c and ferricyanide reduction, respectively. All wells contained assay buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 250 nm CaM, 0.6 mmEDTA, 10 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 10 units/ml catalase) and either 100 μm bovine heart cytochrome c or 1 mm potassium ferricyanide. To assess the dependence on CaM binding, maximum CaM binding was elicited by addition of 0.83 mm Ca2+. After addition of the desired amount of recombinant eNOS (full-length or CΔ27) or water to blank wells, substrate reduction was initiated by addition of NADPH (100 μm final concentration). Sequence alignment of the C-terminal region of rat CPR with NOS isoforms reveals that the C terminus of all NOSs extends beyond the site of CPR termination (Fig. 1). The fact that CPR is functionally homologous to the NOS reductase domain implies that the C-terminal extension in NOSs is not required for catalytic function. Indeed, it had been demonstrated for murine iNOS that 21 amino acids can be deleted from the C terminus without significant loss of activity (12Xie Q.W. Cho H. Kashiwabara Y. Baum M. Weidner J.R. Elliston K. Mumford R. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28500-28505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, deletion of C-terminal segments of nNOS and eNOS have been recently reported to perturb electron transfer and alter calmodulin-dependent regulation (14Roman L.J. Martasek P. Miller R.T. Harris D.E. de La Garza M.A. Shea T.M. Kim J.J. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29225-29232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Significant identity in the C termini of eNOS isoforms and conservation among all isoforms suggests a functional role. Because physiological activation of eNOS has been shown to involve Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of a Ser residue 27 amino acids distal to the C terminus in bovine or human eNOS (15Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar, 16Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3055) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this mode of eNOS activation may be a molecular consequence of disabled C-terminal inhibitory functions. To evaluate this possibility, we contrasted the functional properties of full-length eNOS with those of a truncation mutant lacking the 27 C-terminal amino acids (CΔ27, see Fig. 1). C-terminal truncation of eNOS was conferred by introducing a stop codon in lieu of Ser1179, the site of in vivo phosphorylation and catalytic activation by Akt/PKB in bovine eNOS. This results in CΔ27, a truncated eNOS protein that is deleted in 27 of the 42 C-terminal amino acid residues that extend beyond the homologous termination site in CPR. A two-step purification involving sequential affinity chromatographies on ADP-Sepharose and CaM-Sepharose resins resulted in >90% homogeneity for both full-length and CΔ27 as estimated from Coomassie-stained SDS/PAGE (not shown). Extraction of CΔ27 (but not full-length eNOS) from bacterial pellets was significantly improved by inclusion of CHAPS detergent (20 mm) in the bacterial lysis buffer; CHAPS was included in both full-length and CΔ27 eNOS preparations to allow for direct comparison of enzymatic properties. Spectrophotometry demonstrated that CO-bound absorption spectra of dithionite-reduced CΔ27 and full-length eNOS are indistinguishable, indicating that C-terminal truncation does not compromise heme-coordination. Accordingly, spectral assessment of the heme-chromophore was used to quantify eNOS protein mass. Overall eNOS yields ranged from 2–10 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture. Experiments were performed to compare the Ca2+ dependence for activation of full-length and CΔ27 eNOS (80 nm) by CaM (100 nm). As shown in Fig. 2 A, truncation of the C terminus of eNOS resulted in a 5- to 6-fold diminution in the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal activation of NO synthesis relative to full-length eNOS (EC50 values for free Ca2+ = 83 and 461 nm, respectively). Notably, CΔ27 eNOS was >80% active at 150 nmCa2+, which supported <10% of maximal activity with full-length eNOS. This relative “Ca2+-independence” of CΔ27 eNOS contrasts with the complete Ca2+-independence of murine iNOS activity at all concentrations of Ca2+tested (Fig. 2 A). We next compared the Ca2+ dependence for125I-labeled CaM binding to CΔ27 and full-length eNOS. Despite the substantial difference between CΔ27 and full-length eNOS in their Ca2+ concentration dependence for enzymatic activation, the Ca2+ dependencies for binding of125I-labeled CaM were not markedly different. Notably, assessment of eNOS activity (Fig. 2 A) and125I-labeled CaM binding (Fig. 2 B) were each performed using the same Ca2+ buffer solutions under identical assay conditions, permitting direct comparison of observed Ca2+ dependencies. These findings revealed a fundamental difference between the enzymes; whereas full-length eNOS binds125I-labeled CaM at Ca2+ concentrations that are significantly lower than that required for physiological enzyme activation (≈5-fold difference in EC50 values), the Ca2+ dependence for 125I-labeled CaM binding and activation of CΔ27 eNOS are indistinguishable at Ca2+concentrations above those typically found in resting cells (100 nm) (30Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). An increased affinity for Ca2+/CaM binding could potentially explain the reduced Ca2+ dependence for activation of CΔ27 compared with full-length eNOS. To test this possibility, we defined the concentration dependence for Ca2+/CaM to both activate and bind to each of CΔ27 and full-length eNOS; experiments were performed by varying CaM in the presence of excess Ca2+ (100 μm). Activity assays failed to demonstrate the predicted leftward shift in the concentration dependence of Ca2+/CaM for eliciting NO synthesis by CΔ27 eNOS compared with full-length eNOS; indeed, a small but paradoxical rightward shift was observed (Ca2+/CaM EC50 = 35 nm for CΔ27 eNOS and 23 nm for wild type eNOS; see Fig. 3 A). Saturation analysis revealed an identical affinity for binding of Ca2+/125I-labeled CaM to CΔ27 versus full-length eNOS (EC50 = 13 and 14 nm, respectively; see Fig. 3 B). Based on estimated calculations of free Ca2+/125I-labeled CaM, correcting for the component that contributes to total binding, we calculate Kd values for binding to CΔ27 and full-length eNOS of 3 and 4 nm, respectively. The equilibrium binding constant, Kd, equals the ratio of two kinetic rate constants, dissociation (koff) and association (kon). As equilibrium binding of Ca2+/125I-labeled CaM to eNOS was found to be unaltered by truncation of the 27 C-terminal amino acid residues, contrary to our prediction, we sought verification of this finding by analysis of CaM binding kinetics. The rate of dissociation of125Ilabeled CaM-eNOS at 25 °C was evaluated for complexes that had been formed in the presence of maximal levels of Ca2+. Measurements were initiated by addition of a 3000-fold molar excess of unlabeled CaM to prevent reassociation of125I-labeled CaM-cNOS complexes following their dissociation. As shown in Fig. 4(main panel), the rate of dissociation of CΔ27 eNOS-CaM complexes was not discernibly different from that exhibited by full-length eNOS-CaM complexes; indeed fitted curves were virtually superimposable. Linear analysis of this data indicated half-times for I125-labeled CaM dissociation of 21.4 and 21.0 min for full-length and CΔ27 eNOS, respectively. As we observed no difference in CaM dissociation rates, we next compared the rates of CaM association with full-length and CΔ27 eNOS at 25 °C (Fig. 4,inset). The kinetics of CaM association was indistinguishable for wild type and CΔ27 eNOS, although the rapidity of binding precluded accurate determination of koff values. Nonetheless, as both association and dissociation rates are indistinguishable for CΔ27 and full-length eNOS, we conclude that truncation of the C-terminal amino acids"

Oncogenic activation of Net1 occurs by truncation of the N-terminal part of the protein, which functions as a negative regulatory domain. Here, we have investigated the mechanism of Net1 regulation via its N terminus. We find that Net1 localizes to the nucleus, whereas oncogenic Net1 is found in the cytoplasm. Nuclear import of Net1 is mediated by two nuclear localization signals present in the N terminus of the protein, and forced cytoplasmic localization of Net1 is sufficient to activate Rho. In addition, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Net1 acts as a nuclear export signal. Because an amino acid substitution in the PH domain that inhibits guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity does not inhibit nuclear export, we conclude that this PH domain has at least two functions. Together, our results suggest that Net1 can shuttle in and out of the nucleus, and that activation of Rho by Net1 is controlled by changes in its subcellular localization.

In addition, most GEFs contain other functional domains including Src homology domains 2 and 3, Ser/Thr or Tyr kinase, Ras-GEF, Rho-GTPase-activating protein, and PDZ, which are likely to be involved in linking GEFs to upstream receptors and signaling molecules (11.Cerione R.A.

Although for most GEFs there is no direct evidence that they play a role in cancer, mutations in Tiam-1 and leukemia-associatedRho GEF (LARG) have been found in human tumors (14.Engers R. Zwaka T.P.

It remains to be seen whether mutations in GEFs are a more widespread phenomenon in human tumor formation and progression. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate GEF activity. Oncogenic activation of GEFs is often associated with truncation of the N terminus, suggesting that this might provide a negative regulatory domain (11.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 13.Stam J.C. Collard J.G. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 51-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To date, the best understood example of this is Vav. It has been demonstrated that the N terminus of Vav binds directly, via an intramolecular interaction, to its DH domain, thereby blocking interaction with GTPases (16.Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr-174 in the Vav N terminus by Src-family tyrosine kinases relieves the autoinhibition. Similar mechanisms of activation have been suggested for Dbl, which, like Vav, is activated by phosphorylation of the N terminus, and for p115RhoGEF, which is activated upon binding of Gα13 to an N-terminal RGS domain (17.Bi F. Debreceni B. Zhu K. Salani B. Eva A. Zheng Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18.Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Activation of GEFs has also been reported to involve the PH domain. Binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase products to the PH domain of Vav, for example, disrupts an intramolecular interaction between the PH and DH domains (20.Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For other GEFs, such as Lbc, Lfc, or Dbs, the PH domain appears to be required to target the protein to the plasma membrane, probably by binding to phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIPs) or perhaps proteins at the membrane (21.Whitehead I.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of a conserved tryptophan residue within the PH domain results in loss of transforming activity, and in some cases this can be restored by addition of a CAAX motif to target the protein to the plasma membrane (21.Whitehead I.

The net1 gene, which encodes a specific GEF for Rho, was originally isolated in a tissue culture screen for novel oncogenes using the focus formation assay in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (24.Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Experimental constitutive activation of human and mouse Net1 can be achieved through truncation of the N-terminal 145 and 121 amino acids, respectively (24.Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated the mechanism by which N-terminal sequences negatively regulate the activity of Net1. We find that the N terminus of Net1 harbors nuclear localization signals, which, when removed or mutated, cause relocalization of Net1 to the cytoplasm leading to activation of Rho. Furthermore, we find that the PH domain has at least two activities, one for export of Net1 from the nucleus and the other for activation of Rho once in the cytoplasm. Together, our data suggest that Net1 regulates Rho activity through changes in its intracellular localization. Leptomycin B (LMB), a gift from M.

Swiss 3T3 and COS-7 cells were grown and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Confluent quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells for microinjection were prepared as follows. Cells were plated in DMEM containing 5% serum at a density of 5 × 104onto acid-washed coverslips. Seven to 10 days after seeding, the cells became quiescent, at which time they were serum-starved for 16 h in DMEM containing 2 g/liter NaHCO3. Eukaryotic expression vectors (0.1 μg/μl, unless stated otherwise) together with biotin-dextran were injected into the nucleus of 50–100 cells over a period of 15 min. Cells were returned to the incubator for 1–3 h for optimal expression. To assay the effect of blocking nuclear export, LMB was added 30 min after injection for 1.5 h at a concentration of 40 ng/ml. Microinjected Swiss 3T3 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, incubated with NH4Cl/PBS (2.7 mg/ml) for 10 min to remove free aldehyde groups and then stained as previously described (26.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). Coverslips were rinsed in PBS between each step of the staining procedure. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS and left on the coverslip for 30 min. After washing, the coverslips were incubated for 30 min with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies and AMCA-coupled streptavidin (to identify biotin-dextran-injected cells) diluted in PBS. Where necessary the cells were further incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (200 ng/ml) for 10 min to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. Coverslips were mounted on Mowiol mountant containingp-phenylenediamine as an anti-bleaching agent. After 30 min at 37 °C, the coverslips were examined and the cells analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using Zeiss 40× 1.4 oil immersion objectives. Pictures were taken with a Hamamatsu C5985-10 video camera. Cells injected with constructs expressing GFP-tagged proteins were fixed and permeabilized as described above, and coverslips were then directly mounted onto slides without further staining. Representative pictures are shown, and the data are presented as the means ± standard deviation. Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 2 ml of medium, incubated overnight, and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 1 μg of DNA was used for each transfection. After transfection the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h before harvesting. Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation of Swiss 3T3 or transfected COS-7 cells was performed using the NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents from Pierce following the manufacturer's instructions. Swiss 3T3 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish for 24 h before lysis. COS-7 cells were transfected as described above. After fractionation the protein concentrations were measured, and ∼20 μg of protein extracts were used from each fraction. Samples were denatured in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis were performed by standard methods. As a first step toward analyzing the regulation of Net1, we microinjected cDNA constructs encoding Myc-tagged, murine Net1 or an oncogenic version of Net1 (Net1ΔN, lacking the first 121 amino acids) into quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and examined the cells for changes in the actin cytoskeleton. As described before, expression of Net1ΔN, but not Net1, strongly induced the formation of actin stress fibers (25.Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A,panels II and IV). Interestingly, when we monitored the expression of the injected constructs, we found a striking difference in their subcellular distributions; Net1 localized exclusively to the nucleus, whereas Net1ΔN was mainly found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A, panels I andIII). To examine the subcellular distribution of Net1 and Net1ΔN biochemically, we performed Western analysis using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with Net1 or Net1ΔN. In agreement with our observations in injected fibroblasts, more than 95% of Net1 is present in the nuclear fraction, whereas ∼50% of Net1ΔN is found in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the nuclear localization of overexpressed Net1 is a true reflection of the subcellular distribution of the endogenous protein, we examined the levels of endogenous Net1 in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of growing Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using a commercial antibody directed against a peptide in the N terminus of human Net1. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the antibody is not highly specific but it does recognize a protein of ∼68 kDa, which is the same size as transfected Net1 (data not shown), and is competed away with excess Net1 peptide. This protein is almost exclusively present in the nuclear fraction. Together, these results indicate that Net1 localizes to the nucleus, whereas Net1ΔN is present in the cytoplasm. The above results raise the possibility that Net1 is unable to activate Rho and stimulate stress fiber formation because it is sequestered in the nucleus, whereas Net1ΔN is able to activate Rho simply because it is localized in the cytoplasm. We therefore asked whether forced cytoplasmic localization of Net1 is sufficient to induce stress fibers. To investigate, this we microinjected high concentrations of Net1 cDNA into quiescent, serum-depleted Swiss 3T3 cells. As seen in Fig. 1 D, in cells expressing high levels of Net1, some Net1 protein was detected in the cytoplasm (compare panels I and III). The cells that showed some cytoplasmic localization of Net1 also exhibited stress fibers, suggesting that localization of Net1 in the cytoplasm is sufficient to activate Rho (Fig. 1 D, panels II andIV). Nuclear import of proteins with a molecular mass of >40–50 kDa is dependent on the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is recognized by the import machinery that mediates the translocation of protein into the nucleus (27.Sweitzer T.D. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because Net1 localizes to the nucleus, it is likely that one or several NLS sequences are present in the Net1 sequence. A search through the entire Net1 sequence reveals three potential NLS sequences. Two simple NLS sequences, consisting of a short stretch of basic amino acids, are present in the N terminus of Net1 (NLS1 = amino acids 12–19 and NLS2 = amino acids 66–72), and a bipartite NLS, consisting of a short stretch of basic amino acids preceded by an essential doublet of basic residues 5–14 amino acids upstream, is located in the C terminus (NLS3 = amino acids 536–552). To investigate whether these sequences are functional NLS sequences that contribute to the nuclear localization of Net1, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of Net1 in which one or several of the NLS sequences were removed (Fig. 2 A). cDNAs expressing the Net1 deletion mutants were microinjected into quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, and the localization of the mutant proteins and their ability to induce stress fiber formation were assessed by immunofluorescence and by staining of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, to confirm the localization of the Net1 deletion mutants biochemically, we transiently transfected these cDNAs into COS-7 cells and performed nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation. As seen in Fig. 2 B, Net1ΔN2, lacking NLS1, is able to stimulate stress fiber formation, suggesting that some Net1ΔN2 is cytoplasmic. Although this is not obvious in Fig. 2 B, immunofluorescence is not a very sensitive way to detect low levels of cytoplasmic protein and so biochemical fractionation of transfected COS-7 cells was performed. Fig. 2 C confirms that a small but significant amount of Net1ΔN2 is in the cytoplasm (∼15%) compared with full-length Net1. Removal of both NLS1 and NLS2 (Net1ΔN3) causes the relocalization of a major fraction of the protein to the cytoplasm seen both by immunofluorescence and fractionation, leading to strong induction of stress fibers, similar to that observed with Net1ΔN (Fig. 2, B (panels III and IV) andC). An N-terminal fragment of Net1 (Net1N) that bears both N-terminal NLS sequences is found exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 2,B (panel V) and C). This suggests that Net1 is imported into the nucleus via two NLS sequences in its N terminus. To demonstrate that localization is the only property that is altered in the N-terminal deletion mutants of Net1, we made a Net1 construct (Net1 NLS*) in which we mutated NLS1 and NLS2 by replacing the basic residues with alanine residues. Mutating NLS1 and NLS2, like removal of the N terminus, leads to relocalization of Net1 into the cytoplasm and to the induction of stress fibers (Fig. 2, B(panels VII and VIII) and C). Removal of the C-terminal NLS3 does not lead to relocalization of Net1 to the cytoplasm nor to the formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 2,B (panels IX and X) and C). Furthermore, a C-terminal fragment of Net1 (Net1C) containing NLS3 is not imported into the nucleus (Fig. 2, B (panels XIII and XIV) and C). In addition, the cytoplasmic fraction and activity of Net1ΔN are not altered when the C terminus is removed (Fig. 2, B (panels XI andXII) and C). This suggests that NLS3 is not a functional NLS and that the C terminus of Net1 is not required for its function. We next examined whether NLSs are also present in other Net1 family members. Human Net1, which is 82% identical to murine Net1, also possesses NLS2, suggesting that human Net1 is also localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3 A). A splice variant of mouse Net1, which unlike full-length Net1 induces transformation, is identical to Net1 except for the N-terminal 31 amino acids and lacks NLS1 and NLS2. 2F. Wempe, S. Nigro, and H. Melcher, unpublished data. Another member of the Net1 family of GEFs, Arhgef3, which is 49% identical to mouse Net1, also lacks NLS1 and NLS2. We therefore determined the localization of Arhgef3 and investigated its ability to induce changes in the actin cytoskeleton. First, we transfected Arhgef3 as well as an Arhgef3 mutant that lacked the N terminus (Arhgef3ΔN) into COS-7 cells and fractionated the cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Fig. 3 B shows that, in contrast to Net1, Arhgef3 is found in the cytoplasm. Removal of the N-terminal part of Arhgef3 did not have any effect on localization of the protein. Next, we microinjected Arhgef3 and Arhgef3ΔN into Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. As in COS-7 cells, Arhgef3 and Arhgef3ΔN proteins are localized to the cytoplasm, and both proteins are active and strongly induce the formation of actin stress fibers (Fig. 3 C). The induction of stress fibers by Arhgef3 is blocked by C3 transferase, which specifically inhibits Rho (28.Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar), but is unaffected by dominant-negative Rac (N17Rac), suggesting that, like Net1, Arhgef3 is a Rho-specific GEF (Fig. 3 D). However, unlike Net1, Arhgef3 is cytoplasmic, and its activity is not regulated by its N terminus. To investigate if and how Net1 is exported from the nucleus, we made use of the finding that some Net1ΔN protein, although it lacks the N-terminal NLS sequences, is found in the nucleus. We assessed whether Net1ΔN shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with Net1ΔN and then treated with LMB, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (27.Sweitzer T.D. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were stained for Net1ΔN and with anti-NF-κB antibody as a control. As seen in Fig. 4 A, endogenous NF-κB rapidly accumulates in the nucleus upon LMB treatment (Fig. 4 A, panels II and IV). Nuclear localization of Net1ΔN is also increased in the presence of LMB, although the effect is less dramatic than for NF-κB, possibly because Net1 is overexpressed (Fig. 4, A (panels I and III) and B). This suggests that Net1ΔN shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that its export is mediated by the CRM1 export machinery. We next asked which part of Net1 is required for nuclear export. To investigate this we microinjected various Net1ΔN deletion mutants into quiescent, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells. One del"

The two-hybrid interaction between C-GLUT4 and C-Daxx is validated by the ability of in vitro translated C-GLUT4 to interact with in vitro translated full-length Daxx and C-Daxx. C-Daxx does not interact with the C-cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1, the ubiquitous glucose transporter homologous to GLUT4. Replacement of alanine and serine for the dileucine pair (Leu489-Leu490) critical for targeting GLUT4 from the trans-Golgi network to the perinuclear intracellular store as well as for its surface internalization by endocytosis inhibits 2-fold the interaction of C-GLUT4 with Daxx. Daxx is pulled down with GLUT4 immunoprecipitated from lysates of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing physiological levels of the two proteins. Similarly, GLUT4 is recovered with anti-Daxx immunoprecipitates. Using an established cell fractionation procedure we present evidence for the existence of two distinct intracellular Daxx pools in the nucleus and low density microsomes. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy studies localize Daxx to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and punctate cytoplasmic structures, often organized in strings and underneath the plasma membrane. Daxx and GLUT4 are SUMOlated as shown by their reaction with an anti-SUMO1 antibody and by the ability of this antibody to pull down Daxx and GLUT4.

Trafficking of GLUT4 is mediated by motifs localized to the amino and carboxyl-cytoplasmic domains of the protein, though their characterization and the identification of the factors involved in their reading is incomplete.SUMO (also called sentrin, PIC1, and GMP1), a 101-amino acid ubiquitin-like modifier protein that is highly conserved from yeast to human, appears to control protein turnover and compartmentalization (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Three members of the SUMO family have been described in vertebrates. They show major structural differences in the sequences of their N-extensions, which are absent in ubiquitin. It has been shown recently that Ubc9, the only E2-type SUMO1-conjugating enzyme described in vertebrates, interacts with the carboxyl-cytoplasmic domain of GLUT4 as part of a mechanism that slows its turnover (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O.

Overexpression of Ubc9 increases GLUT4 abundance 8-fold, probably as result of the conjugation of SUMO1 to GLUT4 and the resistance of the conjugate to degradation (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O.

As GLUT4, a small population of Daxx is conjugated to SUMO1. Microscopy studies localize Daxx to the nucleus and to punctate cytoplasmic structures identified as low density microsomes by cell fractionation studies. The binding of Daxx to GLUT4 is discussed in the framework of their demonstrated SUMOlation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have shown that the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 interacts physically with Daxx, the adaptor protein whose function has been associated with apoptosis (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 2Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A.

The co-immunoprecipitation of Daxx and GLUT4 from extracts of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4 and from 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing constitutive levels of the proteins assesses the physiological meaning of the two-hybrid interaction between Daxx and GLUT4. The small amount of Daxx/GLUT4 complexes detected in Daxx and GLUT4 immunoprecipitates suggests that the interaction implicates a small population of the proteins. This agrees with the limited colocalization of the two proteins observed in the microscopy studiesThe results of the study of Daxx in cellular fractions and by microscopy, indicate the existence of large amounts of Daxx outside the nucleus. This observation extends, therefore, recent results showing the presence of Daxx in the cytoplasm (2Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 14Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39103-39106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The punctate staining of the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes incubated with antibodies against Daxx agrees with the localization of Daxx in LDM, the cellular fraction that enriched in endosomes contains a sizable part of GLUT4 (30Czech M.P. Chawla A. Woon C.W. Buxton J. Armoni M. Tang W. Joly M. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The localization of Daxx to endosomes and the identification of endosomes carrying ligand-receptor complexes as the sites where signal transduction is often initiated (31Haraguchi K. Rodbell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1208-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) suggests that the interaction of Daxx with proteins such as Fas receptor TβRII could also occur at endosomes. The recovery of Daxx with the aqueous phase upon treatment of LDM with Triton X-114 indicates that its association with LDM membranes is peripheral, a result not unexpected since Daxx is soluble and interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of Fas receptor TβRII (1Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 2Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and GLUT4.Whereas Daxx and partly GLUT4 are localized to punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm, it is interesting that in adipocytes double-immunostained for GLUT4 and Daxx the colocalization of the two proteins is confined to a few punctate structures localized in the vicinity of the PC-GSC that stores the bulk of GLUT4. The meaning of this is not clear. While the lack of extensive overlapping between the distributions of Daxx and GLUT4 could be an artifact and reflect the masking of their C-domains (involved in their interaction and containing the epitopes recognized by the antibodies), the small amount of Daxx/GLUT4 complexes found in the GLUT4 and Daxx-immunoprecipitates is in agreement with the results of the microscopy studies. Daxx could interact quickly and reversibly with GLUT4 to regulated its trafficking as it moves through one or more intracellular compartments. The contrast between the translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane and the staying of Daxx in LDM after stimulation of adipocytes with insulin discards that Daxx moves shoulder to shoulder with GLUT4 and reaffirms that their interaction is transient and occurs intracellularly.The ability of the anti-SUMO1 antibody to immunoprecipitate the 90-kDa GLUT4 species detected in crude cell lysates confirms the previous detection of SUMO1 in anti-GLUT4 immunoprecipitates (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and assesses the SUMOlation of GLUT4. GLUT4, therefore, may belong to the group of SUMOlated proteins whose ability to bind to Daxx has been separately documented by methods that include the yeast two-hybrid-based trap, immunoprecipitations, analysis of cellular fractions, and microscopy. The interaction of Daxx with in vitro translated C-GLUT4 and with SUMO1 (21Ryu S.W. Chae S.K. Kim E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggest that Daxx may bind simultaneously to both. On the other hand, the lack of reactivity of GLUT1 with Daxx and its probable conjugation to SUMO1 (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) suggests that Daxx does not interact with all the SUMOlated proteins and that additional binding determinants are involved in the binding of Daxx. Nevertheless the demonstration of the SUMOlation of Fas (32Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar) and the interaction of this with Daxx suggests that SUMO is an important determinant in the binding of Daxx to other proteins.The immunoprecipitation of Daxx by the anti-SUMO1 antibody and the detection of SUMO1 in Daxx-immunoprecipitates indicates that Daxx is conjugated to SUMO1. Once again, the amount of Daxx immunoprecipitated by the anti-SUMO1 antibody was small. It is not clear if the low levels of SUMOlated Daxx reflects the rapid turnover of conjugated SUMO1 in the cell or the loss of conjugated SUMO during the manipulation of the cell extracts (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Daxx has been shown to be sequestered in PML bodies, the nuclear stores of SUMOlated proteins, and its release from these results in repression of specific transcription factors (27Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We do not know if the recruitment of Daxx by PML nuclear bodies requires its prior SUMOlation. The recent demonstration that SUMO inhibits the interaction between Daxx and protein targets (12Li H. Leo C. Zhu J., Wu, X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 34Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), raises the possibility that SUMOlation may regulate the interaction between Daxx and GLUT4. With regard to this, it is interesting that SUMOlated-Daxx and SUMOlated-GLUT4 are segregated in LDM and HDM, respectively. It would be interesting, therefore, to know whether the conjugation of GLUT4 to SUMO occurs in LDM and provokes its dissociation from Daxx and its rapid transfer to HDM. The coupling between SUMOlation and trafficking could explain the localization of the 79- and 100-kDa GLUT4 species in LDM and of the SUMOlated 90-kDa GLUT4 in HDM.The reported interaction of GLUT4, GLUT1, and Daxx with Ubc9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, is likely to reflect the involvement of Ubc9 in their conjugation to SUMO1. Overexpression of Ubc9, the SUMO-conjugating enzyme, has been shown to increase dramatically the levels of GLUT4 and to decrease the levels of GLUT1 (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is not known if this difference reflects their different abilities to interact with Daxx. With regard to this it would be interesting to know if the interaction of the Daxx contained in LDM blocks the targeting of GLUT4 to lysosomes in a manner regulated by SUMO.In addition to GLUT4, Daxx has been reported to interact with a broad array of proteins (28Michaelson J.S. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A 139-amino acid region from the N-end of ETS1 has been shown to contain a PLL TPSSK motif (Daxx interacting domain) conserved as P SVLL DAK in the CENP-C sequence (27Li R. Pei H. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and contained asP SLL EQEVK in C-GLUT4. It is interesting that substitution of AS for LL in C-GLUT4 inhibited the two-hybrid interaction between Daxx and GLUT4. Because the inhibition was not complete it is likely that other determinants in C-GLUT4 may mediate its interaction with Daxx.Computer-aided alignment of the human C-GLUT4 sequence and the sequences of another six Daxx-binding proteins, including H-CENP, H-ASK1, H-PML, H-ETS1, H-Pax3, and H-Fas receptor, reveals a three-block consensus within a domain of less than 73 residues (see Fig. 10). While the domain of C-GLUT4 that binds to Ubc9 has been identified (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and C-GLUT4 contains sequences that could be involved in the regulation of SUMO conjugation (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), the only putative SUMO1 acceptor sequences in the GLUT4 molecule (KXD or E, and P or G residues two to five sites upstream or downstream of the acceptor lysine) are localized to its large cytoplasmic loop (K DE KRK LE RERP).While the almost exclusive association of Daxx with cytoplasmic and nuclear mechanisms that control apoptosis may reflect the current areas of interest, it is interesting that in addition to the interaction with GLUT4 described here Daxx interacts with the centromeric protein CENP-C during interphase (7Pluta A.F. Earnshaw W.C. Goldberg I.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the interaction between CENP-C and Daxx and the recently demonstrated binding of Daxx to SUMO makes it more comprehensible that the first reported member of the SUMO family, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SMT3, was cloned in a screen for suppressors of a temperature-sensitive allele of MIF2, a gene encoding an homologue of the mammalian CENP-C (35Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). One of the most relevant findings of the recent analysis of functional protein complexes in S. cerevisiae (33Ho Y. Gruhler A. Meffbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.-L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K. Boutillier K. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3054) Google Scholar, 36Gavin A.-C. Bösche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.-M. Cruciat C.-M. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar) is that the same protein is often integrated in different complexes, a finding that suggests that the activity of a protein may depend on the protein complex in which it is incorporated.In summary, we have shown here that Daxx interacts specifically with GLUT4 both in vitro and in vivo and that both proteins are conjugated to SUMO1. SUMO1 is known to enhance protein stability and to be an address for protein targeting. While SUMO 1 enhances GLUT4 stability (5Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) it is not known if this effect is produced through the regulation of GLUT4 trafficking. The ability of GLUT4 to interact with Daxx appears to be transient. This ability extends the number of SUMO targets that interact with Daxx. The cytoplasmic domain of membrane proteins plays important roles in their transport, signal transduction, organization of protein scaffolds, and regulation of their turnover. Trafficking of GLUT4 in adipose and skeletal muscle cells is regulated by insulin and muscle contraction and is critical for the control of glucose levels in blood. Upon increase in insulin levels and muscle contraction the GLUT4 retained in intracellular stores is translocated to the plasma membrane, where it facilitates glucose transport (3James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Trafficking of GLUT4 is mediated by motifs localized to the amino and carboxyl-cytoplasmic domains of the protein, though their characterization and the identification of the factors involved in their reading is incomplete. SUMO (also called sentrin, PIC1, and GMP1), a 101-amino acid ubiquitin-like modifier protein that is highly conserved from yeast to human, appears to control protein turnover and compartmentalization (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Three members of the SUMO family have been described in vertebrates.

As part of an ongoing study, we investigated the proximal promoter regions that are highly conserved between the human and murine ABCA1 genes. Using reporter gene assays, we show here that a TATA box 24 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site is essential for promoter activity in RAW 264.7 and HepG2 cells, whereas further enhancement of transcriptional activity is mediated by the −175 bp promoter region. Gel shift assays revealed in vitro binding of Sp1 to a −91 GnC motif as well as binding of Sp1 and Sp3 to a −157 GnC promoter region. In co-transfection experiments using Drosophila S2 cells, we demonstrate that Sp3 competes with Sp1 for binding to the −157 GnC motif and acts as a repressor. On the other hand, overexpression of Sp1 increased ABCA1 mRNA expression in HeLa cells and enhanced cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux in RAW 246.7 macrophages. We also show here that the conserved E-box at position −140 binds upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2 and hepatic nuclear factor 1α and that mutagenesis of the E-box enhanced constitutive ABCA1 expression in RAW 264.7 cells, implying a role for this element in silencing ABCA1 expression. Besides the functional importance for basal gene expression, we have identified that the core promoter region (−175 to +224) is also responsible for the induction of ABCA1 by the cytokine oncostatin M, resulting in a rapid increase in ABCA1 mRNA levels in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, this oncostatin M-induced expression is not dependent on the currently known sequence motifs in the ABCA1 promoter. In conclusion, a functional complex of cis-elements within the proximal human ABCA1 promoter associated with the transcription factors Sp1/3, upstream stimulatory factors 1 and 2, and hepatic nuclear factor 1α has been characterized, which allows a subtle tissue-specific regulation of ABCA1 gene expression.

Interestingly, an alternative promoter in the first intron has been recently identified and shown to mediate liver-specific LXR/RXR-dependent ABCA1 expression in two different transgenic mouse models (17.Cavelier L.B.

LXR/RXR-responsive elements trigger retinoic acid and oxysterol-dependent activation of the ABCA1 promoter and thereby confer the observed induction of ABCA1 during lipid loading of macrophages. The most likely endogenous ligand for LXRα and LXRβ is 27-hydroxycholesterol, since CYP27-deficient cells are not able to up-regulate ABCA1 in response to sterols and since overexpression of CYP27 activates LXR/RXR (20.Fu X. Menke J.G. Chen Y. Zhou G. MacNaul K.L. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Lund E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38378-38387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Also, the earlier described LXR ligands 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol are not present in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, rendering them unlikely to be natural ligands of LXR (20.Fu X. Menke J.G. Chen Y. Zhou G. MacNaul K.L. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Lund E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38378-38387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Only little functional information is available on how constitutive and tissue-specific expression of ABCA1 is maintained. In a recent work from our group, the transcriptional repressor ZNF202 has been identified as a critical modulator of ABCA1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 gene expression (21.Porsch-Ozcurumez M. Langmann T. Heimerl S. Borsukova H. Kaminski W.E. Drobnik W. Honer C. Schumacher C. Schmitz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Following these studies and on the basis of a comparison between human and murine ABCA1 proximal promoter regions, we investigated in detail the functional properties of two conserved GnC motifs that bind the zinc finger proteins Sp1 and Sp3 within the core promoter sequence. We show that both sites are of functional relevance for constitutive ABCA1 gene expression in macrophage and liver cells. Furthermore, an E-box between the two GnC motifs acts as a silencer and binds the basic helix-loop-helix proteins upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) and USF2 and the homeodomain-type protein hepatic nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1α) in in vitrobinding assays. Our data also for the first time describe the induction of the ABCA1 promoter by oncostatin M and localize the responsive element within the −175/+229 bp core promoter region. Primers for the amplification of the putative ABCA1 promoter sequence were based on a genomic sequence provided by the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (Cambridge, MA) (accession number AC012230). The human BAC clone RP11-1M10, which contains the genomic ABCA1 5′ region, was provided by the Resource Center of the German Human Genome Project (RZPD) and served as a template for the amplification of the promoter sequence with the High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics). Reporter constructs of the ABCA1 promoter sequence were cloned by ligation of PCR fragments into the BglII and NheI restriction sites of the pGL3-basic vector. Six inserts of increasing length were obtained by PCR. A promoterless pGL3-basic vector served as negative control, whereas the pGL3-control vector, which contains the SV40 early promoter, was used as positive control. In all experiments, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of the pSV β-galactosidase vector to normalize differences in transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assay reagent containing luciferyl-CoA was added after centrifugation. Luciferase activity was determined in a LUMAT LB9501 (Berthold). The β-galactosidase enzyme assay (Promega) was used for the determination of β-galactosidase activity. Each experiment was repeated three times with two distinct plasmid preparations, and measurements were done in triplicate. The impact of transcription factor binding to consensus motifs within the core promoter region was assessed using promoter reporter constructs containing mutated binding sites or truncated constructs. Mutated inserts of the −157 GC-box and −140 E-box sites were generated using extended versions of the forward primer used for the amplification of the −175/+224 reporter construct. Reporter constructs with mutated −91 GnC, −62 DR4, or −24 TATA motifs were generated following a two-step cloning strategy. Two PCR fragments were generated that overlap at the DNA motif of interest, replacing it by either aSacI (−91 GnC) or an EcoRI restriction site. In the case of the DR4 element, mutations introduced were identical to those reported by Costet et al. (15.Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar) using a SpeI restriction site in its vicinity. Overlapping fragments were ligated after digestion with the corresponding restriction enzyme and subsequently cloned into pGL3 basic vectors. The pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 expression vectors have been kindly provided by L. Lania (Naples, Italy). Extension of the ABCA1 5′ region was achieved by RACE-PCR with commercially available fetal liver cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) ligated to adapter sequences as template. Advantage cDNA polymerase (CLONTECH) was employed for PCRs using primers derived from the published ABCA1 sequence (accession number AJ012376): A1(97)R, 5′-CATGTTGTTCATAGGGTGGGTAGC-3′; A1(69)R, 5′-CCGAACAGAGATCAGGATCAGGAA-3′. The specificity of resulting PCR products was confirmed by nested PCR using the primer A1(33)R 5′-CCAGGCCACTTCCAGTAACAGC-3′. Reverse primers A1-PX1R 5′-AAAACAGAACCGGGGAAAAA-3′, A1-PX2R 5′-GAGAACCGGCTCTGTTGGT-3′, complementary to sequences at position +151 and +112, respectively, of the ABCA1 cDNA obtained by RACE-PCR were used for primer extension analysis. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and subsequently purified with Sephadex G25 columns (Roche Diagnostics). Fibroblast total RNA (10 μg) was annealed with an excess of end-labeled primers at 58 °C for 1 h according to the instructions of the manufacturer using the Promega primer extension kit. Reverse transcription reaction was performed for 30 min at 42 °C with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Samples were analyzed on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea and audioradiographed with Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR films at −80 °C. DNA fragments were obtained by PCR (High Fidelity PCR System; Roche Diagnostics) using A1-RP1 5′-CGTGCTTTCTGCTGAGTGAC-3′ as forward primer in combination with A1-PX1R and A1-PX2R (identical to those used for primer extension assays) as reverse primers within exon 1 of the ABCA1 gene. The resulting fragments were cloned into pCRII TOPO dual promoter vector for the generation of riboprobes by in vitro transcription and sequenced. T7 RNA polymerase-mediated in vitrotranscription of the linearized construct was performed in the presence of [α-32P]CTP using the Riboprobe® Combination System-SP6/T7 (Promega). Radiolabeled transcripts were treated with DNase I and purified with Sephadex G50 columns (Roche Diagnostics). Fibroblast total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized overnight at 50 °C with the riboprobes. Finally, the samples were digested by RNase A and RNase T1 using the RNase protection kit from Roche Diagnostics according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The samples were analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and audioradiographed with Kodak BioMax MR films at −80 °C. Further, the plasmid containing the insert generated with primers A1-RP1 and A1-PX1R was sequenced with [α-35S]ATP and primer A1-PX1R using the T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer and served as sequencing ladder. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). RAW 264.7 macrophages, HepG2, Chinese hamster ovary, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biowhittaker) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Drosophila S2 cells were grown at 23 °C in Schneider medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. RAW 264.7 macrophages, HepG2, Chinese hamster ovary, and HeLa were transiently transfected co-transfected with pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 expression vectors and different ABCA1 promoter constructs using Fugene® reagent (Roche Diagnostics). 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) was used for the transfection of Drosophila S2 cells. All transfection protocols were carried out according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. For oncostatin M stimulation experiments, 24 h after transfection with ABCA1 promoter constructs increasing amounts (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 nm) of OM were added to the cells for different periods of time (2, 4, 8, and 24 h) before luciferase activity was determined. An equivalent of 40,000 cpm of double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the desired promoter sequence was incubated either with 10 μg of nuclear extract from RAW cells or 25 μg of nuclear extract from Chinese hamster ovary cells transiently transfected with pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 as described previously (22.Langmann T. Buechler C. Ries S. Schaeffler A. Aslanidis C. Schuierer M. Weiler M. Sandhoff K. de-Jong P.J. Schmitz G. J.

Supershift analysis was carried out using 1 μl of antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) against the indicated transcription factors. In competition experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 100-fold molar excess of competitor for 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. In addition, nuclear extracts were incubated with oligonucleotides containing mutated GC-box and E-box sites. A detailed description of the oligonucleotides used in EMSA analysis is shown in Fig. 5. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel and audioradiographed with Kodak BioMax MR films at −80 °C. ABCA1 mRNA expression was analyzed by a quantitative two-step RT-PCR assay established in our laboratory using the Light Cycler technology (23.Kielar D. Dietmeier W. Langmann T. Aslanidisis C. Probst M. Naruszewicz M. Schmitz G. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Total RNA from HeLa cells was isolated with Trizol reagent (Sigma). RNA concentration, purity, and integrity were assessed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 LabChip R kit (Agilent Technologies). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics) plus 10× reaction buffer, RNase inhibitor, deoxynucleotide mix (1 mm), random primer p(dN)6, MgCl2, and 1 μg of total RNA. The following program was used: 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 60 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. The FastStart DNA Master Hybridization Probes Kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used with a primer pair specific for the 205-bp ABCA1 fragment comprising base pairs 1327–1532 of the coding sequence and two hybridization probes in order to detect PCR product accumulation. For quantification, a standard curve was generated with external homologous RNA after cloning of this fragment into the pCRII TOPO dual promoter vector and in vitro transcription of the linearized construct by T7 RNA polymerase. Results were controlled for the expression of the housekeeping gene (porphobilinogene deaminase). Primers and hybridization probes for porphobilinogene deaminase were obtained from TIB Molbiol. RAW 264.7 cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of pPacSp1 or mock plasmid. Efflux assays were performed with minor modifications as recently described (5.Orso E. Broccardo C. Bottcher A. Liebisch G. Drobnik W. Kaminski W.E. Chen H.M. Chambenoit O. Götz A. Diederich W. Spruss T. Luciani M.F. Rothe G. Lackner K.J. Chimini G. Schmitz G. Nat.

Subsequently, cells were radiolabeled with 1.5 μCi/ml [14C]cholesterol and 10 μCi/ml [3H]choline and loaded with 40 μg/ml enzymatically modified LDL, which was prepared as described elsewhere (24.Bhakdi S.

Cells were incubated for 24 h in six-well plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 10 μm 20(S)-OH-cholesterol, 10 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid (Sigma). Cells were washed and chased for 17 h with either 100 μg/ml HDL3 protein or 10 μg/ml purified ApoA-I (Sigma) or medium alone. Lipids were extracted as previously described (25.Rogler G. Trumbach B. Klima B. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Lipid efflux is expressed as the ratio of counts in medium to total counts. Specific efflux was calculated by subtraction of efflux rates in the presence of ApoA-I or HDL3 from those in the absence of lipid acceptors. In order to precisely map the position of the 5′-end of exon 1, an RNase protection assay using genomic/cDNA hybrid clones encompassing 138 bp upstream of the sequence obtained by 5′-RACE-PCR (data not shown) and either 151 or 112 bp of exon 1 was employed. As depicted in Fig. 1 A, a single protected 161- or 122-bp fragment appeared, which was appropriate in size and consistent with the results obtained by 5′-RACE-PCR. This finding was further confirmed by primer extension analysis employing the same reverse primer (A1-PX1R) within exon 1 used for RNase protection assays and RNA obtained from human fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 1 B, a major transcript can be detected at a size corresponding to that obtained by an RNase protection assay. The exact position of the transcription initiation site, which also defines the ABCA1 promoter region, is indicated in Fig. 2.Figure 2Genomic sequence of 919 nucleotides preceding exon 1 of the human ABCA1 gene.

In addition to the recently described DR4 element mediating oxysterol-dependent activation of the promoter (15.Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Further upstream, two GnC motifs (position −91 (GGGGCGGGG) and position −157 (GGGGCGGGCCC)) and an E-box (position −140, CACGTG) show high homology to the corresponding region within the murine ABCA1 promoter. To investigate the location of the basal promoter apparatus required for the expression of ABCA1 in macrophages and liver cells, we performed transient transfection experiments with reporter constructs containing exon 1 and increasing portions of the ABCA1 promoter (Fig. 3). Vectors were transfected into RAW 264.7 and HepG2 cells. In both cell lines, the full-length promoter sequence resulted in a more than 100-fold induction of luciferase activity as compared with the promoterless construct. The construct containing only exon 1 (positions +12/+224) displayed no significant promoter activity. In contrast, a 24-fold increase was observed by extending the 5′-end up to position −79, which includes the TATA box. Promoter activity increased to 40–70-fold, employing the −175/+224 construct that includes an additional 187 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site. Taken together, these data implicate that the minimal sequence required for ABCA1 promoter activity in RAW 246.7 and HepG2 cells is located in the region −175/+224. Due to the high homology to the murine ABCA1 promoter sequence, we investigated in detail the impact of the −24 TATA box, the −91 and −157 GnC motifs, and the −140 E-box. As shown in Fig. 4, the exchange of the TATA box by an EcoRI site almost completely abolished promoter activity of the −79/+224 region, strongly suggesting a pivotal role of this element for basal promoter induction. Mutations introduced in the −91 GnC motif within the −175/+224 reporter construct diminished promoter activity more than 50% to a level comparable with the wild type −79/+224 region. Considering the particular location of the Sp1 binding site relative to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 2) and other reports on the interaction of Sp1 and TATA-binding protein or TAF110 (26.Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), Sp1 may play a critical role in the formation or recruitment of the transcription initiation complex at the core promoter. Thus, within the −175/+224 core promoter region, the TATA box and the −91 GnC motif are pivotal elements for the basal transcriptional activation of ABCA1. Interestingly, mutations of the −157 GnC motif and the −140 E-box both (Fig. 4) increased promoter activity up to 2-fold, suggesting that these regions function as transcriptional repressors. To identify nuclear proteins interacting with the GnC motifs and the E-box, EMSAs were performed using two probes spanning from −174 to −125 and from −114 to −65, respectively (Fig. 5 A). The interaction of fragment −174/−125, comprising an Sp1 site and an E-box, with RAW nuclear extracts resulted in four specific protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 5 B, lane 1). The specificity of binding was shown by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide, which eliminates these complexes completely (lane 7). In order to identify the protein factors that form these complexes, we used EMSA supershift experiments with antibodies specific for transcription factors that are known to be able to bind to GC- and E-boxes. No supershifted complexes were observed with antibodies against AP-2, C/EBPα, Arnt1, Max1, SREBP1, SREBP2, E2F1, c-Myc, RXRα, LXRα, HNF-3α, or HNF-4α (data not shown). In contrast, antibodies specific for Sp1 and Sp3 resulted in supershifted complexes (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). The slowest migrating complex was partially shifted by either antibody, suggesting that this band represents a doublet of unresolved Sp1 and Sp3 bands. The fastest migrating DNA-protein complex was completely shifted by anti-Sp3 antibody, thus showing binding of Sp3 alone. These results indicate that Sp1 a"

Full activation of the MAP kinases requires dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif of the activation loop by MAP kinase kinases. Interestingly, down-regulation of MAP kinase activity can be initiated by multiple Ser/Thr phosphatases, Tyr-specific phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases. This would inevitable lead to the formation of monophosphorylated MAP kinases. However, in much of the literature investigating MAP kinase signaling, there has been the implicit assumption that the monophosphorylated forms are inactive. Thus, the significance for the need of multiple phosphatases in regulating MAP kinase activity is not clear, and the biological functions of these monophosphorylated MAP kinases are currently unknown. We have prepared extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) in all phosphorylated forms and kinetically characterized them using two proteins (the myelin basic protein and Elk-1) and ATP as substrates. Our results revealed that a single phosphorylation in the activation loop of ERK2 produces an intermediate activity state. Thus, the catalytic efficiencies of the monophosphorylated ERK2/pY and ERK2/pT (ERK2 phosphorylated on Tyr-185 and Thr-183, respectively) are ∼2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the unphosphorylated ERK2 and are only 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the fully active bisphosphorylated ERK2/pTpY. This raises the possibility that the monophosphorylated ERK2s may have distinct biological rolesin vivo. Different phosphorylation states in the activation loop could be linked to graded effects on a single ERK2 function. Alternatively, they could be linked to distinct ERK2 functions.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). MAP kinase cascades are conserved in organisms ranging from yeast to human. The three best-characterized MAP kinases are the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and the p38 kinases. A typical MAP kinase cascade consists of at least three kinases, a MAP kinase, a MAP kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) that activates the MAP kinase, and a MEK kinase (MEKK) that activates the MEK. Although ERKs respond robustly to growth factors and certain hormones, c-Jun N-terminal kinases and p38 kinases react primarily to cytokines and stress stimuli. After activation, each MAP kinase phosphorylates a distinct spectrum of substrates, which include key regulatory enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear receptors, regulators of apoptosis, and many transcription factors. Such an array of substrates is consistent with the observation that MAP kinases are involved in many critical cell functions.Like many protein kinases, the activity of MAP kinases is tightly regulated by phosphorylation. However, unlike many other protein kinases, whose activation requires phosphorylation of a single residue within a structurally conserved activation loop (4.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), the MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the TXY motif of the activation loop (where X is Glu in ERKs, Pro in c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and Gly in p38 kinases) (5.Ahn N.G.

Genetic and biochemical data suggest that the phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr residues in each of the known MAP kinases is catalyzed by specific MEKs, which are dual specificity kinases (8.Seger R.

Because of its central role in signaling pathways regulating cell growth and differentiation, the prototypic member of the MAP kinase family ERK2 has been the subject of intense study. Biochemical studies have shown that phosphorylation at both sites in ERK2 is required for full kinase activity (5.Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W.

Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).The kinase activity of the monophosphorylated ERK2/pT (ERK2 phosphorylated on Thr-183) and ERK2/pY (ERK2 phosphorylated on Tyr-185) has not been accurately measured. However, it is generally believed that the singly phosphorylated forms of ERK2 have little kinase activity. Monophosphorylated ERK2s can be produced by the action of MEK1, which phosphorylates ERK2 by a two-collision, distributive mechanism (13.Burack W.R. Sturgill T.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5929-5933Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14.Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bhatt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). They can also be generated through the action of serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A (15.Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and tyrosine-specific PTP-SL (16.Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and HePTP (17.Saxena M. Williams S. Brockdorff J. Gilman J. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11693-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) on ERK2/pTpY (ERK2 phosphorylated on both Thr-183 and Tyr-185). Indeed, it has been shown that, in addition to the unphosphorylated ERK2 and the bisphosphorylated ERK2/pTpY, both ERK2/pT and ERK2/pY can be detected in living cells (18.Yao Z. Dolginov Y. Hanoch T. Yung Y. Ridner G. Lando Z. Zharhary D. Seger R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19.Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although both of the monophosphorylated ERK2s exist in the cell, it is not clear whether they have any distinct biological functions in signaling. To begin to assess the potential biological significance of differential ERK2 phosphorylation, we have prepared ERK2 in all phosphorylated forms and kinetically characterized them using two protein substrates, the myelin basic protein and Elk-1. Our results revealed that the catalytic efficiencies of ERK2/pY and ERK2/pT are ∼2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the unphosphorylated ERK2 and are only 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the fully active ERK2/pTpY. This raises the possibility that the monophosphorylated ERK2s may have distinct biological roles in vivo.RESULTSAs discussed above, the phosphorylation status of ERK2 is dependent on the balanced activities between ERK2 kinases and phosphatases. Because of the intrinsic catalytic properties of MEK1 and Ser/Thr-specific and Tyr-specific phosphatases, all forms of ERK2,i.e. unphosphorylated ERK2, monophosphorylated ERK2/pT and ERK2/pY, and bisphosphorylated ERK2/pTpY, exist in vivo. However, only the bisphosphorylated ERK2 has been characterized and shown to possess high kinase activity. Although the kinase activities of monophosphorylated ERK2s have not been accurately measured, they are assumed to be inactive and similar to that of the unphosphorylated ERK2. Do monophosphorylated ERK2s have any biological roles in the cell? To begin to address this question, it is important to biochemically characterize all forms of ERK2. In this study we have prepared sufficient quantities of ERK2, ERK2/pT, ERK2/pY, and ERK2/pTpY. This enabled us to fully characterize the kinetic properties of all forms of ERK2s using two different proteins and ATP as substrates.Preparation of ERK2, ERK2/pT, ERK2/pY, and ERK2/pTpYThe N-terminally (His)6-tagged ERK2 was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography followed by an anion exchange Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column. Similar to observations made by others (21.Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), two protein peaks corresponding to ERK2 were found in the anion exchange chromatogram. Because previous structural and biochemical studies of ERK2 were based on fractions from peak 1 (21.Zhang F. Robbins D.J. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 550-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29.Zhang F. Strand A. Robbins D. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1994; 367: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), we decided to focus on peak 1 as well. We measured the kinase activity of each fraction from peak 1, and as observed by others (22.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), found that the latter fractions displayed significantly higher activity than those eluting earlier. The higher specific activity associated with the later fractions may be a result of ERK2 autophosphorylation during its induction and expression in E. coli (30.Rossomando A.J. Wu J. Michel H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5779-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Consequently, only early fractions free of the higher kinase activity were pooled and used in this study, as was an early study (22.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).ERK2/pTpY was prepared by co-expression of the N-terminal His6-tagged ERK2 and a constitutively active MEK1 encoded on a single plasmid in E. coli and followed by purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity and Mono Q anion exchange chromatography (7.Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 23.Wilsbacher J.L. Cobb M.H. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 302: 387-400Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To prepare monophosphorylated ERK2/pT, bisphosphorylated ERK2/pTpY was treated with tyrosine-specific HePTP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The extent of Tyr(P) dephosphorylation in ERK2/pTpY by HePTP was followed by measuring the residual kinase activity in ERK2. As expected, HePTP treatment of ERK2/pTpY led to a dramatic decrease in ERK2 kinase activity. The reaction was followed until no further decrease in ERK2 kinase activity was observed to ensure complete tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fig. 1A). We showed previously by phosphoamino acid analysis that exhaustive dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY by HePTP or PP2A produced monophosphorylated ERK2/pT or ERK2/pY, respectively, (31.Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similarly, monophosphorylated ERK2/pY were prepared by treating ERK2/pTpY with the serine/threonine-specific PP2Cα (Fig. 1B), as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Physical and Biochemical Characterization of ERK2, ERK2/pT, ERK2/pY, and ERK2/pTpYTo characterize the molecular properties of various forms of ERK2, we first examined the purity of the preparations by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). In accord with previous observations, mono- and bisphosphorylated ERK2s co-migrated on SDS-PAGE and could be resolved from the unphosphorylated ERK2 due to gel mobility retardation. As shown in Fig. 2, ERK2, ERK2/pT, and ERK2/pTpY appeared to migrate as single bands (greater than 95% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE). In contrast, the ERK2/pY sample contained a minor band (less than 10%), which migrated with the same mobility as that of the unphosphorylated ERK2. Because ERK2/pY was derived from ERK2/pTpY upon PP2Cα treatment and there were no other impurities having the same gel mobility in the ERK2/pTpY sample, this result suggests that the ERK2/pTpY preparation contained less than 10% of ERK2/pT (the mono- and bisphosphorylated ERK2s cannot be resolved by SDS-PAGE because they have similar gel mobility), which when treated with PP2Cα yielded the unphosphorylated ERK2 in the ERK2/pY sample.Figure 2SDS-PAGE of ERK2, ERK2/pT, ERK2/pY, and ERK2/pTpY. Lane 1, molecular mass standards; lane 2, 1 μg of purified ERK2; lane 3, 1 μg of purified ERK2/pTpY; lane 4, 1 μg of purified ERK2/pT; lane 5, 1 μg of purified ERK2/pY.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the various forms of ERK2, we performed Western blot analyses using anti-ERK2, anti-bisphosphorylated ERK2, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 3). When probed with an anti-ERK2 antibody, all forms of ERK2 showed immunoreactivity. As expected, all phosphorylated ERK2s,i.e. ERK2/pTpY, ERK2/pT, and ERK2/pY, showed similar gel mobility, which was retarded when compared with that of ERK2, consistent with the Coomassie staining in Fig. 2. Note that a faint ERK2 band is also visible in the ERK2/pY sample (Fig. 3, upper panel), supporting the assignment of this band to unphosphorylated ERK2. In every case, treatment of the phosphorylated ERK2s by an appropriate phosphatase (i.e. ERK2/pTpY by MKP3 (an ERK2-specific dual specificity phosphatase (31.Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)), ERK2/pT by PP2Cα, and ERK2/pY by HePTP) produced unphosphorylated ERK2. When probed with an anti-bisphosphorylated ERK2 antibody, only ERK2/pTpY and ERK2/pT displayed immunoreactivity (Fig. 3, middle panel). Only after prolonged exposure can we observe a weak signal for the ERK2/pY sample (data not shown). No measurable immunoreactivity was apparent with the phosphatase-treated ERK2s, indicating that the dephosphorylation was complete. Finally, when probed with an anti-Tyr(P) antibody, only ERK2/pTpY and ERK2/pY show immunoreactivity, as expected (Fig. 3, lower panel). Because similar reactivity toward the anti-Tyr(P) antibody was observed for the ERK2/pY and ERK2/pTpY samples, the Tyr(P) levels in both samples were probably similar. Thus, the very weak reactivity of ERK2pY toward the anti-bisphosphorylated ERK2 antibody was probably due to the intrinsic property of ERK2/pY and not due to a lower Tyr(P) level in the sample. The absence of immunoreactivity in the ERK2/pT sample toward anti-Tyr(P) antibodies indicated that there were no ERK2/pTpY or ERK2/pY present in the sample.Figure 3Western blot analysis of various forms of ERK2. Approximately 10 ng of various forms of ERK2 were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane from 10% SDS-gel and probed with anti-ERK2, anti-bisphosphorylated ERK2, and anti-Tyr(P) (anti-pTyr) antibodies. The immuno-activity was detected by chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next directly and quantitatively measured the phosphorylation states of the ERK2 preparations. Two different methods were used to determine the stoichiometry of ERK2 phosphorylation. In the first, the phosphorylation level in ERK2 was determined by the amount inorganic phosphate released from ERK2 upon treatment by various phosphatases. The amount of phosphate produced was monitored continuously by a coupled enzyme procedure involving purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its chromophoric substrate, MTGuo (26.Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 27.Sergienko E.A. Srivastava D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the phosphate released from phosphorylated ERK2s was determined using the extinction coefficient of 11,200 m−1cm−1 at 360 nm and pH 7.0. As shown in Fig. 4A, the ratio of Tyr(P) (determined from HePTP treatment) to Thr(P) (determined from MKP3 treatment) in the ERK2/pTpY preparation was 0.9–1.0. Because there were no unphosphorylated ERK2 and other impurity proteins in the ERK2/pTpY sample as judged from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2), Western blot (Fig. 3), and mass spectrometric analyses (Fig. 5, see below), this result indicated that the ERK2/pTpY sample contains 10% ERK2/pT. Incubation of the monophosphorylated ERK2/pT with HePTP did not produce any inorganic phosphate, consistent with that there were no ERK2/pY in the sample, whereas stoichiometric amounts of phosphate was released from ERK2/pT upon the addition of MKP3 (Fig. 4B). The level of Tyr(P) in ERK2/pY was determined by the amount of phosphate released upon HePTP treatment, which corresponded to 90% of the protein concentration (Fig. 4C). Further treatment with MKP3 did not yield additional phosphate, indicating that there were no ERK2/pT in the sample. The rest of the 10% must be ERK2, which was derived from ERK2/pT in ERK2/pTpY upon PP2Cα treatment.Figure 4Phosphorylation stoichiometry of various phosphorylated forms of ERK2 determined by an enzyme coupled assay that measures the amount of phosphate released from ERK2 upon treatment with an appropriate phosphatase. The phosphate released from ERK2 was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 360 nm in the presence of 50 μm MTGuo, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA at 25 °C.

To calculate the theoretical mass of ERK2 encoded by the plasmid pET-His6-ERK2-MEK1(R4F), we sequenced both the 5′- and 3′-ends of the ERK2 DNA sequence. The 3′-end sequence was found to be identical to the published data (32.Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. DePinho R.A. Panayotatos N. Cobb M.H.

The 5′-end DNA sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence containing the His6 tag were determined as the following.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, the calculated mass of ERK2 based on the amino acid sequence using the average residue mass is 42297.3. The deconvoluted mass spectra obtained for the ERK2/pTpY, ERK2/pT, ERK2/pY, and ERK2 samples are shown in Fig. 5. After complete dephosphorylation of ERK2/pTpY by MKP3, the experimentally determined molecular mass of ERK2 was 42164, which is 133.3 units lower than that predicated based on the amino acid sequence. This mass difference is almost identical to the mass of methionine (131.2), suggesting that the first methionine in the N-terminal of the His6-tagged ERK2 was cleaved during protein expression in E. coli. Because the molecular mass of the -PO3H2 group is 81 Da, one would expect an increase of 81 mass units in ERK2/pT and ERK2/pY and an increase of 162 mass units in ERK2/pTpY. Table Isummarizes the molecular masses for various forms of ERK2 and the predicted and observed mass differences between them. Given the experimental errors (±5 Da), the observed masses matched perfectly with the calculated masses. Consistent with the SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and phosphorylation stoichiometry measurements with specific phosphatases, the mass spectra of ERK2 and ERK2/pT revealed only one species. In contrast, the mass spectra of ERK2/pY and ERK2/pTpY each showed, in addition to the major peak, a minor peak (∼10% of the total sample) with a mass corresponding to the loss of one phosphoryl group compared with the major peak (Fig. 5). These results provide further support to our conclusions that the ERK2/pTpY sample contained about 10% ERK2/pT and the ERK/pY sample contained about 10% ERK2.Table IThe mass of various forms of ERK2 determined by mass spectrometryMassExpected mass difference (Da)Observed mass difference (Da)ERK242,16400ERK2/pT42,2438181ERK2/pY42,2438181ERK2/pTpY42,322162158 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Properties of ERK2, ERK2/pT, ERK2/pY, and ERK2/pTpYAfter we thoroughly characterized the physical and biochemical properties of various forms of ERK2, we set out to measure their kinase as well as ATPase activities. We selected two proteins, the MBP and the transcription factor Elk-1, as ERK2 substrates. MBP is a widely used protein substrate for several protein kinases, including ERK2 (22.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Elk-1 is a physiological substrate of ERK2. When phosphorylated by ERK2, Elk-1 forms a complex with the serum response factor and binds the serum response promoter element to enhance transcription from the c-fos promoter. In this study we used the C-terminal fragment of Elk-1 (residues 307–428) fused to the C terminus of GST. The C-terminal fragment of Elk-1 (residues 307–428) contains all the ERK2 phosphorylation sites (33.Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), and GST-Elk-1-(307–428) has been shown to be an excellent substrate for ERK2 (34.Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar).The kinase activity of ERK2 in various phosphorylation states was determined by a radioisotope assay in which the rate of incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into a substrate was directly measured (see “Experimental Procedures”). All steady-state kinetic measurements were performed at pH 7.0 and 30 °C in 1 mm ATP, which is within the range of physiological ATP concentrations. As shown in Fig. 6, the phosphorylation of MBP and GST-Elk-1-(307–428) catalyzed by ERK2/pTpY obeyed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. There was no measurable32P incorporation into GST when GST alone was incubated with ERK2/pTpY and [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). Similarly, MBP and GST-Elk-1-(307–428) phosphorylation by ERK2, ERK2/pT, and ERK2/pY also followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We were able to determine the kinetic parameters, kcatand Km, for all four forms of ERK2 with both MBP (Table II) and GST-Elk-1-(307–428) (Table III) as a substrate. Thekcat and Km for the ERK2/pTpY-catalyzed MBP phosphorylation were 6.51 ± 0.43 s−1 and 10.0 ± 1.3 μm, respectively. Under the same conditions, the kcat andKm for ERK2 were 0.000728 ± 0.000010 s−1 and 22.9 ± 1.0 μm, respectively. These results were similar to those obtained from earlier studies (measured at pH 7.4 and 23 °C) in which thekcat and Km for the ERK2/pTpY (prepared by in vitro phosphorylation using a constitutive active MEK1)-catalyzed MBP phosphorylation at 1 mm ATP were found to be 6.14 ± 0.17 s−1 and 5.9 ± 0.7 μm (35.Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas the kcat andKm for the unphosphorylated ERK2 were determined to be 0.000151 ± 0.000009 s−1 and 22.4 ± 6.8 μm (22.Prowse C.N. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). With GST-Elk-1-(307–428) as a substrate, we obtained a kcat of 10.22 ± 0.54 s−1 and Km of 1.95 ± 0.20 μm for ERK2/pTpY. These compared with akcat of 1.67 ± 0.33 s−1 andKm of 1.5 ± 0.5 μm for ERK2/pTpY (purchased from New England Biolabs) with the same GST-Elk-1-(307–428) as a substrate at a 10-fold lower (100 μm) subsaturating ATP concentration (34.Jacobs D.

Lesions in the parkin gene on chromosome 6 are responsible for a large number of patients affected by early onset Parkinson's disease (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y.

The parkin gene encodes the intracellular parkin protein that consists of 465 amino acids with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and a C-terminal domain with two Ring finger motifs (2Kitada T.

Ring finger domains are present in one class of E31 ubiquitin ligases (4Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6791) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of substrate proteins is carried out by sequential reactions catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s). The E3 ubiquitin ligases function either as templates that bring the ubiquitin-bearing E2 molecules in the proximity of the substrate proteins or by directly transferring the ubiquitin moiety to the substrate protein. The target proteins, ranging from misfolded proteins to highly controlled cellular regulators of e.g. the cell cycle, become polyubiquitinated, thereby making them recognizable by the 26 S proteasomal multicatalytic protease complex. The expression of the parkin gene is enhanced during unfolded protein stress as part of the unfolded protein response, and parkin confers cytoprotection toward unfolded protein stress (6Imai Y.

This indicates that parkin performs a vital function for the survival of this particular population of nerve cells. Accordingly, pathological signaling pathways that impinge on parkin function may represent potential contributors to the neurodegeneration in sporadic Parkinson's disease.Caspases comprise a family of cysteine-proteases that regulate the process of apoptosis at several levels and exhibit an ultimate requirement for aspartic residues in the P1 position of their substrates (14Wolf B.B.

Caspase-mediated cell death is generally considered a swift process, where caspase activation is rapidly followed by cellular fragmentation and phagocytic removal (17Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6132) Google Scholar). However, transient caspase activation is compatible with cellular survival (18Reddien P.W. Cameron S. Horvitz H.R.

Goodyer C. LeBlanch A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is corroborated by the demonstration of activated caspases or their specific proteolytic products in degenerating nerve cells of brain tissue affected by Parkinson's disease (21Hartmann A.

Proteolytic cascades catalyzed by caspases may thus represent signaling pathways involved in the progression of common neurodegenerative diseases.We investigated the presence of apoptosis-associated parkin modifications and demonstrate that parkin is cleaved during apoptosis by caspase-mediated proteolysis. Asp-126 represents the major cellular parkin cleavage site in parkin-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and SH-SY5Y dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell lines as determined by site-directed mutagenesis. Proteolysis of parkin after Asp-126 will mimic the disease-causing in-frame truncation of exons 2–3 comprising amino acid residues 3–137 (3Lücking C.B. Durr A. Bonifati V. De Vaughan J. Michele G. Gasser T. Harhangi B.S. Meco G. Denefle P. Wood N.W. Agid Y. Brice A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1560-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) and is thus incompatible with a functional parkin molecule.DISCUSSIONApoptosis-associated proteolysis cleaves parkin and generates a 38-kDa C-terminal fragment as demonstrated by (i) its specific binding of polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant human parkin and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 15 C-terminal amino acid residues of human parkin and (ii) the abrogated formation of the 38-kDa fragment in the presence of peptide inhibitors of caspases. Parkin cleavage is induced by as different inducers of apoptosis as the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor OA, the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine, and the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin. This indicates that parkin cleavage is associated to apoptosis in general and not merely reflects the activation of a specific cellular signal transduction pathway. A direct involvement of caspase activity in the cleavage reaction is supported by several lines of evidence. Firstly, two peptide-based caspase inhibitors inhibit the cleavage, thereby demonstrating a caspase as being upstream of or as responsible for the cleavage. Secondly, the inhibition of cleavage by site-directed mutagenesis of Asp-126 to Glu and Ala indicates that the protease requires an aspartate in the P1 position. Thirdly, the requirement for an aspartate in the P1 position is corroborated by the efficient inhibition of the cleavage by the tetrapeptide aldehyde LHTD-CHO based on the amino acid sequence N-terminal to the putative scissile peptide bond Asp-126–Ser-127. Caspases may cleave other sites in parkin since some caspase inhibitor-sensitive proteolysis of parkin-(D126E) was observed as a smear below the uncleaved 52-kDa parkin. Asp-86–Asp-87 has been reported as a cleavage site in parkin (40Tsai Y. Fishmann P.S. Oyler G.A. Abstract of the Society for Neuroscience's 30th Annual Meeting. 2000; 2000: 4-9Google Scholar), but this site has no quantitative significance in our cellular models based on site-directed mutagenesis. The identity of the parkin cleaving caspase cannot be inferred from the potency of the inhibitors employed as they have a low cell permeability. The LHTD sequence N-terminal to the cleavage site does not conform to any of the optimal sequences for caspase cleavage sites, but may be cleaved with some efficiency by caspases 1, 2, and 9 as judged on the combinatorial approach employed by Thornberry et al. (27Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzage R.V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). The identification of the responsible caspase will have to await the development of a cell-free assay, specific cell permeable caspase inhibitors, or the use of cell lines established from caspase gene knock-out mice.Subcellular fractionation of parkin-expressing cells showed that parkin predominantly is a vesicle-associated protein as previously demonstrated (28Kubo S.I.

This localization is maintained in the apoptotic cells where the 38-kDa fragment remains vesicle-associated. This indicates that the caspase-mediated parkin cleavage occurs at or near the membranes where caspases previously have been localized (29Krebs J.S. Srinivasan A. Wong A.M. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C.

Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar).Proteolysis of parkin after Asp-126 will liberate the ubiquitin-like domain from the remaining large polypeptide containing the Ring box domain (Fig. 5). This is incompatible with a functional parkin enzyme based on several data. Clinical data demonstrate that a single missense mutation in the ubiquitin-like domain R42P or in-frame deletion of exons 2 and 3, resulting in the loss of amino acid residues 3–137, causes early onset autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism based on parkin dysfunction (3Lücking C.B.

Abstract of the Society for Neuroscience's 30th Annual Meeting. 2000; 2000: 4-9Google Scholar).Caspase activation has for several years been associated to the swift apoptotic process observed in cell culture models and certain animal models. However, increasing evidence demonstrate that activated caspases and their specific proteolytic products are present in viable neurons in brain tissue from normal-aged control brains (32Su J.H.

The caspase-positive neurons display degenerative characteristics but are viable, thus demonstrating that low-level proapoptotic caspase activity is compatible with continued survival of functionally compromised nerve cells (17Thornberry N.A.

Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This idea is corroborated by cell culture experiments where cultured neurons display strong resistance toward microinjection of active caspases as compared with cell lines that die rapidly (16Stennicke H.R. Renatus M. Meldal M. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Shimura et al. (10Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Yoshikawa M. Kitada T. Matsumine H.

However, with our current antibodies we are unable to unambiguously demonstrate a parkin cleavage product compatible with a Asp-126–Ser-127 proteolysis in extracts of substantia nigra (data not shown). The demonstration of such putative in vivo cleavage of parkin must await the generation of antibodies that specifically recognize Asp-126-cleaved parkin as previously demonstrated,e.g. amyloid precursor protein (35Xu F.G. Gervais D. Robertson G.S. Vaillancourt J.P. Zhu Y. Huang J. LeBlanc A. Smith D. Rigby M. Shearman M.S. Clarke E.E. Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).Parkin cleavage may thus contribute to a vicious circle in neurons where caspase activation, initiated by e.g. hitherto unknown causes in sporadic Parkinson's disease, compromises parkin function that subsequently lowers the cellular stress threshold and thus leads to further caspase activation. Whether the degenerating caspase-positive neurons represent a reversible state is unknown but a reversible dysfunctional degenerative state has been demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease, where inhibition of the expression of the transgene polyglutamine-containing protein was followed by improvement of the motor symptoms of the mice (38Yamamoto A. Lucas J.J. Hen R. Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar).We did not observe any cytoprotective effect of the D126E mutation as compared with wild type parkin when challenging the cells with OA, staurosporine, and camptothecin. However, this does not exclude the existence of such an effect when using another apoptotic paradigm as the protective effect of parkin previously have been demonstrated to be rather selective. Accordingly, parkin cleavage may represent a novel drug target in neuroprotective strategies against Parkinson's disease aiming at slowing the functional decline of those dopaminergic neurons that remain at the time of diagnosis. Transplantation of dopamine-producing cells represents another treatment strategy used in Parkinson's disease. Such cells are subject to a considerable stress as evidenced by the large caspase-dependent cell loss upon transplantation (39Schierle G.S. Hansson O. Leist M. Nicotera P. Widner H. Brundin P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Transgenic expression of parkin mutagenized at Asp-126 in these cells might represent an attractive method for improving the survival provided the mutation does not affect the enzymatic activity of parkin. Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and its symptoms arise primarily from a rather selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain stem (1Lang A.E. Lozano A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 1044-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Lesions in the parkin gene on chromosome 6 are responsible for a large number of patients affected by early onset Parkinson's disease (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar, 3Lücking C.B. Durr A. Bonifati V. De Vaughan J. Michele G. Gasser T. Harhangi B.S. Meco G. Denefle P. Wood N.W. Agid Y. Brice A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1560-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The parkin gene encodes the intracellular parkin protein that consists of 465 amino acids with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and a C-terminal domain with two Ring finger motifs (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar). Ring finger domains are present in one class of E31 ubiquitin ligases (4Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and parkin exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity although it is unclear whether it is a bona fide E3 ubiquitin ligase or exists as part of a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex (5Shimura H.

Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Ring finger domain mediates the binding to E2 ubiquitin conjugases (2Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4123) Google Scholar,7Zhang Y Gao J. Chung K.K.K. Huang H. Dawson V. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13559Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for the majority of intracellular protein catabolism and relies on the concerted action of two ATP-dependent enzyme systems, the ubiquitin system and the proteasome (8Hershko A Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6791) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of substrate proteins is carried out by sequential reactions catalyzed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s). The E3 ubiquitin ligases function either as templates that bring the ubiquitin-bearing E2 molecules in the proximity of the substrate proteins or by directly transferring the ubiquitin moiety to the substrate protein. The target proteins, ranging from misfolded proteins to highly controlled cellular regulators of e.g. the cell cycle, become polyubiquitinated, thereby making them recognizable by the 26 S proteasomal multicatalytic protease complex. The expression of the parkin gene is enhanced during unfolded protein stress as part of the unfolded protein response, and parkin confers cytoprotection toward unfolded protein stress (6Imai Y. Soda M. Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 9Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Several disease-causing lesions in the parkin gene result in a loss of ubiquitin ligase function (5Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y Gao J. Chung K.K.K. Huang H. Dawson V. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The loss of function elicits a preferential degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra despite parkin being widely expressed in the central nervous system (10Shimura H.

https://openalex.org/W1976402681,"<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> contains 15 class III adenylyl cyclase genes. The gene Rv1264 is predicted to be composed of two distinct protein modules. The C terminus seems to code for a catalytic domain belonging to a subfamily of adenylyl cyclase isozymes mostly found in Gram-positive bacteria. The expressed protein was shown to function as a homodimeric adenylyl cyclase (1 μmol of cAMP·mg<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup>). In analogy to the structure of the mammalian adenylyl cyclase catalyst, six amino acids were targeted by point mutations and found to be essential for catalysis. The N-terminal region represents a novel protein domain, the occurrence of which is restricted to several adenylyl cyclases present in Gram-positive bacteria. The purified full-length enzyme was 300-fold less active than the catalytic domain alone. Thus, the N-terminal domain appeared to be autoinhibitory. The N-terminal domain contains three prominent polar amino acid residues (Asp<sup>107</sup>, Arg<sup>132</sup>, and Arg<sup>191</sup>) that are invariant in all seven sequences of this domain currently available. Mutation of Asp<sup>107</sup> to Ala relaxed the inhibition and resulted in a 6-fold increase in activity of the Rv1264 holoenzyme, thus supporting the role of this domain as a potential novel regulator of adenylyl cyclase activity."

The functional aspect of this coupling has been investigated via release studies and planar lipid bilayer experiments in the presence and absence of CGA.

In healthy individuals, CGA and its peptide fragments are present in the circulatory system in low nanomolar quantities. However, in patients suffering from pheochromocytoma and other neuroendocrine tumors, concentrations are significantly higher (14Aardal S. Aardal N.P. Larsen T.H. Angeletti R.H. Stridsberg M.

We have investigated the functional aspect of this coupling via InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release studies using InsP3R-reconstituted liposomes in the presence and absence of CGA. We have further characterized the molecular basis of this phenomenon at the single channel level using planar lipid bilayer studies. In the presence of CGA the open probability and mean open time of the InsP3R channel increases significantly. Hence, modulation of InsP3R channel activity by CGA appears to be an essential component in the control of intracellular Ca2+concentration in secretory granules.

Briefly, bovine cerebella were mixed with 3 volumes of buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μmpepstatin), homogenized, and centrifuged at 2000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were re-centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to precipitate the membrane pellet, which was resuspended in buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin) containing 1% Triton X-100, stirred for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of buffer III (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μmleupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin), and applied to an InsP3R antibody-coupled immunoaffinity column (0.35 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. The protein-loaded column was washed with 20 bed volumes of this buffer, and the InsP3R was eluted by 10 ml of elution buffer (0.1m glycine, pH 2.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mNaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin). The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and mixed with an equal volume of buffer IV (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol); it was then applied to a benzamidine-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer V (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mKCl, and 3 m urea). InsP3R containing flow-through was collected and stored at −70 °C. until use. The type I InsP3receptor was solubilized in 1% CHAPS and purified from mouse cerebellum using heparin affinity and concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography as described previously (26Thrower E.C.

The purified InsP3R was then incorporated into liposomes by adding 15 μg of purified protein to 1 ml of liposome solution (consisting of phosphatidylcholine in bilayer buffer), mixing, and then incubating on ice for 10 min. InsP3R proteoliposomes were formed as described previously (25Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Some of these proteoliposomes had CGA encapsulated in them, and the remainder was used for control experiments. Ca2+ efflux from the proteoliposomes was measured by observing changes in indo-1 fluorescence. Fluorometric measurements were carried out at 35 °C using a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. Fluorescence intensity was measured at the emission wavelength of 393 nm (excitation of 355 nm) with 10 nm of excitation band slit width and 10 nm of emission band slit width. For the kinetic analysis of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, the data were acquired every 20 ms after each addition of the indicated InsP3 concentration to 0.5 ml of the proteoliposome solution. The fluorescent intensities of indo-1 were calibrated to free Ca2+ concentrations using a Ca2+-EGTA buffering system (27Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). InsP3 dose-dependent Ca2+ release was also measured by the intensity of indo-1 fluorescence after each InsP3 addition and was compared with the fluorescence intensity after the addition of Triton X-100 instead of InsP3. In these experiments, 10 μm indo-1 was used, which is a high enough concentration to buffer released Ca2+, thus precluding the possibility of Ca2+regulation of the InsP3-induced release. Planar lipid bilayers were formed by painting a solution of phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylserine (3:1; 30 mg/ml in decane) across a 100 μm aperture in a Teflon sheet bisecting a Lucite chamber. The hole was pre-painted with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (3:1) prior to membrane formation. The two compartments are defined as cis(corresponding to the cytosol) and trans (corresponding to the lumen of the ER). The cis (cystolic) compartment consisted of 250 mm HEPES, Tris, pH 7.35, 0.5 mm EGTA ([Ca2+]free = 200 nm), ATP 0.5 mm, and ruthenium red 2 μm. The trans (luminal) compartment consisted of 250 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 5.5 (as purified InsP3R was used in these experiments, the pH could be changed using 70 mm HCl), and 53 mmBa(OH)2. Single channel currents were amplified using a bilayer clamp amplifier (Warner Instruments) and recorded on digital tape. Data was filtered with an eight-pole Bessel filter to 500 Hz, digitized to 2 kHz, transferred to a personal computer, and analyzed using the pClamp 6.0 (Axon Instruments) software package. InsP3R proteoliposomes were added to the ciscompartment and mixed followed by the addition of 2 μmInsP3 to the same compartment. Upon InsP3R activation, single channel activity was recorded. CGA (1 μg) was added to the trans compartment and mixed. InsP3R single channel activity was recorded. The pH inside thetrans compartment was changed by adding Tris (final concentration 110 mm) to pH 7.5 (to dissociate CGA from InsP3R), and InsP3R single channel activity was recorded. These experiments were repeated (i) in the presence of increasing doses of InsP3 (over the range of 0.2–2 μm) to thecis compartment and (ii) at a fixed InsP3concentration of 2 μm in the presence of increasing free Ca2+ concentrations (over the range of 0.01–1 μm) to the cis compartment. Both steps i and ii were carried out in the presence and absence of 1 μg of CGA in thetrans compartment, and InsP3R single channel activity was recorded. The effect of CGA on InsP3 dose response for type I InsP3R from bovine cerebella was investigated initially using Ca2+ release studies. InsP3-induced Ca2+ release from InsP3R-reconstituted liposomes was monitored both in the presence and absence of CGA (Fig. 1). InsP3-induced Ca2+ efflux through the proteoliposomes (300 μm Ca2+ inside) was determined by the change of indo-1 fluorescence at 393 nm. The total amount of Ca2+ in the liposomes was determined by adding 1% Triton X-100, and this was the value set at 100%. Given this information, the total amount of InsP3-releasable Ca2+ was estimated to be 60%. When CGA was present inside the vesicle at pH 5.5, the pH value at which CGA associates with the InsP3R, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was significantly enhanced (see Fig. 1a). AKapp value for InsP3 of 0.2 μm was obtained. When the pH was maintained at 7.5, however, the fluorescent changes seen at each InsP3 dose more closely resembled those seen in the absence of CGA at pH 5.5 (Kapp values for InsP3 of 0.8 and 0.9 μm, respectively), further supporting the pH dependence of the InsP3R/CGA interaction. The presence of CGA at pH 5.5 markedly increased the apparent affinity of the receptor for InsP3 when compared with the Ca2+ release obtained in the absence of CGA. This result complements the effect of CGA on InsP3 binding to its receptor (25Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Even at InsP3 concentrations lower than those published previously (starting at 0.05 μm) (25Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an increase in apparent affinity for InsP3 was seen (Fig. 1b). The enhancement of Ca2+ release from InsP3R-reconstituted liposomes as a result of the pH-dependent interaction of CGA with InsP3R, illustrates a functional phenomenon associated with this coupling. To further define the actual mechanism of action, we investigated these effects at the single channel level using InsP3 R incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Under control conditions, in the absence of luminal CGA and in the presence of cytosolic free Ca2+ (300 nm) and InsP3 (2 μm), mouse InsP3R type I, single channel activity was observed (see Fig.2a, trace i). Single channel currents of ∼2 pA were seen, and the presence of a pH gradient between the trans and cis compartments (pH 5.5:pH 7.35) did not affect channel activity. Two populations of mean open times were seen with values of 0.864 ± 0.039 and 8.84 ± 0.014 ms (Fig.3a). The data set is further expanded (Fig. 3b) to emphasize the complete population of longer open times. The open probability (Po) was 4.0 ± 1.0% (S.E.) (n = 4).Figure 3Mean open times for InsP3R in the presence and absence of CGA. a, mean open times for InsP3R in the absence of CGA.

The magnitude of the single channel current remained unaltered; however, significant differences were apparent in mean open times andPo. Two populations of mean open time were evident, as before, but were greatly increased over control values (Fig. 3c). Values of 2.61 ± 0.024 and 103.5 ± 0.003 ms were obtained, illustrating an approximate 3-fold and 12-fold increase of open time in each respective population. This is displayed even more clearly when the scale from Fig. 3c is expanded to focus on the population of longer open times (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, a large increase in Po over control levels was seen with a value of 33.0 ± 8.5% (S.E.) (n = 4). By changing the pH of the trans compartment to 7.5, a condition known to cause dissociation of CGA from InsP3R, channel activity essentially reverted to control levels (Fig.2a, trace iii). The two populations of mean open time were reduced to 1.05 ± 0.014 and 7.19 ± 0.013 ms (n = 4, Fig. 3e, and compare with Fig.3a), and the Po was reduced to 3.0 ± 1.6% (S.E.), a value close to that seen for the control. The addition of heparin, an InsP3R-specific antagonist, to the cis compartment inhibited channel activity completely. A similar study was carried out using microsomes from mouse cerebellum to see whether the effects of CGA would still be seen in native tissue the same as in purified protein. These experiments were complicated by the fact that HCl was present in the transcompartment, a condition necessary for maintaining the pH at 5.5. Thus chloride channels present in the microsomes were activated, making the analysis difficult. Nonetheless, under comparable control conditions to those described for the purified receptor, the open probability was 8%; and upon addition of CGA to the transcompartment this increased to 52%. Altering the pH of thetrans compartment lowered the open probability to ∼1%. The addition of CGA to the trans compartment in the absence of InsP3R had no effect upon the bilayer itself, and CGA did not potentiate any InsP3R channel activity in the absence of cytosolic InsP3. Furthermore, the addition of 1 μg of CGA to the cis compartment in the presence of InsP3R and InsP3 did not affect channel activity. As CGA is a highly charged protein, control experiments were carried out to exclude the possibility that any charged macromolecule could be responsible for the effects observed in this study. Heparin is one such charged macromolecule and is known for its inhibitory effects on the InsP3R when exposed to the cytosolic face of the receptor, although it is not known to bind to its luminal face. The addition of 1 μg of heparin to the trans compartment (see Fig.2b) did not alter channel open probability (5% for the control compared with 4.4% in the presence of luminal heparin), indicating that CGA does have a specific modulatory effect on InsP3Rs. Single channel activity as a function of InsP3 concentration, both in the presence and absence of CGA, was characterized next (Fig.4, a and b). Over a range of InsP3 concentrations starting at 0.2 μm, the open probability was greater in the presence of CGA, with a 14-fold increase observed at 2 μmInsP3. When the pH of the trans compartment was changed to 7.5, the Po was reduced to that seen in the control experiments. The results obtained from the single channel experiments concur with those seen in the Ca2+release studies (see Fig. 1) in that, at each InsP3concentration and in the presence of CGA, a significant increase inPo is concomitant to an increased amount of released Ca2+. The Ca2+-dependence of the InsP3R was investigated in the absence and presence of CGA (Fig. 5, a and b) at a fixed InsP3 concentration of 2 μmand over a Ca2+ concentration range of 0.01–1.0 μm. As the Ca2+ concentration in thecis compartment increased successively from 0.01 to 0.3 μm, the Po increased, reaching a maximum value of 4% at 1 μm Ca2+(pCa 6) in the absence of CGA (Fig. 5b). At Ca2+ concentrations higher than 0.3 μm(pCa 6.5), no inhibition was seen (see Fig. 5b,expanded section). This lack of inhibition by free Ca2+ has been observed previously for purified receptor (28Thrower E. Lea E. Dawson A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Michikawa T. Hirota J. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Yamada M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and contrasts to the inhibition seen with microsomes (30Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Repetition of this experiment, with the addition of CGA to thetrans compartment, produced dramatic increases in channel activity (Fig. 5a). At a Ca2+ concentration of 0.01 μm (pCa 8) the Pois effectively zero in the absence of CGA, in contrast to thePo observed when CGA is present, which expressed as a percentage of total open probability is 34%. Furthermore, thePo effectively remains at this level irrespective despite increasing Ca2+ concentrations, and again no inhibition by Ca2+ is seen. The activating phase of the Ca2+ dependence seen in the absence of CGA is not apparent in its presence. The channel has reached maximal open probability at pCa 8. Thus, the lack of dependence on Ca2+ for activation in the presence of CGA and 2 μm InsP3 is clearly illustrated. Secretory granules of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells have been shown to serve as InsP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores (18Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Blondel O. Bell G.I. Seino S. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 157-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and additional evidence from goblet cells has demonstrated their direct participation in the control of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (20Nguyen T. Chin W.C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Chromogranins are Ca2+storage proteins that are found in secretory granules in millimolar concentrations (1–2 mm) (1Simon J.P. Aunis D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 32Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and CGA binds 32 mol of Ca2+/mol with a dissociation constant of 2.7 mmat pH 7.5 and 55 mol of Ca2+/mol with a dissociation constant of 4 mm at pH 5.5 (33Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the high capacity Ca2+ binding of CGA, most of the 40 mmintravesicular Ca2+ remains bound, thus yielding a total free Ca2+ concentration of ∼24 μm inside the granules (34Bulenda D. Gratzl M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7760-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As secretory granules occupy about 10% of the total cell volume (at least in bovine chromaffin cells) (32Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and have a high storage capacity for Ca2+, they may play an important role in governing intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. This hypothesis is further supported by the discovery that chromogranins A and B interact directly with type I InsP3Rs located on the secretory granule membrane (24So S.H. Yoo S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and that this coupling is functional, at least in terms of CGA (25Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The present results obtained from our bilayer studies reemphasize the functional importance of the interaction and provide the first mechanistic insight at the level of a single InsP3R. The effects of CGA on InsP3R channel activity, at the intravesicular pH of 5.5 (the pH at which the coupling occurs), are very profound. The increase in both mean open time and open probability (Fig. 3) demonstrates clearly that CGA causes the channel to open more frequently and, once open, to stay open for longer times, which when translated to the cellular level, implies a greater release of Ca2+. When the intravesicular pH is altered to 7.5, the effects of CGA are seen to dissipate almost instantly (Fig. 2, trace iii, and Fig. 3,e and f) and resemble more closely those seen at pH 5.5 in the absence of CGA. The InsP3 concentration dependence both in bilayer studies and flux studies carried out at comparable concentrations complement one another. At the single channel level the InsP3R is seen to have a greater chance of opening when CGA is present, and in the flux studies, the apparent affinity for InsP3 is greater. Again, a change in pH to 7.5 causes the effect to revert to control levels. As for Ca2+dependence, the InsP3R is already active at maximal levels when CGA and InsP3 are present even when the level of cytosolic free Ca2+ is only 10 nm (Fig. 5). The data shown in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that in the presence of coupled CGA and a sufficient concentration of InsP3 (2 μm), the characteristic effects of cytosolic Ca2+ on the InsP3R channel disappear. It appears that the conformation of the InsP3R is in such a state in the CGA-coupled condition, that high InsP3dictates the channel activity regardless of the presence of Ca2+. How do these results relate to the physiological situation? In the presence of CGA at intravesicular pH 5.5, the InsP3R is primed to respond to low levels of InsP3. Hence, when a secretory granule reaches the surface of the cell and docks with the inner surface of the plasma membrane, it is fully loaded with Ca2+ and sensitized for release. Generation of InsP3, even in small quantities, will cause a large elevation in local Ca2+ concentration (values as high as 100 μm have been seen immediately prior to exocytosis) (23Yoo S.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), initiating secretory processes. During exocytosis, the vesicle contents are exposed to the extracellular pH of 7.4, thus causing dissociation of CGA from the InsP3R resulting in altered channel properties and hence Ca2+ release. Following these events, vesicular contents dissociate from the vesicle membrane, with secretory cargo moving to the extracellular space and then into the bloodstream. The chromogranins, particularly CGA, appear to play a role in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and secretion, which also has significant implications to human disease. For example, patients suffering from pheochromocytoma and other neuroendocrine tumors have significantly higher concentrations of CGA measured in the plasma (14Aardal S. Aardal N.P. Larsen T.H. Angeletti R.H. Stridsberg M. Taupenot L. Aunis D. Helle K.B. Scand. J. Clin Lab. Invest. 1996; 56: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,15Helle K.B. Aunis D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 482: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This high plasma CGA indicates that high levels must have been stored in order to be released. Individual cells contain increased CGA, and there are more CGA-containing cells. In various cholestatic liver diseases, a striking increase is seen in the number of bile ductules (35Roskams T. De van den Oord J.J. Vos R. Desmet V.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 1019-1025PubMed Google Scholar). These reactive bile ductules differ from their normal counterparts in that they display neuroendocrine features, in particular the expression of CGA. Hence, the presence of elevated CGA can lead to abnormal Ca2+ release within these cells, thus activating specific metabolic mechanisms in the cell, which leads to unnecessary growth. The increased release of neuroendocrine substances, including CGA, may also play an autocrine or paracrine regulatory role in ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes or bile ductule growth. Thus, although the role of CGA in disease is largely attributed to extracellular CGA and its derivatives, a contribution may arise also from intragranular CGA with respect to its effects on intracellular Ca2+ release and exocytosis. In conclusion, our present work is the first electrophysiological study detailing the very important physiological phenomenon arising from the interaction between CGA, a Ca2+ storage protein, and an intracellular Ca2+ release channel, InsP3R. We have shown that there is an order of magnitude increase in the open probability and open time of the InsP3-gated Ca2+ channel. These effects of the interaction of CGA and InsP3R have implications for exocytosis and neuroendocrine cell function in disease."

These enzymes show considerable diversity in terms of substrate specificity, catalyzing the reduction of a range of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones, including sugars, steroids, and xenobiotics. Although structural information has revealed significant differences in the substrate-binding pocket, the relationships between structure and substrate specificity have not been fully determined. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues predicted to have important roles in binding of substrate and in catalysis has provided limited information on substrate specificity determinants. Recently a loop-swapping experiment, in which the three loop regions of 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C1) were replaced by those from 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, created a chimeric enzyme that was able to reduce progestins instead of androgens (15Ma H.

Carcinogenesis. 1999; 7: 1215-1223Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reports also suggest that human AKR7A2 can function as a SSA reductase in brain and may play a role in the production of γ-hydroxybutyrate (17Kelly V.P. Ireland L.S. Ellis E.M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Schaller M. Schaffhauser M. Sans N. Wermuth B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, the AKR7A2 gene appears to be frequently deleted in human tumors, suggesting a role in detoxication of aldehyde carcinogens (21Praml C. Savelyeva L. Perri P. Schwab M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5014-5018PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the potential importance of the AKR7 family and their weak sequence identity to other members of the AKR superfamily, we have determined the structure of AKR7A1 with the objective of better understanding the substrate specificity of the enzyme and hence its biological role. Recombinant AKR7A1 was overexpressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (3Ellis E.M. Judah D.J. Neal G.E. Hayes J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10350-10354Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme was exhaustively dialyzed into 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently concentrated using Centricon-10 centrifugal concentrators (Amicon, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK) to a concentration of 6 mg/ml. Dynamic light scattering experiments were performed on the enzyme (1 mg/ml concentration) using a DYNA-PRO 801 dynamic light scattering/molecular sizing instrument (Protein Solutions, Buckinghamshire, UK). These confirmed that the enzyme was monodispersed in solution with a hydrodynamic radius of 3.7 nm (estimated molecular mass of 68 kDa) consistent with the protein forming a dimer. Careful examination of the UV absorption of the sample atA260 and A280 confirmed that NADPH was present at a stoichiometry of one NADPH per polypeptide chain. The enzyme was then used in a number of in-house sparse matrix screens at 20 °C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. Crystals of AKR7A1 were grown by equilibrating a mixture of 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of precipitant solution (20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 msodium citrate, pH 5.6) against 0.8 ml of the precipitant solution. Within a day large rhombohedral-shaped crystals were formed growing to maximum dimensions of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.3 mm after 1 week. A single crystal was loop-mounted in a drop of artificial mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) glycerol and flash frozen at 100 K using an Oxford Cryostream Cryosystem. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the European Molecular Biology Laboratory BW7B beamline at the DORIS storage ring (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) with a MAR 345-mm image plate system. The data were processed with DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK (22Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). One round of auto-indexing yielded a C-centered orthorhombic space group; however, from analysis of the Rmerge statistics it became clear that the true space group was monoclinic C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 125.54 Å, b = 64.68 Å, c = 112.84 Å, and β = 91.0°. The diffraction was anisotropic with data effectively complete to 1.6 Å but only 46% complete between 1.43- and 1.38-Å resolution. Several different derivative data sets were collected, but attempts at multiple isomorphous replacement were unsuccessful due to significant anisomorphism between different native and derivative data sets. The choice of search model was not obvious as AKR7A1 is only distantly related to the other members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily, sharing less than 20% amino acid sequence identity with most other members. However, the rat voltage-dependent K+ channel β2-subunit (AKR6A2) (23Gulbis J.M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1999; 97: 943-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) shares the highest sequence identity with AKR7A1 (26%), so the 2.1-Å structure of this protein (Protein Data Bank code1EXB) (24Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) was used as the search model. Using the main chain atoms of this structure and data between 12.0- and 4.0-Å resolution a solution was obtained with AMoRe (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) (correlation coefficient 22.1 R-factor 71.1 after rigid body refinement). The solution was checked for acceptable packing in the unit cell using the graphics package SETOR (26Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Multiple runs of AMoRe were performed with various modified versions of the model to optimize the quality of the solution.

Open table in a new tab Initial electron density maps calculated from the molecular replacement solution were of marginal quality and insufficient to permit significant rebuilding of the structure. To improve these maps, density modification procedures were performed with the program DM (27Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) using solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 2-fold averaging to refine and extend the phases to 2.0-Å resolution. Refinement was carried out using the maximum-likelihood refinement program REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Vagin A.A. Dodson E. Moore M. Bailey S. Macromolecular Refinement. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1996: 93-104Google Scholar). Five percent of the data were randomly set aside as test data for calculation of Rfree (29Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). One round of unrestrained refinement using data from 8.0–1.9 Å with no bulk solvent correction was crucial to the successful refinement of the model as this reduced Rwork to 49% andRfree to 53% and increased the correlation coefficient from 42 to 60%. Cycles of tightly restrained refinement using noncrystallographic symmetry averaging further reducedRwork to 48% and Rfreeto 51%. Sixty cycles of the program ARP/WARP (30Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), adding 40 and removing 20 dummy atoms per cycle and using all data to 1.38-Å resolution reduced Rwork to 24% andRfree to 28%. The output electron density map was then used as input for automated structure building within WARP using the option warpNtrace. After 12 cycles 507 residues in 12 chains were built, which were assembled into A and B chains of AKR7A1, which were 85 and 75% complete (residues 200–250 were notably absent in both models). Manual correction of the structure and model building and addition of solvent were performed using modules within the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Five iterations of refinement and manual rebuilding with the addition of molecules of NADP+, citrate, and glycerol and with the application of individual anisotropic temperature factors in the final stages of refinement resulted in a model with the final Rwork of 15.7% and Rfree of 17.8%. The data reduction and refinement statistics for the model are summarized in TableI. The structure contains two protein subunits in the asymmetric unit, one is the apoenzyme and the other is the ternary complex (enzyme·NADP+·inhibitor), the inhibitor being the tricarboxylic acid citrate. In addition, there are 12 molecules of glycerol and 511 solvent molecules included in the final model. The quality of the refined structure was assessed using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot showed that all residues are in allowed regions with 91.8% in the most favored regions. The main chain and side chain parameters are within values expected for a 1.4-Å structure, and the overall co-ordinate error is 0.06 Å as estimated by the method of Cruickshank (32Cruickshank D.W.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The r.m.s. deviation from ideal bond lengths is 0.023 Å and from ideal bond angles is 1.9°. The average temperature factors are as follows: molecule A, 20 Å2; molecule B, 15.5 Å2; NADP+, 22 Å2; solvent and citrate, 38 Å2. One notable deviation from ideal values is residue Tyr-107 that has a 28° deviation from a planar peptide bond (ω angle) and 0.062 r.m.s. distance from planarity in side chain (in both A and B molecules). From inspection of the structure it is evident that this residue adopts a strained conformation due to packing constraints. AKR7A1 folds into an α/β-barrel with eight parallel β-strands and eight α-helices (Fig.1a). This class of fold was first identified in triosephosphate isomerase (33Banner D.W. Bloomer A.C. Petsko G.A. Philips D.C. Pogson C.I. Wilson I.A. Corran P.H. Firth A.J. Milman J.D. Offord R.E. Priddle J.D. Waley S.G. Nature. 1975; 255: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be common to many classes of enzymes including the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. The regular α/β-barrel is interrupted by two additional helices, named H1 and H2 by convention (34Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), which are located between β7 and α7 and between α8 and the C terminus, respectively. The base of the β-barrel is normally covered by two short β-strands formed by the N terminus, but in AKR7A1 these are absent. Instead the bulky R groups of Tyr-191, Arg-189 (which forms a salt bridge with Glu-135), and residues from a loop (residues 270–275) effectively close off the barrel. The first loop between β1 and α1 is similar to AKR6A2 but differs significantly from that found in other AKR structures. Helix α2 is much shorter than usual with a triple Leu-Gly repeat ending the helix and forming an extended loop structure with the leucines buried in the hydrophobic core. Residues 76–82 form a loop structure between β3 and α3 that is present in AKR6A2 but absent in all other AKR structures. In AKR7A1 residues Met-77 and Phe-78 of this loop occupy positions similar to residues Trp-81 and Pro-123 from Loop A in AKR1B1, a 23-amino acid loop that is absent in AKR7A1 and AKR6A2. Residues between β7 and helix H1 form Loop B, which is important in cofactor binding. Loop B of AKR7A1, which forms a large lid over the active site, is the longest such loop (35 residues) of any known AKRs compared with 12 residues for AKR1B1. Arg-204, Tyr-204, Pro-215, Ser-217, and Arg-218 from this loop are involved in cofactor binding and occupy the same positions as residues from the AKR6A2 structure. However, in AKR7A1 Loop B extends some 5–6 Å further over the active site, which is almost completely closed off by Phe-224. There are large differences in the position of the secondary structure of the sequence-variable C-terminal portion of AKRs, which has been shown to define substrate specificity (34Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 35Bohren K.M. Grimshaw C.E. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20965-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Barski O.A. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14276-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Helices H1 and H2 in most AKRs are 8–10 residues long but in both AKR6A2 and AKR7A1 are between 12 and 19 residues long. This has the effect of reducing the length of the C-terminal loop in these two structures to 5 residues in contrast to the 23 residues for AKR1B1. In AKR6A2, the C-terminal loop packs outside helix α6 far from the active site. However, in AKR7A1 this loop passes over helices α5 and α6 toward the active site where the terminal carboxylate is anchored in place by hydrogen bonding to the imidazole of His-113. AKR7A1 is therefore similar to other enzymatically active AKRs where the C-terminal residues play a role in the active site. Of the AKRs that have been characterized to date, almost all have been monomeric, and this has been interpreted as a feature of this superfamily of proteins. A notable exception is AKR6A2 that forms a tetramer thereby matching the 4-fold symmetry of the membrane-bound portion of the channel. AKR7A4 was the first member of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily to be shown to have a dimeric structure (17Kelly V.P. Ireland L.S. Ellis E.M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering and the crystal structure presented here show that AKR7A1 is also a dimer suggesting that this is a general feature of AKR7 enzymes. The dimer interface buries ∼2000 Å2 of solvent accessible surface area, 963 Å2contributed by the A chain and 995Å2 contributed by the B chain with residues Trp-144, Lys-155, Glu-178, and His-320 contributing to almost 50% of the buried surface area. The two monomers are related by almost perfect rotational 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 1b). The interface is rather slender (20 × 35 Å) involving almost exclusively helices α5 and α6 with eight hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge (between Lys-155 and Glu-118) per subunit. The dimer interface is distinct from the tetramer interface found in the AKR6A2 structure, which involves helices α3 and α4 and the N-terminal strands β1 and β2. More generally, several classes of TIM (triosephosphate isomerase) α/β-barrel proteins present in the SCOP data base (37Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J.P. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) form dimers, but surprisingly none seem to possess dimerization interfaces that are coincident with AKR7A1. The NADP+ cofactor binds in an extended conformation in a deep cleft as observed in other aldo-keto reductase enzymes (34Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The cofactor makes numerous contacts with protein with the nicotinamide ring being bound in the core of the α/β-barrel, the pyrophosphate group between the C-terminal edges of β-strands β7 and β8, and the adenine monophosphate moiety between helices α7, α8, and Loop B. The complex between NADP+and AKR7A1 is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and water-mediated interactions in a similar manner to other AKRs (Fig.2). NADP+ in complex with AKR7A1 is almost completely buried with only 5% (45 Å2) of the total surface area being solvent-accessible (using a 1.4-Å radius probe). The solvent-accessible fraction of NADP+includes a small portion (10 Å2) of the nicotinamide ring accessible in the active site and part of the adenine ring and single phosphate at the other extremity of the cofactor. The 2′-monophosphate of the adenine moiety forms a large number of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the protein. Although AKR7A1 can use either NADPH or NADH as a cofactor, the large number of interactions with the 2′-phosphate group, including charge interactions with Arg-18 and Arg-204, are clearly important for the recognition of NADPH and account for the 180-fold lower Km value for NADPH compared with NADH (16Ellis E.M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The dimer of AKR7A1 within the crystal contains one polypeptide with NADP+ and citrate bound, while the other polypeptide is empty suggesting the possibility of negative cooperativity between the two subunits. In solution the protein was calculated to have one NADPH per polypeptide chain. Although not ruling out communication between active sites, it suggests that the difference between the subunits is due in part to the stabilization of two different conformations by crystal packing. The presence of both apo and ternary complex within this high resolution crystal structure is, however, fortuitous as it permits a direct comparison of these two enzyme forms. Examination of the differences between the two subunits reveals there is a large hinged movement of the enzyme that in addition to movements of Loop B and helices H1 and H2 also involves those parts of the α/β-barrel most intimately involved in cofactor binding. This conformational change does not occur simply at a domain boundary but involves three regions of the enzyme moving in concert. There are therefore a number of residues that act as hinges (Fig. 3). The region from Gly-166 to Glu-178, which represents the β-turn and short 310 helix between β6 and α6, is buried between helices α7, H1, and H2. A significant source of the hinged movement is located at Tyr-191 in the middle of strand β7. This movement of ∼0.8 Å permits Phe-193 to stack against the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, positioning it correctly for 4-pro-R hydride transfer. On strand β8 there is a small (1-Å) movement around residues 284–286, which move closer to the pyrophosphate of NADP+ in part due to the hydrogen bonding of Ser-286. Further conformational changes are evident at the beginning of Loop B. The side chain of Asn-194 in the apoenzyme forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of Gly-198, while in the ternary complex it swings around 90° to hydrogen bond with the pyrophosphate portion of NADP+. This conformational change allows the amide nitrogens of Leu-196 and Gly-198 to form hydrogen bonds with the pyrophosphate of the cofactor. The R group of Asn-194, in addition to cofactor binding, also forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr-228, Arg-231, and Tyr-232 closing Loop B down over the cofactor and the active site of the enzyme. Loop B is also involved in important charged interactions with the cofactor. The side chain of Arg-204 moves over 6 Å from its position in the apoenzyme to coordinate with both the 2′-phosphate group and the AN3 of the adenine ring of NADP+. Arg-218, which is not seen in the apoenzyme, forms a main chain hydrogen bond with the 2′-phosphate group and a salt bridge to the cofactor pyrophosphate in the ternary complex. Compared with most other AKRs (34Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), the structure of AKR7A1 reveals spatial conservation of residues involved in the active site, namely Asp-40, Lys-73, Tyr-45, and His-109. Tyr-45 is considered the side chain likely to act as the proton donor during catalysis. The active sites of most AKRs form a cleft consisting of three elements: an oxyanion-binding site (Tyr-45, His-109, and the C-4N of the nicotinamide ring); certain residues from the three loops A, B, and C; and a series of amino acids that line the active site (Fig.4). The most notable feature of the active site pocket of AKR7A1 is the presence of strong positive charge, which is the result of three arginines residues, Arg-17, Arg-231, and the extreme C-terminal Arg-327, that line the active site. The active site pocket has dimensions of 11 × 11 Å and a depth of about 7Å (measured from a molecular surface using the program GRASP (38Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B"

When formed in DNA, 8-oxoG in a template directs incorporation of non-cognate dAMP as well as cognate dCMP during translesion synthesis by DNA polymerases, thereby inducing GC-to-TA transversions (8.Shibutani S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6023-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Similarly, when formed in a cellular nucleotide pool, a 2′-deoxyribonucleotide form of 8-oxoG can be incorporated opposite adenine as well as cytosine in a DNA template, inducing AT-to-CG transversions (10.Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 11.Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Mispair formation between 8-oxoG and adenine leading to mutation involves an unusualsyn-conformer of 8-oxoG that can form two hydrogen bonds between O-6 and N-7–H in 8-oxoG and N-6–H and N-1 in adenine without introducing significant distortions in DNA (13.Kouchakdjian M.

Accordingly, the molecular basis of the mechanism of 8-oxoG-induced mutagenesis has been well established. The amount of FapyG in DNA exposed to oxidizing agents is comparable to that of 8-oxoG (15.Dizdaroglu M. Nackerdien Z. Chao B.-C. Gajewski E. Rao G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 388-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16.Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M.

Med. 2000; 28: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Despite this fact, the genotoxic effect of FapyG lesions has been less clarified than that of 8-oxoG. The effects of FapyG on DNA synthesis have been previously assessed by in vitro DNA polymerase reactions and transfection studies using DNA containing a 5-N-methylated analog of FapyG (2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine (mFapyG)) (Fig. 1 B) (18.O'Connor T.R.

Pol. 1999; 46: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In these experiments, single-stranded M13mp18 DNA was methylated by dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and then treated with 0.2 m NaOH to rupture the imidazole ring of 7-methylguanine (7-MeG), thereby introducing mFapyG as a major lesion (59%) together with 1-methyladenine (21%), 3-methyladenine (6%), and others (14%) as minor lesions. When the DMS/NaOH-treated DNA template was replicated by DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (pol I Kf) or T4 DNA polymerase in vitro, DNA synthesis stalled 1 base prior to putative mFapyG sites as well as other adenine and cytosine lesions. Consistent with this, the transfection efficiency of DMS/NaOH-treated M13mp18 DNA decreased significantly relative to that of DMS-treated DNA. Interestingly, the most frequent mutation in progeny phage was observed at adenine sites (A-to-G transitions) rather than guanine sites (putative mFapyG sites). Aside from the contribution of coexisting base lesions, these results strongly suggest that mFapyG is a potentially lethal lesion due to its capacity to block DNA synthesis, but not a premutagenic lesion, although the mechanism involved is not clear. Possible mechanisms may involve (i) preferential insertion of cognate dCMP opposite mFapyG during translesion synthesis; (ii) very inefficient extension of primer termini containing mFapyG:A, mFapyG:G, and mFapyG:T pairs formed by insertion of non-cognate nucleotides; and (iii) complete arrest of DNA synthesis by mFapyG (no translesion synthesis). Recently, we developed a novel method to introduce mFapyG into DNA as a unique lesion without using DMS treatment (21.Asagoshi K. Yamada T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Monden Y. Arai T. Nishimura S. Aburatani H. Lindahl T. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4956-4964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this method, 7-MeG, a precursor of mFapyG, is site-specifically incorporated into oligonucleotides by a DNA polymerase reaction using the 2′-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate of 7-MeG as a substrate, and then 7-MeG is quantitatively converted to mFapyG by mild alkaline treatment at pH 11.4. The oligonucleotides containing site-specific mFapyG have been successfully used to quantitatively characterize the activities ofEscherichia coli formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg) and its human functional homolog (hOGG1) (21.Asagoshi K. Yamada T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Monden Y. Arai T. Nishimura S. Aburatani H. Lindahl T. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4956-4964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). More recently, we also demonstrated that endonuclease (Endo) III and Endo VIII from E. coli and a mammalian Endo III homolog (NTH1), which have been thought to be pyrimidine-specific enzymes, recognize mFapyG in a paired base-dependent manner (22.Asagoshi K.

Availability of the defined DNA containing mFapyG prompted us to further investigate the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the effect of mFapyG on DNA synthesis. We report here that mFapyG is a fairly strong but not absolute block to DNA synthesis catalyzed by pol I Kf and that dCMP is preferentially incorporated opposite mFapyG when bypassed. Moreover, the reaction parameters reveal that extension of a mFapyG:C primer terminus rather than preceding insertion of dCMP opposite mFapyG constitutes a dominant kinetic barrier to DNA synthesis. The kinetic data and the thermal stability of the duplexes containing mFapyG are further compared with those of 8-oxoG and an AP site embedded in the same site of the templates. T4 polynucleotide kinase and 7-methyl-2′-dGTP were purchased from Toyobo and Sigma, respectively. [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) and ultrapure dNTPs were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pol I Kf and pol I Kf deficient in 3′–5′ exonuclease (pol I Kf(exo−)) were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table I. The templates containing G (34G), 8-oxoG (34OG), and a tetrahydrofuran-type AP site (34AP) at the same position were synthesized by the standard phosphoramidite method and purified by 16% denaturing PAGE. Other oligonucleotides (except 34FP) were also synthesized and purified in a similar manner. The template containing mFapyG (34FP) was prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of a 7-MeG residue that was site-specifically introduced by a DNA polymerase reaction (21.Asagoshi K. Yamada T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Monden Y. Arai T. Nishimura S. Aburatani H. Lindahl T. Ide H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4956-4964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primer 11OLG was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, purified, and mixed with a 9-fold excess of 11OLGp bearing a nonradioactive 5′-phosphate group. 11OLGp was annealed to the template 44OLG (2-fold molar excess) in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 25 mm NaCl). The template-primer (44OLG-11OLGp, 125 nm) was incubated with pol I Kf (25 units) in the presence of 200 μm7-methyl-2′-dGTP and 20 μm each dATP, dCTP, and dTTP in buffer B (66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmmercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6.6 mm MgCl2; total of 200 μl) at 25 °C for 40 min. A single 7-MeG residue was incorporated immediately after the original primer terminus (i.e. opposite cytosine in the template) under these conditions. After incubation, the reaction mixture was dialyzed against alkaline buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 11.4) and 2 mm EDTA) at 25 °C for 20 h to rupture the imidazole ring, followed by 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 6 h (twice). The strand containing mFapyG (34FP) was separated from the template (44OLG) by 16% denaturing PAGE, extracted from the gel, and purified on a Waters Sep-Pak cartridge (23.Ide H. Okagami M. Murayama H. Kimura Y. Makino K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study has shown that oligonucleotides prepared in this manner contain mFapyG exclusively (96%) at the lesion site (21.Asagoshi K. Yamada T. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Monden Y. Arai T.

Open table in a new tab The reactions to assay translesion synthesis were performed under running-start conditions using templates (34FP, 34OG, 34AP, and 34G) and a32P-5′-end-labeled primer (11PRM) whose terminus was three nucleotides shorter than the lesion site. The template and primer were annealed in buffer A by briefly heating at 70 °C and cooling to room temperature. The template-primer (15 nm) was incubated with pol I Kf or pol I Kf(exo−) (both at 0.1 unit) and 4 dNTPs (50 μm each) in buffer B (5 μl) at 25 °C for 0.5–60 min. The reaction was terminated by adding gel loading buffer (0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 20 mm EDTA, and 98% formamide). Products were separated by 16% denaturing PAGE, and the radioactivity in the gel was analyzed on a Fuji BAS 2000 phosphorimage analyzer. Alternatively, the gel was autoradiographed at −80 °C. The nucleotides inserted opposite the lesions were analyzed by two methods. In the first method, a template (34FP, 34OG, or 34G) was primed by 11PRM and replicated by pol I Kf for 60 min as described above. The products were subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The SSCP analysis was performed following the reported method (24.Shibutani S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The upper phase (5 cm) of a 20% polyacrylamide gel contained 8 m urea, and the lower phase (35 cm) contained no urea (native gel). The sample was electrophoresed at 4 °C for 30 h. The applied voltage was 600 V for the initial 24 h and was then shifted to 1200 V for the remaining 6 h. 5′-End-labeled oligonucleotides (26COM-N, where N is A, G, C, or T) were electrophoresed side by side as standard markers. In the second method, a single nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion was analyzed by a primer extension assay under standing-start conditions. A template (34FP, 34OG, 34AP, or 34G) was primed by 5′-end-labeled 14PRM (15 nm as template-primer) and incubated with pol I Kf or pol I Kf(exo−) (both at 0.1 unit) and a single dNTP (100 μm) in buffer B (5 μl) at 25 °C for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding gel loading buffer, and products were analyzed by 16% denaturing PAGE. The parameters for nucleotide insertion and extension were determined by the gel fidelity assay (25.Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For the insertion parameter, a primer (5′-end-labeled 14PRM) annealed to a template (34FP, 34OG, 34AP, or 34G) was extended by pol I Kf (0.01–1.5 units) in the presence of a single dNTP (0.01–500 μm) for 5–30 min as described above (see “Analysis of Nucleotides Inserted Opposite Lesions”). Based on the results of preliminary experiments, the amount of pol I Kf, the concentration range of dNTP, and the reaction time were appropriately adjusted so that the extent of primer elongation was <30% in the actual measurement of the initial velocity. For the parameter of primer extension past the lesion, a primer (5′-end-labeled 15PRM-N, where N is A, G, C, or T) annealed to a template (34FP, 34OG, 34AP, or 34G) was extended by pol I Kf in an essentially similar manner, except that the amount of pol I Kf was 0.01–0.3 units and only dATP (complementary to template T next to the lesion) was added to the reaction mixture. The amounts of the original and extended primers were quantified by measuring the radioactivity of the corresponding bands on the Fuji BAS 2000 analyzer. The parameters (V max and K m) were evaluated from the plot of the initial velocity versus the dNTP concentration using a hyperbolic curve-fitting program. Data are the average of two independent experiments, and allV max values were standardized as nmextended primer/min/unit of pol I Kf. The melting temperature (T m) of duplexes containing a lesion was measured by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) (26.Nishigaki K. Tsubota M. Miura T. Chonan Y. Husimi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 27.Nishigaki K. Miura T. Tsubota M. Sutoh A. Amano N. Husimi Y. J. Biochem.

Duplexes (5 nm) comprising a 5′-end-labeled lesion strand (34FP, 34OG, or 34G) and a complementary strand (34COM-N, where N is A, G, C, or T) in TGGE loading buffer (0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 50% glycerol, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 0.5 mm EDTA; total of 52.5 μl) were loaded along the top of a 20% polyacrylamide gel (12 × 12 cm) containing 5 mformamide and TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mmsodium borate, and 2 mm EDTA). Formamide was included to adjust the T m in a measurable temperature range of the present TGGE setup. Using a standard vertical gel electrophoresis apparatus, the sample was briefly electrophoresed at 250 V for ∼5 min at 4 °C, allowing the sample to run onto the gel. The gel was transferred to a TGGE apparatus Thermogradient TG (TAITEC), and electrophoresis was carried out at 250 V for 3.5 h in a perpendicular TGGE mode (i.e. a temperature gradient was perpendicular to the electric field) using a linear temperature gradient between 20 and 60 °C. After electrophoresis, a digital image of the migrated radioactive DNA was acquired on the Fuji BAS 2000 analyzer. The amounts of the duplex and dissociated DNA were quantified every 0.15-mm slice (corresponding to a 0.05 °C temperature difference) along the temperature axis using the Science Lab 99 Image Gauge Version 3.4 software of the Fuji BAS 2000 analyzer. TheT m value was determined from the melting curve (a plot of the fraction of duplex DNA (Θ) versus temperature) as a midpoint where the amounts of the duplex and dissociated DNA were equal. To elucidate the effect of mFapyG on DNA synthesis, a template (34FP) containing this lesion at the defined site was primed by 11PRM and replicated by pol I Kf or pol I Kf(exo−) for up to 60 min. For comparison, similar experiments were performed using the templates containing G (34G), 8-oxoG (34OG), and an AP site (34AP) at the same site. Primer extension catalyzed by pol I Kf (Fig. 2 A) and pol I Kf(exo−) (Fig. 2 B) was strongly arrested by mFapyG (lanes 7–11), 8-oxoG (lanes 13–17), and the AP site (lanes 19–23). The primary termination site of DNA synthesis was at the mFapyG and 8-oxoG sites for both pol I Kf and pol I Kf(exo−). With the AP site, the primary site was one nucleotide prior to the lesion for pol I Kf, whereas it was one nucleotide prior to and at the lesion for pol I Kf(exo−). The arrested bands were observed after 60 min of incubation for all lesions. In contrast, primer elongation on the intact template containing G (lanes 3–5) was rather rapid, although DNA synthesis was considerably distributive. Thus, almost fully extended products were observed after 3–10 min of incubation. With the templates containing mFapyG and 8-oxoG, products resulting from translesion synthesis (bands at the top of the gel) gradually accumulated with incubation time. This was also the case for the AP site, but the products accumulated very slowly. Note that the fully extended product on the AP template (lane 23) was one nucleotide shorter than the 34AP template (34-mer). Probably, a single nucleotide deletion occurred at the AP site by the misinsertion strand slippage mechanism (31.Shibutani S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol.

In the present case, incorporation of dAMP opposite the AP site (see below) was followed by misalignment of the primer terminus to 5′-T in the template (3′-TXT-5′, whereX is the AP site) and extension of the misaligned terminus. To compare the efficiency of translesion synthesis, the amount of bypassed products was quantified and plotted against incubation time (Fig. 3). The order of the efficiency of translesion synthesis was G > 8-oxoG > mFapyG > AP site, and the efficiencies were slightly higher for pol I Kf(exo−) (Fig. 3 B) than for pol I Kf (Fig. 3 A) with all lesions.Figure 3Time courses of translesion synthesis on templates containing mFapyG , 8-oxoG , and an AP site.

The products, together with those obtained for 8-oxoG (34OG) and G (34G), were subjected to SSCP analysis, which can resolve a single nucleotide difference at the same site (34.Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8003-8011Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows the results of SSCP analysis of the bypassed products. Comparison of the gel mobility of the product formed on the mFapyG template (lane 6) with those of standard markers (lanes 1–4) revealed that dCMP was exclusively incorporated opposite mFapyG during translesion synthesis. Incorporation of other nucleotides was below the detection limit under these conditions. Consistent with previous reports (8.Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar, 9.Wood M.L. Esteve A. Morningstar M.L. Kuziemko G.M. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6023-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), both dCMP and dAMP were incorporated opposite 8-oxoG, with a preference for dCMP (lane 5). To confirm the SSCP data, the nucleotide incorporated opposite the lesion was also analyzed by a primer extension assay in the presence of a single dNTP using 14PRM as the primer. The results obtained for pol I Kf and pol I Kf(exo−) are shown in Fig. 4 (B andC, respectively). Essentially similar results were obtained for both enzymes. Stepping of the primer band (i.e. incorporation of the added nucleotide) was observed with dCTP for mFapyG (lane 9) and with dCTP and dATP (incorporation of two consecutive As due to T on the 3′-side of 8-oxoG) for 8-oxoG (lanes 14 and 12, respectively). These results agree well with those obtained by SSCP analysis. For the AP template, dAMP was most efficiently incorporated (lane 17), consistent with previously studies (36.Boiteux S. Laval J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37.Schaaper R.M. Kunkel T.A. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To elucidate the quantitative aspect of nucleotide insertion opposite mFapyG and to compare the data with those for other lesions, parameters for nucleotide insertion (V max andK m) were measured using pol I Kf. Using these data, the insertion efficiency of individual nucleotides (f ins =V max/K m) was calculated (Table II). To better understand the data in Table II, log f ins was plotted against the nucleotide inserted opposite the lesion (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 A, dCTP was the much favored nucleotide for insertion opposite mFapyG (dCTP ≫ dTTP ≈ dATP > dGTP). The -fold decrease in f ins relative to that of dCTP was 4.2 × 103 for dTTP, 1.2 × 104 for dATP, and 2.2 × 106 for dGTP. The discrimination between dCTP and other nucleotides originated from both a reduction in V max (33–790-fold) and an increase in K m (47–2900-fold) (Table II). When thef ins values of the cognate nucleotide (dCTP) for template G and mFapyG were compared, insertion opposite mFapyG was 65-fold less efficient than that opposite G (3.1 × 102 versus 2.0 × 104), showing that mFapyG constituted a moderate barrier to DNA synthesis in the insertion step. Also note that f ins of dCTP for mFapyG (3.1 × 102) was comparable to that for 8-oxo"

These studies have revealed significant differences between hRAD51 and RecA. In the presence of ATPγS, RecA forms a stable complex with ssDNA, while the hRAD51 ssDNA complex is destabilized. Conversely, in the presence of ADP and ATP, the RecA ssDNA complex is unstable, while the hRAD51 ssDNA complex is stabilized. We identified two hRAD51·ssDNA binding forms by gel shift analysis, which were distinct from a well defined RecA·ssDNA binding form. The available evidence suggests that a low molecular weight hRAD51·ssDNA binding form (hRAD51·ssDNAlow) correlates with active ADP and ATP processing. A high molecular weight hRAD51·ssDNA aggregate (hRAD51·ssDNAhigh) appears to correlate with a form that fails to process ADP and ATP. Our data are consistent with the notion that hRAD51 is unable to appropriately coordinate ssDNA binding with adenosine nucleotide processing. These observations suggest that other factors may assist hRAD51 in order to mirror RecA recombinational function."
https://openalex.org/W2076638899,"The effects of cholesterol-perturbing agents on the mobilization of calcium induced upon the stimulation of human neutrophils by chemotactic factors were tested. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and filipin did not alter the initial peak of calcium mobilization but shortened the duration of the calcium spike that followed the addition of fMet-Leu-Phe. These agents also inhibited the influx of Mn2+ induced by fMet-Leu-Phe or thapsigargin. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin and filipin completely abrogated the mobilization of calcium induced by 10−10m platelet-activating factor, which at this concentration depends to a major extent on an influx of calcium as well as the influx of calcium induced by 10−7mplatelet-activating factor. On the other hand, methyl-β-cyclodextrin and filipin enhanced the mobilization of calcium induced by ligation of FcγRIIA, an agonist that did not induce a detectable influx of calcium. Finally, methyl-β-cyclodextrin and filipin enhanced the stimulation of the profile of tyrosine phosphorylation, the activity of phospholipase D (PLD), and the production of superoxide anions induced by fMet-Leu-Phe.

The migration of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) to sites of infection or tissue injury is an essential element of their role in the first line of immune defense. It is orchestrated by the local accumulation of chemotactic factors that may be of endogenous or exogenous origin. Examples of the former include complement-derived factors (e.g. C5a), lipid-derived mediators such as leukotriene B4 and platelet-activating factor (PAF), 1The abbreviations used are: PAFplatelet-activating factorMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinPLphospholipaseSOCstore-operated calciumAMacetoxymethyl esterIns(34,5)P3, inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatefMLPformylmethionylleucylphenylalanineDRMdetergent-resistant membranesand tissue-derived chemokines (interleukin-8 (IL-8) in particular).

A role for cyclic ADP-ribose in the regulation of the influx of calcium has also been postulated (21.Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to investigate the potential involvement of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the modulation of the mobilization of calcium induced by chemotactic factors in human neutrophils. The results to be described provide evidence that agents that interfere with plasma membrane cholesterol selectively inhibit the chemoattractant-stimulated influx of calcium without altering the release of calcium from intracellular stores. These results suggest that the calcium channels activated by these agonists are either located in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains or that the mechanisms that couple intracellular store depletion to their activation are dependent on the integrity of the microdomains. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), Filipin III, thapsigargin, and fMLP were purchased from Sigma. Fura-2/AM and Fluo-3/AM were obtained from Molecular Probes. PAF was kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Borgeat (Laval University, Québec, Canada). The anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3 was purified from the ascites of mice inoculated with hybridoma HB 217 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The goat F(ab′)2 fragments directed against mouse F(ab′)2 used for cross-linking were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. F(ab′)2 fragments of antibody IV.3 were prepared essentially as described in the Pierce catalog. Venous blood was collected in isocitrate anticoagulant from healthy adult volunteers, and neutrophils were sterilely purified as previously described (22.Gaudry M. Roberge C.J. de Médicis R. Lussier A. Poubelle P.E. Naccache P.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Neutrophils at 1 × 107 cells/ml were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1.6 mm CaCl2but no magnesium. Neutrophils (1 × 107/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 10 mm MβCD, 0.5 μg/ml filipin or their solvent (Me2SO and ethanol, respectively), and with 1 μm Fura-2/AM or 1 μm Fluo-3/AM. The cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS with 1.6 mmCaCl2. Neutrophils were then kept at 37 °C and transferred to the thermostatted cuvette compartment of a spectrofluorimeter (SLM 8000C). Neutrophils were stimulated with the indicated agonists at the times indicated by the arrows in the individual figures. In the case of stimulation of FcγRIIA, the cell suspensions were incubated for 2 min with antibody IV.3 (2.5 μg/ml of F(ab′)2 fragments), and FcγRIIA was then cross-linked upon the addition of 25 μg/ml of goat F(ab′)2 fragments against mouse F(ab′)2. The fluorescence of the cells was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm for the Fura-2 probe. In the experiments where Fluo-3 was used, the wavelengths used for excitation and emission were 506 and 526 nm, respectively. The internal calcium concentrations were calculated as described by Grynkievicz et al. (23.Grynkievicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils were preincubated as described above with MβCD, filipin, or their diluents and with 1 μm Fura-2/AM. The cells were washed and resuspended in HBSS without calcium and magnesium. The wavelengths used for these experiments were 360 and 505 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. After 10 s, 200 μm MnCl2was added to the cell suspensions that were then stimulated with the indicated agonists at 75 s. Adenosine deaminase (0.1 units/ml) was added 5 min before MnCl2 in those experiments in which the effects of thapsigargin were monitored. Manganese influx is reported in arbitrary fluorescence units. Neutrophils, at 1 × 107 cells/ml, were incubated with MβCD, filipin, or their solvents as described above. The cells were washed and stimulated with fMLP (10−7m) at 37 °C for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped by transferring 100 μl of the cell suspensions to an equal volume of boiling 2× Laemmli sample buffer (1× is 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 8.5% glycerol, 2.5 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm paranitrophenylphosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.025% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 7 min. The samples were then subjected to 7.5–20% SDS-PAGE gradients and transferred to immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Immonoblotting was performed using the 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibody (final dilution 1:4000) and revealed using the ECL detection system as previously described (24.Al-Shami A. Gilbert C. Barabé F. Gaudry M. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were prelabeled with 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-phosphatidylcholine (2 μCi/107 cells) for 90 min as described previously (25.Marcil J. Harbour D. Houle M.G. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. Biochem.

Med. 1990; 172: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For the last 30 min, 10 mm MβCD were added to the cells. Neutrophils were then washed and resuspended at 8 × 106 cells/ml. Ethanol (final concentration, 1.0% v/v) was added immediately preceding the addition of fMLP (10−7mol/liter, 10 min). The incubations were stopped by adding 1.8 ml of cold chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:100:1, v/v/v) and unlabeled phosphatidylethanol (PEt) as a standard. The lipids were extracted, dried under nitrogen, and spotted on prewashed silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) plates. PEt was separated from the other lipids with the solvent mixture chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:2, v/v/v). Lipids were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and the different lipid classes were scraped off the plates. Radioactivity in PEt was monitored by liquid scintillation counting, and the results were corrected for background radioactivity and quenching. Superoxide production was measured using the reduction of cytochrome c as previously described (28.Naccache P.H. Gilbert C. Caon A.C. Gaudry M. Huang C.K. Bonak V.A. Umezawa K. McColl S.R. Blood. 1990; 76: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were resuspended at 106 cells/ml with 130 μm cytochrome c and stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with fMet-Leu-Phe. The tubes were then transferred to an ice bucket for 15 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 ×g. The optical density of the supernatants was read at 540 and 550 nm, and the amounts of superoxide produced were calculated from the differences between the optical readings at 550 nm and those at 540 nm using an extinction coefficient of 21.1. As previously reported (6.White J.R. Naccache P.H. Molski T.F.P. Borgeat P. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) the addition of 10−7m fMet-Leu-Phe to a suspension of human neutrophils led to increases in the concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium as monitored using the fluorescent calcium probe Fura-2 (Fig. 1). This increase was rapid and transient with levels of cytosolic free calcium returning to near basal values by 2–3 min poststimulation. Pretreating the cells with 10 mm MβCD, a cholesterol-binding agent, had little effect on the peak of calcium mobilization induced by fMet-Leu-Phe. In contrast, it significantly reduced the duration of the calcium spike affecting mostly the maintenance of the elevated calcium levels (Fig. 1A). The concentrations of MβCD used were similar to those that had previously been characterized in other cell types as effective in reducing plasma membrane cholesterol levels with minimal overall cell damage (29.Kilsdonk E.P.

MβCD did not affect cell viability under the experimental conditions used as evidenced by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown), the maintenance of normal levels of resting cytoplasmic calcium, and the ability to respond to fMet-Leu-Phe (initial phase of calcium mobilization, superoxide production, activation of PLD, tyrosine phosphorylation (see Fig. 7)). A second agent affecting cholesterol-rich membranes, the cholesterol-sequestering antibiotic (33.Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 34.Norman A.W. Demel R.A. de Kruyff B. van Deenen L.L. J. Biol.

The results shown in Fig. 1B indicate that filipin had no effect on the early peak of cytoplasmic free calcium induced by fMet-Leu-Phe, but it reduced the duration of the maintenance of the elevation of cytoplasmic free calcium much as MβCD did (Fig. 1A).Figure 7Effect of MβCD on various responses of human neutrophils to fMet-Leu-Phe. The ability of fMet-Leu-Phe to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation (panel A) activity of PLD (panel B) and the production of superoxide anions (panel C) in cells preincubated, or not, with MβCD was monitored. The procedures are detailed under “Materials and Methods.” Asterisk, statistically different from the values of the fMet-Leu-Phe samples (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon matched pairs test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The modifications to the shape of the calcium spike brought about by pretreatment with MβCD and filipin suggested that these compounds were acting principally on the influx of calcium that follows the depletion of intracellular calcium stores induced upon activation of chemotactic factor receptors. Two sets of experiments were carried out to test this hypothesis as directly as possible. First, calcium influx was monitored by following the quenching of intracellular Fura-2 that results from the entry of Mn2+through the calcium channels (35.Bianchini L. Todderud G. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Sage S.O. Pintando E. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Merritt J.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 915-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results of these studies are illustrated in Fig. 2. As expected, the addition of fMet-Leu-Phe to a suspension of neutrophils loaded with Fura-2 increased within about 30 s, the rate of quenching of the calcium probe. This effect is a reflection of the increased plasma membrane permeability to divalent cations (increased calcium influx). Of particular relevance to the present study is the practically complete inhibition of the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced increased rate of quenching of Fura-2 that is observed following pretreatment with MβCD (panel A) and filipin (panel B), effects that are indicative of an inhibition of the opening of the calcium channels. Second, the mobilization of calcium induced by fMet-Leu-Phe was monitored immediately following chelation of extracellular calcium by EGTA. Under those conditions of low extracellular calcium most if not all of the increases in the levels of cytosolic free calcium can be assumed to be derived from the emptying of the intracellular stores of calcium. As shown in Fig. 3 the addition of 2 mm EGTA to the cells prior to stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe significantly reduced the maintenance of the elevated calcium levels without significantly affecting the initial peak of mobilization of calcium. These modifications in the pattern of cytoplasmic free calcium mobilization induced by the addition of EGTA are similar to those induced by MβCD. It is also important to point out that adding EGTA to MβCD-treated cells was without any significant additional effect on the mobilization of calcium induced by fMet-Leu-Phe (compare the MβCD tracing to that of MβCD+EGTA). Having observed that the influx of calcium induced by fMet-Leu-Phe was inhibited in MβCD-treated cells, we next examined the effects of this agent on neutrophil agonists that either were very dependent on an influx of calcium or, alternatively, did not rely to a significant extent on this response. Previous studies provide evidence that the mobilization of calcium induced by low concentrations of the lipid mediator PAF differs from that stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe in that it was nearly completely dependent on an influx of calcium from the extracellular medium (37.Naccache P.H. Molski T.F.P. Volpi M. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,38.Naccache P.H. Molski M.M. Volpi M. Shewfcyk J. Molski T.F.P. Loew L. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1986; 40: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were therefore pretreated with MβCD, loaded with Fura-2, and treated with 10−10m PAF. As shown in Fig. 4A, PAF at this concentration was still able to significantly increase the level of cytoplasmic free calcium. MβCD completely inhibited the mobilization of calcium induced by 10−10m PAF. The data inpanel B show that the influx of calcium induced by 10−10m PAF was completely inhibited by MβCD. At higher concentrations the mobilization of calcium induced by PAF closely resembles that of other chemoattractants, i.e. an immediate spike due to a release of intracellular calcium followed by a wave of calcium derived from the extracellular medium. MβCD treatment inhibited the second phase of calcium mobilization induced by 10−7m PAF (Fig. 4C) much as it had that induced by fMet-Leu-Phe (Fig. 1). The influx of calcium induced by 10−7m PAF was inhibited by MβCD (panel D) as was observed at low concentrations of PAF (panel B). The mobilization of calcium induced by the FcγIIA in contrast to that induced by chemotactic factors (e.g. Fig. 1) is not coupled to an influx of calcium and relies to a much larger extent on the recruitment of calcium from intracellular stores. Cross-linking of FcγRIIA induced a rapid and transient mobilization of calcium (Fig. 5, panel A) that was not inhibited by MβCD. The extent of the mobilization of calcium induced by ligation of FcγRIIA was relatively unaffected by the addition of EGTA (data not shown), and no evidence for increased Mn2+-dependent quenching of Fura-2 was obtained (Fig. 6B) indicating that most if not all of the calcium was derived from intracellular stores. It should be noted that these experiments did not address the question of the nature of the calcium stores called upon by these receptors and their relationship to those mobilized by chemotactic factors.Figure 6Effect of MβCD and filipin on the influx of Mn2+ induced by thapsigargin.The incubation conditions with MβCD and filipin were as in Fig. 1. Thapsigargin was added at the time indicated by the dotted arrow. The results are from a single experiment, representative of duplicate determinations on cells from three or more donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One of the strongest pieces of evidence for the presence of store-operated calcium (SOC) channels in cells is provided by the ability of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin to stimulate an influx of Mn2+subsequent to the depletion of intracellular calcium stores (39.Foder B. Scharff O. Thastrup O. Cell Calcium. 1989; 10: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40.Wenzel-Seifert K. Krautwurst D. Musgrave I. Seifert R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 this effect is readily detectable in neutrophils as evidenced by the increased rate of Mn2+-dependent quenching of Fura-2 following the addition of thapsigargin. Pretreatment with MβCD or filipin nearly abolished the stimulation of the influx of Mn2+induced by thapsigargin. The effects of MβCD on other neutrophil responses to fMet-Leu-Phe were tested next. As shown in Fig. 7A, MβCD enhanced the stimulation of the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation elicited by the chemotactic factor at all time points tested, and this effect was also observed with the cholesterol-sequestering agent filipin (data not shown). The enhancing effects of MβCD and filipin on the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were not reproduced by inhibiting the influx of calcium with EGTA (data not shown) indicating that the former did not result from the inhibition of the entry of calcium per se. Increases in the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation were also observed in MβCD-treated cells stimulated with 10−7m PAF (data not shown). MβCD had a similar stimulatory effect on the enhancement of the activity of phospholipase D (Fig. 7B) and the activation of the oxidative burst (Fig. 7C) induced by fMet-Leu-Phe. The results of the present investigation provide evidence for a role for cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the link between the emptying of intracellular calcium stores and the opening of the calcium channels as stimulated by G protein-coupled receptors in human neutrophils. The cholesterol-modifying depleting agents MβCD and filipin inhibited the stimulation of the influx of calcium induced by fMet-Leu-Phe and PAF. The receptors of these chemoattractants belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (4.Gerard C. Gerard N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 6: 140-145Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). They are thought to share many of the steps leading to the mobilization of calcium including reliance on the same intracellular stores of calcium and, although this had not been directly established, the same mechanisms of coupling to the plasma membrane calcium channels or SOCs (capacitative calcium entry). The common sensitivity of the calcium influx stimulated by these agonists to inhibition by MβCD and filipin is consistent with this view. Several lines of evidence indicate that the effects of MβCD and filipin are not due to a general deleterious effect on cell viability. First, no differences in trypan blue exclusion were noted between treated and untreated cells under the conditions reported here (data not shown). Second, neither agent significantly altered the resting levels of cytoplasmic calcium, a sensitive indicator of cell integrity. Third, the initial mobilization of calcium induced by fMet-Leu-Phe was not affected by these agents indicating that the steps leading to the Ins(3,4,5)P3-mediated release of calcium, including the integrity of the calcium stores, were intact. Fourth, the effects of MβCD and of filipin were limited to interference with the mobilization of calcium as several neutrophil responses (tyrosine phosphorylation, O2−generation, activation of PLD) were not inhibited but in fact were enhanced. Finally, the mobilization of calcium induced by the cross-linking of FcγRIIA was also enhanced. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence for a selective and nontoxic effect of cholesterol-modulating agents on the responses of human neutrophils to the activation of chemotactic factor receptors under the experimental conditions tested here. The effects of MβCD and filipin resided primarily at the level of the activation of the SOCs. Evidence for this conclusion comes most specifically from the following: (i) the lack of effect on the magnitude of the initial spike of calcium mobilization, an indicator of calcium release from intracellular stores, (ii) the lack of effect of MβCD on the mobilization of calcium observed in the absence of extracellular calcium, and (iii) the inhibition of the uptake of Mn2+, a classic index of inward-directed calcium permeability, and in particular following the addition of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. It is consistent with the sensitivity of the mobilization of calcium induced by low concentrations of PAF to MβCD, concentrations at which the lipid mediator relies to a major extent on increases in plasma membrane permeability to calcium and only marginally on release from intracellular stores (37.Naccache P.H. Molski T.F.P. Volpi M. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38.Naccache P.H. Molski M.M. Volpi M. Shewfcyk J. Molski T.F.P. Loew L. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1986; 40: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, the relative resistance of the calcium mobilization induced by ligation of FcγRIIA to the cholesterol-perturbing agents also supports this conclusion as the activation of the latter receptor does not appear to be tightly coupled to increases in calcium influx. This may be related to the possible utilization of different pools of intracellular calcium by chemotactic factor and opsonin receptors (42.Davies E.V. Hallett M.B. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 1: 485-490PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the present results differ from the previously described interference with calcium signaling through the Fc receptor in RBL cells by cholesterol-depleting agents (43.Yamashita T. Yamaguchi T. Murakami K. Nagasawa S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicating that the DRM dependence of the various Fc receptors vary as a function of cell or receptor type. In addition, they are unlikely to be explained by direct interference with the partitioning of G protein subunits in DRMs such as has been described for Gq/11 (44.Li S.W. Okamoto T. Chun M.Y. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), because this would have resulted in the inhibition of all responses to fMet-Leu-Phe and PAF. On the other hand, they are consistent with the results of Petrie et al. (31.Petrie R.J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Patel K.D. AwasthiKalia M. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) who observed that although cholesterol sequestration disrupted lipid rafts in B cells and prevented B cell receptor (BCR) redistribution, it did not inhibit tyrosine kinase activation or phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase. The effects of MβCD and filipin on the calcium response to cross-linking of FcγRIIA also resemble those of Petrie et al. (31.Petrie R.J. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Patel K.D. AwasthiKalia M. Deans J.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1220-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) who observed that raft disruption enhanced the release of calcium from intracellular stores following BCR stimulation. The results presented are consistent with the interpretation that the link between the emptying of the Ins(3,4,5)P3-sensitive stores and subsequent opening of plasma membrane calcium (capacitative calcium entry) is dependent on the integrity of the plasma membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol. These are known by various names including detergent insoluble glycolipid enriched membrane fractions (DIGs), DRMs, and lipid rafts, a multiplicity that may reflect subpopulations of these microdomains (45.Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar) that are thought to act as hubs of concentration of signaling molecules. Their involvement in the regulation of calcium channels in human neutrophils is to the best of our knowledge undocumented. However, these results are consistent with the recent identification of hTrp1, a putative component of SOCs, in the low density fraction of Triton X-100-extracted human submandibular gland cell membranes (20.Lockwich T. Liu X. Singh B. Jadlowiec J. Weiland S. Ambbudkar I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11934-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), which is an empirical definition of DRMs. It should be noted however, that the present data do not allow us to distinguish between the possibilities that SOCs are themselves located within the cholesterol-rich microdomains or whether a necessary intermediary step between the emptying of the intracellular calcium stores and the opening of the calcium channels depends on the integrity of these microdomains. The very recent observations that the calcium influx induced by fMet-Leu-Phe was inhibited in CD38−neutrophils (46.Partida-Sanchez S. Cockayne D.A. Monard S. Jacobson E.L. Oppenheimer N. Garvy B. Kusser K. Goodrich S. Howard M. Harmsen A. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and that CD38 was associated with lipid rafts in T lymphocytes (47.Zubiaur M. Fernandez O. Ferrero E. Salmeron J. Malissen B. Malavasi F. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 31: 31Google Scholar) raise the intriguing possibility of a relationship between CD38 and our results. Finally, although this study focused on the effects of cholesterol-perturbing agents on the mobilization of calcium, it also uncovered an unexpected up-regulation of several neutrophil responses upon the addition of either MβCD or filipin. The three responses examined, tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of PLD, and production of superoxide anions are experimentally independent but may be causally related. Indeed, the activation of PLD is thought to be controlled by one or more tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent steps (48.Bourgoin S. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11908-11916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several lines of investigation indicate that the production of superoxide anions lies downstream from the activation of PLD (49.Dewald B. Thelen M. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16179-16184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that the enhancements of the stimulation of the activity of PLD (several isozymes of which have been localized to DRMs, Refs. 41.Czarny M. Fiucci G. Lavie Y. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Liscovitch M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 50.Kim Y. Kim J.E. Lee S.D. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park J.B. Han J.M. Jang S.K. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Bba. Mol.

A corollary of this interpretation is that components of cholesterol-rich microdomains (tyrosine phosphatases?) may act to limit the extent of the activation of human neutrophils by chemotactic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2312955998,"We have used serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to investigate the influence of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene on global gene expression profiles. SAGE libraries were prepared from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lines that either lack (parental) or express wild-type VHL (wtVHL). Comparison of these libraries revealed some differentially expressed genes (Glut-1, for example) that were known to be influenced by VHL, but the majority of genes had not previously been reported to be affected by the cell's VHL status. The identification of several genes involved in TNFalpha-mediated events prompted us to compare the sensitivity of cells with different VHL status in TNFalpha cytotoxicity assays. Strikingly, VHL-deficient cells were much more resistant to the toxic influence of TNFalpha. We propose that VHL-dependent sensitization of RCC cells to TNFalpha-mediated killing may contribute to VHL's growth suppressive function."

This site overlaps the binding site for an activity that we identified as the ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factor (USF) (Ribeiro, A., Pastier, D., Kardassis, D., Chambaz, J., and Cardot, P. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 1216–1225). In the present study, we characterized the relationship between USF and HNF-4 in the activation of human apoC-III transcription. Although USF and HNF-4 binding to element B is mutually exclusive, co-transfection experiments in HepG2 cells surprisingly showed a combined effect of USF and HNF-4 in the transactivation of the (−890/+24) apoC-III promoter. This effect only requires the proximal region (−99/+24) of the apoC-III promoter and depends neither on USF binding to its cognate site in element B nor on a USF-dependent facilitation of HNF-4 binding to its site. By contrast, we found by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and footprinting analysis two USF low affinity binding sites, located within the proximal promoter at positions −58/−31 (element II) and −19/−4 (element I), which are homologous to initiator-like element sequence. Co-transfection experiments in HepG2 cells show that a mutation in element II reduces 2-fold the USF transactivation effect on the proximal promoter of apoC-III and that a mutation in element I inhibits the combined effect of USF and HNF-4. In conclusion, these initiator-like elements are directly involved in the transactivation of the apoC-III promoter by USF and are necessary to the combined effect between USF and HNF-4 for the apoC-III transcription.

For example, in humans, apoA-I is equally expressed in the liver and intestine, apoA-IV is expressed mainly in the intestine, and apoC-III is expressed predominantly in the liver (1.Zannis V.I.

Numerous studies have focused on regulatory mechanisms that control liver-specific expression. Liver-specific gene expression relies on four families of transcription factors that are liver-enriched but not restricted to this tissue: hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-1, HNF-3, and HNF-4 and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) (for review, see Ref. 2.Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar).

Lacotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V.I. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proximal promoters of apoA-I, apoC-III, and apoA-IV genes exhibit, as a common feature, an hormone-responsive element that binds transcriptional factors of the nuclear receptor family, and they are transactivated by HNF-4, a member of this family (for review, see Ref. 3.Kardassis D. Lacotripe M. Talianidis I. Zannis V.I. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 980-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HNF-4 used to be assigned to the orphan receptor family until fatty acyl-CoA thioesters were identified as its ligands (4.Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), a finding of considerable interest in view of the critical role that HNF-4 plays in the expression of genes involved in major metabolic pathways. Furthermore, mutations in HNF-4 gene have been directly associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young (5.Yamagata K. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Furuta H. Vaxillaire M. Southam L. Cox R.D. Lathrop G.M. Boriraj V.V. Chen X. Cox N.J. Oda Y. Yano H. LeBeau M.M. Yamada S. Nishigori H. Takeda J. Fajans S.S. Hattersley A.T. Iwasaki N. Hansen T. Pedersen O. Polonski K.S. Bell G.I. Nature. 1996; 384: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). HNF-4 is primarily expressed in the liver, gut, kidney, and pancreas (6.Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. 11. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 207-223Google Scholar) and also plays an essential role in embryonic development (7.Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2466-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Adult human and rat liver and kidney contain two main isoforms of HNF-4, generated by differential splicing (9.Hata S. Inoue T. Kosuga K. Nakashima T. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The longest isoform, HNF-4α2, is the predominant species in liver and kidney, whereas the shortest isoform, HNF-4α1, represents only a minor species (10.Chartier F.L. Bossu J.P. Laudet V. Fruchart J.C. Laine B. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,11.Hata S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ApoC-III transcription involves both HNF-4 and ubiquitous factors. For instance, multiple SP1-binding sites on the distal apoC-III enhancer allow communication with HNF-4 bound to the proximal promoter of apoC-III (12.Talianidis I. Tambakaki A. Toursounova J. Zannis V.I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10298-10309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The binding site of HNF-4 in element B overlaps the binding site of an activity designated CIIIB1 (13.Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized that CIIIB1 could modulate the HNF-4 effect on apoC-III promoter (14.Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the CIIIB1 activity corresponds to the ubiquitously expressed upstream stimulatory factor (USF), which plays a major role in apoA-II transcription (15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The CIIIB1 binding site GTCACCTG contains the CANNTG consensus E-box motif (16.Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G.

USF belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor family, which contains a basic DNA-binding domain and two contiguous dimerization domains: a helix-loop-helix and a leucine zipper. This group includes a wide variety of transcription factors, such as c-Myc, Max (18.Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), TFE3 (19.Beckman H. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), TFEB (20.Carr C.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and SREBP1 (21.Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.-D. Shih H.-M. Ellenberger T. Twole H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). USF appears to be the predominant basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper factor in liver nuclear extracts (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Three USF isoforms, 1, 2a, and 2b, with apparent molecular masses of 43, 44, and 38 kDa, respectively, have been described (23.Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Sirito M. Lin Q. Marity T. Sawadogo M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1405-1415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). USF1 and USF2a and 2b are encoded by two different genes, with USF2a and 2b being generated by differential splicing. The involvement of two identical factors, HNF-4 and USF, in the transcription of the two liver-expressed genes apoA-II and apoC-III led us to question the relationships between USF and HNF-4 in different promoter contexts. We have previously reported that USF and HNF-4 synergistically transactivate the apoA-II promoter and cooperatively bind to their distal and adjacent cognate sites (15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, HNF-4per se is not able to transactivate the apoA-II promoter, in contrast with apoC-III promoter. In the present study, we found a combined effect of USF and HNF-4 in the transactivation of the human (−890/+24) apoC-III promoter but through a different mechanism from that of the apoA-II promoter. The mutation of the USF binding site in element B does not inhibit this effect, and there is no cooperative binding of USF and HNF-4 to this element. We found that USF binds on two other sites in the proximal promoter that are homologous to an “initiator-like” sequence. Mutagenesis of these elements showed that they account for the combined effect between USF and HNF-4 in the apoC-III transcription.

The −890/+24 CIII plasmid, containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the −890/+24 human apoC-III promoter, has already been described, as have the −890/+24 CIIIBM1 and −890/+24 CIIIBM5 plasmids with mutations M1 and M5 in element B (13.Ogami K.

The −99/+24 CIII plasmid contains the CAT gene under the control of the −99/+24 human apoC-III promoter and has also been described (13.Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J.

Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested byHindIII and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated to the annealed oligonucleotides 3c and 3nc and oligonucleotides 4c and 4nc. Similarly, the digested pUC-SH-CAT plasmid was ligated to the annealed oligonucleotides 2c and 2nc and oligonucleotides 4c and 4nc to generate the −99/+24 CIIIBM1IIm, to the annealed oligonucleotides 3c and 3nc and oligonucleotides 6c and 6nc to generate the −99/+24 CIIIBM1Im, and finally to the annealed oligonucleotides 2c and 2nc and oligonucleotides 6c and 6nc to generate the −99/+24 CIIIBM1IImIm. These plasmids were sequenced. The various CAT gene reporter plasmids were co-transfected with the plasmid Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase in HepG2 cells and COS-1 cells using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method (27.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was determined so as to normalize the variability in transfection efficiency (28.Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed in a liquid phase, as previously described (29.Desbois C.

The initial velocity of the enzymatic reaction was estimated by measuring the amount of labeled acetylchloramphenicol that diffused directly into the liquid phase in the scintillation counting vial. cDNAs encoding USF2a and TDU2 (USF2a, which lacks the NH2-terminal activation domain), subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV, were prepared in the INSERM U129 laboratory and were kindly provided by Michel Raymondjean (25.Viollet B.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant USF1 was prepared in the INSERM U129 laboratory and was kindly provided by Benoit Viollet (25.Viollet B.

It has been reported that HNF-4 and the CIIIB1 activity that we recently identified as USF (15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) had overlapping binding sites on element B of the apoC-III promoter (Fig. 1 A, lower panel) (14.Ladias J.A.A. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kardassis D. Cardot P. Cheng J. Zannis V.I. Cladaras C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15849-15860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An EMSA with the CIIIB probe (Fig. 1 A, upper panel) shows that no slower complex is obtained with USF2a and HNF-4 translated separately (lane 3) or co-translated (lane 4) than with only USF2a (lane 2) or with only HNF-4 (lane 1). Therefore the binding of USF2a and HNF-4 to the CIIIB probe is mutually exclusive. To study the combined effect of HNF-4 and USF, co-transfection experiments in HepG2 cells were performed with the CAT reporter gene under the control of the −890/+24 human apoC-III promoter and vectors expressing USF2a and HNF-4α isoforms. This analysis shows (Fig. 1 B) that USF2a is able to transactivate 2-fold the −890/+24 apoC-III promoter as compared with the 6-fold increase induced by HNF-4. More strikingly, however, when they were added simultaneously, USF2a and HNF-4 produced a 11-fold increase in apoC-III promoter activity. The specificity of this effect was confirmed by co-transfection experiments with a truncated mutant USF2a protein, TDU2, which lacks the NH2-terminal activation domain but retains the normal dimerization and binding domains. TDU2 did not display either the transactivation effect of the normal protein or its combined effect with HNF-4 (Fig. 1 B). We generated mutations in element B that specifically inhibit the binding of USF or HNF-4, as previously described (13.Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9640-9646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA analysis of the binding of USF2a or HNF-4 overexpressed in COS-1 cells to wild type or mutant element B confirms that mutations BM1 or BM5 specifically impair the binding of USF2a or HNF-4, respectively (Fig. 1,insets). As expected, the mutation in the HNF-4 binding site (BM5) results in a weaker activation by HNF-4 of the −890/+24 apoC-III BM5 promoter (2-fold) as compared with the wild type (6-fold) (Fig. 1, C versus B). This remaining activation might be because of the binding of HNF-4 to its distal binding site on the apoC-III enhancer (33.Kardassis D. Tzameli I. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Talianidis I. Zannis V.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34.Bisaha J.G. Simon T.C. Gordon J.I. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19979-19988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). By contrast, USF2a exerts a stronger effect on BM5 promoter activity (5-fold; Fig. 1 C) than on that of the wild type form (2-fold; Fig. 1 B). Nevertheless, co-transfection experiment of HNF-4 and USF2a only resulted in an additive effect on the −890/+24 apoC-III BM5 promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). Conversely, the effects of USF2a and HNF-4 were not affected by the mutation of the USF binding site, designated BM1 (Fig. 1 D). USF2a still transactivates 2-fold the −890/+24 apoC-III BM1 promoter. Furthermore, a combined effect of USF2a and HNF-4 is still observed with the mutated BM1 promoter, with transactivation reaching a 14-fold activation versus 2- and 7-fold activation with the individual factors, respectively. TDU2, the truncated USF2a protein, showed no effect either alone or associated with HNF-4 (Fig. 1 D). Because the combined effect of USF2a and HNF-4 on the −890/+24 apoC-III promoter was not abolished by the mutation of the USF binding site in element B, it could be hypothesized that USF2a binds to a more distal element of the promoter. Systematic analysis of USF2a binding by competitive EMSA showed that USF2a does not bind to any site in the distal region of the apoC-III promoter (data not shown). Co-transfection experiments of USF2a and HNF-4 expression vectors were then performed in HepG2 cells with the CAT reporter gene under the control of the proximal −99/+24 apoC-III promoter. As expected, because of the lack of the apoC-III enhancer, the HNF-4 transactivation effect on the −99/+24 apoC-III promoter is weaker than on the −890/+24 promoter (4-fold versus 6-fold; Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 A also shows a 10-fold transactivation of the proximal apoC-III promoter by USF2a and a combined effect of HNF-4 and USF2a, which are not reproduced by its mutant form, TDU2 (Fig. 2 A). The level of expression of USF2a or/and HNF-4 in transfected cells has been controlled by EMSA (Fig. 2 A, inset). The expression of USF2a or HNF-4 is similar in cells transfected with the expression vector of USF2a or with the expression vector of HNF-4 and in cells transfected with both vectors. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that USF2a and HNF-4 transactivate the human apoC-III promoter by a mechanism that only requires the −99/+24 proximal region of the promoter and that this potentialized effect does not depend on the USF2a binding to its cognate site in element B. The combined effect of USF2a and HNF-4 could be explained by an indirect effect of USF on the binding of HNF-4 to element B. It has previously been shown that C/EBPα stimulates the binding of USF to the promoter of the C/EBPα gene and therefore activates its own promoter (35.Timchenko N. Wilson D.R. Taylor L.R. Abdelsayed S. Wilde M. Sawadogo M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, EMSA with increasing amounts of USF2a and a constant amount of HNF-4 or with increasing amounts of HNF-4 and a constant amount of USF2a were performed with the CIIIB probe (Fig. 2 B). In any case, the addition of a constant amount (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6) or an increasing amount (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–9) of USF2a does not modify the binding of HNF-4 as compared with that bound in the absence of USF2a (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1–3), demonstrating that there is no facilitation of HNF-4 binding to element B by USF2a. Alternatively, the combined effect of USF2a and HNF-4 might involve a proximal USF binding site other than element B. To test this hypothesis, we generated a −71/+24 apoC-III promoter. Fig. 2 C clearly shows that this promoter is sufficient to be activated by USF2a, whereas HNF-4 has no effect, as expected. To localize the proximal site(s) of USF, we designed three double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning the regions −68/−31, −44/−13, and −26/+5 of the apoC-III promoter. USF2a directly binds to the probes −68/−31 and −26/+5 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and4) but not to the probe −44/−13 (Fig. 3 A,lane 3). The binding of USF2a to these probes is weaker than that to the CIIIB probe (compare the band intensity of lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. 3 A). The precise location of USF binding sites in the −99/+24 apoC-III promoter fragment was further determined by footprinting analysis in the presence of bacterially expressed USF1, which has an identical DNA-binding domain and exhibits the same binding properties as USF2a (15.Ribeiro A.

These USF binding sites could account for the combined effect observed between HNF-4 and USF2a. These regions do not comprise E-box motifs. However, it has been reported that in addition to the E-box motif, USF recognizes the initiator element (Inr), a sequence rich in pyrimidine nucleotides, near the transcription start site (36.Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).

To determine whether elements I and II were involved in the activation of the apoC-III promoter, we mutated the elements I or/and II in the proximal (−99/+24) apoC-III promoter (Fig. 4). The mutation BM1 was also inserted to avoid any interference from the USF2a binding to element B with that to elements I and II. Co-transfection experiments with USF2a and HNF-4 expression vectors were performed in HepG2 cells with the CAT reporter gene under the control of the proximal (−99/+24) apoC-III promoter comprising the different mutations described in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 A shows that USF2a by itself transactivates 5-fold the −99/+24 C-IIIBM1 promoter, as does HNF-4 for a total of 10-fold additive transactivation. However, the combination of both factors, HNF-4 and USF2a, results in a 15-fold activation of this reporter, which is more than additive. Introduction in the −99/+24 C-IIIBM1 reporter of the mutation IIm (Table II), which avoids USF2a binding to element II, results in a 2-fold reduction in the transactivation capacity of USF2a but without altering its capacity to potentialize the effect of HNF-4 (Fig. 4, B versus A). The element I has also been mutated to a “classic Inr,” which supports TFII-I binding but not USF2a (mutation Im, described in Table II) (36.Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 37.Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This mutation does not alter the capacity of USF2a to transactivate the −99/+24 C-IIIBM1Im reporter but results in a 2-fold reduction in the transactivation capacity of HNF-4, and the combined effect between HNF-4 and USF2a led to a transactivation that is not significantly different from the transactivation by USF2a alone (Fig. 4 C). Finally, when elements I and II are mutated, the combined effect of USF2a and HNF-4 led similarly to a nonsignificant transactivation of the −99CIIIBM1IImIm reporter activity (Fig. 4 D).Table IIMutations in elements B, I, and II of the apo C-III promoterElement B−90TCAGCAGGTGACCTTTGCC−72Element BM1−90TCAGATATCGACCCTTTGCC−72Element II−58CCTCAGTGCCTGCTGCCCTGGAGATGAT−31Element IIm−58CCTCTCAGATATCGACCCTGGAGATGAT−31Element I−19CAGAACCCTCCTGCCT−4Element Im−19CAGAACTCACTCTCCT−4Sequences of element B, element II, and element I and their associated mutations are described.

Eukaryotic gene expression involves a combination of transcription factors interacting with specific binding sites clustered within an enhancer and the proximal promoter of a given gene. Such a mechanism combines tissue-specific and ubiquitously expressed transcription factors. Altogether these elements, with chromatin structure, yield a great diversity of specific patterns of gene expression, although the actual mechanism controlling this specificity is still elusive. In the liver, this regulation is even more complex because none of the liver-specific factors are restricted to hepatocytes, and a unique combination of regulators defines a particular phenotype. It might be expected that liver-specific genes involved in the same metabolic pathway could be expressed under the same combinatorial control. The apolipoprotein gene family represents an accurate model to test such a hypothesis. Our results show that liver-specific expression of both apoA-II (15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and apoC-III genes relies on a combination of the liver-enriched HNF-4 factor and USF. USF has been found to regulate a wide variety of genes involved in different specialized functions, such as tissue specificity, development, and metabolic regulation (38.Henrion A.A. Martinez A. Mattei M.-G. Khan A. Raymondjean M. Genomics. 1995; 25: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the case of apoA-II promoter, USF and HNF-4 bind cooperatively to the distal enhancer and communicate synergistically with USF bound to the proximal promoter (15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is not the case for apoC-III, where the USF cognate site overlaps that of HNF-4 within the proximal promoter of apoC-III. This overlapping binding could suggest that USF may negatively modulate HNF-4 activation of apoC-III transcription. Surprisingly, despite a mutually exclusive binding of USF and HNF-4 on element B, we observed a combined effect of these transcription factors in the transactivation of the human apoC-III promoter. This combined effect is not because of a distal USF binding site nor to a facilitated binding of HNF-4 in the presence of USF. This mechanism differs from that we previously elucidated for apoA-II gene transcription (15.Ribeiro A. Pastier D. Kardassis D. Chambaz J. Cardot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1216-1225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and this reinforces the idea that a unique arrangement of regulatory elements and factors bound to promoter allows the formation of a unique DNA-protein complex that finally promotes the transcription of a particular gene. The second finding of our study is that USF binds two new sites in the proximal promoter, different from element B. By EMSA and footprinting analysis in vitro, we localized two regions, element II and element I, which bind USF, at positions (−58/−31) and (−19/−4) on both sides of the TATA box, respectively. Sequence analysis of the −71/+24 apoC-III region reveals that this region does not comprise an E-box motif, is pyrimidine-enriched, and presents homology with the Inr sequences of AdML, HIV, and terminal transferase promoters (Table I). It has been reported that in addition to the E-box motif, USF recognizes Inr (36.Du H. Roy A.L. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Inr was first described as a promoter element that allows direct transcription from a TATA-less promoter. Various studies have demonstrated that Inr can also be present in promoters that contain a TATA box and can act independently or in concert with the TATA box to enhance the transcription. Generally, Inr is located approximately between −5 and +5 around the initiation transcription start site (+1), but pyrimidine-rich Inr-like elements have also been found distal to the initiation site (37.Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 39.Nakatani Y. Horikoshi M. Brenner M. Tamamoti T. Besnard F. Roeder R.G. Freese E. Nature. 1990; 348: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A weak consensus sequence has been defined by Javahery et al. (40.Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar): YYA+1NWYY. The pyrimidine content surrounding the ANT has to be assessed with particular attention. In general, the greater the number of pyrimidines at this location, the greater the activity of the Inr. Furthermore, in the absence of optimal sequences surrounding the −1 to +3 position, the CANT sequence is insufficient for Inr activity. The functional analysis of element I and element II by directed mutagenesis shows that the potentialized transactivation of the apoC-III promoter by HNF-4 and USF is dependent on the element I (Fig. 4). This effect may be because of the stabilization of the basal transcriptional machinery or to a better accessibility of the preinitiation complex to the promoter. USF presents a weak binding to both Inr-like sites of the apoC-III promoter. Such a low affinity has been described for the binding of USF to AdML Inr, which is markedly enhanced by the general transcription factor TFII-I (41.Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 23: 7091-7194Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). TFII-I binds to Inr of the AdML promoter and may serve as a co-regulator that can integrate regulatory responses of USF to the basal machinery (41.Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 23: 7091-7194Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). USF may play a similar role in the transactivation of the apoC-III promoter by HNF-4. A direct interaction between these two factors has never been reported, and co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal the absence of physical interactions between USF and HNF-4 (data not shown). An alternative hypothesis could involve a co-activator that bridges transcription factors to the basal transcriptional machinery and allows recruitment and/or stabilization of the preinitiation complex. A recent study suggests the existence of a specialized co-activator that is not, in contrast to USF itself, ubiquitously expressed (42.Qyang Y. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The existence of specific co-activators might explain the different functions of distinct basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper proteins through common E-box in different promoters. It may be hypothesized that a specific co-activator, common to HNF-4 and USF, allows an enhancement of transcription by the TATA-box through the binding of HNF-4 to the hormone-responsive element of element B and USF to the Inr-like element I. Indeed, HNF-4 interacts with co-regulators such as CBP/p300 (43.Yoshida E. Aratani S. Itou H. Miagishi M. Takiguchi M. Osumu T. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 664-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and SRC-1/GRIP1 (44.Wang J.-C. Stafford J.M. Granner D.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction of CBP and HNF-4 enhances apoC-III transcription (46.Dell H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9013-9021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the context of the TGFβ2 promoter, USF1 does not interact with p300 (47.Kingsley-Kallesen M. Kelly D. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34020-34028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that p300 mediates the transcriptional activation of the F1F0 ATP synthase promoter by USF2 through an Inr element (48.Breen G.A.M. Jordan E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, CBP/p300 and the p300-associated factor display intrinsic acetyltransferase activities. The acetylation of histones is thought to be involved in destabilization of nucleosomes, a crucial event for the access of transcription factors to their DNA templates (49.Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the transcription of two liver-expressed genes involved in the same metabolic pathway, the apos A-II and C-III genes, requires the same combination of transcription factors: the liver-enriched HNF-4 and the ubiquitously expressed USF. Furthermore, this combination is dependent on the regions responsible for the in vivo liver expression. However, USF and HNF-4 regulate their transcription through different mechanisms: a cooperative binding of USF and HNF-4 to the distal apoA-II promoter, which is involved in the in vivoliver-restricted expression of this gene (15.Ribeiro A.

These results underline the fact that the understanding of the actual role of transcription factors in regulating gene transcription requires the elucidation of their mechanisms of action."

However, many “modern” entelegyne spiders such as Cupiennius salei differ from the standard arachnid scheme and have 2 × 6-mer hemocyanins. Here we report the complete primary structure of the 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin of C. salei as deduced from cDNA sequencing, gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption spectroscopy. Six distinct subunit types (1 through 6) and three additional allelic sequences were identified. Each 1 × 6-mer half-molecule most likely is composed of subunits 1–6, with subunit 1 linking the two hexamers via a disulfide bridge located in a C-terminal extension. TheC. salei hemocyanin subunits all belong to the arachnidg-type, whereas the other six types (a–f) have been lost in evolution. The reconstruction of a complex hemocyanin from a single g-type subunit, which commenced about 190 million years ago and was completed about 90 million years ago, might be explained by physiological and behavioral changes that occurred during the evolution of the entelegyne spiders.

Hemocyanins are large allosteric respiratory proteins that occur freely dissolved in the hemolymph of many arthropod and molluscan species (1.Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ.

Oxygen binding of hemocyanins is mediated by a pair of copper atoms that are coordinated by six histidine residues (2.van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv.

Arthropod hemocyanins are hexamers (6-mers) composed of distinct although related subunits in the 75-kDa range that may combine to multimers up to 8 × 6 subunits, depending upon the taxon or the physiological conditions (1.Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). The sequences of various hemocyanin subunits have been determined from all euarthropod subphyla, including the Chelicerata, Crustacea, Myriapoda, and Hexapoda (7.Burmester T. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 2002; 172: 95-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that subunit evolution took place independently within each subphylum (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol.

The estimated rate of amino acid replacement in the chelicerate hemocyanins is about the half of that found in the crustaceans or myriapods (7.Burmester T. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 2002; 172: 95-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which is most likely linked to the conserved structure of these proteins (1.Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ.

The hemocyanins of orthognath spiders, scorpions, and related Arachnida are 4 × 6-mer protein complexes consisting of two identical 2 × 6-mers (1.Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). The 8 × 6-mer hemocyanin of xiphosurs (Merostomata) such as Limulus polyphemus consists of two identical 4 × 6 halves that correspond structurally to the 4 × 6-mer arachnid hemocyanins. Typically, seven distinct subunit types, termeda–g, are present in a chelicerate hemocyanin, which have been immunologically correlated between L. polyphemus, the scorpion Androctonus australis, and the tarantula Eurypelma californicum (13.Lamy J.

In this species, formation of the 4 × 6-mer requires a stoichiometric association of four copies of subunits a,d, e, f, and g and two copies of subunits b and c (16.Markl J. Bonaventura C.

Estimates assuming a molecular clock have led to the conclusion that the diversification of the seven distinct subunits commenced early in evolution, more than 500 million years ago (MYA), 1The abbreviations used are: MYAmillion years agoMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometryRTAretrolateral tibial apophysisPAMaccepted point mutations per site and was completed about 420 MYA (5.Burmester T.

Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). However, many other labidognath spider families such as Agelenidae, Salticidae, Thomisidae, Dysderiidae, Clubionidae, Lycosidae, and Ctenidae diverge from this standard scheme of chelicerate hemocyanin structure (10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). They possess a 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin with only two hemocyanin subunit types identified by immunological means, suggesting a severe rearrangement of the subunits. A carefully studied example is the Central American ctenid spider, Cupiennius salei (Fig. 1). In the hemolymph of this species, a mixture of 1 × 6- and 2 × 6-mer hemocyanins occurs in an approximate 1:2 ratio (20.Markl J. Schmid R. Czichos-Tiedt S. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1713-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although both hemocyanin forms include five electrophoretically distinct but immunologically identical monomer subunits, an additional subunit dimer is present in the 2 × 6 molecules (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Markl J. Markl A. Schartau W. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1979; 130: 283-292Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This subunit dimer is immunologically distinct from the monomers (23.Markl J. Kempter B. Lamy J. Lamy J. Invertebrate oxygen-binding Proteins. Dekker, New York1981: 125-137Google Scholar) and is linked by a cysteine-mediated disulfide bridge (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22.Markl J. Markl A. Schartau W. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1979; 130: 283-292Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is responsible for the formation of the 2 × 6-mer by connecting two hexamers. To understand the architecture of the C. salei hemocyanin and the evolutionary processes that led to the construction of the hemocyanin multimer, we have cloned and sequenced the cDNAs of all subunits of this hemocyanin. This is the second chelicerate hemocyanin for which the full subunit sequence has been elucidated (12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39339-39344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Central American ctenid spider,Cupiennius salei (Chelicerata, Araneae, Ctenidae; Fig. 1) was obtained from Prof. E.-A. Seyfarth (Institute of Zoology, Frankfurt, Germany). The animals were kept at 28 °C with a 12/12 h light-dark cycle and fed on insects. Specimens used in this study had ∼3–3.5-cm body length and 10–12-cm leg span. Adult spiders were immobilized for 2 h at 4 °C. The hemolymph was withdrawn from the median-dorsal region of the opisthosoma by a syringe and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g to remove the hemocytes. For some experiments, the hemolymph was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in a buffer containing 130 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.6. SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out according to Laemmli (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on a 7.5% gel, either under reducing (with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) or nonreducing conditions (without β-mercaptoethanol). Native PAGE was performed on 5% polyacrylamide gels without SDS and β-mercaptoethanol. For Western blotting, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose at 0.8 mA/cm2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20). Incubation with the anti-C. salei hemocyanin antibodies (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) diluted 1:10,000 in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBS-T was carried out overnight at 4 °C. The filters were washed three times for 10 min in TBS-T and subsequently were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit Fab fragments conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Dianova) diluted 1:10.000 in 5% nonfat dry milk/TBS-T. The membranes were washed as above and the detection was carried out using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. RNA was prepared from two ∼18-month-old adult C. salei specimens 10 days after induction of hematopoiesis by bleeding. The specimens were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder under continuous addition of nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted according to the guanidinium thiocyanate method (25.Chirgwin J.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar), and the poly(A)+RNA was purified by the aid of the Poly(A)Tract kit (Promega). A directionally cloned cDNA expression library was established applying the Lambda ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). The library was amplified once and screened with anti- C. salei hemocyanin antibodies. Positive phage clones were converted to pBK-CMV plasmid vectors with the material provided by Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced by the commercial GEnterprise (Mainz, Germany) sequencing service. Complete hemocyanin cDNA sequences were obtained by primer walking using specific oligonucleotides. MALDI-TOF experiments were performed by Dr. Christian Hunziger (Proteosys, Mainz, Germany) on proteins that had been separated by native PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and digested with trypsin. The MALDI-TOF data were evaluated using the program PEPTIDE-MASS. 2Available at the ExPASy web server: www.expasy.ch. Sequence analyses were carried out with the programs provided by software package 9.0 from the Genetics Computer Group (GCG, Wisconsin) and the ExPASy web server.2 Sequences were added by hand to an alignment of the published hemocyanin sequences (12.Voit R.

Nicholas and H. B. Nicholas, Jr. (1997) www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/. The alignment is available from the authors upon request. The PHYLIP 3.6b2 software package was used for phylogenetic analyses (27.Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), Version 3, 6.b2, distributed by the author. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle2001Google Scholar). Distances between pairs of protein sequences were calculated and corrected for multiple changes according to Dayhoff's empirical PAM 001 matrix (28.Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5, Suppl. 3. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar) with the PROTDIST program. Phylogenetic trees were constructed either by the neighbor-joining method or the maximum parsimony method implemented in the PROTPARS program. The reliability of the trees was tested by bootstrap analysis (29.Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 100 replications (SEQBOOT program). To estimate the divergence times, the PAM matrix was imported into the Microsoft Excel 2000 spreadsheet program (30.Burmester T. Massey Jr., H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Beneš H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A linearized tree that corresponds to the phylogeny of the chelicerate hemocyanins was calculated on the basis that Merostomata and Arachnida separated about 450 MYA (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 31.Dunlop J.A. Selden P.A. Fortey R.A. Thomas R.H. Arthropod Relationships. Systematic Association Special Volume Series 55, Chapman and Hall, London1997: 221-236Google Scholar). The confidence limits were estimated using the observed standard deviation of the protein distances. The hemolymph proteins of six adult individuals of C. salei were extracted and subjected to electrophoretic studies (Fig. 2). The total protein content of the hemolymph of these individuals varied between 28 and 65 mg/ml. In the first set of experiments, the proteins were applied to a native PAGE immediately after the bleeding of the animals (Fig. 2 A). The bands represent the 2 × 6- and 1 × 6-mer hemocyanins, as well as a non-respiratory protein and a significant amount of a hemocyanin heptamer, which is formed by partial dissociation of the 2 × 6-mer molecule (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a second experiment, the hemolymph proteins were dialyzed in an alkaline glycine buffer at pH 9.6 before the PAGE to ensure the dissociation of 2 × 6- and 1 × 6-mer hemocyanin into subunits (Fig. 2 B). In both types of analysis, no detectable variation in the migration of the hemocyanin multimers and subunits was observed, although in specimens 5 and 6 the relative amount of the subunits varies slightly (Fig. 2 B). SDS-PAGE analyses under both reducing and nonreducing conditions revealed a single prominent hemocyanin band in the 70-kDa range (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). The non-respiratory protein of C. salei forms a single band of about 110 kDa under nonreducing condition (lane 2), and a double band of 100 and 120 kDa, respectively, when β-mercaptoethanol was added (lane 1; cf. Ref. 21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). An additional band of 140 kDa appears only under nonreducing conditions (lane 2), which was suspected to be the dimeric hemocyanin subunit that is linked by a disulfide bridge (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-C. salei hemocyanin antibodies, which stain the 70-kDa subunits as well as the 140-kDa dimer (lanes 3 and 4). A minor cross-reaction with the 110-kDa non-respiratory protein was observed, probably due to some contamination in the hemocyanin preparation used for immunization. A cDNA library was constructed according to Kempter (32.Kempter B. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 255-256Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) fromC. salei 10 days after induction of hematopoiesis by bleeding. The library was screened with specific anti-C. salei hemocyanin antibodies (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A total of 27 positive clones was identified and partially sequenced; 17 of the clones encoded hemocyanin. Comparison of the 5′ and 3′ sequences revealed that they represent a total of nine distinct hemocyanin cDNAs. The complete sequences of these clones were obtained on both strands by primer walking. The full-length cDNAs cover the complete coding regions for the different subunits together with 44 to 67 bp of the respective 5′ untranslated regions and the complete 3′ untranslated regions comprising the standard polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) and the poly(A)-tails of different lengths (Table I). In each case, the presence of 3 purines upstream of the putative initiator codons (ATG) fulfills the minimum criteria for an eukaryotic translation start site (33.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). Because three of the sequences are almost identical (>99.2%) with other cDNAs at the nucleotide level, and the distances among the others are in about the same range (Table II), we assume that these sequences represent alleles in the C. salei gene pool. Thus we identified a total of six sequences that are expected to encode the individual hemocyanin subunits ofC. salei.Table IMolecular properties of the C. salei hemocyanin subunitsSubunitAccession number1-aGenBank™/EBI DNA data accession number.cDNA1-bWithout poly(A)-tail.Protein1-cIncluding the initiator methionine.

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide identities (within the coding region) are above and amino acid identities below the diagonal. The open reading frames translate into five distinct polypeptides of 626 amino acids and a single one of 634 amino acids with calculated molecular masses in the range of 72 kDa (Table I), which agrees well with observations made by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3; cf. Ref.21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To assign these cDNA sequences to distinct subunits that have been identified by gel electrophoresis, the Coomassie-stained bands from a native gel (Fig. 2 C) were excised and submitted to MALDI-TOF analyses. Using a theoretical digest of the hemocyanin polypeptides deduced from the cDNAs, between 4 and 14 unique peptides from each band were unambiguously allocated. The hemocyanin subunits were named according to their apparent migration in the native gel, with CsaHc-1 being the subunit dimer, CsaHc-2 the slowest, and CsaHc-6 the fastest migrating subunit. Pairwise sequence comparison (excluding the allelic sequences) of the C. salei hemocyanin subunits revealed that 76.4–86.1% of the nucleotides and 79.2–88.8% of the amino acids are identical (Fig. 4; Table II). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the C. salei hemocyanin subunits were added to the previously published alignments of the chelicerate hemocyanins (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39339-39344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid identity score among the distinct C. salei hemocyanin subunits is higher than 79.2%, the lower scores were obtained with other known hemocyanin sequences. The highest score was found with the E. californicumhemocyanin subunit g (EcaHc-g) (71.2–72.8% identity at the amino acid level), whereas other sequences were lower than 66% (data not shown). For phylogenetic inference, four selected crustacean hemocyanin sequences were included in the alignment. Crustacean and chelicerate hemocyanins form two distinct branches, which separated at the time of the divergence of the subphyla in the Cambrian or an earlier period (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the crustacean hemocyanins may be used as the out-group to infer the phylogeny of chelicerate proteins. Tree construction was performed assuming maximum parsimony or by the neighbor-joining method based on a PAM matrix (Fig. 5). In both analyses, the six C. salei hemocyanin subunits form a single, well supported clade (100% bootstrap support) nested within the other chelicerate hemocyanins. The C. salei branch is associated with the g-subunit of E. californicum(100 and 99% bootstrap support, respectively). A time scale of chelicerate hemocyanin evolution was inferred under the assumption that the L. polyphemus hemocyanin subunit II and E. californicum hemocyanin subunit a are orthologous proteins (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol.

Fortey R.A. Thomas R.H. Arthropod Relationships. Systematic Association Special Volume Series 55, Chapman and Hall, London1997: 221-236Google Scholar). Assuming a PAM substitution matrix, we calculated a mean amino acid replacement rate of 0.65 ± 0.03 × 10−9 substitutions per site per year, which is good agreement with the previous estimates using fewer sequences (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol.

Thus the time of divergence of the branches leading to the C. salei hemocyanin subunits and E. californicum subunit g (EcaHc-g) occurred around 279 ± 5 MYA (Fig. 6). CsaHc-1 and the precursor of the other Cupiennius subunits split 186 ± 10 MYA. Subunit CsaHc-4 diverged 127 ± 5 MYA, CsaHc-2 and CsaHc-5 split 97 ± 1.5 MYA, and CsaHc-3 and CsaHc-6 split 93 ± 1.4 MYA.Figure 6An approximate time scale of the evolution in the chelicerate hemocyanins. The linearized tree was obtained on the basis of corrected protein distance data (PAM 001 matrix; 28). The divergence times were estimated as described.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hemocyanin of the ctenid spider C. salei is represented by a 1 × 6 oligomer formed by five distinct subunits and a 2 × 6 multimer with six subunits, one of which forms a dimer that links the two hexamers (20.Markl J. Schmid R. Czichos-Tiedt S. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1713-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have cloned and sequenced six distinct hemocyanin cDNAs (plus three allelic sequences). The MALDI-TOF data allow the unambiguous assignment of each of these polypeptides to one of the protein bands observed in gel electrophoresis and also demonstrate that all subunits were covered by the cDNA data. Besides the 4 × 6-mer hemocyanin of the North American tarantula E. californicum, which consists of seven distinct subunits (12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39339-39344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), C. salei hemocyanin is the second chelicerate hemocyanin for which subunit sequences have been completely determined. However, the structures of these two respiratory proteins essentially differ. Although the 4 × 6-mer hemocyanin of E. californicum represents the standard type of an arachnid hemocyanin, C. salei is the representative of another 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin form only found in a distinct group of the Araneae. Based on the cross-reactions of the C. salei subunits with antibodies raised against the various hemocyanin subunits of E. californicum, the monomers were previously assigned to the chelicerate subunit type f, whereas the dimer appeared to belong to the d-type subunits (10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). However, both sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses clearly show that the dimer as well as the monomers do in fact belong to the chelicerate subunit type g (Fig. 5). The C. salei hemocyanin sequences closely resemble those of the other chelicerates. It is, however, noteworthy that in theC. salei hemocyanins as well as in EcaHc-g the copper-binding site A carries a conserved HHWYWH motif, whereas in the other chelicerate hemocyanin subunits this sequence is HHWHWH. The functional consequences of this mutation are unknown. As in theE. californicum hemocyanin subunits (12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39339-39344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), no signal peptides except putative initiator methionines were found in the C. salei hemocyanin subunits, although these polypeptides are extracellular proteins. This is explained by the fact that spider hemocyanins are synthesized by free ribosomes and most likely released by holocrine secretion (32.Kempter B. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 255-256Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34.Markl J. Stumpp S. Bosch F.X. Voit R. Preaux G. Lontie R. Invertebrate Dioxygen Carriers. University Press, Louvain, Belgium1990: 497-502Google Scholar). Thus, the proteins do not pass the Golgi apparatus and the putative N-glycosylation sites (NX(T/S)), which, although present in the primary structure of all subunits, are probably not used. There are four strictly conserved cysteine residues in all C. salei hemocyanins in positions 531, 533, 574, and 581 in domain 3. They most likely form two disulfide bridges that make up a flexible hinge stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of the subunit, as deduced from other hemocyanins (35.Topham R. Tesh S. Westcott A. Cole G. Mercatante D. Kaufman G. Bonaventura C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As already observed with various hemocyanin sequences (1.Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar, 5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39339-39344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), most variations are present in the first and third structural domains. The second domain, which forms the core of the hemocyanin subunit and includes the copper-binding sites, is strikingly conserved within the different C. salei hemocyanin subunits (79.7% identical amino acids) and between those and the other hemocyanins. Although in general the first domain is the least conserved region among different hemocyanins, we found the third domain of the C. saleihemocyanin subunits to be the most variable, with only 63.7% strictly conserved residues (71.4% in the first domain). Based on the MALDI-TOF data, CsaHc-1 was found to form the homodimeric hemocyanin subunit. In this protein, the two polypeptide chains are linked by a disulfide bridge (20.Markl J. Schmid R. Czichos-Tiedt S. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 1713-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The hemocyanin dimer is responsible for the formation of the 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin and mediates a flexible but stable interhexamer contact that is readily visible in electron micrographs (21.Markl J. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 1980; 140: 199-207Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The dimer-forming subunit, CsaHc-1, is longer than the other subunits and contains eight additional amino acids at its C-terminal end, which includes a cysteine at position 631 (Fig. 4). Comparison with the known three-dimensional structure of subunit II from L. polyphemus (36.Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) reveals that this is the only cysteine available at the subunit surface (Fig. 7). Thus we assume that Cys-631 of CsaHc-1 is in fact responsible for the formation of the disulfide link between two CsaHc-1 subunits and the creation of the 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin. We cannot conclude from our data the position of the other subunits in the native 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin. It should be noted, however, that in reassembly experiments the monomeric subunits (CsaHc-2 to-6) were individually able to form hexamers and to combine with the dimeric subunit (CsaHc-1) to form 2 × 6-mers (23.Markl J. Kempter B. Lamy J. Lamy J. Invertebrate oxygen-binding Proteins. Dekker, New York1981: 125-137Google Scholar). Seven different subunit types (a–g) and a typical 4 × 6-mer hemocyanin are present in most chelicerate orders (10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). The subunit types diverged from an ancestral hemocyanin gene as early as 550 MYA (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12.Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39339-39344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By contrast, the hemocyanin of C. salei is a rather recent derivative of this ancient chelicerate hemocyanin structure, which emerged only about 90–190 MYA from a singleg-type subunit (Fig. 6). It can be assumed that the ancestor of the Cupiennius-type hemocyanin was a simple hexamer, which contained a single g-like subunit type. The reasons why the other subunits have been lost is essentially unknown, but it might be speculated that morphological changes made the highly complex 4 × 6-mer hemocyanin unnecessary. It is noteworthy that theCupiennius type 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin appears to be restricted to the “higher” entelegyne Araneae of the retrolateral tibial apophysis (RTA) clade (37.Coddington J.A. Levi H.W. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1991; 22: 565-592Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar), which are active hunters with a complex tracheal system. It is conceivable that the loss of the 4 × 6-mer hemocyanin is linked to the evolution of such respiratory organs. It is also possible that the ancestors of the RTA clade passed a period of dwarfism in which a simple 1 × 6-mer hemocyanin acted as a high-affinity oxygen storage protein rather than a sophisticated oxygen carrier. Later, an increase in body size rendered simple tracheal respiration inefficient to sustain the metabolic need of an active hunter. By a gene duplication event about 186 MYA they regained a more complex hemocyanin with an additional dimeric subunit, enabling the formation of 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin. This in turn would allow more sophisticated allosteric regulations as well as a higher oxygen transport capacity while maintaining blood osmolarity and viscosity. The later diversification of the different subunits by gene duplication 90–120 MYA might either be related simply to the need of more hemocyanin polypeptides or may again enhance the regulation capacity of the protein. Hemocyanin sequences have been used successfully to infer a time scale of the evolution of arthropod taxa (5.Burmester T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 7.Burmester T. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ.

Evol. 2001; 18: 1566-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the sparse fossil record (38.Selden P.A. Benton M.J. The Fossil Record 2. Chapman and Hall, London1993: 297-320Google Scholar), the present knowledge of the evolution of the spiders (Araneae) is poor. The Araneae probably emerged in the Devonian period some 400 MYA. Recent cladistic analyses treat the suborders Mygalomorpha (represented here by E. californicum) and Araneomorpha (C. salei) as sister taxa, which are joined as Opisthothelae (37.Coddington J.A. Levi H.W. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1991; 22: 565-592Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The first fossils of the Mygalomorpha derive from the early Triassic period (some 240 MYA), whereas the lower bound of the fossil record of the Araneomorpha is about 160 MYA (38.Selden P.A. Benton M.J. The Fossil Record 2. Chapman and Hall, London1993: 297-320Google Scholar). The time of divergence of the C. salei hemocyanins and EcaHc-g most likely coincides with the split of the Mygalomorpha and Araneomorpha. Assuming a molecular clock, we calculated this date to be about 280 MYA, which agrees with the fossil data. The most successful subgroup within the Araneomorpha are the Entelegynae, which are subdivided in the Orbicularidae and the spiders of the RTA clade (37.Coddington J.A. Levi H.W. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. 1991; 22: 565-592Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar). So far, only species that belong to the RTA clade possess a Cupiennius-type hemocyanin (10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). However, it is uncertain whether it can be considered as a molecular synapomorphy of this taxon, because its occurrence outside of the RTA clade is still possible. If this is the case it would provide an excellent trait for tracing the closest relatives of the RTA clade. On the other hand, various families of the Orbicularidae possess anEurypelma-type hemocyanin (10.Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). Thus the formation of the 2 × 6-mer hemocyanin must have occurred after the separation of the Orbicularidae and the progenitors of the RTA clade. The fossil records of both taxa are poor and are mainly restricted to specimens from the Tertiary period preserved in Baltic amber (38.Selden P.A. Benton M.J. The Fossil Record 2. Chapman and Hall, London1993: 297-320Google Scholar). The lower bound of divergence of the Orbicularidae and the RTA clade is set by an orbicularian spider from the early Cretaceous period, some 140 MYA (38.Selden P.A. Benton M.J. The Fossil Record 2. Chapman and Hall, London1993: 297-320Google Scholar). We have calculated that the formation of theCupiennius-type hemocyanin commenced about 190 MYA, which should be considered as the lower boundary for the time of emergence of the RTA clade. The different subunits of the C. saleihemocyanin have existed as distinct genes for at least 90 MYA. Future studies will elucidate the distribution and relationship of hemocyanin subunits in the Entelegynae and other Araneae and will help to infer the evolution of spiders. We thank Prof. E.-A.

https://openalex.org/W2002477714,"The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) from the hyperthermophilic archaeum <i>Thermoproteus tenax</i> represents an archaeal member of the diverse superfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). GAPN catalyzes the irreversible oxidation ofd-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate. In this study, we present the crystal structure of GAPN in complex with its natural inhibitor NADP<sup>+</sup> determined by multiple anomalous diffraction methods. The structure was refined to a resolution of 2.4 Å with an <i>R</i>-factor of 0.21. The overall fold of GAPN is similar to the structures of ALDHs described previously, consisting of three domains: a nucleotide-binding domain, a catalytic domain, and an oligomerization domain. Local differences in the active site are responsible for substrate specificity. The inhibitor NADP<sup>+</sup>binds at an equivalent site to the cosubstrate-binding site of other ALDHs and blocks the enzyme in its inactive state, possibly preventing the transition to the active conformation. Structural comparison between GAPN from the hyperthermophilic <i>T. tenax</i> and homologs of mesophilic organisms establishes several characteristics of thermostabilization. These include protection against heat-induced covalent modifications by reducing and stabilizing labile residues, a decrease in number and volume of empty cavities, an increase in β-strand content, and a strengthening of subunit contacts by ionic and hydrophobic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2316086376,"The mechanisms through which the oncoprotein c-Myc initiates locus-specific gene amplification are not understood. When analysing the initiation mechanism of c-Myc-dependent amplification of the mouse ribonucleotide reductase R2 (R2) gene, we observe c-Myc-dependent initiation of illegitimate DNA replication of the R2 gene. We demonstrate multiple simultaneous c-Myc-induced R2 replication forks, whereas R2 normally replicates with a single fork. In contrast, cyclin C replicates with only a single replication fork irrespective of c-Myc deregulation. In addition to de novo replication forks, c-Myc also initiates bi-allelic replication of R2, abrogating its normal mono-allelic replication pattern. Moreover, several chromosomal regions also display c-Myc-induced illegitimate replication profiles. Thus, c-Myc can act as an illegitimate replication-licensing factor that promotes de novo replication initiation and illegitimate replication timing that adversely impacts upon genomic stability."

Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Creighton T.E. Encyclopedia of Molecular Medicine. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001: 393-396Google Scholar). The reaction products are indirectly channeled into the Krebs cycle or linked to lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. In patients with inherited maple syrup urine disease, the activity of the BCKD complex is deficient, which results in the accumulation of branched-chain α-keto acids. This metabolic block has severe clinical consequences including often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangement, and mental retardation in survivors (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The mammalian BCKD complex is a member of the highly conserved α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes consisting of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDC), and the BCKD complex with similar structure and function (3Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The mammalian BCKD complex consists of three catalytic components as follows: a heterotetrameric (α2β2) branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase or E1, a homo-24-meric dihydrolipoyltransacylase or E2, and a homodimeric dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase or E3. E1 and E2 components are specific for the BCKD complex, whereas the E3 component is common among the three α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes. In addition, the mammalian BCKD complex contains two regulatory enzymes, the BCKD kinase and the BCKD phosphatase that regulate activity of the BCKD complex through phosphorylation (inactivation)/dephosphorylation (activation) cycles (4Harris R.A. Hawes J.W. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Sato J. Haskiewicz J. Hurley T.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 271-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The BCKD complex is organized around the cubic E2 core, to which 12 copies of E1, and unspecified copies of E3, the BCKD kinase, and the BCKD phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions (5Petti F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4881-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the BCKD multienzyme complex is estimated to be 4 × 106 daltons. The E2 chain of the human BCKD complex consists of three independently folded domains, i.e. the amino-terminal lipoyl-bearing domain (hbLBD), the interim E1/E3-binding domain, and the carboxyl-terminal inner core domain, that are linked through flexible linkers between domains. The inner core domain confers the subunit-binding site for forming the 24-meric structure. The E2 inner core structure from Azobacter vinelandii PDC shows that the 24 E2 subunits are assembled into 8 trimers with each occupying the corners of a hollow cube (6Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Schulze E. Kalk K.H. Westphal A.H. de Kok A. Hol W. Science. 1992; 255: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The active site resides on the interface formed by two neighboring subunits in a trimer. The CoA substrate must enter the 29-Å-long active site channel from the inside of the cube, whereas the lipoamide substrate enters from the outside. The chain folds of the E1/E3-binding domains of the Escherichia coliand Bacillus stearothermophilus KGDCs were determined by NMR spectroscopy (7Robien M.A. Clore G.M. Omichinski J.G. Perham R.N.

This remarkably small domain of 35 amino acid residues is made up of two parallel helices, a 5-residue helix-like turn and an irregular loop. In the E1/E3-binding domain of the bacterial PDC, one of the two helices binds one molecule of E1 and the other binds E3 but not simultaneously (9Mande S.S. Sarfaty S. Allen M.D. Perham R.N. Hol W. Structure. 1996; 4: 277-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The structures of these domains from the related PDC and KGDC complexes serve as bases for modeling interactions of the E2 component with other components of α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes (9Mande S.S.

After acyl transfer, the reduced lipoic acid moiety on LBD is re-oxidized by E3 with NAD+ as the ultimate electron acceptor. Thus, during the oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids, LBD plays a central role in substrate channeling by visiting the three active sites in cognate E1, E2, and E3 (12Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Moreover, in mammalian PDC, the inner LBD mediates the feedback regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity by NAD+/NADH and CoA/acetyl-CoA. LBD exerts this role by changing its oxidation, reduction, and acetylation state of the lipoyl group (13Radke G.A. Ono K. Ravindran S. Roche T.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 982-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Baker J.C. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G.L. Bhat T. Weissig H. Shindyalov I. Bourne P. J. Biol.

The overall structures of LBDs are highly conserved. In each case, the LBD consists of a flattened β-barrel made up of two 4-stranded β-sheets. The lipoyl lysine residue is located at the tip of a protruding β-turn in one sheet, with the amino and carboxyl termini adjacent to each other in the other sheet. A prominent surface loop, which is juxtaposed to the β-hairpin carrying the lipoyl lysine, is the site of interactions of LBD with E1 (21Jones D.D. Stott K.M. Howard M.J. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8448-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Wallis N.G. Allen M.D. Broadhurst R.W. Lessard I.A.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). LBDs from mammalian PDC and BCKD complexes are M2 autoantigens in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, although the mechanism of the autoimmune response is unknown (23Gershwin M.E. Mackay I.R. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 822-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bassendine M.F. Jones D.E. Yeaman S.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1997; 17: 490-496Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human mutations in the hbLBD have also been identified in maple syrup urine disease patients (2Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Vogelstein B. Childs B. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). However, to this day the structure of hbLBD has not been determined. Therefore, the structural basis of these human diseases involving the hbLBD remains unknown. Furthermore, crystal structures of the E1 (10Aevarsson A. Chuang J. Wynn M. Truley S. Chuang D.T. W. G.J, H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 15: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and the BCKD kinase (25Machius M. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Tomchick D.R. Chuang D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11218-11223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) component of the mammalian BCKD complex have been determined recently. It will be of great interest to dissect the mode of interactions between LBD and E1 as well as between LBD and the BCKD kinase at the atomic level. For these reasons, we undertook to determine the solution structure and dynamics of the hbLBD by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. hbLBD protein was purified from the BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli containing a plasmid that carried the gene of hbLBD under the control of T7 polymerase. To facilitate protein expression and purification, the recombinant lipoic acid-bearing domain was constructed to contain a total of 93 amino acids including an extra methionine residue at the amino terminus, a leucine, a glutamic acid, and six histidine residues at the carboxyl terminus. However, the wild type protein sequence is used to number the amino acid sequence described in this paper. The uniform15N- and/or 15N/13C-labeled proteins were obtained by growing the E. coli cells in M9 medium supplemented with 15NH4Cl and/or [U-13C]glucose. The protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, and the purity of the protein was found to be better than 95%, based on the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. NMR samples contain ∼2–3 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 10% (v/v) D2O. To prepare D2O samples, concentrated protein solutions were lyophilized and redissolved in D2O. NMR experiments were carried out at 310 K on Bruker AVANCE-600 or AMX-500 NMR spectrometers (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), both equipped with field gradient accessories. Experimental parameter settings were similar to that described previously (26Lin T.H. Chen C.P. Huang R.F. Lee Y.L. Shaw J.F. Huang T.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 363-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).15N-T1,15N-T2, and steady-state heteronuclear (1H-15N) NOE (whereT1 and T2 are, spin-lattice relaxation time (or longitudinal relaxation time) and spin-spin relaxation time (or transverse relaxation time), respectively) data were obtained at 310 K using standard pulse sequences as described previously (27Huang Y.T.

Water suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE sequence (30Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) with the States-time proportional phase increment quadrature detection mode in the indirect dimension (31Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Two sets of T1 andT2 experiments, and three pairs of the steady-state heteronuclear NOE experiments were collected at 600 MHz (14.1 T). Saturation was achieved by applying a train of 1H 120° pulses spaced at 20-ms intervals (32Markley J.L. Horsley W.J. Klein M.P. J. Chem. Phys. 1971; 55: 3604-3605Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). All data were transferred to SGI workstations (Silicon Graphics) for processing and further analysis using Bruker XWINNMR and AURELIA (AUtomatedREsonance LIne Assignment) software packages (Karlsruhe, Germany). The proton chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0 ppm. The15N and 13C chemical shift values were calculated using consensus Ξ ratios of 0.101329118 for15N/1H and 0.251449530 for13C/1H (33Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Assignment of the main chain HN, NH, Cα, Cβ, and C′ chemical shifts were based on CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments. Assignment of side chain resonances were achieved from analysis of1H-15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and1H-13C-edited HCCH-TOCSY, HBHANH, and HBHA(CO)NH spectra. The stereospecific assignments were obtained according to the method of Wagner et al. (34Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Go T. Schaumann N. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Assignment of β-protons was obtained from 3J coupling constants estimated from HNHB and HACAHB experiments and relative intensities of the NOEs from the NH-CβH and CαH-CβH protons in NOESY spectra. Assignments of the valine methyl resonances were obtained from the3Jαβ coupling and the NOE cross-peak intensities between the valine methyl protons and its NH protons (35Zuiderweg E.R. Scheek R.M. Kaptein R. Biopolymers. 1985; 24: 2257-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments of the NH2 group of Asn and Gln residues were made on the basis of chemical shift differences between the two protons, with the more downfield resonance assigned to the trans proton and the upfield resonance assigned to cis proton. H/D exchange rates of the amide protons were determined by recording a series of HSQC spectra in several time intervals after they had been redissolved in D2O. NOE distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (mixing time 50 and 100 ms) and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (100 ms) experiments. The NOE spectra were peak-picked and quantified using the automatic picking routine of AURELIA (36Neidig K.P. Geyer M. Gorler A. Antz C. Saffrich R. Beneicke W. Kalbitzer H.R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). NOESY cross-peaks were assigned both manually and automatically by ARIA (37Linge J.P. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) using peak lists from NOESY raw data and the chemical shift table for hbLBD. ARIA consisted of a series of routines that partially assigned and calibrated NOE data, performed violation analysis, and merged assigned data from different sources. These assignments were also reconfirmed manually, and the distance constraints (range from 1.8 to 6.0 Å) set by ARIA were used for final structure calculations. Backbone torsion angle, total of 59 φ, were obtained using the3JNHHα coupling constants derived from the HNHA experiment (26Lin T.H. Chen C.P. Huang R.F. Lee Y.L. Shaw J.F. Huang T.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 363-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the empirical Karplus equation (38Pardi A. Billeter M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In addition, 23 φ torsion restraints predicted from TALOS (39Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) were found to be consistent with NOE patterns and were included in the final structure calculation. Hydrogen bond constraints were included in calculations only if the corresponding amide protons were found to exchange slowly, and if the β-sheet inter-strand NHi-NHj, NHi-CαHj+1, and CαHi−1-CαHj+1NOE cross-peaks were observed (34Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Go T. Schaumann N. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Two restraints were assigned for each hydrogen bond, 2.5 to 3.3 Å for the NH-O distance and 1.5 to 2.3 Å for the HN-O distance. All structural calculations were done with a simulated annealing method using PARALLHDG forcefield, starting from random polypeptide chains, aided by the software ARIA interfaced with CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R.I. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The parameter setting was similar to that described by Nilges et al. (41Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Dongoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The initial temperature for torsion dynamics was 2000 K with a 50 K decrease per cycle of dynamics. The temperature after the first cooling step was 1000 K, and the final temperature after second cooling step was set to 50 K. Nine iterations (50 structures for the ninth iteration and 20 structures for other iterations) were performed for the last ARIA run, from which 941 unambiguous NOEs and 33 ambiguous NOEs were manually reconfirmed. A total of 974 distance constraints, 164 dihedral angles, and 42 hydrogen bonds were used to generate the final 100 structures (Table I). The best 20 lowest energy structures were further analyzed.Table ISummary of structural constraints and structural statisticsAll NOE distance restraints1-aFinal NOE restraints defined by the program ARIA.974 Unambiguous total 94 Ambiguous 33Total dihedral angles164 φ (degree) 82 Ψ (degree)1-bDihedral angles predicted from the program TALOS. 70 χ1(degree)1-bDihedral angles predicted from the program TALOS. 12 Hydrogen bonds 42RMSD from geometrical analysis Bonds (Å)0.0021 ± 0.0001 Bond angles (degree)0.400 ± 0.002 Improper torsions (degree)0.317 ± 0.002Atomic RMSD (secondary region,1-cResidues 3–7, 18–23, 29–32, 37–42, 46–50, 54–60, 66–68, and 73–79. pairwise) Backbone (N, Cα, C′)0.39 ± 0.09 All heavy atoms0.91 ± 0.15Ramachandran statistics Most favorable region (%)80.4 Additional allowed region (%)18.5 Generally allowed region (%) 1.11-a Final NOE restraints defined by the program ARIA.1-b Dihedral angles predicted from the program TALOS.1-c Residues 3–7, 18–23, 29–32, 37–42, 46–50, 54–60, 66–68, and 73–79.

The coordinates of the present structure of hbLBD have been deposited in Protein Data Bank codes 1k8m and 1k8o. The structures of these domains were analyzed with the programs InsightII (MSI), GRASP (42Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar), MOLMOL (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol.

NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar) on SGI computers. Relaxation rates and NOE enhancements were calculated from peak heights of the resonances in a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The longitudinal and transverse relaxation times T1 andT2 were obtained by a two-parameter nonlinear optimization of a single exponential function using Marquardt-based nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific). The uncertainties in the measured peak-height were set equal to the root mean square base-line noise in the spectra. The uncertainties in R1 andR2 (where R1 andR2 are longitudinal relaxation rate constant and transverse relaxation rate constant, respectively) were obtained from curve fitting with SigmaPlot, and the errors in NOE were the standard deviation of three pairs of repeated NOE experiments. Local magnetic field fluctuation generated by global molecular tumbling and internal motion leads to the relaxation of the 15N-1H spin system. The 15N relaxation rates and1H-15N NOE at the currently available high field are dominated by 1H-15N dipolar and by 15N chemical shift anisotropic interactions, and are given by Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 (45Abragam A.

Niu C.H. Silverston J.V. Bavavo A. Torchia D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 2378-2383Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Dynamic parameters are contained in the spectral density function,J(ω) at five frequencies: 0, ωN, ωH − ωN, ωH, and ωH + ωN. The exact expression ofJ(ω) depends on the motional model used (47Woessner D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 647-654Crossref Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 48Kinoshita K. Kawato Jr., S. Ikegami A. Biophys.

Complete determination of the five spectral density functions requires determination of at least five independent relaxation parameters (54Peng J.W. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 98: 308-332Google Scholar,55Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8571-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) that are not easy to obtain. Fortunately, it was shown experimentally that the spectral density function is a slow varying function at high frequency between ωH − ωNand ωH + ωN. With the additional assumption that J(ω) = λ1/ω2 + λ2, where the first and second terms represent contributions to J(ω) from the overall rotation and internal dynamics, respectively, and substituting a single value ofJ(0.87ωH) for a linear combinations ofJ(ωH − ωN),J(ωH) and J(ωH + ωN) in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 gives rise to the following Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7 (56Farrow N.A.

TheJ(0.870ωH) is essentially the same as the <Javg(ωH)> of Lefevreet al. (57Lefevre L.-F. Dayie K.T. Peng J.W. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2674-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and J(ωH + ωN) of Ishima and Nagayama (58Ishima R. Nagayama K. J. Magn.

For a rigid globule molecule the overall rotational correlation time τc can be obtained from spectral density functions as described previously (59Bracken C. Carr P.A. Cavanagh J. Palmer A.G. J. Mol.

Automated resonance assignment schemes, based on CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO experiments, were employed to facilitate the assignments of the main chain HN, NH, Cα, Cβ, and C′ resonances (60Lukin J. Gove A. Talukdar S. Ho C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 61Atreya H.S. Sahu S.C. Chary K.V. Govil G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions (pH 7.5 at 310 K), the Trp23 indole Hɛ1 and the five pairs of side chain NH2 for Asn63 and all four glutamine residues (Gln2, Gln6, Gln33, and Gln41) were observed. However, no signals were detected for the backbone amides of Met−1, Gly1, Gln2, Glu13, Gly14, Arg16, Asp43, Asp84, and the six His tag residues in the carboxyl terminus, suggesting that these HN nuclei are exposed and undergo fast solvent exchange. Assignments of side chain resonances were achieved by analysis of 1H-15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and 1H-13C-edited HCCH-TOCSY, HBHANH, and HBHA(CO)NH spectra. Nearly all 1H,15N, and 13C resonances were assignments for more than 80% of the spin systems, and the chemical shift table was available as entry 5078 in Bio Magnetic Resonance Bank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu).

Infected animals expressed seven blood group A-like structures that were all absent in the control animals. The blood group A nature of these epitopes was confirmed by blood group A reactivity of the prepared mucins, of which Muc2 was one. Transferase assays and Northern blotting on small intestines from infected animals showed that an α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase similar to the human blood group A glycosyltransferase had been induced. The expression was a transient event, with a maximum at day 6 of the 13-day-long infection. The rat blood group A glycosyltransferase was cloned, revealing two forms with an amino acid similarity of 95%. Both types had blood group A transferase activity and were probably allelic because none of 12 analyzed inbred strains carried both types. The second type was found in outbred rats and in one inbred strain. First generation offspring of inbred rats of each type were heterozygous, further supporting the allelic hypothesis. The transient induction and the large allelic variation could suggest that glycosyltransferases are part of a dynamic system altering mucins and other glycoconjugates as a protecting mechanism against microbial challenges.

The transient induction and the large allelic variation could suggest that glycosyltransferases are part of a dynamic system altering mucins and other glycoconjugates as a protecting mechanism against microbial challenges. The gastrointestinal tract is covered by a mucus layer, effectively protecting the epithelial cells from the hostile milieu including microorganisms and at the same time allowing digested nutrients and other smaller molecules to traverse. Microorganisms bind to intestinal mucus and epithelial cells; some of this binding is with high specificity to glycan epitopes (1.Karlsson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 309-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). To maintain the protective layer despite continuous damaging processes, especially by these intestinal microorganisms, a system with a continuous mucus renewal is demanded. In the intestine, a majority of the mucus is produced by the goblet cells interspersed between the enterocytes. The matrix in the mucus is made up of gel-forming mucins. These are highly glycosylated proteins, where up to 80% of the mass is from O-linked oligosaccharides. Cloning and sequencing of mucin genes have revealed that the sites for glycosylation are located in domains of long stretches of protease-resistant sequences rich in the amino acids serine and threonine together with proline. Because these domains are typical for mucins, but also found in other proteins, they have been named mucin domains. Up until now, 13 human mucin genes have been identified and fully or partly sequenced (2.Moniaux N. Escande F. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Batra S.K. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D1192-D1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 57: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), in addition to mucins identified from other species. The major intestinal mucin in rat is the Muc2 mucin, and the two mucin domains of this mucin have previously been isolated as two highly glycosylated peptides of 650 and 335 kDa, respectively (5.Carlstedt I.

Gendler S.J. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The rat Muc2, as well as its human homologue MUC2, belongs to a class of gel forming mucins, gaining their viscous properties by oligomerization into large mucin complexes via the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges between mucin subunits (3.Perez-Vilar J. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31751-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 6.Karlsson N.G. Johansson M.E. Asker N. Karlsson H. Gendler S.J. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides clustered on the mucin domains show a remarkable diversity (7.Hounsell E.F. Davies M.J. Renouf D.V. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These mucin oligosaccharides have a proximal GalNAc directly linked to serine or threonine of the peptide core. The GalNAc can be further glycosylated on both C-3 and C-6, and the extended branches often have blood group antigens as terminating structures. One of these is the blood group A antigen, Fucα1–2(GalNAcα1–3)Galβ1, originally described as a blood group antigen present on human erythrocytes. Today it is well established that blood group A antigens also are present on other tissues, as well as in other animals, such as pig and rat (8.Hansson G.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 228: 465-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The blood group A epitope can be found both on glycosphingolipids and on various glycoproteins asN-linked or O-linked epitopes (9.Race R.R. Sanger R. Blood Groups in Man. Plenum Press, New York1975Google Scholar). Responsible for the expression of the blood group A antigen in human is the blood group A glycosyltransferase gene (10.Yamamoto F. Marken J. Tsuji T. White T. Clausen H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), encoding an α1–3GalNAc-transferase that acts in the final step of the biosynthesis of this epitope, adding a GalNAc to the galactose of the blood group H epitope Fucα1–2Galβ1. Most rat strains carry the blood group A determinant in the large intestine, whereas only a few do this in the small intestine (11.Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.A. Leffler H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 114: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12.Bouhours D. Hansson G.C. Bouhours J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The expression of blood group A active glycosphingolipids appeared at weaning in a strain expressing this epitope in the small intestine (13.Bouhours J.F. Bouhours D. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16370-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In rats infected by the small intestinal parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, an induced goblet cell hyperplasia has been shown, and at the time of expulsion (around day 13 of the infection) an increased amount of mucus has been found (14.Miller H.R. Nawa Y. Exp. Parasitol. 1979; 47: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15.Miller H.R. Huntley J.F. Dawson A. Bourne F.J. Current Topics in Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science. 12. Nijhoff, The Hague1981: 402-440Google Scholar). Studies of lectin binding to tissue sections have indicated a glycosylation alteration on the secreted mucins during the infection in both normal and hypothymic rats (16.Ishikawa N. Horii Y. Nawa Y. Immunology. 1993; 78: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ishikawa N. Horii Y. Oinuma T. Suganuma T. Nawa Y. Immunology. 1994; 81: 480-486PubMed Google Scholar). An increased reactivity with the helix pomatia (HPA) 1The abbreviations used are: HPAhelix pomatia agglutininGCgas chromatographyMSmass spectrometryHexNAcN-acetylhexosamineRACErapid amplification of cDNA ends lectin, recognizing terminal GalNAc-α, was observed in the small intestine of infected rats. helix pomatia agglutinin gas chromatography mass spectrometry N-acetylhexosamine rapid amplification of cDNA ends In a previous study we reported glycosylation alterations among sialylated oligosaccharides on the rat Muc2 mucin during N. brasiliensis infection (18.Karlsson N.G. Olson F.J. Jovall P.Å. Andersch Y. Enerbäck L. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Detailed structural characterization of sialylated Muc2 oligosaccharides prepared from small intestinal mucosal scrapings of infected rats at different stages of the infection revealed two events of altered glycosylation. The amount of bound NeuGc was decreased in favor of NeuAc during the infection, and a Sda/Cad-like terminal epitope, NeuAc/NeuGcα2–3(GalNAcβ1–4)Galβ1, appeared late in the infection cycle. These events could be connected to the regulation of a NeuAc hydroxylase and a yet unidentified GalNAc transferase. However, none of these alterations could explain the observed increased reactivity of the HPA lectin in infected rats (16.Ishikawa N. Horii Y. Nawa Y. Immunology. 1993; 78: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Ishikawa N. Horii Y. Oinuma T. Suganuma T. Nawa Y. Immunology. 1994; 81: 480-486PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have analyzed the neutral oligosaccharides of the Muc2 mucin in the small intestine of N. brasiliensis-infected rats and found a transient induction of a blood group A-like terminal epitope caused by the expression of a blood group A-type GalNAc transferase. Two alleles with a remarkably high sequence difference were found. Inbred GOT-W (8.Hansson G.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1988; 228: 465-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,11.Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.A. Leffler H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 114: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or outbred Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g, B&K Universal, Sollentuna, Sweden), both blood group A-negative in the small intestine and blood group A-positive in the large intestine, were infected subcutaneously with N. brasiliensis third stage larvae (19.Wingren U. Enerbäck L. Ahlman H. Allenmark S. Dahlström A. Histochemistry. 1983; 77: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The rats were killed by decapitation after ether anesthesia, and the mucosae from the small intestine was collected and stored frozen at −80 °C or immediately homogenized in 6.0 m guanidinium chloride as described (5.Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellets collected after centrifugation were repeatedly extracted (two to four times) in the above buffer and solubilized by reduction and alkylation (5.Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These samples, referred to as “insoluble” mucins, were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. Oligosaccharides were released from the insoluble mucins (5 mg), using 0.05 m KOH containing 1.0m NaBH4 (5.Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral oligosaccharides were isolated after applying the oligosaccharide mixtures to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column and eluting with methanol (20.Karlsson N.G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Permethylation of the oligosaccharides was done using methyl iodide and NaOH in Me2SO (21.Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-218Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar, 22.Larson G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Pimlott W. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 161: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). GC and GC-MS were performed using 11–12-m columns (inner diameter, 0.25 mm) with 0.02–0.04 μm of cross-linked PS264 prepared as described (20.Karlsson N.G. Karlsson H. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The temperature program and parameters were as described (23.Karlsson N.G. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Johansson M.E. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27025-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reduced and alkylated small intestinal insoluble mucins were coated onto microtiter plates and washed and blocked as described (24.Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used (100 μl) were the monoclonal antibodies anti-blood group H diluted 1:50 (DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-blood group A diluted 1:50 (DAKO), anti-blood group A type 2 (A005) diluted 1:50 (Monocarb, Lund, Sweden), and anti-Tn (1E3) hybridoma supernatant diluted 1:10 (25.David L. Nesland J.M. Clausen H. Carneiro F. Sobrinho-Simoes M. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scan. Suppl. 1992; 27: 162-172Google Scholar). Lectin binding assay was performed using biotinylated HPA (Sigma) in concentration 1 μg/ml. For immunochemical detection of Muc2, insoluble mucins (1–5 μg) were coated onto microtiter plates by a slow evaporation of a water solution at 37 °C for 12 h. Alternatively, 0.5 μg of insoluble mucins (100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline) were incubated for 3 h in microtiter wells precoated with 1 μg of HPA (Sigma). The plates for detection of Muc2 were further dried in an exicator for 2 h and treated with gaseous HF in an HF apparatus (Peptide Institute, Tokyo, Japan) for 18 h at room temperature. The samples were recoated in their original wells by adding 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and incubating for 24 h at 37 °C. Washing and blocking were performed as described above, followed by incubating for 2 h with anti-gpA polyclonal rabbit antiserum (diluted 1:100) (26.Hansson G.C. Baeckström D. Carlstedt I. Klinga-Levan K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fluoroimmunoassays and lectin assays were performed as described (24.Baeckström D. Hansson G.C. Nilsson O. Johansson C. Gendler S.J. Lindholm L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21537-21547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using secondary goat anti-rabbit antiserum, goat anti-mouse antiserum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), or streptavidin, all labeled with europium. A 30-cm piece was cut 20 cm proximal to the distal end of the small intestine from infected animals. Mucosal scrapings were collected and homogenized, and the blood group A transferase activity was measured as described (23.Karlsson N.G. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Johansson M.E. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27025-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using 65 mg (wet weight) of the pellet reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated together with LNF-1 and UDP-[14C]GalNAc. The enzyme activity was measured as the retarded fraction of radioactively labeled material from a blood group A affinity column (23.Karlsson N.G. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Johansson M.E. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27025-27034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An EMBL-3 rat genomic DNA phage library (CLONTECH) was screened with a cDNA probe (P718), derived from the human blood group A glycosyltransferase (10.Yamamoto F. Marken J. Tsuji T. White T. Clausen H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and corresponding to nucleotides 148–865 of the human cDNA sequence. Positive recombinants were purified, digested with EcoRI, and analyzed by Southern blot using the P718 probe. Two hybridization-positive fragments (4.0 and 3.5 kb) were obtained and digested by HinfI. The products were ligated into the pUC18 vector and subjected to DNA sequencing. One clone, from the 4.0-kb fragment digest, contained an insert of 406 bp, of which a stretch was 84.4% similar to exon six of the human blood group A gene coding sequence. A 129-bp DNA probe (P129) was made by PCR amplification from rat genomic DNA with primers derived from the candidate exon sequence. mRNA was prepared as previously described (6.Karlsson N.G. Johansson M.E. Asker N. Karlsson H. Gendler S.J. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) from a 20-cm section of the proximal part of the small intestine from infected animals, electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with the32P-labeled P120 DNA probe. Both hybridization-positive fragments (4.0 and 3.5 kb) were also ligated into the pBluescript II SK− vector and subjected to DNA sequencing. All 7.5 kb were sequenced and submitted to GenBank™ (accession number AF296761). The two fragments were shown to be adjacent in the rat genome by sequencing of the uncleaved genomic clone in the junction region. Genomic DNA sequencing was performed with the Cy™ 5 Thermo Sequenase™ dye terminator kit (Amersham Biosciences). The reactions were analyzed on an ALF Express using the ReproGel™ Long Read (Amersham Biosciences). The 7.5-kb rat genomic DNA sequence was compared with the seven exons of the human blood group A glycosyltransferase (27.Bennett E.P. Steffensen R. Clausen H. Weghuis D.O. van Kessel A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and was found to contain regions similar to human exons 3–7. From this, a partial cDNA sequence of the rat transferase was proposed, containing the stop codon in exon 7. To obtain the sequence of the 5′ terminus, a 5′ RACE was performed with the SMART™RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 5′ RACE primer (GH137A) was constructed from the rat genomic region similar to human exon 5. The template was small intestinal mRNA, prepared as previously described (6.Karlsson N.G. Johansson M.E. Asker N. Karlsson H. Gendler S.J. Carlstedt I. Hansson G.C. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) from an infected outbred rat (day 6 of infection). In parallel, a second 5′ sequence was obtained from GenBank™ (accession number AF264018). Two cDNA clones, denoted A(1) and A(2), were constructed by reverse transcription-PCR on mRNA from colon of inbred GOT-W rats for A(1) or on the same mRNA used for the 5′ RACE for A(2), with primer pairs GH170B/GH170R for A(1) and GH170A/GH170R for A(2). The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector using the pcDNA 3.1 Directional TOPO expression kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to obtain the expression plasmids pA(1) and pA(2). Sequencing of the 5′ RACE clones and cDNA clones were done by GATC Biotech AG (Constance, Germany) or MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). The expression plasmids pA(1) and pA(2) were transiently transfected into HeLa cells using the Geneporter transfection system (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. 72 h after transfection, the cells were immunostained for blood group A epitopes on their cell surface. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with tissue culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with or without monoclonal anti-blood group A antibody A003 (Monocarb, Lund, Sweden) diluted 1:5 in serum-containing medium, washed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (DAKO) diluted 1:100 in serum-containing medium. After the staining, coverslips were mounted with Pro-Long antifade (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for fluorescence microscopy. To obtain genomic DNA from the same rats as mRNA, a method was developed to prepare genomic DNA by extraction from previously collected intestinal mucosal scrapings stored at −80 °C. Approximately 250 μl of mucosal scrapings were dissolved without homogenization in 10 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate with 1% mercaptoethanol. After incubation at room temperature for 4 h, 0.5 ml of 10% laurylsarcosinate was added to the mixture, followed by 2 m KAc, pH 5.5 (0.5 ml), and 1 m HAc (0.8 ml). Room temperature 99.5% ethanol was added while shaking, and the DNA was precipitated at −20 °C for a minimum of 2 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × gat 4 °C for 20 min. The pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of 7.5m GuHCl with 10 mm dithiothreitol added. DNA was precipitated again by incubation at −20 °C after the addition of 2 m KAc, pH 5.5 (0.25 ml), and room temperature 99.5% ethanol (12.5 ml). Centrifugation and precipitation were repeated once. After an additional centrifugation, the DNA was dissolved in 1.4 ml of DNA extraction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with proteinase K added (0.5 μg/μl). The samples were incubated at 56 °C overnight, and DNA was precipitated by the addition of one volume of isopropanol. DNA was spooled around a pipette tip, transferred to a new tube, and dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Primer pairs specific for rat A(1) (GH158C/GH183C) or rat A(2) (GH158A/GH183A) were constructed. PCR was performed on the expression plasmids pA(1) and pA(2), on genomic DNA prepared from small intestinal mucosal scrapings from the same rats, on genomic DNA prepared from inbred rat strains BN/Mol, COP/Mol, DA/Mol, F344/Mol, GK/Mol, LE/Mol, LEW/Mol, NEDH/Mol, PVG/Mol, SPRD-Cu3/Han, WF/Mol, and WKY/Mol, and on genomic DNA from an animal from an F1 cross between DA and LEW. The GH158C/GH183C and GH158A/GH183A primer pairs were also used in combination with primers for β-actin in a multiplex PCR on cDNA libraries derived from small and large intestinal mRNA of infected rats. The β-actin primers were TGG CCT TAG GGT GCA GGG GG (3′ oligonucleotide) and GTG GGC CGC TCT AGG CAC CA (5′ oligonucleotide) with an expected amplified fragment length of 270 bp. For PCR, an annealing temperature of 70 °C was used, the Mg2+ concentration was 2 mm, and PCR was performed over 25 or 30 cycles on a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 machine (Perkin Elmer). Rats were infected with the intestinal dwelling parasite N. brasiliensis. The two rat types used, the inbred GOT-W strain (Sprague-Dawley type) and outbred Sprague-Dawley rats, are blood group A-negative in the small intestine and blood group A-positive in the large intestine. The parasite was introduced subcutaneously and migrated via the lungs to the small intestine, where it remained until expulsion after 12 or 13 days of infection. Mucosal scrapings from Sprague-Dawley rats were collected at different stages of the infection, and the insoluble mucin complex (5.Carlstedt I. Herrmann A. Karlsson H. Sheehan J. Fransson L.Å. Hansson G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18771-18781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated after repeated extraction with guanidinium chloride. As described before, the amount of collected insoluble mucins increased up to day 12–13 and then quickly reverted to normal after parasite expulsion (18.Karlsson N.G. Olson F.J. Jovall P.Å. Andersch Y. Enerbäck L. Hansson G.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides were released from the insoluble mucins collected at different stages of the infection. The neutral oligosaccharides were isolated as the nonretarded fraction from an anion exchange column. After permethylation, the oligosaccharides were analyzed by high temperature GC and GC-MS. Infected Sprague-Dawley rats showed not only the normally expressed compounds but also seven additional oligosaccharides appearing transiently during the infection. In Fig. 1, the gas chromatograms of the permethylated oligosaccharides from days 0 and 7 are shown. Structural characterization by GC-MS (Table I) revealed that the seven induced oligosaccharides all had a terminal trisaccharide epitope similar to the blood group A determinant GalNAcα1–3(Fucα1–2)Galβ1. The general fragmentation features of permethylated oligosaccharides are described by the mass spectrum of the blood group A-type structure 5.2 (Fig. 2 and Table I), deduced to be a branched pentasaccharide containing an A type 1 structure by the fragment ions at m/z 189 (Fuc-), m/z 260 (HexNAc-), m/z 638 (Fuc-(HexNAc-)Hex-), andm/z 883 (Fuc-(HexNAc-)Hex-HexNAc-). The fragment ion at m/z 693 is due to further fragmentation of the ion m/z 883 by the loss of a fucose unit (m/z 189) and an additional proton. This type of fragmentation is indicative for type 1 chains (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ1-) as is the lack of a fragment ion at m/z 182 (29.Smith E.L. McKibbin J.M. Karlsson K.A. Pascher I. Samuelsson B.E.

The binding of the HPA lectin (GalNAc-α binding) was found to coincide with the blood group A activity (Fig. 3 A) and the appearance of blood group A-type oligosaccharides in the gas chromatograms. No obvious change of the amount of N-acetylgalactosaminol was found in the GC-MS, and no reactivity with a monoclonal antibody against the Tn-antigen (GalNAcα1-polypeptide) was detected (Fig. 3 A), thus it was less likely that the increased HPA binding was due to the alteration of Tn-antigen level. When the experiment was repeated by infecting a second set of rats (infection 2), the induction of blood group A activity occurred"

L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c requires the lipoyl-lysine prosthetic group and specificity residues that distinguish L2 from the other lipoyl domains (L1 in E2 and L3 in the E3-binding component). The L2-surface structure contributing to binding was mapped by comparing the capacities of well folded mutant or lipoyl analog-substituted L2 domains to interfere with E2 activation by competitively binding to PDP1 or PDP1c. Our results reveal the critical importance of a regional set of residues near the lipoyl group and of the octanoyl but not the dithiolane ring structure of the lipoyl group. At the other end of the lipoyl domain, substitution of Glu182 by alanine or glutamine removed L2 binding to PDP1 or PDP1c, and these substitutions for the neighboring Glu179 also greatly hindered complex formation (E179A > E179Q). Among 11 substitutions in L2 at sites of major surface residue differences between the L1 and L2 domains, only the conversion of Val-Gln181 located between the critical Glu179 and Glu182 to the aligned Ser-Leu sequence of the L1 domain greatly reduced L2 binding. Certain modified L2 altered E2 activation of PDP1 differently than PDP1c, supporting significant impact of the regulatory PDP1r subunit on PDP1 binding to L2. Our results indicate hydrophobic binding via the extended aliphatic structure of the lipoyl group and required adjacent L2 structure anchor PDP1 by acting in concert with an acidic cluster at the other end of the domain.

Mammalian PDC is organized around a central framework formed by assembly of 60 E2 subunits. E2 consists of four independently folded domains connected to each other by mobile linker regions 20–30 amino acids in length (1.Thekkumkara T.J. Ho L. Wexler I.D. Pons G. Lui T.-C. Patel M.S.

Association of 20 trimer units of E2's C-terminal domain produces a central cavity in the shape of a dodecahedron. At its surface, this assembled inner core is connected by the first linker region to a 5-kDa domain that binds the E1 component (5.Rahmatullah M. Gopalakrishnan S. Andrews P.C. Chang C.L. Radke G.A.

Then, set off by two more linker regions in the E2 structure, are two ∼10-kDa lipoyl domains: an interior one, L2, and an NH2-terminal one, L1. An E3-binding protein (E3BP) has a multidomain structure similar to E2 consisting of three linker region-connected globular domains (8.Jilka J.M. Rahmatullah M. Kazemi M. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

In Ca2+-sensitive tissues, the pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (PDP1) is the dominant phosphatase isoform (20.Huang B. Gudi R. Wu P. Harris R.A. Hamilton J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17680-17688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PDP1 catalyzes a Mg2+-requiring, Ca2+-stimulated dephosphorylation and activation of E1 (15.Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 227-234Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21.Hucho F. Randall D.D. Roche T.E. Burgett M.W. Pelley J.W. Reed L.J. Arch. Bioch.

PDP1 activity is enhanced manyfold when the phosphorylated E1 and PDP1 are bound by the E2 60-mer (23.Petit F.H. Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24.Yang D. Song J. Wagenknecht T. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6361-6369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ca2+ stimulation requires E2 because PDP1 binds to E2 via an interaction that requires Ca2+ (23.Petit F.H. Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) at micromolar levels (22.Denton R.M. Randle P.J. Martin B.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The magnitude of this enhancement (typically 7–16-fold) primarily depends on the level of free phosphorylated E1 in the absence of E2 because kinetically it results in a near saturated activity in the presence of E2 being compared with an activity that varies greatly with the level of phosphorylated E1. Thus, there is a major decrease in the apparentK m of PDP1 for phosphorylated E1 upon concentrating PDP1 along with phosphorylated E1 at the surface of the E2 core (23.Petit F.H. Roche T.E. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 49: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also causes an ∼2-fold decrease in theK m of PDP1 for Mg2+ (25.Thomas A.P. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PDP1 is composed of two subunits (26.Teague W.M. Pettit F.H. Wu T.-L. Silberman S.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5585-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27.Pratt M.L. Maher J.F. Roche T.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 125: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Its catalytic subunit (PDP1c, mass = 52.6 kDa) is in the phosphatase 2C class but shares only ∼20% sequence identity with rat cytosolic α and β isoforms of phosphatase 2C (28.Lawson J.E. Niu S.-D. Browning K.S. Le Trong H. Yan J. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8987-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The other subunit (PDP1r, mass = 96 kDa) serves a regulatory role by elevating the concentration of Mg2+ required for efficient PDP1c catalysis (29.Yan J. Lawson J.E. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4953-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The PDP1r subunit is a flavoprotein with a bound FAD; the sequence of PDP1r is distantly related to the mitochondrial flavoprotein, dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (30.Lawson J.E. Park S.H. Mattison A.R. Yan J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31625-31629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which functions in choline degradation. Spermine and, to a lesser degree, other polyamines reduce theK m of PDP1 for Mg2+ (31.Damuni Z. Humphreys J.S. Reed L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), probably by binding to PDP1r to reverse the effect of this subunit in elevating the Mg2+ responsiveness (29.Yan J. Lawson J.E. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4953-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The PDP2 isoform has an even higher K m for Mg2+, which is reduced from >15 mm to 3 mm by direct interaction of spermine with recombinantly produced PDP2 that consists just of a catalytic subunit. Rat PDP2 shares 55% sequence identity with rat PDP1c, but PDP2 is not activated by Ca2+ (20.Huang B. Gudi R. Wu P. Harris R.A. Hamilton J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17680-17688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A similar diminution in the concentration dependence of PDP activity for Mg2+ is produced by insulin and sustained in permeabilized mitochondria prepared from insulin-treated adipose tissue (32.Thomas A.P. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This probably involves a change in the activity of PDP2, which is located in adipose tissue (20.Huang B. Gudi R. Wu P. Harris R.A. Hamilton J. Popov K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17680-17688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The L2 domain of E2 selectively binds PDP1 by an association that specifically engages L2's lipoyl prosthetic group (33.Chen G. Wang L. Liu S. Chang C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28064-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34.Yang D. Gong X. Yakhnin A. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

PDP1c, alone, undergoes Ca2+-dependent binding and activation (28.Lawson J.E. Niu S.-D. Browning K.S. Le Trong H. Yan J. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8987-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) via an association with the L2 domain (Ref. 35.Choi W.S. Yan J. McCarthy D.B. Seung H.P. Reed L.J. Protein Exp. Purif. 2000; 20: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, and data herein). Using gel-anchored GST-L2, Ca2+-aided binding has been used to selectively purify PDP1 (33.Chen G. Wang L. Liu S. Chang C. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28064-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and PDP1c (35.Choi W.S. Yan J. McCarthy D.B. Seung H.P. Reed L.J. Protein Exp. Purif. 2000; 20: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Ca2+ does not bind to either PDP1c or the L2, alone; binding requires the combination of the catalytic subunit and the free lipoyl domain. 2ITC studies indicate that neither PDP1c nor L2, alone, directly interact with <100 μm Ca2+and ITC, analytical ultracentrifugation, and other studies indicate L2 and PDP1c bind each in forming a tight Ca2+ binding site (Kd < 3 μm); similar complex formation by PDP1 is enhanced by Mg2+ (A. Turkan, Y. Hiromasa, and T. E. Roche, manuscript in preparation). Portions of these studies have been described elsewhere (11.Turkan A. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: A1528Google Scholar). This suggests either a bridging role of Ca2+ between L2 and PDP1c or a stepwise interaction in which Ca2+ stabilizes the complex by binding at a site induced by a precursory (weaker) interaction between PDP1c and the L2 domain. To understand and compare the lipoyl-domain specific, Ca2+-dependent binding of the L2 domain to PDP1 and PDP1c, we have mapped the effects of changes in the L2 structure both by site-specific changes in surface amino acid residues and by substitution of analogs of the lipoyl prosthetic group. Our results reveal the importance of residues near the lipoyl group and the hydrophobic character of the lipoyl group as well as the critical contribution of specific acidic residues at the opposite half of the folded domain that are separated by required, L2 domain-specific sequence. Some differences between interactions with PDP1 and PDP1c are also detected. Bovine PDC and resolved E1 containing bovine PDK were isolated as previously described (36.Roche T.E. Cate R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37.Linn T.C. Pelley J.W. Pettit F.H. Hucho F. Randall D.D. Reed L.J. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1982; 125: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is more stable than the highly purified PDP1 prepared by affinity chromatography using GST-L2, most assays of PDP1 employed PDP1 from this less purified fraction (40–50% PDP1 based both on PDP1 specific activity and staining patterns after SDS-PAGE).Escherichia coli expressing PDP1c was provided by Lester J. Reed and PDP1c prepared by modification of the procedure described by Choi et al. (35.Choi W.S. Yan J. McCarthy D.B. Seung H.P. Reed L.J. Protein Exp. Purif. 2000; 20: 128-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The primary modification was that extracts of PDP1c were allowed to interact with the GST-L2 anchored on GSH-Sepharose overnight at 4°C prior to washing and then eluting by Ca2+ chelation using EGTA. From 10 g of cells, 25–30 mg of nearly homogeneous PDP1c was routinely obtained. L2, mutant L2, nonlipoylated L2, and L2 with lipoate analogs enzymatically attached to nonlipoylated L2 were prepared as previously described (38.Gong X. Peng T. Yakhnin A. Zolkiewski M. Quinn J.

Bovine PDP1 activity was determined using phosphorylated bovine PDC (PDCb) by measuring the rate of release of [32P]phosphate from PDCb (27.Pratt M.L. Maher J.F. Roche T.E. Eur. J.

The inhibition of PDP activity by various lipoyl domain constructs, added at the indicated levels, was determined as previously described for wild type L2 domain (33.Chen G. Wang L. Liu S. Chang C.

Unless otherwise indicated, PDP1 or PDP1c was added to reaction mixtures equilibrated at 30 °C for 60 s and then PDP activity initiated by addition of Mg2+ to a final concentration of 10 mm. Final reaction mixtures also contained: 50 mm MOPS-K (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA. 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1.0 mm EGTA, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mg/ml Pluronic-F-68, 20 μg of phosphorylated PDC, and 0.02–0.03 units of PDP activity (27.Pratt M.L.

After 120 s, reactions were quenched with 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, vortexed immediately, and after a 30-min incubation on ice, 90 μl was withdrawn and the released [32P]phosphate determined (27.Pratt M.L.

Assays, in which either a phosphatase source or Mg2+ were not added, gave similar negligible backgrounds, which were subtracted from the above activities. Using this standard assay procedure and 10 mmMg2+, PDP1 (DEAE-purified) had a specific activity in the range of 500–650 nmol·min−1·mg−1 and PDP1c had specific activities in the range of 1300–1600 nmol·min−1·mg−1. In the limited studies in which the free Ca2+ level was controlled by EGTA-Ca buffer, the level of free Ca2+ was calculated as previously described (36.Roche T.E. Cate R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 664-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with appropriate corrections for Mg2+binding and for Ca2+ contamination in reagents. All assays were conducted at least in duplicate with control assays (no lipoyl domain present) conducted in duplicate at the beginning and end of the series of assays. The deviations from the average values for the control, E2-activated PDP1 or PDP1c activities, were normally within ±4% of the average value. Somewhat higher percentile, but usually lower absolute deviations (typical data shown in Figs. 8 and 9) were observed for the average values for the lower (well inhibited) rates. Given these deviations, the percentage of inhibition values shown in the tables (a difference of the average control rate and an average inhibited rate) could be as high as ±7% so that 5% inhibition is within experimental error little or no inhibition. With a given PDCb substrate, the average percentage of inhibition values obtained for a specific L2 construct in different experiments fell within these deviations and the trends (strong to weak inhibition) were invariant with all PDCb substrates. However, the absolute percentage of inhibition by various L2 structures (including wild-type L2) varied somewhat more with different PDCb substrates. Tables I, II, and IVcombine data from several experiments. The data are normalized as described in the legend to Table I for convenient comparison of the trends that were repeatedly observed.Table IPercentage of inhibition of E2-activated PDP1 and PDP1c activity by native and mutated L2 for mutations introduced near the lipoylated end of L2 domainL2 structureL2 structure concentrationL2 structure concentration6 μm12 μm6 μm12 μm% inhibition of PDP1 activity% inhibition of PDP1c activityWild type51673350L140A0204S141A4767T143A66774561T145A31482240D172N54814K173A46911A174S5.53.51831R196Q57722643D197A4259Assays were conducted and deviations of individual phosphatase activities were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data for L2 construct effects on PDP1 or PDP1c are from a series of experiments; values are a ratio of the observed percentage of inhibition determined to the percentage of inhibition of wild type L2 in that experiment times the average value for wild type L2 shown here for PDP1 or PDP1c.

https://openalex.org/W2039115553,"Abstract Carboxyl-terminal deletion of apoB-100 may impair its triglyceride (TG)-transporting capability and alter its catabolism. Here, we compare our newly generated apoB gene (Apob)-targeted apoB-27.6-bearing mice to our previously reported apoB-38.9 mice to understand further the relationship between the size of a truncated apoB variant and its function/metabolismin vivo. The apoB-27.6-specifying mutation produces a premature stop codon six amino acids (aa) downstream of the last codon of mouse Apob exon 24 (corresponding to aa 1254 of human apoB-100). ApoB-27.6 transcripts were 3- and 5-fold more abundant than apoB wild type and apoB-38.9 transcripts in the liver. Likewise, hepatic secretion rates of apoB-27.6 were 7-fold higher than those of apoB-48 and apoB-38.9. In contrast, apoB-27.6 heterozygotes (Apob 27.6/+) had lower hepatic TG secretion rates and higher liver TG contents than both apoB-38.9 heterozygotes (Apob 38.9/+) and apoB wild type mice (Apob +/+). ApoB-27.6 was secreted byApob 27.6/+ hepatocytes as dense high density lipoprotein particles. Moreover, despite its high secretion rates, apoB-27.6 was barely detectable in plasma. Disruption of apoE gene inApob 38.9/+ and Apob 27.6/+dramatically increased plasma levels of apoB-38.9 as well as apoB-48 but caused no change in plasma apoB-27.6 concentrations. Finally, the birth rate of apoB-27.6 homozygotes (Apob 27.6/27.6) from intercrosses of Apob 27.6/+ was 7-fold lower than that of Apob 38.9/38.9 fromApob 38.9/+ intercrosses (1.8% versus12%). Crossbreeding of Apob 27.6/27.6 andApob 38.9/38.9 produced viableApob 27.6/38.9 offspring, butApob 27.6/27.6 intercrosses produced no offspring. Together, these results demonstrate in vivo that the apoB-27.6-apoB-38.9 peptide segment (aa 1254–1744) plays a critical role, not only in supporting hepatic TG-secretion and in modulating catabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins, but also in normal mouse embryonic development."

Our previous structure-function studies on hMCH yielded a cyclic peptide consisting of the disulfide ring and Arg6 of hMCH: the so-called “active core” of hMCH with the four residues, Arg6, Met8, Arg11, and Tyr13, critical for molecular recognition at hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R (24.Bednarek M.A. Feighner S.D.

This compound, Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2(Structure 2), was equipotent to the full-length hMCH at both receptors. 2Throughout this report, the numbering of the amino acid residues in hMCH has been retained for all cyclic analogs of this neuropeptide.Ac­Arg6­Cys7­Met8­Leu9­Gly10­Arg11­Val12­Tyr13­Arg14­Pro15­Cys16­NH2STRUCTURE 2Moreover, at hMCH-1R, an analog of Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2with d-Arg in position 6 was as potent as the parent compound, but, at hMCH-2R, this analog was a noticeably weaker agonist. The d-Arg6 compound was the first described peptide agonist with enhanced hMCH-1R selectivity with respect to hMCH-2R. The study presented here was designed to expand on the above observation and prepare potent agonists of high hMCH-1R selectivity. First, analogs of Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2 were synthesized in which Arg in position 6 was replaced with various d-amino acids, with anticipation that the hMCH-1R selectivity of these peptides will be improved. In the binding and calcium release assays at the human MCH receptors, most of the new compounds displayed lower affinity and potency at hMCH-2R than hMCH-1R. Further, structure-function studies on hMCH(6–16)-NH2 revealed that incorporation of various l-amino acids in place of Gly10 affects interactions of the new analogs with hMCH-2R but not with hMCH-1R. These observations led us to design analogs of Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2 modified at both positions 6 and 10. Syntheses and biological evaluation in vitro at hMCH-1R and hMCH-2R of several cyclic peptides that are potent and selective hMCH-1R agonists is reported here. Elongation of peptide chains on 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-aminomethyl)-phenoxy resin, deprotection and cleavage of peptides from a resin, and formation of the disulfide ring in solution were performed as previously described in detail (24.Bednarek M.A. Feighner S.D.

The lyophilized crude peptides were analyzed by analytical reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 Vydac column attached to a Waters 600E system with automatic Wisp 712 injector and 991 Photodiode Array detector. A standard gradient system of 0–100% buffer B in 30 min was used for analysis; buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and buffer B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. HPLC profiles were recorded at 210 and 280 nm. Preparative separations were performed on a Waters Delta Prep 4000 system with a semipreparative C18 RP Waters column. The above-described solvent system of water and acetonitrile, in a gradient of 0–70% buffer B in 60 min, was used for separation. The chromatographically homogeneous products (purity >97%) were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Membrane binding assays were performed on transiently transfected COS-7 cells expressing human MCH-2R from the plasmid vector pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI), and a CHO cell line stably expressing human MCH-1R from pcDNA3.1. For transient expression, COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. A suspension of 7 × 106 COS-7 cells were transfected with 20 μg of pCI-neo/MCH-2R plasmid by electroporation (26.Audinot V. Beauverger P. Lahaye C. Suply T. Rodriguez M. Ouvry C. Lamamy V. Imbert J.

Membranes were prepared from transient and stable transfectants by hypotonic lysis, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. A filter binding assay was developed to measure the specific binding of125I-[Phe13,Tyr19]hMCH. Scintilation proximity assays were carried out using wheat germ agglutinin-polyvinyltoluene beads (Amersham Biosciences), in 96-well OptiPlates (Packard, Meriden, CT). Each well contained 0.5–10 μg of membrane protein and 200 μl of binding buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmEDTA, 12% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Binding buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors: 200 μg/ml bacitracin (Sigma), 1 μm phosphoramidon (Peninsula Laboratories), Assays were optimized with respect to membrane preparations: for CHO/MCH-1R membranes, 1 μg of membranes/well yielded a 10× specific binding window and for COS MCH-2R membranes, 8 μg of membrane protein yielded a window of ∼8×. Specific binding is defined as the difference between total binding and nonspecific binding conducted in the presence of 500 nm unlabeled hMCH. In 96-well dishes, the membranes were combined with peptide at various dilutions and the radioligand125I-[Phe13,Tyr19]hMCH at 0.3 nm final concentration and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane-bound counts were collected by filter harvesting through a Filtermate harvester (Packard Instruments) and washing with binding buffer as described above with added 0.04% Tween detergent, dried, scintillant added, and the plates were read in a TopCount (Packard). IC50 calculations were performed using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The IC50values were measured in three different experiments. For the functional receptor activation assays, stable cell lines expressing either the MCH-1R or the MCH-2R and the aequorin reporter protein were used. The assays were performed on a Luminoskan RT luminometer (Labsystems Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) controlled by custom software written for a PC-compatible computer. 293AEQ17/MCH-1R(or MCH-2R) cells were cultured for 72 h, and the apo-aequorin in the cells was charged for 1 h with coelenterazine (10 μm) under reducing conditions (300 m reduced glutathione) in ECB buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The cells were harvested, washed once in ECB medium, and resuspended to 500,000 cells/ml. 100 μl of cell suspension (corresponding to 5 × 104 cells) was then injected into the test plate containing the hMCH peptides, and the integrated light emission was recorded over 30 s, in 0.5-s units. 20 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% final Triton X-100 concentration) was then injected and the integrated light emission recorded over 10 s, in 0.5-s units. The “fractional response” values for each well were calculated by taking the ratio of the integrated response to the initial challenge to the total integrated luminescence including the Triton X-100 lysis response. The EC50 values were measured in three different experiments. Analogs of hMCH listed in Table I, Table II, Table III were prepared by solid-phase syntheses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” They were evaluated for their respective binding affinities for cloned human MCH receptor 1 and 2 in the competition binding assays with125I-[Phe13,Tyr19]hMCH as the radiolabeled ligand (28.Drozdz R.

Open table in a new tab Binding and functional data for analogs of Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2 modified in position 6 are compiled in Table I. Omission of Ac and the amino group of Arg6, through incorporation of 5-guanidino-valeric acid (des-amino-arginine) in position 6, resulted in compound 1, which was not a fully effective agonist at hMCH-1R (29% activation at 10 μm concentration), but was a full agonist at hMCH-2R of potency similar to that of the parent compound. In contrast, at hMCH-1R, analog 2 without the Ac group but withd-Arg in position 6 was equipotent to Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2 but, at hMCH-2R, this des-acetyl-peptide was an ∼10-fold weaker agonist. In compounds 3–10, d-enantiomers of hydrophobic amino acids, Ala, Nle, Pro, and Phe, and hydrophilic amino acids, Asn, Ser, Glu and Lys, were incorporated in position 6 of hMCH(6–16)-NH2. The new peptides were efficient binders to hMCH-1R, but their signal transduction efficacies at this receptor were more than 4-fold lower than that of Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2. These compounds poorly activated the second hMCH receptor, thus showing the enhanced selectivity for hMCH-1R. Replacement of Arg6with d-enantiomer of citrulline, yielded analog11 of binding affinity for hMCH-1R diminished ∼20-fold and of agonist potency at both MCH receptors significantly reduced (>50-fold). In analog 12, the Ac-Arg6 segment of Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2 was omitted and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (des-aminocysteine) was used instead of Cys in position 7 to form the disulfide ring. This peptide showed ∼40-fold lower binding affinity and activity at hMCH-1R than Ac-hMCH(6–16)-NH2. Simil"
https://openalex.org/W1975565600,"MobA is a DNA strand transferase encoded by the plasmid R1162 and required for plasmid DNA processing during conjugal transfer. The smallest active fragment was identified using phage display and partial enzymatic digestion of the purified protein. This fragment, consisting of approximately the first 184 amino acids, is able to bind and cleave its normal DNA substrate, the origin of transfer (oriT). Smaller fragments having one of these activities were not obtained. An active intermediate consisting of MobA linked to DNA was isolated and used to show that a single molecule of MobA is sufficient to carry out all of the DNA processing steps during transfer. These results, along with those obtained earlier, point to a single large, active site in MobA that makes several different contacts along the oriT DNA strand. MobA is a DNA strand transferase encoded by the plasmid R1162 and required for plasmid DNA processing during conjugal transfer.

This fragment, consisting of approximately the first 184 amino acids, is able to bind and cleave its normal DNA substrate, the origin of transfer (oriT).

These results, along with those obtained earlier, point to a single large, active site in MobA that makes several different contacts along the oriT DNA strand. Prior to conjugal transfer of the broad-host-range plasmid R1162, three plasmid-encoded proteins assemble at a unique site, the origin of transfer (oriT), to form the relaxosome (1.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Otto S. Dobrinski B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One component of the relaxosome is MobA, a large (708-amino acid) protein that consists of two domains. The carboxyl-terminal region is a primase and is not required for the interaction of the protein withoriT (2.Scholz P. Haring V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Ashman K. Bagdasarian M. Scherzinger E. Gene. 1989; 75: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 3.Brasch M.A. Meyer R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 703-710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primase is also translated separately (2.Scholz P. Haring V. Wittmann-Liebold B. Ashman K. Bagdasarian M. Scherzinger E. Gene. 1989; 75: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and the gene for this protein probably became fused to mobAas a secondary adaptation that increased the frequency of transfer (4.Henderson D. Meyer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6888-6894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this, pSC101 as well as other plasmids contain MobA homologs lacking the primase domain (5.Meyer R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4875-4881Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The principal DNA processing reactions carried out by MobA at initiation and termination of transfer are shown in Fig. 1. The amino-terminal region of MobA, a strand transferase consisting of about 250 amino acids, cleaves one of the DNA strands at oriT and forms a tyrosyl phosphodiester bond with the 5′ end (1.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Otto S. Dobrinski B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6.Bhattacharjee M.K. Meyer R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cleavage reaction is reversible and does not result in the loss of plasmid superhelicity (1.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Otto S. Dobrinski B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The two ends of the cleaved strand are probably held together by MobA, which prevents relaxation of the plasmid DNA. In the cell, cleavage and rejoining of the oriTDNA strand might occur as an idling reaction, awaiting a hypothetical signal to direct the complex into a productive round of transfer. Actual DNA transfer involves the unwinding of the cleaved strand and its passage, in the 5′ to 3′ direction (7.Kim K. Meyer R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), through an intercellular pore by a transporting machine assembled at this site. At the end of this process, the two ends of the strand are rejoined, presumably by a second trans-esterification carried out by the covalently linked MobA. This reaction has not been demonstrated to occur in the cell, butin vitro MobA can both cleave and rejoin single-strandedoriT DNA (8.Scherzinger E. Kruft V. Otto S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, the putative intermediate, MobA covalently linked to single-stranded DNA, is stable and able to rejoin the strands (this work). During both initial strand cleavage within the relaxosome and subsequent strand rejoining after a round of transfer, MobA probably interacts with an oriT DNA structure made up of both double- and single-stranded domains (9.Barlett M.M. Erickson M.J. Meyer R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3579-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10.Zhang S. Meyer R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In the relaxosome, the DNA duplex in the AT-rich region of oriT is disrupted by MobA and a second protein, MobC (10.Zhang S. Meyer R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MobB, another component of the relaxosome but not shown in the figure, stabilizes the interaction of these proteins with the DNA (11.Perwez T. Meyer R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the termination of a round of transfer, when the mobilized DNA is single-stranded, the double-stranded domain is formed by hybridization of the two arms of the inverted repeat inoriT. MobA must bind to both domains in order to function properly during transfer and to cause a gel mobility shift of single-stranded oriT DNA in vitro (12.Bhattacharjee M.K. Meyer R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4563-4568Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13.Becker E. Meyer R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The site of cleavage is located several bases from the AT-rich region (Fig. 2 A). Thus, during conjugal transfer, MobA must contact a large fraction of the 38-bporiT. We have identified the minimal region of MobA required for DNA processing at oriT. We also show that a single molecule is able to make all the necessary contacts required for this processing. Our results suggest that a single large functional domain of the protein contacts the origin of transfer. The display vectors used in this experiment are derivatives of the plasmid pICDRR (14.Courtney B. Williams K. Schlager J. Gene. 1995; 165: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) modified to contain restriction sites for EcoRV,SmaI, and BsaBI positioned so thatpelB and gpIII are in different relative reading frames. A fragment of mobA encoding the first 391 amino acids of the protein was amplified by PCR, and then portions of the product were digested separately with MnlI, BalI,RsaI, Eco47III, or Bst1107I. We then combined the products of these digestions and ligated this DNA to display vectors linearized at each of the three newly introduced restriction sites in order to increase the probability that in-frame trihybrid proteins will be encoded by the recombinant phage. Competent cells of Escherichia coli JM103(pREP4) (15.Messing J. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar, 16.Farabaugh P. Nature. 1978; 274: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were transformed with the ligated DNA by the method of Cohen et al. (17.Cohen S.N. Chang A.C.Y. Hsu L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2110-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar) and then allowed to grow in 2× YT medium (18.Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% glucose at 37 °C for 90 min. We found that the additional copies of lacI q contained in pREP4 as well as glucose in the medium were necessary to suppress background expression of gpIII fusion proteins to the level necessary for good growth. Transformation resulted in ∼30,000 transformed cells, which were enumerated by plating on medium containing ampicillin. The transformed cells were diluted 2-fold into 2× YT medium containing 1% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight. Cells were then diluted 20-fold into the same medium lacking glucose and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. These cells were infected with ∼1010 plaque-forming units of the helper phage R408 (19.Russel M. Kidd S. Kelley M. Gene. 1986; 45: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The infected culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 16 h. Phagemid particles in the medium were concentrated with polyethylene glycol after removing the cells by centrifugation. The particles were stored in 400 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl (TBS buffer). The suspension contained 4.7 × 1011 transducing units/ml. Biopanning was done by the method of Scott and Smith (20.Scott J. Smith G. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Streptavidin (2 μl of a 200 μg/ml solution) was diluted in 40 μl of 0.1 mNaHCO3 and then added to each well of a 96-well polystyrene microtiter dish. The dish was sealed with tape and incubated with rocking at 4 °C for 16 h. The wells were then emptied by vacuum aspiration, filled with about 400 μl of blocking solution (0.1m NaHCO3 5 mg/ml dialyzed bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μg/ml streptavidin, and 0.02% NaN3) and further incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and then washed four times with 400 μl of TBS containing 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. We then added to each well the 3′-biotinylated oriToligonucleotide 5′-GGCCAGTTTCTCGAAGAGAAACCGGTAAATGCGCCCTCCCCTACAAAGTAG (14 pmol of DNA in 50 μl of TBS/Tween containing 0.2% NaN3 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the wells were vacuum-aspirated and washed six times with TBS/Tween. Sixty μl of the phagemid suspension (1011 infecting particles/ml) were added to the DNA-containing well, and the plate was gently agitated for 2 h at room temperature. Nonbinding particles were then removed by aspiration, and the well was washed 10 times with 400 μl of TBS/Tween. We eluted the bound particles by adding to each well 40 μl of a solution containing 0.1n HCl (pH adjusted to 2.2 with glycine), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml phenol red. After 10 min at room temperature, the eluate was removed and neutralized with 7.5 μl of 1 m Tris base (pH 9.1). Approximately 2.5 ml of early log-phase cells of JM103(pREP4), grown in 2× YT broth containing glucose were then infected with 20 μl of the neutralized phage solution, and the culture was further incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. The cells were diluted to 30 ml in 2× YT containing ampicillin, and the phagemids were packaged by infecting the culture with 108 plaque-forming units of R408. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, cells were removed by centrifugation. Ten μl of the culture supernatant were heated to 70 °C for 20 min and then mixed with 50 μl of TBS and subjected to two additional rounds of biopanning. We estimated by a gel shift assay the proportion of phagemids binding to DNA after each cycle of enrichment. Five μl of the phagemid suspension for each cycle were mixed with 2.5 ml of JM103 cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The cells were then diluted into 10 ml 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and R408 (106-107 particles/ml) and incubated overnight. Binding reactions consisted of 5 μl of the supernatant of the overnight culture, 50 fmol of32P-labeled oriT oligonucleotide (above), and 15 μl of TBS. Bound and free oligonucleotide were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. A protein fragment containing the first 321 amino acids of MobA was purified by first fusing it to an intein and a chitin binding domain (21.Chong S. Mersha F. Comb D. Scott M. Landry D. Vence L. Perler F. Benner J. Kucera R. Hirvonen C. Pelletier J. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Gene. 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pTYB2 (New England Biolabs) by standard methods. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of broth (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) to ∼4 × 108 cells/ml. isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to 0.3 mm, and the culture was incubated overnight at 20–25 °C. Protein was prepared from the induced culture by affinity chromatography with a column containing chitin, essentially according to the procedures described by New England Biolabs, This protein is designated MobA*. We first determined the conditions required to visualize and separate complexes of oriT DNA and MobA polypeptides generated by partial digestion with chymotrypsin. Twenty-μg amounts of MobA dissolved in 20 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA were digested with chymorypsin (final concentrations 0.25, 2.5, 25, and 50 μg/ml) for 16 h at 25 °C. The locations of the sites in MobA that are cleaved by this protease are shown in Fig. 2 B. After incubation, EGTA was added to 30 mm, and the samples were then mixed with 0.8 μmol of the oriT oligonucleotide 5′-GGATCCAGTTTCTCGAAGAGAAACCGGTAAATGCGCCCT-3′. One pmol of this oligonucleotide, end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, was added as a tracer. The samples were then separated by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel (15 cm × 15 cm × 1.5 mm) and visualized by autoradiography without drying the gel. To isolate the complexes, 100 μg of MobA in 100 μl of digestion buffer was digested with chymotrypsin (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 25 °C. The sample was then mixed with the oriToligonucleotide, and complexes were separated as before, except that the gel was allowed to polymerize for 16 h and free radicals were scavenged by pre-running for 1 h at 200 V with 0.1 mmthioglycolate in the upper running buffer. The samples were separated by electrophoresis at 200 V for 2 h and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. Blotted peptides were detected by soaking the membrane for 5 min in 50 ml of 40% MeOH solution containing 0.025% Coomassie Blue R-250 and then destaining for 15 min in 200 ml of 50% MeOH. The membrane was dried in a stream of argon. The positions of the oriT-polypeptide complexes were then determined by comparison of the Coomassie-stained bands with those appearing after autoradiography of the membrane. The polypeptide-oriT DNA complexes were cut from the membrane and submitted for peptide sequencing (automated Edman procedure). high pressure liquid chromatography N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid Two mg of MobA in 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl, 1 mm EDTA, PH 7.5) was digested with trypsin (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C. Trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was then added to 50 μg/ml, and the sample was applied to a 2.5-ml reverse phase column (SOURCE5rpcst 4.6/150, Amersham Biosciences). Polypeptide fragments of MobA were eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Peak fractions (1 ml each) were identified by measuring absorbance at 220 nm. Fractions 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 20, 22, 23, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, and 53 (Fig. 3) were concentrated about 75% by vacuum centrifugation, and 20 μl of each was mixed with an equal volume of buffer solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 20 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 30% w/v glycerol. The pH of each sample was checked for neutrality by spotting onto pH paper. 200 fmol of the oriT oligonucleotide 5′-CCCCCAGGATCCAGTTTCTCGAAGAGAAACCGGTAAATGCGCCCTCCCTTT-3′ end-labeled as described above were then added to each sample. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, one-half of each sample was applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel and the other half to a 12% gel also containing 6m urea. Radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. On the basis of the gel analysis, fraction 49 was submitted for amino-terminal amino acid sequencing and electrospray analysis. Approximately 1.8 mg of paramagnetic, streptavidin-coated beads (Promega) were washed three times with 600 μl of TES (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and then resuspended in 600 μl of the same buffer containing 4 nmol of the 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide, 5′-GGGCCGAATTCCCAAAA-3′ and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were collected at the side of the tube with a magnet, washed a further two times in TES, and then resuspended in 300 μl of TES. Covalent complex was prepared by digesting 3 nmol of the oligonucleotide 5′-AATCTCCCAATTTAAATGCGCCCTCCCTTTTGGGAATTCGGCCC-3′ with 120 μg of purified MobA for 1 h at 37 °C in 125 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 15% (v/v) glycerol (1.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Otto S. Dobrinski B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). EDTA was then added to 100 mm and a final volume of 150 μl. Fifty μl of this reaction was mixed with 50 μl of 2 m NaCl and added to 100 μl of the bead preparation (above). The complex binds to the beads because the DNA hybridizes to the short oligonucleotide attached by the biotin label. The mixture was then adjusted to 1 m NaCl and a final volume of 400 μl, with the high salt concentration preventing further binding of free MobA to the oligonucleotide. The beads were chilled in an ice-water bath and washed 15 times with 400 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, and 2% Triton X-100. Finally, the beads were washed two times with 60 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in 30 μl of the same buffer. The complex was eluted from the beads by heating at 65 °C for 1 min followed by collection of the beads with a magnet and then repeating. The purity of the complex was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6 A). The complex migrates more slowly than free MobA, which was used as a marker. No detectable free MobA was found in the final preparation. We used phage display to identify the minimal MobA fragment able to bind an oriT oligonucleotide. DNA encoding the protein was amplified by PCR, digested with different restriction enzymes, and then cloned into derivatives of the display phagemid pICDLRR (14.Courtney B. Williams K. Schlager J. Gene. 1995; 165: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this vector, fragments are cloned between genes encoding the amino terminus of gpIII, a minor coat protein of M13, and pelB, a signal sequence. Plasmid molecules containing cloned fragments of mobA DNA were introduced by transformation into JM103 (15.Messing J. Crea R. Seeburg P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar) followed by selection for ampicillin resistance. We then generated a phagemid library by infecting these transformed cells with the partially defective helper phage, R408 (19.Russel M. Kidd S. Kelley M. Gene. 1986; 45: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The resulting phagemid particles were subjected to biopanning in microtiter wells coated with single-strandedoriT DNA. Particles remaining bound to the DNA after repeated washing were eluted with acidic buffer and amplified by infection of JM103. After two additional cycles of biopanning, the infected cells were plated for resistance to ampicillin. For each cycle of biopanning, phagemids were assayed for binding tooriT DNA. The medium from the infected culture was mixed with radiolabeled DNA and applied to a polyacrylamide gel. This medium contains phagemid proteins in sufficient amounts to allow the detection of an active MobA fusion protein by a gel mobility shift assay. Binding to oriT was easily detected in culture supernatants from phagemids that had undergone three rounds of biopanning. We isolated the phagemid DNA from 20 colonies and characterized the cloned DNA by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. In each case, the cloned DNA was identical and encoded the amino-terminal 184 amino acid residues of MobA (Fig. 2 B). Could we isolate additional phagemids expressing smaller MobA fragments? To answer this question, the mobA DNA in the phagemid was amplified by PCR, and the product was digested for various times with exonuclease Bal31. The DNA from each time point in the digestion was then cloned separately into the display system, and biopanning was carried out for three cycles as before. Protein binding to oriT DNA was detected for each time point (data not shown), but in each case only the input phagemid was recovered. We conclude therefore that the trihybrid protein expressed by the phagemid probably contains the smallest fragment of MobA capable of optimal binding of oriT DNA. The result from the phage display experiment suggested that a large fragment of MobA, beginning at the amino-terminal end, is required for binding to oriT. However, this does not exclude the possibility that other phagemid particles expressing smaller fragments of MobA might also bind oriT DNA but are outcompeted during the cycles of biopanning. Moreover, in MobA the nucleophile active for cleavage of oriT DNA is a tyrosine near the amino-terminal end of the protein, at position 25 in Fig. 2 B (counting from the amino-terminal methionine) (1.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Otto S. Dobrinski B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies (13.Becker E. Meyer R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) indicated that the oriT base sequences required for strong binding by MobA are not located around the cleavage site. It was possible that the active binding region was smaller than indicated by phage display, with the larger MobA fragment required only for proper folding within the trihybrid protein. We therefore used an independent method involving partial enzymatic cleavage of MobA to map the minimal binding domain. We purified a MobA fragment that is competent for transfer, but lacks the primase domain. This fragment, termed MobA*, consists of the first 321 amino acids of MobA, and the sequence is shown in Fig. 2 B. The amino-terminal methionine is cleaved from the protein in the cell, and the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids, Thr-Pro-Gly, were added as the result of cloning in the expression vector. We partially digested this protein with different amounts of chymotrypsin. The enzyme was then inactivated, and the samples were mixed with a radiolabeled, single-stranded oriToligonucleotide and applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4 A). During electrophoresis MobA* binds to the DNA to form a slowly migrating complex (Fig. 4 A, leftmost lane), whereas partial digestion of the protein resulted in additional complexes with greater mobility. We transferred the electrophoretically separated complexes to a polyvinylidene membrane by electroblotting and located the DNA-protein complexes by autoradiography and staining (Fig. 4 B). The amino-terminal sequence of the polypeptide in each complex was then determined by the Edman procedure. The same experiment was carried out with protein digested instead with trypsin, and in this case the two complexes with the greatest mobility were collected on the membrane (data not shown). For the five complexing polypeptides (two from the trypsin digestion and three from the chymotrypsin digestion), the amino-terminal sequences were the same and were identical to the amino-terminal sequence of MobA* (Fig. 2 B). We thus conclude that the minimal binding region of MobA* includes the active tyrosine. We determined the minimal binding domain of MobA* by again partially digesting this protein with trypsin but then separating the fragments by HPLC (Fig. 3), and testing fractions for binding to theoriT oligonucleotide. The polypeptides in the peak fractions, which are indicating by the black bars at thebottom of the chromatographic profile in Fig. 3, were tested for binding by a mobility shift assay. No binding was observed except for the fractions shown in Fig. 5 A. In each case, the polypeptide-oriT DNA complex migrated more rapidly than the MobA*-DNA complex (lane marked “+”). The peak fractions were also tested for cleavage of oriTsingle-stranded DNA (13.Becker E. Meyer R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Those fractions showing a mobility shift, but none of the other fractions tested cleaved the DNA (Fig. 5 B). Fraction 48, which formed the least amount of complex, also generated little or no cleavage product. Thus, although strong binding is not required for proper cleavage of the oriT DNA strand (8.Scherzinger E. Kruft V. Otto S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), there were no polypeptides active in cleavage but unable to cause a mobility shift. We examined the proteins in fractions 48–53 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although most fractions contained more than one protein fragment, only one of these fragments was common to all the fractions active in binding (Fig. 5 C). The migration rate of this fragment indicated that it consisted of most of MobA*. To identify this polypeptide, we submitted a sample of fraction 49 for automated amino-terminal sequencing to verify that it included the amino-terminal end of MobA, and we also determined the mass by electrospray ionization. As expected, the amino-terminal sequences of MobA and the binding polypeptide were the same. Two determinations by electrospray analysis gave molecular mass determinations of 21121.5 and 21124.0 daltons. The amino-terminal MobA fragment closest in mass, with a calculated molecular size of 21121.5 daltons, consists of 188 amino acids and is underlined in Fig. 2 B. This fragment is almost the same mass as that identified by phage display. Our results indicate that a MobA fragment of about 180 amino acids is required for strong binding to oriT and for cleavage of this DNA. A fragment of this size, folded according to several different predictions of general structure based upon amino acid sequence, would be sufficiently large to contact both the inner arm of the inverted repeat, with the outer arm folded to form a hairpin, the AT-rich region, and the correct site of cleavage (Figs. 1 and 2 A). Moreover, the relaxosome has been estimated to contain one to two molecules of MobA, based on the protein stoichiometry required for optimum activity of relaxosomes reconstituted in vitro (1.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Otto S. Dobrinski B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We asked whether only one molecule of MobA* is required for the DNA processing reactions atoriT. For a single molecule of MobA* to be sufficient, it must be able to cleave the oriT DNA, remain covalently attached to the 5′ end of the DNA during passage into the recipient cell, and then bind the trailing part of oriT in a manner allowing the strand-joining second trans-esterification (Fig. 1). We first generated the presumed intermediate in this series of reactions by incubating purified MobA* with an oriT oligonucleotide lacking the outer arm of the inverted repeat. In the presence of large amounts of protein, the oligonucleotide is correctly cleaved (8.Scherzinger E. Kruft V. Otto S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but because there is no inverted repeat and the protein is unable to bind strongly to the DNA, the reverse reaction is inhibited. This allows the accumulation of large amounts of the intermediate. The protein-DNA covalent complex was then isolated by hybridization to a 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide, which was then collected using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The complex was purified from free MobA* by extensive washing (Fig. 6 A). We incubated the complex with a 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide having the correct sequence at the 3′ end for strand rejoining. This DNA was rejoined to the DNA of the complex in the presence of Mg2+, as shown by the slower mobility of the labeled DNA during gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6 B). In addition, purified complex was able to bind full-length oriT, resulting in a gel mobility shift of some of the labeled DNA (Fig. 6 C). Thus, a second molecule of free MobA* is not required for covalent complex to bind to full-length oriT. Moreover, it is unlikely that more than one covalently linked molecule binds to oriT. When free MobA* was mixed with complex and the binding assay repeated, a third labeled band appeared in the gel. This band migrated at the position of free MobA* binding to the labeled oligonucleotide; its mobility was less than that of free DNA but greater than covalent complex bound to the DNA. No species of intermediate mobility, which would indicate binding by one free and one covalently complexed MobA molecule, or reflecting other stoichiometries, were observed. Conjugal mobilization of R1162 requires that the MobA protein contact oriT at the inner arm of the inverted repeat, the AT-rich region, and the cleavage site. It seemed possible, therefore, that MobA could contain more than one distinct functional domain able to interact with oriT. Several observations are consistent with this possibility. First, in vitro the inverted repeat is not required for cleavage of oriT DNA at the correct site (8.Scherzinger E. Kruft V. Otto S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Second, the distance between the inverted repeat and the other sites can be increased by one base without loss of activity (13.Becker E. Meyer R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and this flexibility could reflect the presence of two independent binding domains on the protein. Third, in plasmids such as RK2, the small TraJ protein binds to the inner arm of the inverted repeat (22.Ziegelin G. Furste J.P. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11989-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This complex is necessary for subsequent docking of the relaxase, TraI. Although in R1162 one protein is responsible for both docking and cleavage, the two required domains might still be functionally independent. Finally, within the oriTs of plasmids having Mob systems in the R1162/RSF1010 family, the inverted repeat is highly variable in sequence, whereas the sequence of the DNA making up the AT-rich region and the cleavage site is highly conserved. This suggests that there have been different selective pressures during the evolution of these two segments of oriT, a situation most easily accommodated by two separate domains. We found, however, that the smallest fragment capable of strong binding to oriT DNA is also the smallest fragment that cleaves this DNA. This minimal fragment consists of ∼184–188 residues and includes the amino-terminal end of the protein. Fragments smaller than this but able to bind oriT were not detected either by phage display or after a partial tryptic digest of the protein. Moreover, among the fragments generated by digestion with trypsin, only those fragments able to bind could cleave oriT DNA. The data therefore suggest a single, large MobA domain that makes all of the necessary contacts with oriT DNA. In this context, it is interesting to compare the minimal MobA with the homologous protein of another plasmid, pSC101. The oriTs of R1162 and pSC101 are almost identical in the region of the cleavage site and the adjacent AT-rich DNA, but they have significantly different inverted repeats (Fig. 7 A). However, regions of similarity or identity between the proteins are distributed rather uniformly (Fig. 7 B) and are not clustered at one location that might correspond to the conserved portion of the oriTsequence. The size of the minimal MobA fragment is consistent with earlier results on the properties in vivo of truncated MobA proteins. Recombination between oriTs on single-stranded M13 phage is a measure of the single-strand cleavage and rejoining activity of MobA (23.Meyer R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 799-806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that a MobA amino-terminal fragment extending to residue 179 in MobA was inactive in recombination, whereas a fragment extending to residue 204 was fully active (pUT208 and pUT209 in Fig. 2 B and Ref. 22.Ziegelin G. Furste J.P. Lanka E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11989-11994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is expected if the minimal MobA extends to a residue between the end points of the proteins encoded by these plasmids. If a single, large domain is required for cleavage, then one molecule of MobA could be sufficient for DNA processing. The gel mobility shifts shown in Fig. 6 suggest that in fact one molecule of MobA carries out all the necessary DNA processing steps at oriT. The addition of purified, active covalent complex to oriT DNA results in a single band with retarded mobility. This band could arise by the assembly of one or more complex molecules on the DNA. However, when free MobA is also added, a single, new band appears on the gel, with a mobility characteristic of free MobA bound to DNA. If multiple molecules of MobA were binding to the DNA, we would have expected bands between those formed by complex and free MobA. The most likely explanation is that only one molecule of protein binds to theoriT DNA. However, this conclusion also creates a certain difficulty. When molecules are constructed that contain two directly repeated copies of the R1162 oriT, then transfer can be initiated at one of these and terminated at the other (7.Kim K. Meyer R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because each oriT is cleaved, there needs to be two nucleophiles to carry out these reactions. If only one molecule of MobA is also required here, then the protein must be able to carry out a second cleavage, whereas the first nucleophile, Tyr-25, is covalently linked to DNA. Secondary, active nucleophilic residues have been found for the mobilization protein TrwC (24.Grandoso G. Avila P. Cayon A. Hernando M. Llosa M. de la Cruz F. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2320727010,"We previously demonstrated that RB18A, a member of TRAP220/DRIP205/PBP family, in vivo acted as a cofactor of transcription by differently regulating p53wt transactivating activity on physiological promoters. Using p53-negative cells transfected with different constructs, we herein demonstrated that RB18A down-regulated p53wt-dependent apoptosis. This biological regulation was due to a specific diminution of p53wt protein level, as level of p53mut and GAPDH proteins was not modified. This p53wt diminution was dependent on proteasome activity, as inhibited by MG-132 inhibitor. This specific p53wt degradation was correlated with an increase in expression of MDM2, which promoted p53wt degradation into proteasome. RB18A up-regulated MDM2 expression by activating MDM2 promoter, even in absence of p53wt. Altogether, these data emphasized that RB18A could regulate p53wt function not only by direct interaction between both proteins, but also by up-regulating promoter activity of MDM2, a p53-regulating partner."

The proviral integration sites in these leukemias provide powerful genetic tags for disease gene identification. Here we show that Evi24, a common site of retroviral integration in AKXD B cell and BXH-2 myeloid leukemias, contains a novel Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor gene. We have designated this geneClg (common-site lymphoma/leukemiaguanine nucleotide exchange factor). Proviral integrations on chromosome 7 at Evi24 are located 7.6–10.3 kb upstream of Clg and increased Clg expression 2–5-fold compared with leukemias lacking proviral integrations atEvi24. Clg contains Dbl/pleckstrin homology domains with substantial sequence homology to many Rho family activators, including the transforming Dbl andDbs/Ost oncogenes. Nucleotide exchange assays indicated that Clg specifically activated nucleotide exchange on Cdc42, but not RhoA or Rac1, in vitro. NIH 3T3 transfection studies showed that overexpression of full-length and carboxyl-terminally truncated forms of Clg morphologically transformed NIH 3T3 cells. This study and studies showing that the human homolog ofEVI24 is located in a region of 19q13 frequently amplified in B cell lymphomas and pancreatic and breast cancers implicateClg and Cdc42 activation in mouse and human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2081331368,"Replication of DNA within Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes is initiated from multiple origins, whose activation follow their own inherent time schedules during the S phase of the cell cycle. It has been demonstrated that a characteristic replicative complex (RC) that includes an origin recognition complex is formed at each origin and shifts between post- and pre-replicative states during the cell cycle. We wanted to determine whether there was an association between this shift in the state of the RC and firing events at replication origins. Time course analyses of RC architecture using UV-footprinting with synchronously growing cells revealed that pre-replicative states at both early and late firing origins appeared simultaneously during late M phase, remained in this state during G1 phase, and converted to the post-replicative state at various times during S phase. Because the conversion of the origin footprinting profiles and origin firing, as assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, occurred concomitantly at each origin, then these two events must be closely related. However, conversion of the late firing origin occurred without actual firing. This was observed when the late origin was suppressed in clb5-deficient cells and a replication fork originating from an outside origin replicated the late origin passively. This mechanism ensures that replication at each chromosomal locus occurs only once per cell cycle by shifting existing pre-RCs to the post-RC state, when it is replicated without firing.

In somatic cells, initiation at origins of replication occurs in a fixed order during a limited period called the S phase (1Brewer B.J. Diller J.D. Friedman K.L. Kolor K.M. Raghuraman M.K.

Chromosoma (Berl.). 1990; 99: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Precise replication of chromosomal DNA once per cell cycle requires suppression of each origin of replication after it has fired until the beginning of next S phase. In addition, if a region served by one replication origin is replicated after initiation at a flanking origin, then this unused origin must also be suppressed. Although such a phenomenon has been generally accepted, its precise mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, short distinct chromosomal fragments, identified as autonomously replicating sequences act as replication origins in chromosomes (3Huberman J.A. Zhu J.

Several lines of evidence obtained from in vivo footprinting, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and chromatin fractionation demonstrate that the initiation factors are assembled into replication complexes (RC)1 at replication origins (5Diffley J.F.

The origin recognition complex (ORC) binds to an essential sequence (autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) consensus sequence (ACS)) within replication origins throughout the cell cycle (5Diffley J.F.

In G1 phase, Cdc6p and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are sequentially recruited to the ACS-bound ORC to form the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) (6Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P.

Nature. 1996; 379: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Its formation can be monitored by in vivo footprinting with DNase I or UV, which yields footprints that are distinct from those observed at other cell cycle phases, referred to as post-replicative complex (post-RC) footprints (5Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the post-RC state, the protection pattern is consistent with that of a simple ORC-ACS complex, resembling the one obtained when only purified ORC proteins are used in in vitro footprinting experiments (5Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A. Cell. 1994; 78: 303-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, it is held that the pre-RC is formed from the existing ORC-ACS complex and is a prerequisite for the initiation of DNA replication. Conversion of the pre-RC to the post-RC in S phase is thought to be closely associated with origin firing. For example, dissociation of MCM proteins from the ACS and dissociation of polymerase α and ɛ, which are loaded just before the dissociation of the MCM proteins, occur with the same kinetics (6Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stalling of replication forks by the addition of hydroxyurea concomitantly blocks both the conversion and firing at late replicating origins (12Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Several S-phase-specific protein kinases, for example cyclin-dependent kinase and Cdc7-Dbf4 protein kinase are believed to regulate the RC status. They phosphorylate one or more factors in the RC to directly trigger initiation of DNA replication. Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase activity increases at G1/S and remains high throughout S phase (13Yoon H.J. Loo S. Campbell J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Jackson A.L. Pahl P.M. Harrison K. Rosamond J. Sclafani R.A. Mol. Cell.

Brewer B.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Cdc7p in G1 phase prevents initiation of S phase, and inactivation at early S phase results in inactivation of the late origins. Thus, Cdc7 kinase activity is necessary for both early and late replication origin firing throughout S phase (15Bousset K. Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Donaldson A.D. Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Among six closely related B-type cyclins (Clb1–6), it appears that Clb5p and -6p are involved mainly in S phase events (17Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Kuhne C. Linder P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Clb5p and Clb6p can cause early origins to fire, whereas only Clb5p can fire late origins (19Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that these kinases are involved in origin activation and may determine the order of origin firing. We have attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of how the timing of replication origin firing is regulated through the characterization of the protein-DNA complex architecture at replication origins using UV footprinting in budding yeast. This method allows us to monitor the dynamic conversion of the RC architecture at origins of replication in living cells. Comparable studies of early and late replication origins using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis show a close association in the timing between RC conversion and origin firing. We also observed conversion without firing when late origin activation was suppressed by a Clb5 mutation. Based on these results, we propose mechanisms that ensure that replication occurs once and only once per cell cycle through assembly and disassembly of the pre-RCs at chromosomal replication origins. Genotypes for W303-1A and RM14-3A have been described previously (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The genotype for the Cdc15 temperature-sensitive mutant strain (DK329-10a) is (MATacdc15-1 his3-11 leu2-3112 ura3-1) (29Schweitzer B. Pholippsen P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To obtain the clb5-deficient strain (SKY009), the clb5 gene in W303-1A was disrupted by transformation with a CLB5 (5′)-Trp1-CLB5(3′) fragment that had been amplified by PCR from YIplac204 (30Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar) using a primer containing 18 nucleotides of the YIplac204 vector sequence and 100 nucleotides of the sequence flanking the CLB5 open reading frame. Methods used for UV photofootprinting in vivoand in vitro and quantification of the band intensities have been described previously (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Construction of plasmids carryingori602 or ori607 are described in Shirahigeet al. (31Shirahige K. Iwasaki T. Rashid M. Ogasawara N. Yoshikawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5043-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Primers to extent the sequences atori602 and ori607 are 5′-AAGGGCAGTTCCACTGTCAGGCTTCG-3′ and 5′-GATTCTATGCTTTCTAGTACCTACTGTGCCG-3′, respectively. Band intensities obtained from time course experiments using ori1,ori602, and ori607 were calculated as the relative amounts using the highest and lowest values as 100 and 0%, respectively. Two-dimensional gel analyses were performed as described previously (21Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were mainly cultured in YPDA medium at 23 °C (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Synchronization of thecdc15-1 strain (DK329-10a) from late metaphase was done by shifting the temperature down to 23 °C after the cells had been incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. RM14-3a cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary following the methods described previously (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). W303-1A and SKY009 cells were synchronized at G1 phase by arresting cell cycle progression at this stage with α-factor peptide (2 μg/ml for 2.5 h) followed by exchange of medium at 23 °C to that without α-factor but containing 50 μg/ml Pronase (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Cell cycle distribution was monitored by measuring the DNA content of cells using FACS analyses as described previously (17Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We have analyzed UV footprinting profiles of ORC-ACS complexes at various replication origins that fire at different times during S phase. Chromosomal DNA was purified from exponentially growing haploid yeast cells immediately after UV irradiation. Using the DNA as a template, we have performed primer extensions to identify sites of pyrimidine dimer formation within these ACS regions. As shown previously, the intensity of a band located within the T cluster of the 3′ portion of the A element of ori1 was significantly reduced (Ref. 10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A,left panel, arrowhead). This reduction in intensity was restored to the unprotected naked DNA level by inactivating either ORC1, -2, or -5 by shifting their respective temperature-sensitive mutants to the non-permissive temperatures (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of purified ORC to the naked ori1DNA produced a band profile that was identical to that of the in vivo footprint (Ref. 10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Fig. 1A, right panel). Therefore, the in vivo footprinting patterns demonstrate protection against pyrimidine dimer formation by ORC binding to ori1 as described previously (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We also examined whether the same ORC footprint could be obtained at other replication origins by this method. We chose ori602and ori607 as typical late and early origins on chromosome VI. As with ori1, we found there was a significant reduction in intensity of bands located at the 3′-ends of the T clusters within the ACS of ori602 and ori607 in asynchronous-growing cells (Fig. 1, B and C,left panels, with arrowheads). Forori602, a band corresponding to the 5′-end of the T cluster was also protected region to the same extent as that of the 3′-end (Fig. 1B). To address whether the protection ofori602 and ori607 was because of ORC binding, we performed UV footprinting in vitro with purified ORC proteins and plasmids carrying the various origins (Fig. 1,B and C, right panels). The same ATP-dependent protection profiles were observed, indicating that ORC binds specifically to ori602 and ori607 in vivo to produce the characteristic protection patterns in the UV-footprinting experiments as observed for ori1. We have reported that the UV-footprinting pattern of ori1 switches between pre- and post-replicative states in a cell cycle-dependent manner (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether other replication origins had similar patterns of cell cycle-dependent switching. Yeast cells growing synchronously after release from three different cell cycle arrest points (late M, G1, and G1/S transition) were collected at defined time intervals, washed quickly once in phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately irradiated with UV light (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Because UV footprinting does not require the preparation of spheroplasts, we were able to study accurately the formation of protein-DNA complexes in cells without any time lags. We took advantage of this to perform time course footprinting for ori1,ori602, and ori607. Although only one representative result from each experiment is shown, it should be noted that the time course experiments were performed at least twice and that essentially the same results were obtained each time.Figure 3Conversion between pre- and post-RCs after release from the cdc7-1 arrest point.

The cells started to grow synchronously after a temperature shift-down (release) as shown by FACS analysis (Fig.2A). DNA samples extracted from the cells at the indicated time points after the release were purified and analyzed in footprint experiments using ori1-, ori602-, andori607-specific primers as shown in Fig. 2, B–D. The intensity of a band within the A element of ori1(indicated by an arrowhead in Fig. 2B) at thecdc15-1 arrest point was weaker compared with the one obtained using naked DNA. This indicates that there was strong protection against thymine dimer formation at this site through ORC binding during this phase of the cell cycle. The same decrease in intensity of this band in the ACS regions of ori602 andori607 was also observed (Fig. 2, C andD). Time course footprints of these replication origins show clear increases followed by decreases in the intensities of the bands associated with cell cycle progression. Band intensities were quantified, and transitions in their relative intensities during cell cycle progression were calculated. The weakest values (0%) were assigned to the band intensities at the arrest points forori602 and ori607 and 20 min after release from arrest for ori1. The strongest values (100%) were assigned to the band intensities at 55 min for ori1 andori607 and 85 min for ori602 (Fig.2E). We have previously shown that the increased band intensity at the A element represents the pre-RC state at the ACS region (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, increases in band intensities indicate a shift in the state of the ACS in the cell population from post-RC to pre-RC. The increase in band intensities at the three origins started almost simultaneously between 20 and 35 min after release and before cytokinesis as shown by FACS analysis (Fig. 2, A andE). The transition profiles of the bands at the early replicating origins, ori1 and ori607, were almost the same and showed sharp peaks at ∼50 min after release, just before entry into G1 phase (Fig. 2, B, D, and E). The band intensities decreased quickly before the start of bulk DNA replication (65 min) and reached levels at early S phase (75 min) that were similar to those at the start of the experiment. The profile of the late replicating origin,ori602, was slightly different (Fig. 2, C andE). The intensities of two bands in the ACS started to increase at the same time and rate as those for ori1 andori607 but remained high for up to 75–85 min after release. This period corresponds to the middle of S phase, when both ACS bands for ori1 and ori607 had decreased to their initial levels. The bands for ori602 gradually decreased in intensity by G2 phase but never reached their initial level during the time course of the experiment. To study the different footprint transitions at individual origins more precisely and especially to gain more information about the transition from pre- to post-RC during progression from the G1/S boundary to S phase, time course footprints were done with cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary (Fig. 3). Temperature-sensitivecdc7-1 mutant cells were first arrested in G1phase by treatment with α-factor and then allowed to progress to the G1/S boundary where they were arrested by incubating the cells at the non-permissive temperature for 90 min after having treated them in parallel with Pronase. After a shift-down of the temperature (release), the arrested cells progressed from the G1/S boundary to G2 phase synchronously by as shown by FACS analysis (Fig. 3A). The time course footprints forori1, ori602, and ori607 were carried out as described above with cells withdrawn at the indicated time points after release (Fig. 3, B–D). The relative intensities of bands across the time course were calculated using the lowest intensities (35 min for ori1, 45 min forori602, and ori607) as 0% and the highest intensities (0 min for ori1 and ori607 and 5 min for ori602) as 100%(Fig. 3E). At the G1/S boundary arrest point (Cdc7), the bands of interest within the A element of ori1 and within the ACS ofori602 and ori607 (arrowheads) had stronger intensities than those of asynchronously growing cells (log phase) (Fig. 3, B–E). This indicates that these origins in the cells arrested at the G1/S boundary are in the pre-RC state as suggested by experimental results described above (Fig. 2). Upon release from the G1/S boundary, the band intensities decreased within 5 min for ori1 and ori607 (Fig.3, B, D, and E). Forori602, the decrease in band intensity was delayed slightly and started between 5 and 15 min (Fig. 3, C andE). Band intensities of all origins reached their lowest levels during S phase. This corresponded to 25 min after release forori607, 35 min for ori1, and 45 min forori602 (Fig. 3E). The transition from pre- to post-RC for ori607 was slightly earlier than that forori1. The transition time for ori602 was the latest, which occurred in the middle of S phase. The transition time for each origin was consistent with its order of replication as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or density transfer experiments in the same synchronization background (20Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Next, we studied the relationship between the transition from pre- to post-RC and actual firing at individual replication origins in W303-1A (wild type) cells, synchronized by release at G1 phase after α-factor arrest (Fig. 4). We also investigated whether the transitions in the footprinting patterns were because of the effect of mutations used in the above experiment. The arrested cells passed through G1phase synchronously and entered S phase 30- 40 min after release as shown using FACS analysis (Fig. 4, A and F). Time course footprints for ori1,ori602, and ori607 were obtained as above (Fig.4, B–D), and the relative intensities of their specific bands were plotted as in Figs. 2E and 3E (Fig.4F). Bands intensities for these origins were stronger in G1-arrested cells (0 min) than in asynchronously growing cells (log). This indicates that the origins in early G1phase cells are present in the pre-RC state as observed above. Upon release, the band intensities for the early origins stayed at the same level through G1 phase and then started to weaken between 30 and 40 min after release and declined to the level of asynchronously growing cells within a further 20 min (Fig. 4, B,D, and F). The band intensity for the late origin, ori602, was still high even after 50 min, which corresponds to the middle of S phase (Fig. 4, C andF). At this time, the early origins had already entered the post-RC state. A gradual decrease in band intensity ofori602 started between 50 and 60 min. The band intensity reached its lowest level at 80 min, which corresponded to the end of S phase as judged by FACS analysis (Fig. 4, A andF). We also observed a synchronized second increase in band intensities at all origins at 120 min, just before cytokinesis (Fig.4). These results are consistent with the previous two time course footprinting experiments using different synchronization procedures (Figs. 2 and 3) and confirm that the early and late origins are intrinsically different with respect to the timing of the switch from the pre-RC state to the post-RC state. To measure the time window of origin firing and fork passage, replication intermediates from the ori602 andori607 regions were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the same synchronized cells prepared for the time course footprints (Fig. 4E). Because the distance between the ACSs of ori601 and ori602 is only 240 base pairs and their firing events cannot be distinguished by two-dimensional gel analysis, they have been considered as a single origin (20Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 21Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4E, both Y- and bubble-arcs appeared at 60 and 80 min, respectively, in theori602 region. This indicates that this region replicates autonomously through firing or passively through fork progression from 40 to later than 80 min at most or between 60 and 80 min at least (ared bar in Fig. 4F). On the other hand, only a bubble arc appeared at ori607 at 40 min (Fig.4E), suggesting that firing at this origin occurs at most between 20 and 60 min or at least at 40 min (a blue bar in Fig. 4F). These time windows for origin firing are consistent with the period required to convert the cell population from the pre-RC to the post-RC state for ori602 andori607 (Fig. 4F). Therefore, the pre- to post-RC transition times as determined by UV-footprinting at these replication origins are entirely consistent with the timing of firing at these origins. It has been reported that late-replicating origins are inactivated in clb5-deficient cells (19Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Indeed, bubble arcs were undetectable, and only Y-arcs were detectable around the ori602 region as determined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis in clb5deficient cells, whereas no differences in origin firing were observed for ori607 in clb5-deficient cells (Fig.5A). As observed in previous experiments, transitions between pre- and post-RCs normally occur at the same time as origin firing (Fig. 4). Thus, we asked whether this rule could be applied to the RC state at the inactive originori602 in clb5-deficient cells. We performed a similar experiment to that in Fig. 4 using G1-arrestedclb5-deficient cells derived from the W303-1A line (Fig. 5). FACS analysis of the clb5 mutant cells after release showed that although the bulk of DNA replication began at about the same time (30–40 min) as in wild type cells, S phase (40–100 min) took twice as long to complete (40–70 min) as reported before (ref. 19Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar; Fig. 4,A and F, and Fig. 5, B andG). Fig. 5F shows the replicative intermediates obtained from synchronized clb5-deficient cells after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The bubble arc of ori607 was detected 40 min after release. This was similar to the result obtained with W303-1A cells. The replicative intermediates observed in the ori602region were mostly Y-arc and appeared between 60 and 100 min. Very little if any bubble arc was observed. This means that theori602 region replicates mostly by replication forks that originate at other origins. Time course footprints with DNA prepared from the same synchronized clb5-deficient cells and W303-1A cells exhibited very similar transition profiles for the three origins (Fig. 5, C, D, E, andG). The band profiles of the early replication origins,ori1 and ori607, which were initially in the pre-RC state, shifted to the post-RC state 30–50 min after release. Unexpectedly, at ori602, the pre-RC state shifted to the post-RC state without firing in clb5-deficient cells. The only difference was that the shift to the post-RC state took 50–60 min to reach the lowest level in clb5-deficient cells compared with 30 min in W303-1A cells. The transition period (40–100 min) for ori602 in the synchronizedclb5-deficient cells correlated with the time of appearance of the Y-arc in the ori602 region. We have shown by time course footprinting of ori1,ori602, and ori607 that replication complex architecture at these sites shifts between that of a pre-RC and a post-RC in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This is the first report showing transition of the architecture directly in synchronously growing budding yeast cells. Previous comprehensive studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that replication complexes undergo scheduled protein assembly at budding yeast origins (6Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 7Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K.

A. 1999; 96: 9130-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the former experiments, our UV-probing based method allows a more direct analysis of the DNA structural changes associated with replication complex transitions at origins and facilitates the study of the dynamic changes that occur in these complexes during cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the method allowed us to correlate the timing of the shift in the replicative complex architecture with the appearance of replicative intermediates. Strong protection against thymine dimer formation at the T-cluster in the ACS, which appeared from the middle of S phase to late M phase, indicated persistent ORC binding and the establishment of the post-RC state. From M to G1 phase, there was decreased protection, indicating that the binding shifts to the G1 mode. Because our previous data indicate that MCM proteins and Cdc6p are required to maintain the G1 mode, their association with the ORC-ACS complex probably induces this shift (10Fujita M. Hori Y. Shirahige K. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the shift occurs after the cdc15-1 arrest point and before the start of cytokinesis. This corresponds to the time of MCM protein-loading onto replication origins, a process that depends on the accumulation of Cdc6p and the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase (7Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 8Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9130-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This means that a shift in the UV-footprinting profile may represent a topological change in the origin DNA induced by the assembly of proteins at these sites as has already been observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation or chromatin fractionation assays. Therefore, the accumulation of Cdc6p and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase apparently induces the transitions within the RCs. The finding that transitions start almost simultaneously and proceed at the same rate at both early and late origins suggests that the signals that initiate the structural changes (pre-RC formation signals) are distributed over the whole chromosome and that they have even access to all origins at the same time once the cell cycle reaches the appropriate time point. The timing of transition from a pre- to a post-RC differed between early and late origins. After formation of the pre-RC through the loading of MCM proteins onto the existing ORC-ACS complex, other factors, for example, Cdc45p, Cdc7-Dbf4 protein kinase, S phase cyclin-dependent kinase, replication protein A, polymerase α and ɛ are predicted to act on the origins to initiate DNA synthesis (Refs. 8Aparicio O.M.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar)). Because the firing of the origin is linked tightly to the transition from the pre- to post-RC state, it is possible that the association of these factors with the pre-RC triggers the architectural shift as well as origin firing. Once the early origins, ori1and ori607, begin to shift to the post-RC state, the transition at these origins in the whole cell population is completed within a short time span (10–20 min) at the beginning of S phase. In contrast, the late origin, ori602, was still in the pre-RC state at this time, and its transition started in the middle of S phase and took more than 30 min. This slow start and slow shift indicates that the triggering signal has slow access the late origin probably caused by some masking mechanism. It has been shown that late origins, including ori602, can essentially behave as early origins if they are harbored on yeast plasmids (21Yamashita M. Hori Y. Shinomiya T. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Shirahige K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 655-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Ferguson B.M. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 68: 333-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that the delay in late origin firing may depend the origin location within the nucleus, its chromatin structure, or its association with the nuclear matrix. To elucidate the exact mechanism, it will be necessary to compare the effects of these factors on early and late origin firing. In clb5-deficient cells, firing of ori602 was suppressed, as reported for other late origins (19Donaldson A.D. Raghuraman M.K. Friedman K.L. Cross F.R. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This suppression was not because of failure to form an ORC-ACS complex or pre-RC without Clb5p at the late origin, because we observed a normal footprinting profile at ori602 in the mutant Clb5p cells. ORC binding and pre-RC formation at a known dormant origin, ori301, have been reported (28Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6671-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, irrespective of their firing activity, all potential origins create pre-RCs at their ORC-ACS complexes in response to the pre-RC formation signal. What is the mechanism that suppresses late origin firing in Clb5p-deficient cells? Loading of Cdc45p onto chromatin has been shown to be delayed in the absence of Clb5p and Clb6p activity (9Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This means that the ordered assembly of the triggering signal, including that of Cdc45p, may depend on S phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinase activities. Thus, deficiency in clb5 may cause a selective delay in the assembly of triggering signals at late origins. Loci associated with late origins may thus replicate through fork passage from distantly located origins if delays occur in the firing of local origins. Even in the clb5-deficient cells with an inactiveori602, the shift from a pre- to a post-RC still occurred at the origin. This suggests that in addition to direct firing, there exists a secondary mechanism controlling the shift from the pre-RC state at a late origin. The timing of the shift at ori602correlated exactly with the appearance of the Y-arc in this region. Thus, we propose that passage of replication fork from an extraneous origin into a late origin region could work as a secondary mechanism to change a pre-RC into a post-RC. This hypothesis leads to a plausible mechanism about why replication of all chromosomal regions occurs only once in a cell cycle. If a pre-RC at a late origin were maintained even after the passage of a replication fork, the origin could fire again within the same S phase, leading to more than one replication cycle of the origin region. Our observations suggest that this risk is averted at late origins by the conversion of pre-RCs into post-RCs through replication fork passage. This idea is supported by an experiment that examined the transition from a pre- to a post-RC atori602 in hydroxyurea-treated cells. As expected, without replication fork progression from early origins, no transitions were observed atori602, 2R. Tadokoro and C. Obuse, unpublished results. as reported previously for other late origins (12Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). We have shown that the transition of replication origins from the pre- to post-RC state is tightly linked to either direct origin firing or passive replication of the origin by a replication fork from a distantly located origin. We assume in both cases that replication fork movement at or around the origins directly induces association or dissociation of some factor(s), which then trigger the change in the replication complex architecture at these sites. Future studies to reconstitute pre-RCs and reproduce their transition in a cell free system will be necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of origin triggering. We thank Drs. H. Araki, B. Stillman, and B. Brewer for plasmids and strains."
