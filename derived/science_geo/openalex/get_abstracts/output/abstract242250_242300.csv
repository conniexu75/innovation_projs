https://openalex.org/W2101037833,"Transgenerational effects of environmental toxins require either a chromosomal or epigenetic alteration in the germ line. Transient exposure of a gestating female rat during the period of gonadal sex determination to the endocrine disruptors vinclozolin (an antiandrogenic compound) or methoxychlor (an estrogenic compound) induced an adult phenotype in the F 1 generation of decreased spermatogenic capacity (cell number and viability) and increased incidence of male infertility. These effects were transferred through the male germ line to nearly all males of all subsequent generations examined (that is, F 1 to F 4 ). The effects on reproduction correlate with altered DNA methylation patterns in the germ line. The ability of an environmental factor (for example, endocrine disruptor) to reprogram the germ line and to promote a transgenerational disease state has significant implications for evolutionary biology and disease etiology."
https://openalex.org/W1993180746,"Small RNAs, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can silence target genes through several different effector mechanisms. Whereas siRNA-directed mRNA cleavage is increasingly understood, the mechanisms by which miRNAs repress protein synthesis are obscure. Recent studies have revealed the existence of specific cytoplasmic foci, referred to herein as processing bodies (P-bodies), which contain untranslated mRNAs and can serve as sites of mRNA degradation. Here we demonstrate that Argonaute proteins--the signature components of the RNA interference (RNAi) effector complex, RISC--localize to mammalian P-bodies. Moreover, reporter mRNAs that are targeted for translational repression by endogenous or exogenous miRNAs become concentrated in P-bodies in a miRNA-dependent manner. These results provide a link between miRNA function and mammalian P-bodies and suggest that translation repression by RISC delivers mRNAs to P-bodies, either as a cause or as a consequence of inhibiting protein synthesis."

However, the purified exosome showed weak in vitro activity, indicating that rapid RNA degradation requires activating cofactors. This work identifies a nuclear polyadenylation complex containing a known exosome cofactor, the RNA helicase Mtr4p; a poly(A) polymerase, Trf4p; and a zinc knuckle protein, Air2p. In vitro, the Trf4p/Air2p/Mtr4p polyadenylation complex (TRAMP) showed distributive RNA polyadenylation activity. The presence of the exosome suppressed poly(A) tail addition, while TRAMP stimulated exosome degradation through structured RNA substrates. In vivo analyses showed that TRAMP is required for polyadenylation and degradation of rRNA and snoRNA precursors that are characterized exosome substrates. Poly(A) tails stimulate RNA degradation in bacteria, suggesting that this is their ancestral function. We speculate that this function was maintained in eukaryotic nuclei, while cytoplasmic mRNA poly(A) tails acquired different roles in translation.

The exosome is a multisubunit complex with ten common components that are shared between the nuclear and cytoplasmic forms of the complex, often referred to as the “core” exosome. All of these are essential for viability and have either proven or predicted 3′–5′ exonuclease activity (Allmang et al., 1999bAllmang C. Petfalski E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Mitchell P.

Around 15% of the core exosome population is associated with an additional exonuclease, Rrp6p (Allmang et al., 1999bAllmang C. Petfalski E. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Mitchell P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13255-13263Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), which is restricted to the cell nucleus in yeast. Rrp6p functions together with the core exosome, but the absence of Rrp6p frequently results in phenotypes that are distinct from depletion of core exosome components, showing that their functions are substantially separable. The absence of Rrp6p is not lethal but does impair growth and leads to temperature sensitivity (Briggs et al., 1998Briggs M.W. Burkard K.T. Butler J.S.

The accumulation of 3′-extended and polyadenylated precursors to small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) was observed in strains lacking Rrp6p (Allmang et al., 1999aAllmang C.

Modification-defective tRNAMet was stabilized by a mutation in the putative poly(A) polymerase Trf4p and stabilization was also seen in strains mutant for the exosome components Rrp6p and Rrp44p/Dis3p, suggesting that polyadenylation by Trf4p exposes the tRNA to degradation by the exosome (Kadaba et al., 2004Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Anderson J. Nuclear surveillance and degradation of hypomodified initiator tRNAMet in S. cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The purified exosome functions as a 3′–5′ exonuclease in vitro but showed only a slow distributive activity, leading to the accumulation of numerous degradation intermediates (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). In contrast, individual components were active in vitro as recombinant proteins. In particular, recombinant Rrp44p/Dis3p showed a highly processive activity that efficiently degraded RNA to an oligonucleotide product (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). This suggests that, in its default state, the exosome is largely inactive, a potentially important feature in protecting cellular RNAs against inappropriate or nonspecific degradation. It seemed clear that some activation mechanism must alter the exosome to convert the slow, distributive in vitro activity into the rapid, processive activity observed in in vivo activity. A good candidate for an activating cofactor was a DEVH box, putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase Mtr4p/Dob1p (YJL050w) (de la Cruz et al., 1998de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Tollervey D. Linder P. Dob1p (Mtr4p) is a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for the 3′ end formation of 5.8S rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K.

Mtr4p is localized to the nucleoplasm and nucleolus and functions together with the exosome in the degradation and maturation of many nuclear RNA substrates. Here we report that Mtr4p is associated with the TRAMP complex, which can activate the exosome for the degradation of RNA substrates in vitro and in vivo. In order to identify proteins that interact with the exosome cofactor Mtr4p, a two-hybrid analysis was performed using the entire MTR4 open reading frame (ORF) as bait, in a fusion with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in plasmid pB27 (Hybrigenics SA, Paris) (Fromont-Racine et al., 2000Fromont-Racine M. Mayes A.E. Brunet-Simon A. Rain J.C. Colley A. Dix I. Decourty L. Joly N. Ricard F. Beggs J.D. Legrain P. Genome-wide protein interaction screens reveal functional networks involving Sm-like proteins.Yeast. 2000; 17: 95-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This screen identified 22 clones containing regions of the Trf5p ORF and five clones with the Trf4p ORF. No other significant hits were found (for complete data, see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Trf4p and Trf5p are related to the β nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (Aravind and Koonin, 1999Aravind L. Koonin E.V. DNA polymerase beta-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily: identification of three new families, classification and evolutionary history.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For Trf5p, the minimal region common to all of the clones interacting with Mtr4p is amino acids 53–199 (see Figure 1A ), which lies immediately N terminal to the nucleotidyltransferase domain. Each fragment of Trf4p recovered contains a large region of the ORF, precluding more accurate mapping; however, given the high overall homology between Trf4p and Trf5p (57% identity, 70% similarity over 559 aa), it seems very likely that they share a homologous Mtr4p binding site. The central regions of the two proteins are very homologous (73% identity over 363 aa), and this homology extends into the minimal interaction region between Trf5p and Mtr4p (Figure 1A). In other two-hybrid analyses, Air2p was identified as an ORF interacting strongly with Lsm2p (Fromont-Racine et al., 2000Fromont-Racine M. Mayes A.E. Brunet-Simon A. Rain J.C. Colley A. Dix I. Decourty L. Joly N. Ricard F. Beggs J.D. Legrain P. Genome-wide protein interaction screens reveal functional networks involving Sm-like proteins.Yeast. 2000; 17: 95-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Air1p and Air2p (arginine methyltransferase-interacting RING finger protein) are 48% identical and contain RING-type fingers or zinc knuckle domains (Inoue et al., 2000Inoue K. Mizuno T. Wada K. Hagiwara M. Novel RING finger proteins, Air1p and Air2p, interact with Hmt1p and inhibit the arginine methylation of Npl3p.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32793-32799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Purification of a fusion between Air2p and a tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag failed to provide evidence for stable association with the Lsm2-8p complex, but Mtr4p and Trf4p were identified in the precipitate. This association was supported by a recent high-throughput, systematic analysis (Krogan et al., 2004Krogan N.J. Peng W.T. Cagney G. Robinson M.D. Haw R. Zhong G. Guo X. Zhang X. Canadien V. Richards D.P. et al.High-definition macromolecular composition of yeast RNA-processing complexes.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 225-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Initial proteomic analyses used a standard TAP-purification protocol (Rigaut et al., 1999Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar), but substantially better yields were obtained following modifications to the procedure (see Experimental Procedures). Figure 1B shows a Coomassie blue-stained gel of large-scale precipitates of TAP-tagged Air2p, Trf4p, Trf5p, and Mtr4p. Major bands were excised and identified by mass spectrometry. Air2p-TAP coprecipitated Mtr4p and Trf4p with apparent stoichiometry. Mtr4p and Air2p coprecipitated with Trf4p-TAP, again with apparent stoichiometry. In the doublet labeled as Air2p in Figure 1B, both bands were identified as Air2p. Mtr4p coprecipitated with Trf5p-TAP, but no bands corresponding to the mobility of Air1p or Air2p were observed. Finally, Trf4p, Trf5p, and Air2p coprecipitated with Mtr4p-TAP; however, in this case, the recovery of Mtr4p was clearly greater than the other proteins. The apparent stoichiometry of the complex makes it unlikely that the proteins associated only via substrate RNAs. Moreover, RNase treatment of the Trf4p-TAP complex bound to IgG prior to release by TEV cleavage did not abolish the recovery of protein bands with the gel mobility predicted for Mtr4p and Air2p (Figure S1). To confirm these interactions and determine their salt sensitivity, Trf4p-TAP, Trf5p-TAP, and Air2p-TAP were purified following washing of the columns with 100 or 500 mM NaCl (Figure 1C). The presence of Mtr4p in the precipitate was assessed by Western blotting using anti-Mtr4p (anti-Dob1p) antibodies (de la Cruz et al., 1998de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Tollervey D. Linder P. Dob1p (Mtr4p) is a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for the 3′ end formation of 5.8S rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Mtr4p was coprecipitated with Trf4p-TAP, Trf5p-TAP, and Air2p-TAP in preparations washed with 100 mM NaCl but was lost following washing at 500 mM NaCl. The amount of Mtr4p coprecipitated with Trf4p was higher than with Trf5p, consistent with the estimate that Trf4p is ∼3-fold more abundant than Trf5p (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O’Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Global analysis of protein expression in yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). Ten-fold less of the Mtr4p-TAP preparation was used in Figure 1B, confirming that only a fraction of the Mtr4p population is associated with the complex, even under physiological salt conditions. Western blotting confirmed that all four TAP-tagged proteins were bound to the IgG column and cleaved by TEV protease with similar efficiency (data not shown). The nucleolar ribosome synthesis factor Nop1p (Aris and Blobel, 1988Aris P. Blobel G.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Schimmang et al., 1989Schimmang T. Tollervey D. Kern H. Frank R. Hurt E.C. A yeast nucleolar protein related to mammalian fibrillarin is associated with small nucleolar RNA and is essential for viability.EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4015-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) was not detectably coprecipitated with any of the TAP-tagged proteins (Figure 1B), and Mtr4p was not detectably recovered in a mock precipitation from the nontagged control strain (P51) (data not shown). We conclude that Trf4p, Air2p, and Mtr4p form a salt labile complex, which appears to be approximately stoichiometric based on the Coomassie blue staining and will be referred to as TRAMP. Trf5p forms a distinct complex with Mtr4p but does not copurify with Air1p or Air2p. In addition to its participation in the TRAMP complex, a large pool of free Mtr4p also exists. This indicates that Mtr4p is likely to have functions that are not shared by the TRAMP complex, a conclusion that is supported by in vivo analyses (see below). The association of Mtr4p with the putative poly(A) polymerases Trf4p and Trf5p led us to test an Mtr4p-TAP precipitate for polyadenylation activity. Mtr4p-TAP purified at 150 mM NaCl, which was expected to be associated with Trf4p, Trf5p, and Air2p, was assessed for polymerase activity in the presence of 1 mM ATP, UTP, GTP, or CTP (Figure 2A ) using a 37 nt RNA substrate derived from the pBS polylinker (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Robust polyadenylation activity was seen with ATP, with much lower polymerase activity in the presence of GTP. With UTP, only 1–2 nt was added, and no activity was seen in the presence of CTP. To determine whether the observed polyadenylation is due to the presence of the complex associated with Mtr4p, we compared the activity of a 150 mM salt precipitate (TRAMP samples in Figure 2B) with Mtr4p-TAP purified with washing at 500 mM salt (Mtr4p samples in Figure 2B), which dissociates Trf4p, Trf5p, and Air2p from Mtr4p. Coomassie blue staining (data not shown) demonstrated that the 500 mM salt wash did not significantly alter the recovery of Mtr4p itself. The high-salt Mtr4p preparation showed no poly(A) or poly(G) addition (Figure 2B), confirming that the polymerase activity shows salt-labile association with Mtr4p. Poly(A) polymerase activity was then assayed using Trf4p-TAP, Trf5p-TAP, and Air2p-TAP purified following washing with 500 mM NaCl (Figure 2B). Trf4p was associated with a poly(A) polymerase activity that closely resembled the 150 mM salt preparations of Mtr4p (TRAMP lanes). In contrast, no activity was detected for Trf5p-TAP. Western blotting of the protein A tag that remained bound to the IgG column after TEV cleavage confirmed that all three TAP-tagged proteins had bound with similar efficiency and were quantitatively cleaved by TEV (data not shown). The Air2p-TAP preparation showed a lower but clearly detectable polyadenylation activity, indicating that it was still associated with the active polymerase. We conclude that the poly(A) polymerase activity present in 150 mM preparations of Mtr4p-TAP is likely to be associated with the TRAMP complex between Mtr4p, Trf4p, and Air2p, with catalysis performed by Trf4p. In contrast, Trf5p showed no in vitro activity. To better characterize the mode of poly(A) addition, more detailed time courses were analyzed (Figure 2C). Poly(A) tails added to the 37 nt substrate by either the TRAMP complex or purified Trf4p appeared to be quite discrete in size, with an elongation rate of approximately one nucleotide per minute. We also assayed polyadenylation on a substrate that was potentially more physiologically relevant. In vivo analyses indicated that an undermodified pre-tRNA was subject to Trf4p-dependent degradation (Kadaba et al., 2004Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Anderson J. Nuclear surveillance and degradation of hypomodified initiator tRNAMet in S. cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), suggesting that an unmodified pre-tRNA transcript should be a substrate for in vitro polyadenylation and degradation. Incubation of a 110 nt substrate encoding S. pombe pre-tRNASupSI (Krupp et al., 1991Krupp G. Kahle D. Vogt T. Char S. Sequence changes in both flanking sequences of a pre-tRNA influence the cleavage specificity of RNase P.J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with TRAMP or isolated Trf4p gave a rate of poly(A) addition very similar to that seen with the 37 nt substrate (Figure 2D and data not shown). Both the synchrony and slow rate of poly(A) addition suggested a distributive mode of elongation. This was tested by using 10-fold less Trf4p in the reaction to alter the ratio between the RNA and Trf4p (10% lanes in Figure 2D). This led to only a small increase in the length of the RNA substrate, and no products were detected of the length seen at the higher Trf4p concentration. We conclude that Trf4p and the TRAMP complex show a distributive mode of poly(A) addition. Such a mode of elongation might be an important feature of a polymerase that is associated with a degradative activity, since it implies frequent dissociation from the substrate, potentially allowing access to exonucleases. For initial analyses of in vitro activity, we used a standard TAP purification protocol (Rigaut et al., 1999Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). The exosome was purified using a TAP-tagged form of the core component Csl4p, following washing at 500 mM NaCl, while TRAMP was copurified with Mtr4p-TAP at 150 mM NaCl. On the 37 nt transcript (Figure 3A ), the exosome alone was able to initiate degradation but was largely stalled after a few nucleotides, as previously reported (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The combination of the exosome and the TRAMP complex reduced polyadenylation of the substrate but also suppressed the accumulation of the intermediates, suggesting that the processivity of the exosome had been enhanced. Some stabilization of the full-length RNA was also observed, suggesting that binding and slow poly(A) addition by TRAMP may impede initial access of the exosome to the 3′ end of the substrate. Analyses were also preformed using the 110 nt pre-tRNA transcript. This is predicted to be structured and has a single nucleotide 3′ overhang, features that should make it relatively resistant to 3′ exonuclease digestion. The exosome or TRAMP complexes alone showed a very low level of degradation of the tRNA transcript (Figure 3B). Degradation was stimulated by the combination of the exosome with the TRAMP complex, with the appearance of an activity that converted the input RNA to a 4 nt product (Figure 3B; see Figure S2 for comparison of the reaction product to an RNA ladder). Interestingly, this activity closely resembles that previous reported for the recombinant exosome subunit Rrp44p (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). To confirm that degradation was stimulated by the TRAMP complex, we compared the activity of Air2p, Trf4p, Mtr4p, and Trf5p purified under physiological conditions (Figure 3C) and following washing at 500 mM salt (Figure 3D). The exosome was activated by the TRAMP complexes copurified with Air2p, Trf4p, and Mtr4p but was not stimulated by Trf5p purified under the same conditions (Figure 3C). In contrast, the proteins purified after washing with 500 mM salt failed to stimulate degradation singly or in combination. We conclude that the intact TRAMP complex is required for degradation. The activity of the exosome, TRAMP, or exosome + TRAMP was not stimulated by the addition of 1 mM phosphate to the reaction (data not shown), a concentration that was previously shown to activate E. coli PNPase and the recombinant exosome subunit Rrp41p (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). This may indicate that a hydrolytic component of the exosome, rather than one of the phosphorolytic components, is activated by the TRAMP complex. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that sufficient phosphate is carried over with the purified protein complexes to stimulate activity. We also analyzed the activity of the TRAMP and exosome complexes purified under the modified conditions used to obtain the complexes visualized in Figure 1C. These preparations showed substantially higher in vitro activity (Figure 4). Both the exosome and Air2p (TRAMP) preparations were able to partially degrade the substrate, but the combination yielded a synergistic increase in degradation (Figures 4A and 4B). To assess the effects of a poly(A) tail on exosome activity, the tRNA substrate was polyadenylated by treatment with Trf4p (Figure 4D). The exosome alone was able to efficiently remove the poly(A) tail, generating a product with gel mobility that was indistinguishable from the nonpolyadenylated transcript. Addition of high-salt-purified Mtr4p failed to stimulate degradation of the deadenylated tRNA and indeed appeared to be mildly inhibitory. We conclude that the poly(A) tail can be rapidly removed by the exosome alone, but its presence does not strongly stimulate degradation of the structured tRNA region, even in the presence of the Mtr4p RNA helicase. The role of poly(A) tail addition in stimulating degradation was further assessed by analyses in the presence and absence of added ATP and in the presence of cordycepin (3′ deoxyadenosine) 5′ triphosphate, an ATP analog that cannot be extended into poly(A) chains (Figure 4C). In four independent experiments using three different TRAMP preparations, similar stimulation of degradation by TRAMP was seen in the presence or absence of added ATP. The presence of cordycepin triphosphate in place of ATP was mildly inhibitory to the reaction. We cannot exclude the possibility that a small amount of ATP is present in the purified protein complexes. However, we estimate that the RNA substrate is present in ∼10-fold molar excess over the protein complexes, and it seems unlikely that this makes a significant contribution to the degradation activity. We conclude that neither the polyadenylation activity of Trf4p nor the putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity of Mtr4p is required for the stimulation of exosome activity by the TRAMP complex on this naked RNA transcript in vitro. We would, however, anticipate that these activities are important for activity on the highly structured RNA-protein complexes that are the substrates for the exosome in vivo. The data would be consistent with the activation of one of the hydrolytic components of the exosome, e.g., Rrp44p, which shows highly processive, ATP-independent RNA exonuclease activity in vitro (Mitchell et al., 1997Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. The exosome; a conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex containing multiple 3′→5′ exoribonuclease activities.Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Strains depleted of Mtr4p show in vivo defects in the processing and degradation of nuclear RNAs substrates that resemble those of exosome mutants. To determine whether TRAMP participates in these functions, strains lacking Trf4p, Trf5p, Air1p, and Air2p were tested for defects in nuclear RNA processing and degradation (Figure 5, Figure 6). Trf4p and Trf5p are at least partly functionally redundant in vivo, since double mutants are synthetic lethal (Castano et al., 1996bCastano I.B. Heath-Pagliuso S. Sadoff B.U. Fitzhugh D.J.

We therefore constructed and tested a strain in which TRF4 was deleted and TRF5 was placed under GAL regulation to allow its depletion on glucose medium. Strains lacking both Air1p and Air2p are viable but impaired in growth (Inoue et al., 2000Inoue K. Mizuno T. Wada K. Hagiwara M.

We show here that several supposedly silent intergenic regions in the genome of S. cerevisiae are actually transcribed by RNA polymerase II, suggesting that the expressed fraction of the genome is higher than anticipated. Surprisingly, however, RNAs originating from these regions are rapidly degraded by the combined action of the exosome and a new poly(A) polymerase activity that is defined by the Trf4 protein and one of two RNA binding proteins, Air1p or Air2p. We show that such a polyadenylation-assisted degradation mechanism is also responsible for the degradation of several Pol I and Pol III transcripts. Our data strongly support the existence of a posttranscriptional quality control mechanism limiting inappropriate expression of genetic information.

Our data strongly support the existence of a posttranscriptional quality control mechanism limiting inappropriate expression of genetic information. Most, if not all, eukaryotic primary transcripts, whether transcribed by RNA polymerase (Pol) I, II, or III, undergo maturation, which includes endonucleolytic severing, exonucleolytic trimming, splicing, nucleotide modifications/edition, and/or capping. Interestingly, most mature 3′ ends are generated by processing. Some result from cleavage and/or trimming, while others are extended by polymerases of the β family, which add 3′ tails without the help of a DNA template: CCA for tRNA (Schurer et al., 2001Schurer H. Schiffer S. Marchfelder A. Morl M. This is the end: processing, editing and repair at the tRNA 3′-terminus.Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or poly(A) sequences for mRNA (Proudfoot and O’Sullivan, 2002Proudfoot N. O’Sullivan J. Polyadenylation: a tail of two complexes.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R855-R857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Addition of poly(A) tails to mRNAs occurs at an endonucleolytic cleavage site that is severed cotranscriptionally. The Pap1p protein has poly(A) polymerase activity but depends on the assembly of a large complex for its function, which also insures correct positioning and control the length of the poly(A) tail (Keller and Minvielle-Sebastia, 1997Keller W. Minvielle-Sebastia L. A comparison of mammalian and yeast pre-mRNA 3′-end processing.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In eucaryotes, polyadenylation of coding RNAs has at least three important functions: it is required for RNA stability, efficient nucleocytoplasmic export, and translation. Except for a limited number of exclusively nuclear species, most transcripts reach the cytoplasm, where a large majority contribute to protein synthesis. In this canonical view of the RNA synthesis pathway, the expressed fraction of the genome in a given cell is determined by accurate promoter selection. Transcription from these landmarks generates primary transcripts that are matured into functional RNA molecules, while the remaining fragments of the primary transcripts (e.g., introns, 3′ trailers, as well as 3′ extensions and internal spacers of the pre-rRNAs and pre-tRNAs) are rapidly degraded (e.g., Kim et al., 2004Kim M. Krogan N.J. Vasiljeva L. Rando O.J. Nedea E. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. The yeast Rat1 exonuclease promotes transcription termination by RNA polymerase II.Nature. 2004; 432: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, West et al., 2004West S. Gromak N. Proudfoot N.J. Human 5′→3′ exonuclease Xrn2 promotes transcription termination at co-transcriptional cleavage sites.Nature. 2004; 432: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These events may explain the high rate of degradation of a fraction of nuclear RNAs never reaching the cytoplasm (e.g., Egyhazi, 1976Egyhazi E. Quantitation of turnover and export to the cytoplasm of hnRNA transcribed in the Balbiani rings.Cell. 1976; 7: 507-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to degradation events targeting short-lived processing intermediates, specific nuclear RNA decay pathways also destroy aberrant pre-mRNAs or those failing to be exported (Bousquet-Antonelli et al., 2000Bousquet-Antonelli C.

In yeast, Rat1p and the exosome are two exonucleases implicated in these nuclear degradation processes: Rat1p is a 5′–3′ exonuclease showing sequence similarity to Xrn1, the major 5′–3′ exonuclease involved in cytoplasmic mRNA decay (Johnson, 1997Johnson A.W. Rat1p and Xrn1p are functionally interchangeable exoribonucleases that are restricted to and required in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Rat1p is mostly nuclear and has been implicated in the maturation of pre-rRNAs and snoRNAs (Petfalski et al., 1998Petfalski E. Dandekar T. Henry Y. Tollervey D. Processing of the precursors to small nucleolar RNAs and rRNAs requires common components.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and in transcription termination (Kim et al., 2004Kim M. Krogan N.J. Vasiljeva L. Rando O.J. Nedea E. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. The yeast Rat1 exonuclease promotes transcription termination by RNA polymerase II.Nature. 2004; 432: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The exosome is a large complex of 3′–5′ nucleases that is found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Mitchell and Tollervey, 2000Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Musing on the structural organization of the exosome complex.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The nuclear form of the complex contains two specific subunits, Rrp6p and Lrp1p, that are its only nonessential subunits. The exosome has been implicated in numerous nuclear RNA processing and degradation events including pre-rRNA and sn(o)RNA maturation (Allmang et al., 1999aAllmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P.

Presence of both Rat1p and exosome homologs in eukaryotic species suggests that the cognate decay pathways are evolutionarily conserved. To identify new targets for the nuclear exosome, we have analyzed the transcriptome of a strain lacking Rrp6p with DNA microarrays. In accordance with previous studies, polyadenylated forms of numerous Pol II and Pol III noncoding RNAs (Allmang et al., 1999aAllmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D.

Polyadenylation of rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8581-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) accumulated. Surprisingly, we identified in addition new polyadenylated transcripts mapping to intergenic regions. These were characterized as novel Pol II transcription units. Accumulation of the cognate RNAs in a rrp6 mutant results from their stabilization rather than from transcriptional activation. Interestingly, most poly(A) additions to these transcripts are not mediated by the classical polyadenylation machinery. Database searches revealed the presence of other potential poly(A) polymerases encoded by the yeast genome, including Trf4p that has recently independently been shown to be required for polyadenylation and degradation of hypomodified forms of tRNAmet (Kadaba et al., 2004Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Anderson J. Nuclear surveillance and degradation of hypomodified initiator tRNAMet in S. cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Consistently, we show that Trf4p associates with Air1p and Air2p to form a new enzyme endowed with polyadenylation activity. This complex associated with Mtr4p, a putative RNA helicase previously implicated in activation of the nuclear exosome (de la Cruz et al., 1998de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Tollervey D. Linder P. Dob1p (Mtr4p) is a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for the 3′ end formation of 5.8S rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 1996Liang S. Hitomi M. Hu Y.H. Liu Y. Tartakoff A.M. A DEAD-box-family protein is required for nucleocytoplasmic transport of yeast mRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5139-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the polyadenylation of most cryptic transcripts derived from intergenic regions detected in the rrp6Δ background was nearly completely abolished in the absence of Trf4p, leading to their further stabilization. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a novel yeast nuclear poly(A) polymerase is implicated in a quality control process targeting numerous RNA to degradation by the exosome. Notably, this mechanism appears to limit the genomic noise resulting from inappropriate transcription of intergenic regions in the genome. These observations have several evolutionary implications. The role of the Rrp6p exonuclease in the nuclear turnover of Pol II transcripts is still unclear. To identify new Rrp6p targets, we compared the transcriptomes of an rrp6Δ and a wild-type strain using Affymetrix DNA microarrays spanning the entire yeast ORFeome as well as some noncoding RNAs and intergenic regions. Two microarrays were used with RNAs from a wild-type strain (BMA64; see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) and two with RNAs from an rrp6Δ strain (LMA164), and the signal intensities were compared (Figure 1A ). Importantly, the fluorescent probes were generated from total RNAs using oligo(dT) as primer and were thus enriched for probes against polyadenylated RNAs. While the vast majority of the cellular ORF-containing transcripts did not differ between the two strains (only 5.1% of verified ORFs reproducibly exhibit an rrp6Δ/WT ratio >2), a number of signals increased significantly in the rrp6 mutant compared to the wild-type. Signals corresponding to almost all snRNAs and snoRNAs and directly downstream sequences strongly increased in an rrp6Δ background (red dots, Figure 1A), presumably as a consequence of the previously reported polyadenylation of such transcripts in the absence of Rrp6p (Allmang et al., 1999aAllmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D.

Biol. 2000; 20: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, and see below). Likewise, signals corresponding to several rRNA species increased dramatically (yellow dots, Figure 1A), consistent with the reported stabilization of polyadenylated forms of these transcripts in rrp6 mutants (Kuai et al., 2004Kuai L. Fang F. Butler J.S. Sherman F. Polyadenylation of rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 8581-8586Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and see below; van Hoof et al., 2000van Hoof A. Lennertz P. Parker R. Yeast exosome mutants accumulate 3′-extended polyadenylated forms of U4 small nuclear RNA and small nucleolar RNAs.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a number of signals derived from intergenic regions not linked to previously reported transcripts were also specifically enhanced in the rrp6 mutant. Many of these signals corresponded to intergenic regions containing SAGE tags (Velculescu et al., 1997Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Zhou W. Vogelstein J. Basrai M.A. Bassett Jr., D.E. Hieter P. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Characterization of the yeast transcriptome.Cell. 1997; 88: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) (green dots, Figure 1A). Some (20.3%) of these SAGE probes (cured for those overlapping or next to known noncoding RNAs; see Table S3) reproducibly exhibited an rrp6Δ/WT ratio >2 in the two independent experiments (by comparison, only 0.8% of these probes exhibited a ratio >2 in the controls where the isogenic strains, i.e., WT-1/WT-2 and rrp6Δ-1/rrp6Δ-2, were compared). Similarly, 7.7% of these probes reproducibly exhibited an rrp6Δ/WT ratio >3 in both independent experiments when this number was only 0.9% for the verified ORFs. This specific behavior of the SAGE probes did not result from a bias in the distribution of signal intensities between the two types of features (SAGE probes versus ORFs), since essentially identical results were obtained when comparing a subset of ORF and SAGE probes exhibiting an average signal ratio within the same intensity class (300–3000 average intensities). The peculiarity of SAGE probes was also apparent when comparing the class frequencies distribution of log2-transformed ratios between the two kind of features (Figure 1B): the rrp6Δ versus wild-type ratios (green curves) appear more significantly shifted toward higher values relative to the control experiments (gray curves) for the intergenic SAGEs compared to verified ORFs. These microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR performed on cDNAs primed with sequence specific oligonucleotides (Figure 1C), indicating that, in at least six out of eight test regions, signal increase resulted from higher transcript amounts rather than from polyadenylation of a preexisting RNA. These new regions thus differ from loci containing noncoding RNAs (snRNAs, snoRNAs, rRNAs, etc.). Oligo-directed RNase H cleavage and Northern blots performed for four of these transcripts, corresponding to Affymetrix features NEL025c (Figure 2A ), NBL001c, NPL040w, and NGR060w (Figure S1), revealed that they consisted in RNAs of heterogeneous sizes (250–600 nt). The oligo-directed RNase H cleavage experiments showed that, except for NPL040W, these transcripts had a discrete 5′ end, and their heterogeneity thus resulted from multiple 3′ ends. We chose NEL025C (located on chromosome V between RMD6 and DLD3) for further studies. RNaseH cleavage with oligo dT increased mobility of NEL025c transcripts but did not abolish size heterogeneity (Figure 2A, compare lanes 7 and 8). The polyadenylation status of these heterogeneous transcripts was further confirmed by oligo-dT affinity selection (Figure 2B). Taken together, these data indicate that these transcripts extend from a defined 5′ end to multiple, closely spaced 3′ ends to which poly(A) tails have been added. The oligo-dT-selected RNAs were also hybridized with a probe specific for the NGR060W transcripts and showed that these RNAs are also polyadenalylated in the rrp6Δ strain (data not shown). Given their structure, we assessed whether NEL025c-derived RNAs are independent Pol II transcripts or readthrough products from neighboring genes. Immunoprecipitation with anti-cap antibodies (H20, kind gift of R. Lührmann) indicated that these transcripts are capped, which is a distinctive feature of Pol II transcripts and a specific mark of the transcription initiation site (Figure S2). Furthermore, inactivation of Pol II in a double mutant rrp6Δ/rpb1-1, expressing a thermosensitive form of the largest Pol II subunit (Nonet et al., 1987Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Eucaryotic RNA polymerase conditional mutant that rapidly ceases mRNA synthesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and grown at nonpermissive temperature (37°C), resulted in the strong reduction of NEL025c transcript levels compared to a Pol III 5S ribosomal RNA control (Figure S3A). A similar result was also obtained for other intergenic transcripts (Figure S3B). Finally, the NEL025c-transcribed sequences expressed from their genomic locus but under the control of a heterologous Pol II promoter (tetO7 operators under the control of the tetracycline repressible tTA transactivator; Gari et al., 1997Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. A set of vectors with a tetracycline-regulatable promoter system for modulated gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) were also strongly upregulated (∼15 fold) in the absence of Rrp6p (Figure S3C). Together, these results indicate that these rrp6Δ-induced intergenic RNAs are independent, capped, and polyadenylated Pol II transcripts. To demonstrate that these intergenic RNAs are produced in both the wild-type and the rrp6Δ strain but have higher turnover rates in the former strain, we assessed Pol II occupancy at the NEL025c locus by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in both strains. Real-time PCR analysis of the DNA immunoprecipitated with anti-Rpb1p antibodies was performed with primer pairs spanning the whole NEL025c locus. RNAs were analyzed in parallel by real-time RT-PCR with the same primer set. In striking contrast with the differences in transcript amounts, Pol II density was similar (or even slightly higher) in the wild-type strain compared to the rrp6Δ strain in the region tested (Figure 2C). This ChIP signal was specific since abolished by mutation of the largest Pol II subunit in an rpb1-1 strain (Nonet et al., 1987Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Eucaryotic RNA polymerase conditional mutant that rapidly ceases mRNA synthesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, Schroeder et al., 2000Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Dynamic association of capping enzymes with transcribing RNA polymerase II.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) at the nonpermissive temperature (Figure S4). Pol II-ChIP analysis of other intergenic regions gave essentially identical results (data not shown). To further confirm that NEL025c transcripts are transcribed but more rapidly degraded in the presence of Rrp6p, we compared their turnover rates in a wild-type and rrp6Δ strains. Some NEL025c transcripts could be detected above background by real-time PCR in a wild-type strain, consistent with the existence of a SAGE tag in this genomic region (Velculescu et al., 1997Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Zhou W. Vogelstein J. Basrai M.A. Bassett Jr., D.E. Hieter P. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Characterization of the yeast transcriptome.Cell. 1997; 88: 243-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Use of an rpb1-1 mutant (Nonet et al., 1987Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Eucaryotic RNA polymerase conditional mutant that rapidly ceases mRNA synthesis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) allowed fast transcription shutoff in an otherwise wild-type or rrp6Δ context. As expected, the turnover rate of NEL025c transcripts was significantly higher in the rpb1-1 strain compared to the rpb1-1/rrp6Δ strain, although the very low amount of transcripts in the rpb1-1 strain precluded precise determination of the half-life of these RNAs (t1/2 <3 min in the rpb1-1 strain and ∼10 min in the rpb1-1/rrp6Δ strain); ACT1 turnover rate was not significantly different in the two strains (Figure S5). Altogether, these data indicate that the NEL025c RNAs are produced in both the rrp6Δ and the wild-type strains, but, in the latter, the RNAs are more rapidly degraded. Degradation of these RNAs was also dependent on the integrity of the core exosome, as depletion of Rrp41p resulted in a similar stabilization of the NEL025c transcripts (Figure S6). Given the properties of the RNA products of these regions, revealed in the rrp6Δ strain, we named them CUTs for cryptic unstable transcipts. For most Pol II transcripts, the standard polyadenylation machinery adds poly(A) to a limited number of sites generated by cleavage. The heterogeneous 3′ ends of the CUTs were thus unexpected. To test the involvement of the standard polyadenylation machinery in NEL025c CUT poly(A) formation, we analyzed its polyadenylation status in an rrp6Δ/pap1-1 double mutant shifted for 1 hr at the nonpermissive temperature (37°C). Oligo-dT-selected RNAs were analyzed by Northern blot (Figure 2B). Strikingly, Pap1p mutation did not strongly affect the amount and profile of the most abundant polyadenylated forms of these heterogeneous transcripts (300–400 nucleotides long), although the amount of the less abundant longest forms (>500 nucleotides) appear to decrease in the rrp6Δ/pap1-1 strain compared to the rrp6Δ strain (Figure 2B, lanes 1–8). As a control, polyadenylation of RPS28A mRNA, a standard Pap1p substrate, was strongly inhibited in these conditions (Figure 2B). These observations suggested that the main polyadenylated forms of the NEL025c heterogeneous transcripts were polyadenylated by a machinery not involving Pap1p. These results suggested the presence of at least another yeast poly(A) polymerase in addition to the classical machinery. Database searches revealed the presence of two highly related proteins, Trf4p and Trf5p, with distant similarity to Pap1p. These factors are similar to Cid1 and Cid13 from S. pombe and to Gld2 from C. elegans and related mammalian proteins that were recently described as cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerases (Kwak et al., 2004Kwak J.E. Wang L. Ballantyne S. Kimble J. Wickens M. Mammalian GLD-2 homologs are poly(A) polymerases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 713-724Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). While this work was in progress, a role for Trf4p in the polyadenylation of aberrant hypomodified tRNAMet was proposed (Kadaba et al., 2004Kadaba S. Krueger A. Trice T. Krecic A.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Anderson J. Nuclear surveillance and degradation of hypomodified initiator tRNAMet in S. cerevisiae.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To directly test whether Trf4p was endowed with poly(A) polymerase activity, we purified Trf4p and control factors from yeast using the TAP method (Rigaut et al., 1999Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. A generic protein purification method for protein complex characterization and proteome exploration.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar) and assayed their poly(A) polymerase activity by following the incorporation of radiolabeled ATP in acid insoluble material using total yeast RNA as substrate. A strong incorporation was specifically detected with Trf4p-TAP (Figure 3A ). In a similar assay, a Trf5p-TAP preparation was poorly active (data not shown). RNA polymerase activity of the Trf4p-TAP preparation is specific for ATP and could be primed by all tested substrates, including oligo(A) and tRNAs, with the exception of poly(U) (data not shown). Extension of an in vitro-transcribed RNA occurred in a time (data not shown) and Trf4-TAP concentration (Figure 3B) dependent manner in an apparent distributive reaction incorporating up to 500 residues. Mutation of two catalytic site residues (Wang et al., 2000Wang Z. Castano I.B. De Las Penas A. Adams C. Christman M.F. Pol kappa: A DNA polymerase required for sister chromatid cohesion.Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) abolished the poly(A) polymerase activity of a Trf4-236-TAP preparation (Figure 3C). Overall, these data demonstrated the existence of a new yeast poly(A) polymerase having Trf4p as a catalytic subunit that we confirmed to be nuclear (Huh et al., 2003Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O’Shea E.K. Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast.Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar and data not shown). While our results demonstrate that Trf4p is a subunit of a new poly(A) polymerase, recombinant Trf4-produced in E. coli was inactive in polyadenylation assays (see below), suggesting the requirement for additional factors and/or protein modification(s). Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified Trf4p-TAP complex (Figure 4A ) revealed the presence of additional factors, two of which that were identified as the related Air1 and Air2 proteins, which are located in the nucleus and have been previously implicated in nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport (Inoue et al., 2000Inoue K. Mizuno T. Wada K. Hagiwara M. Novel RING finger proteins, Air1p and Air2p, interact with Hmt1p and inhibit the arginine methylation of Npl3p.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32793-32799Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A larger protein present at substoichiometric levels was identified as Mtr4p, a putative RNA helicase that was shown to interact functionally with the exosome (de la Cruz et al., 1998de la Cruz J. Kressler D. Tollervey D. Linder P. Dob1p (Mtr4p) is a putative ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for the 3′ end formation of 5.8S rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1128-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), supporting a role for Trf4p in the degradation of CUTs (see below). In addition, several ribosomal proteins were found in the purified fraction, possibly as a consequence of the implication of Trf4p in rRNA processing (see below). All these data are consistent with previous large-scale studies (Ho et al., 2002Ho Y. Gruhler A. Heilbut A. Bader G.D. Moore L. Adams S.L. Millar A. Taylor P. Bennett K.

By blocking ATP binding to HSP90, treatment with 17-AAG stabilizes HSP90 conformation into the alternative one that recruits HSP70-based co-chaperone complex, which binds the misfolded client proteins and directs them to polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (11Meyer P.

Following recruitment by multiprotein transcriptional complexes to the promoters of genes, the balance between the activities of HATs and HDACs regulates the acetylation status of chromatin and transcription through chromatin modification without directly binding the DNA (15Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Importantly, these enzymes also affect the acetylation status of specific lysine residues of a number of transcription factors, which may affect their DNA binding and transcriptional activity (16Marks P.A.

These observations raised the issue as to which of the HDACs is responsible for deacetylating HSP90, such that its inhibition by HAA-HDIs induces acetylation and undermines the chaperone function of HSP90. HDAC6 is predominantly a cytoplasmic, microtubule-associated member of the class IIB family of HDACs (21Verdin E. Dequiedt F. Kasler H.G. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 286-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). HDAC6 is unique in possessing two catalytic domains and a C-terminal zinc finger domain that binds both polyubiquitylated misfolded proteins and the dynein motor (22Hook S.S. Orian A. Cowley S.M.

Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The C-terminal catalytic domain of HDAC6 possesses α-tubulin deacetylase activity, which is inhibited by the small molecule inhibitor tubacin (24Hubbert C. Guardiola A. Shao R. Kawaguchi Y. Ito A.

HDAC6 has also been demonstrated to direct the polyubiquitylated misfolded proteins into aggresomes, thus regulating the cellular management of the misfolded protein stress response (23Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Collectively, these features of HDAC6 suggested that HDAC6 might be involved in HSP90 deacetylation. In the present studies we determined whether HDAC6 regulates the acetylation status of HSP90 and whether depletion or inhibition of HDAC6 affects the chaperone function of HSP90 in human leukemia cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—17-AAG was obtained from Developmental Therapeutics Branch of CTEP, NCI, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD).

This had a 21-nucleotide sequence (5′-GG ATG GAT CTG AAC CTT GAG A-3′) corresponding to the targeted codons 200–219 in the HDAC6 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number BC013737) or a nonspecific siRNA encoding sequence. Forty-eight h following transfection, cell lysates were screened for HDAC6 expression by Western blot analysis.

After exposure of cells to LAQ824 for 16 h, immunoprecipitation of HSP90 followed by immunoblotting with an antibody that recognizes anti-acetylated lysine residues was performed. Acetylation of HSP90 in a dose-dependent manner was observed, without significant effect on the levels of HSP90 (Fig. 1A). Exposure to LBH589 exerted a similar effect on HSP90 acetylation (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with sodium butyrate or trapoxin (which are known not to inhibit the activities of class II HDACs) for 16 h did not induce HSP90 acetylation (Fig. 1B). Exposure to tubacin, which inhibits only the α-tubulin deacetylase (TDAC) domain of HDAC6, caused only a minimal increase in HSP90 acetylation. Following treatment of K562 cells with LAQ824 or LBH589 for 16 h, HSP90 was affinity-precipitated from the cell lysates with ATP-Sepharose, and the levels of HSP90 were estimated by immunoblot analysis. LAQ824- and LBH589-mediated acetylation of HSP90 was associated with decreased binding of ATP-Sepharose to HSP90 (Fig. 1C). While 17-AAG, the geldanamycin analogue inhibitor of the ATP binding pocket of HSP90, was also effective in inhibiting the binding of ATP-Sepharose to HSP90, treatment with sodium butyrate, trapoxin, or tubacin (not shown) was ineffective (Fig. 1C).Next, we evaluated the impact of these modifications on the function of HSP90 as a chaperone protein. Following exposure of K562 cells to LAQ824 for 16 h, Bcr-Abl was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, and the binding of Bcr-Abl to HSP90 versus HSP70 was determined. Fig. 2A demonstrates that, similar to what has been observed with 17-AAG, treatment with LAQ824 shifted the chaperone association of Bcr-Abl from HSP90 to HSP70. A similar shift in the chaperone association was also seen following treatment with LBH589 (data not shown). Previous reports have shown that the shift in the chaperone association of the client proteins to the HSP70 containing unstable multichaperone complex induces polyubiquitylation and accumulation of the client proteins in the detergent-insoluble cellular fraction. Polyubiquitylation marks the client proteins for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 6Bagatell R. Whitesell L. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, treatment with LAQ824 increased Bcr-Abl accumulation in the detergent-insoluble fraction, which was further enhanced by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor PS341 (bortezomib) (Fig. 2B). Additionally, treatment of K562 cells with LAQ824 increased the polyubiquitylation of proteins in the Bcr-Abl-containing immunoprecipitates with anti-Abl antibody (Fig. 2B). Increased polyubiquitylation of proteins was also seen following treatment with PS341 or following co-treatment with LAQ824 and PS341 (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this finding, treatment with LAQ824 depleted the levels of Bcr-Abl in K562 cells (Fig. 2C). As also reported previously, LAQ824 treatment depleted c-Raf and AKT levels (18Nimmanapalli R. Fuino L. Bali P. Gasparetto M. Glozak M. Tao J. Moscinski L. Smith C. Wu J. Jove R. Atadja P. Bhalla K.

A, K562 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of LAQ824 for 16 h. Then immunoprecipitates (IP) of Bcr-Abl from the cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with anti-HSP90, anti-Hsp70, or anti-Abl antibodies. B, K562 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of LAQ824 and/or PS341 (bortezomib) for 16 h. Then immunoprecipitates of Bcr-Abl from the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-ubiquitin or anti-Abl antibodies. Additionally, following treatment of K562 cells with LAQ824 and/or PS341, the detergent (Nonidet P-40)-insoluble fractions were obtained and immunoblotted with anti-Abl antibody. The levels of β-actin served as the loading control. C, K562 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of LAQ824 for 16 h. Then the cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-acetyl α-tubulin, p21, Abl, c-Raf, or anti-AKT antibody. The levels of β-actin served as the loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Simultaneous induction of the acetylation of α-tubulin and HSP90 by LAQ824 raised the possibility that inhibition of HDAC6 may be responsible for LAQ824-mediated acetylation and inhibition of the chaperone function of HSP90. To address this issue, we first determined whether HDAC6 is co-immunoprecipitated with HSP90. As shown in Fig. 3A, in K562 cells HDAC6 could be co-immunoprecipitated with HSP90. Treatment with LAQ824 or LBH589 for 16 h, but not treatment with sodium butyrate, reduced the amount of HDAC6 that could be co-immunoprecipitated with HSP90, as estimated by densitometry (Fig. 3A). LAQ824 but not trapoxin treatment was associated with a slight increase in the levels of HDAC6, whereas neither drug significantly affected the levels of HDAC10 (the HDAC most closely related to HDAC6) (data not shown). We next determined the effect of the ectopic overexpression of HDAC6 on LAQ824-induced acetylation of α-tubulin and HSP90 and on induction of p21 in K562 cells. A FLAG-tagged cDNA of HDAC6 was transfected in K562 cells, and the transient expression of FLAG and the overexpression of HDAC6 were confirmed in K562/HDAC6 cells (Fig. 3B). As compared with the vector alone-transfected control K562 cells, a 2-fold increase in HDAC6 expression was detected in K562/HDAC6 cells. The discrepancy between FLAG expression and only a 2-fold overexpression of HDAC6 may be because the anti-HDAC6 antibody poorly recognized its epitope in the FLAG-tagged version of HDAC6. No significant change in the HDAC10 levels was observed in K562/HDAC6 cells (Fig. 3B). As compared with the control K562, LAQ824-mediated increase in the levels of acetylated α-tubulin but not of p21 was blunted in K562/HDAC6 cells (Fig. 3B). LAQ824 treatment did not significantly affect HDAC6 or HDAC10 expression in K562/HDAC6 and K562/control cells. Importantly, ectopic overexpression of HDAC6 also inhibited LAQ824-induced HSP90 acetylation in K562/HDAC6 cells (Fig. 3C). Concomitantly, as compared with the effect of LAQ824 in K562/control cells, a lesser LAQ824-mediated attenuation of Bcr-Abl and c-Raf levels was observed in K562/HDAC6 cells (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3HDAC6 binds to HSP90, and ectopic overexpression of HDAC6 inhibits LAQ824-mediated acetylation of α-tubulin and HSP90. A, K562 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of HAA-HDI LAQ824 or LBH589 or with sodium butyrate for 16 h. Then total cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated (IP) to HSP90 or the control rat IgG. Immunoblot analysis (IB) was performed with either anti-HSP90 or anti-HDAC6 antibody. B, K562 cells were transiently transfected with pCDNA3.1 vector containing FLAG-tagged HDAC6 (K562/HDAC6) or the vector alone (K562/vector) over 48 h. Then the cells were treated with 250 nm LAQ824 for 16 h. After this treatment, the cell lysates were immuno"

Here, we developed replication-competent vaccines against EBOV and MARV based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing either the EBOV glycoprotein or MARV glycoprotein. A single intramuscular injection of the EBOV or MARV vaccine elicited completely protective immune responses in nonhuman primates against lethal EBOV or MARV challenges. Notably, vaccine vector shedding was not detectable in the monkeys and none of the animals developed fever or other symptoms of illness associated with vaccination. The EBOV vaccine induced humoral and apparent cellular immune responses in all vaccinated monkeys, whereas the MARV vaccine induced a stronger humoral than cellular immune response. No evidence of EBOV or MARV replication was detected in any of the protected animals after challenge. Our data suggest that these vaccine candidates are safe and highly efficacious in a relevant animal model."
https://openalex.org/W1974973994,"Closely related signals often lead to very different cellular outcomes. We found that the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into bone-forming cells is stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We used mass spectrometry–based proteomics to comprehensively compare proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EGF and PDGF and their associated partners. More than 90% of these signaling proteins were used by both ligands, whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway was exclusively activated by PDGF, implicating it as a possible control point. Indeed, chemical inhibition of PI3K in PDGF-stimulated cells removed the differential effect of the two growth factors, bestowing full differentiation effect onto PDGF. Thus, quantitative proteomics can directly compare entire signaling networks and discover critical differences capable of changing cell fate."

FruM is expressed in ∼2% of neurons in the male nervous system, but not in the female. We have targeted the insertion of GAL4 into the fru locus, allowing us to visualize and manipulate the FruM-expressing neurons in the male as well as their counterparts in the female. We present evidence that these neurons are directly and specifically involved in male courtship behavior and that at least some of them are interconnected in a circuit. This circuit includes olfactory neurons required for the behavioral response to sex pheromones. Anatomical differences in this circuit that might account for the dramatic differences in male and female sexual behavior are not apparent."

https://openalex.org/W1965149530,"Plant cells have two defense systems that detect bacterial pathogens. One is a basal defense system that recognizes complex pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). A second system uses disease-resistance (R) proteins to recognize type lll effector proteins that are delivered into the plant cell by the pathogen's type III secretion system. Here we show that these two pathways are linked. We find that two Pseudomonas syringae type III effectors, AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1, inhibit PAMP-induced signaling and thus compromise the host's basal defense system. RIN4 is an Arabidopsis protein targeted by AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1 for degradation and phosphorylation, respectively. We find that RIN4 is itself a regulator of PAMP signaling. The R proteins, RPS2 and RPM1, sense type III effector-induced perturbations of RIN4. Thus, R proteins guard the plant against type III effectors that inhibit PAMP signaling and provide a mechanistic link between the two plant defense systems."

Drosophila melanogaster males (but not females) perform an elaborate and innate courtship ritual directed toward females (but not males).

We have generated alleles of fru that are constitutively spliced in either the male or the female mode. We show that male splicing is essential for male courtship behavior and sexual orientation.

More importantly, male splicing is also sufficient to generate male behavior in otherwise normal females. These females direct their courtship toward other females (or males engineered to produce female pheromones). The splicing of a single neuronal gene thus specifies essentially all aspects of a complex innate behavior. Animals are born not only with their characteristic body plan and morphology, but also a set of innate behaviors, or instincts, that are manifested as stereotyped responses to environmental stimuli (Tinbergen, 1951Tinbergen N. The Study of Instinct. Clarendon Press, Oxford1951Google Scholar). Enormous progress has been made over the past several decades in elucidating the developmental processes that direct the formation of the body plan and its parts. In contrast, our understanding of how innate behaviors are specified is still rudimentary at best. It is not even clear whether the general principles gleaned from the study of morphological development also apply to the development of behavior. For example, body parts are often specified by “switch” or “selector” genes, the action of which is both necessary and sufficient to trigger the development of a complete anatomical structure (Garcia-Bellido, 1975Garcia-Bellido A. Genetic control of wing disc development in Drosophila.Ciba Found. Symp. 1975; 0: 161-182PubMed Google Scholar). Might instincts be specified in a similar way? Are there behavioral switch genes that create the potential for a complex innate behavior (Baker et al., 2001Baker B.S. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Are complex behaviors specified by dedicated regulatory genes? Reasoning from Drosophila.Cell. 2001; 105: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)? Or, at the other extreme, do instincts emerge diffusely from the combined actions of the vast number of genes that contribute to nervous system development and function, so that no single gene can be said to specify any particular behavior (Greenspan, 1995Greenspan R.J. Understanding the genetic construction of behavior.Sci. Am. 1995; 272: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)? If behavioral switch genes exist, then one place in which they are likely to be found is in the specification of sexual behaviors (Baker et al., 2001Baker B.S. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Are complex behaviors specified by dedicated regulatory genes? Reasoning from Drosophila.Cell. 2001; 105: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Males and females generally have dramatically distinct and innate sexual behaviors. These behaviors are essential for their reproductive success, and so strong selective pressure is likely to have favored the evolution of genes that “hardwire” them into the brain. The initial steps of sexual differentiation have been well characterized for several model organisms, and genetic perturbations in these sex-determination hierarchies can alter all aspects of the sexual phenotype—innate behaviors as well as gross anatomy. Several genes near the top of these sex-determination hierarchies thus qualify as developmental switch genes, but they cannot be considered specifically as behavioral switch genes. A switch gene for a sexual behavior should act to specify either male or female behavior, irrespective of the overall sexual phenotype of the animal. A candidate for such a gene is the fruitless (fru) gene of Drosophila, which is intimately linked to male sexual orientation and behavior (Baker et al., 2001Baker B.S. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Are complex behaviors specified by dedicated regulatory genes? Reasoning from Drosophila.Cell. 2001; 105: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Male courtship in Drosophila is an elaborate ritual that involves multiple sensory inputs and complex motor outputs (Hall, 1994Hall J.C. The mating of a fly.Science. 1994; 264: 1702-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar; see Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). It is largely a fixed-action pattern, in which the male orients toward and follows the female, taps her with his forelegs, sings a species-specific courtship song by extending and vibrating one wing, licks her genitalia, and finally curls his abdomen for copulation. If the female is sufficiently aroused and has not recently mated, she accepts his advances by slowing down and opening her vaginal plates to allow copulation. An obvious but nonetheless remarkable aspect of this behavior is that mature males court only females, never other males, whereas females do not court at all. Certain loss-of-function alleles of the fru gene disrupt both male courtship behavior and sexual orientation: performance of the courtship ritual is below par, and it is directed indiscriminately at either sex (Anand et al., 2001Anand A.

Extended reproductive roles of the fruitless gene in Drosophila melanogaster revealed by behavioral analysis of new fru mutants.Genetics. 1997; 147: 1107-1130PubMed Google Scholar). Strong fru alleles completely block courtship behavior, but weaker fru alleles variously disrupt individual steps, with each step affected in some allelic combination (Anand et al., 2001Anand A. Villella A. Ryner L.C. Carlo T. Goodwin S.F. Song H.J. Gailey D.A. Morales A. Hall J.C. Baker B.S. Taylor B.J.

Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggests that fru is required for every step of the courtship ritual, not just for a single critical step. For all of these fru alleles, female morphology and behavior appear normal. Of the many genes known to be involved in male courtship behavior (Billeter et al., 2002Billeter J.C. Goodwin S.F. O'Dell K.M. Genes mediating sex-specific behaviors in Drosophila.Adv. Genet. 2002; 47: 87-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fru is unique in that it is sex-specifically spliced (Ito et al., 1996Ito H. Fujitani K. Usui K. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Tanaka S. Yamamoto D. Sexual orientation in Drosophila is altered by the satori mutation in the sex-determination gene fruitless that encodes a zinc finger protein with a BTB domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Control of male sexual behavior and sexual orientation in Drosophila by the fruitless gene.Cell. 1996; 87: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the fru locus generates a complex set of transcripts, all of which encode BTB domain-containing zinc finger proteins. Most of these transcripts are not sex specific, but those initiated from the most distal (P1) promoter are spliced differently in males and females. The alleles of fru that affect male courtship are all associated with chromosomal insertions, deletions, or rearrangements that specifically disrupt these sex-specific P1 transcripts (Anand et al., 2001Anand A. Villella A. Ryner L.C. Carlo T. Goodwin S.F. Song H.J. Gailey D.A. Morales A. Hall J.C. Baker B.S. Taylor B.J.

Aberrant splicing and altered spatial expression patterns in fruitless mutants of Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 2000; 154: 725-745PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that the male-specific splicing of the fru P1 transcripts specifies male courtship behavior and sexual orientation (Baker et al., 2001Baker B.S. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Are complex behaviors specified by dedicated regulatory genes? Reasoning from Drosophila.Cell. 2001; 105: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This is the hypothesis we test here. We used gene targeting by homologous recombination to generate alleles of fru that are constitutively spliced in either the male or female mode. Forcing female splicing in the male results in a loss of male courtship behavior and orientation, confirming that male-specific splicing of fru is indeed essential for male behavior. More dramatically, females in which fru is spliced in the male mode behave as if they were males: they court other females. Thus, male-specific splicing of fru is both necessary and sufficient to specify male courtship behavior and sexual orientation. A complex innate behavior is thus specified by the action of a single gene, demonstrating that behavioral switch genes do indeed exist and identifying fru as one such gene. The fru locus spans approximately 130 kb, and includes at least four promoters (P1–P4; Figure 1A ; Ito et al., 1996Ito H. Fujitani K. Usui K. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Tanaka S. Yamamoto D.

Transcripts from the P2–P4 promoters are not sex-specifically spliced and encode a set of common Fru isoforms that have essential functions in the development of both sexes (Figure 1B; Anand et al., 2001Anand A.

Transcripts initiated from the distal P1 promoter include the S exon, which is sex-specifically spliced under the control of the sex-determination factors Tra and Tra-2 (Heinrichs et al., 1998Heinrichs V.

In males, Tra is absent and the S exon is spliced at its default male-specific donor site. This results in an in-frame fusion to the exons common to all fru transcripts, adding a 101 amino acid N-terminal extension that is unique to these male-specific FruM isoforms. In females, Tra binds to fru P1 pre-mRNAs to promote splicing at a more 3′ donor site (Heinrichs et al., 1998Heinrichs V. Ryner L.C. Baker B.S.

We generated four alleles of fru by gene targeting: fruF, an allele that should prevent male-specific splicing; fruM and fruΔtra, both of which should force male splicing; and fruC, a control allele in which splicing should be unchanged (Figures 1C and S1). In fruF, point mutations introduced at the male splice donor site of the S exon should abolish splicing at this site but not alter the coding potential of the unspliced transcripts. In fruM, the entire 1601 bp female-specific part of the S exon is deleted, while fruΔtra contains a 261 bp deletion that just eliminates the Tra binding sites. In fruC, the only sequence modification is the insertion of an FRT site in the intron following the S exon. This FRT insertion is a footprint of the targeting procedure and is also present in the fruF, fruM, and fruΔtra alleles. We established several independent lines for each of these four alleles and verified them by molecular, histological, and behavioral analyses. Independent derivatives of the same allele were indistinguishable in all of these assays. A single line for each allele was then backcrossed to the wild-type Canton S strain for four generations prior to more extensive behavioral tests. For all molecular, histological, and behavioral data presented here, unless otherwise stated, the fruC, fruF, fruM, and fruΔtra alleles were examined in trans to fru4-40. The fru4-40 allele results from a deletion of at least 70 kb that removes all P1 and P2 transcripts and is genetically null for the fru behavioral phenotypes (Anand et al., 2001Anand A. Villella A. Ryner L.C. Carlo T. Goodwin S.F. Song H.J. Gailey D.A. Morales A. Hall J.C. Baker B.S. Taylor B.J. Molecular genetic dissection of the sex-specific and vital functions of the Drosophila melanogaster sex determination gene fruitless.Genetics. 2001; 158: 1569-1595PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, any fru P1 product or activity detected in these assays can be assigned to the engineered fruC, fruF, fruM, or fruΔtra allele. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the entire 18 kb targeted region confirmed the predicted structure of the fru locus in each of the four alleles, and RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the predicted transcripts are indeed generated (Figure 1C; splicing at the female donor site is variable in fruF males, presumably because no Tra is present to promote use of the normal female splice site.) FruM proteins could also be detected in the brains of fruC males, and fruM and fruΔtra flies of either sex, both in adults (Figure 1D) and 48 hr pupae. The distribution of FruM appears identical in each case and also matches the reported expression of FruM in wild-type males (Lee et al., 2000Lee G. Foss M. Goodwin S.F. Carlo T. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Spatial, temporal, and sexually dimorphic expression patterns of the fruitless gene in the Drosophila central nervous system.J. Neurobiol. 2000; 43: 404-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We conclude that the modifications we have introduced into the fru locus eliminate the sex differences in FruM expression but do not alter its distribution. The sex determination hierarchy in Drosophila bifurcates downstream of Tra. Like fru, the doublesex (dsx) gene is also differentially spliced under the control of Tra and produces either male (DsxM) or female (DsxF) isoforms of a DM-domain transcription factor (Burtis and Baker, 1989Burtis K.C.

Control of doublesex alternative splicing by transformer and transformer-2 in Drosophila.Science. 1991; 252: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). These Dsx proteins direct male or female morphological development, respectively, but have little influence on sexual behavior: males that lack DsxM still court, albeit at reduced levels (Villella and Hall, 1996Villella A. Hall J.C. Courtship anomalies caused by doublesex mutations in Drosophila melanogaster.Genetics. 1996; 143: 331-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas females that produce DsxM resemble normal males but do not court (Taylor et al., 1994Taylor B.J. Villella A. Ryner L.C. Baker B.S. Hall J.C. Behavioral and neurobiological implications of sex-determining factors in Drosophila.Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This has led to the notion that dsx regulates gross sexual anatomy, while fru regulates sexual behavior (Taylor et al., 1994Taylor B.J. Villella A. Ryner L.C. Baker B.S. Hall J.C. Behavioral and neurobiological implications of sex-determining factors in Drosophila.Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 275-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with this view, our fru P1 splice mutations do not generally alter external or internal sexual anatomy: fruF males have the normal male anatomy, whereas fruM and fruΔtra females are anatomically normal females. The one exception is that fruM and fruΔtra females have a male-specific muscle of Lawrence (MoL), and fruF males lack this muscle (Figure S2). The MoL is a dorsal abdominal muscle that uniquely depends on fru rather than dsx for its sexual differentiation (Gailey et al., 1991Gailey D.A. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. Elements of the fruitless locus regulate development of the muscle of Lawrence, a male-specific structure in the abdomen of Drosophila melanogaster adults.Development. 1991; 113: 879-890PubMed Google Scholar, Lawrence and Johnston, 1984Lawrence P.A.

Differentiation of a male-specific muscle in Drosophila melanogaster does not require the sex-determining genes doublesex or intersex.Genetics. 1992; 132: 179-191PubMed Google Scholar), evidently requiring fru in the motor neurons that innervate it rather than the muscle itself (Currie and Bate, 1995Currie D.A. Bate M. Innervation is essential for the development and differentiation of a sex-specific adult muscle in Drosophila melanogaster.Development. 1995; 121: 2549-2557PubMed Google Scholar). It is not involved in courtship behavior, but may facilitate the termination of copulation (Lee et al., 2001Lee G. Villella A. Taylor B.J. Hall J.C. New reproductive anomalies in fruitless-mutant Drosophila males: extreme lengthening of mating durations and infertility correlated with defective serotonergic innervation of reproductive organs.J. Neurobiol. 2001; 47: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also verified that correct splicing of fru, rather than dsx, is essential in the male nervous system for male courtship behavior. Ectopic expression of tra in all postmitotic neurons in males normally leads to a dramatic reduction in courtship vigor (elav-GAL4/UAS-tra; Kido and Ito, 2002Kido A. Ito K. Mushroom bodies are not required for courtship behavior by normal and sexually mosaic Drosophila.J. Neurobiol. 2002; 52: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In these males, fru, dsx, and any other tra targets are presumably spliced in the female mode within the nervous system. However, restoring male splicing of fru alone, by introducing either a fruM or fruΔtra allele, is sufficient to restore normal courtship levels (Figure S3). Having generated alleles of fru that force either male or female splicing and confirmed that they do not affect general sexual anatomy, we were now in a position to test the hypothesis that fru splicing specifies sexual behavior (Ito et al., 1996Ito H. Fujitani K. Usui K. Shimizu-Nishikawa K. Tanaka S. Yamamoto D. Sexual orientation in Drosophila is altered by the satori mutation in the sex-determination gene fruitless that encodes a zinc finger protein with a BTB domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Ryner et al., 1996Ryner L.C. Goodwin S.F. Castrillon D.H. Anand A. Villella A. Baker B.S. Hall J.C. Taylor B.J. Wasserman S.A. Control of male sexual behavior and sexual orientation in Drosophila by the fruitless gene.Cell. 1996; 87: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). First, we asked whether male behavior requires male splicing. If so, fruF males should display little or no courtship, and, if they have any residual courtship activity at all, it should be directed at males as well as females. fruM and fruΔtra males should behave normally. We used courtship, fertility, and chaining assays to test these predictions (Figure 2). In male-female courtship assays, a test male is paired with a wild-type virgin female in a 10 mm observation chamber, and the percentage of time the male courts the female during the first 8 min or until copulation, is recorded as his courtship index (CI). In these assays, wild-type, fruC, fruM, and fruΔtra males are all avid courters (CI > 70%; Figure 2A and Movie S1). In contrast, fruF males, like males carrying the classic P-induced fru alleles fru3 and fru4, barely court at all (CI < 5%). We also tested male courtship in competitive mating assays, in which a wild-type virgin female is placed in a chamber with two males—a test male and a wild-type (fru+) competitor. The trio is then observed for up to 1 hr to record which of the two males succeeds in copulating with the female (Figure 2B). In these assays, fruF males always lost out to the fru+ control males, whereas fruC, fruM, and fruΔtra males were all at least as successful as their fru+ competitors. Consistent with the loss of courtship behavior, fruF males are also completely sterile (0% fertility; n = 196), whereas fru+, fruC, fruM, and fruΔtra males are all fully fertile (>99%; n = 230, 140, 110, and 131, respectively). Together, these data establish that male-specific splicing of fru P1 transcripts is indeed essential for male courtship behavior. To test for sexual orientation, we first performed courtship assays in which single fru test males were paired with wild-type males rather than females. Male-male courtship is low for all genotypes. However, fruF males, like fru3 and fru4 males, court other males somewhat more actively than do any of the control males (fru+, fruC, fruM or fruΔtra; Figure 2C). Comparing courtship levels in these single-pair assays is more difficult for male-male assays than for male-female assays, as courtship levels are generally much lower. A more reliable way to test for male-male courtship is to monitor chaining behavior in groups of males. If groups of fru mutant males are left on food plates for several hours or days, they begin to form courtship chains in which each male courts the one ahead of him (Hall, 1978Hall J.C. Courtship among males due to a male-sterile mutation in Drosophila melanogaster.Behav. Genet. 1978; 8: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is not clear how this chaining behavior relates to normal courtship, and it probably involves environmental and social stimuli that are absent in the single-pair assays. Nevertheless, it is a robust male-male courtship behavior displayed by classical fru mutants but not wild-type males and can be readily quantified by a chaining index (ChI, the percentage of time three or more males form a chain during a 10 min observation period). Using this assay, we observed dramatically elevated levels of male-male courtship amongst fruF males (ChI = 63%, p < 0.0001; Figure 2D and Movie S2) compared to fru+, fruC, fruM, or fruΔtra males (ChI < 1%). We conclude that male-specific fru splicing not only promotes male-female courtship, it also inhibits male-male courtship. Intriguingly, in the competition assays, fruM and fruΔtra males had a slight but significant edge over their fru+ competitors, winning 71% (n = 41, p = 0.0002) and 61% (n = 62, p = 0.01) of assays, respectively (Figure 2B). This prompted us to compare individual courtship steps performed by fruC, fruM, and fruΔtra males in single-pair assays with wild-type virgin females (Table 1). Qualitatively, courtship performed by fruM and fruΔtra males is indistinguishable from courtship by fruC males. However, fruM and fruΔtra males initiate courtship more rapidly than fruC males (p < 0.01 for both genotypes). Once courtship is initiated, fruM and fruΔtra males spend as much time as fruC males performing each of the other steps (tapping, wing extension, licking, and attempted copulation; p > 0.05 for each step). Although we have not been able to detect any differences by molecular or histological means (Figure 1), it is possible that forced male splicing results in slightly elevated levels of FruM proteins in at least some cells in fruM and fruΔtra males. A tentative inference from this result is therefore that FruM is not only essential for male courtship behavior but may also contribute quantitatively to its initiation.Table 1Comparison of Courtship by fruC Males and fruM and fruΔtra Males and FemalesfruC MalefruM MalefruΔtra MalefruM FemalefruΔtra Femalen1310112115All courtship steps (CI)72.94 ± 3.4189.75 ± 2.8781.86 ± 4.2342.40 ± 3.58**45.76 ± 3.55*Courtship latency (s)50.00 ± 15.236.90 ± 2.64*10.27 ± 3.82*48.86 ± 10.5741.73 ± 7.72Tapping (s)51.23 ± 10.2873.00 ± 8.9556.09 ± 6.7986.67 ± 9.49*147.20 ± 18.02***Wing extension (s)128.77 ± 16.66181.30 ± 19.63153.36 ± 22.08105.57 ± 16.1486.20 ± 12.87Licking3.77 ± 0.765.60 ± 0.629.09 ± 3.030.62 ± 0.22*0.27 ± 0.12*Attempted copulation1.54 ± 0.292.40 ± 0.653.36 ± 1.060 ± 0**0 ± 0**Courtship assays for fruC males and fruM and fruΔtra males and females paired with wild-type virgin females were recorded at higher magnification to monitor individual courtship steps.

Promoter tagging in transgenic parasites confirmed the designation of stage and sex specificity of the proteins. The male proteome contained 36% (236 of 650) male-specific and the female proteome 19% (101 of 541) female-specific proteins, but they share only 69 proteins, emphasizing the diverged features of the sexes. Of all the malaria life-cycle stages analyzed, the male gametocyte has the most distinct proteome, containing many proteins involved in flagellar-based motility and rapid genome replication. By identification of gender-specific protein kinases and phosphatases and using targeted gene disruption of two kinases, new sex-specific regulatory pathways were defined."

Clues to a possible mechanism for Ena/VASP function during cell migration came from electron microscopic studies of actin filaments in lamellipodia of fibroblasts and neuronal growth cones. Depletion of Ena/VASP proteins from their normal locations in fibroblasts or neurons promoted formation of dense actin networks with short, highly branched filaments. In contrast, enrichment of Ena/VASP proteins at the plasma membrane resulted in sparse networks containing primarily long, unbranched filaments, which in growth cones coalesced into filopodia (8.Lebrand C.

These studies support the hypothesis that Ena/VASP proteins influence actin networks by promoting formation of long, unbranched actin filaments in the cell periphery. Ena/VASP proteins could influence the length of actin filaments and the extent of filament branching at the cell periphery via several mechanisms: by increasing the rate of actin filament elongation, reducing the frequency of forming branched actin filaments, increasing the dissociation rate of branched filament junctions, or decreasing barbed end capping activity. Biochemical experiments in which recombinant VASP enhanced actin polymerization in the presence of heterodimeric capping protein (CP) 1The abbreviations used are: CP, capping protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; SAS, spectrin F-actin seeds; PKA, protein kinase A. supported the hypothesis that Ena/VASP proteins promote the formation of long, unbranched actin filaments, in part, by protecting actin filament barbed ends from capping (9.Bear J.E.

All proteins except actin were quantified from absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients predicted from the amino acid sequence (Protean, DNAStar software): VASP, 32,650 m-1 cm-1, considered a tetramer (based on analytical ultracentrifugation experiments below); CP, 76,290 m-1 cm-1; and profilin, 18,100 m-1 cm-1. Actin was quantified from absorbance at 290 nm and the extinction coefficient of 26,600 m-1 cm-1.

SAS were omitted from reactions monitoring spontaneous actin polymerization. Fluorescence of pyrenyl-actin (excitation at 365 nm, emission at 386 nm) was monitored for 600 s at 25 °C. All components except actin and SAS were mixed in MKEI-100 buffer; reactions were initiated by the simultaneous addition of actin (primed with 1 mm EGTA and 0.1 mm MgCl2 for 90 s) and SAS. The delay between mixing reactants and recording fluorescence was <16 s. In experiments with profilin, VASP and profilin were incubated in MKEI-100 buffer for 5 min prior to addition of other components. Fluorescence was converted to the molar concentration of F-actin from the fluorescence of completely polymerized and unpolymerized actin, assuming a critical concentration of 0.1 μm. Initial rates of actin assembly were determined from linear fits of data collected during the initial 60 s. In control experiments, VASP did not alter the fluorescence of either pyrenyl-G-actin or pyrenyl-F-actin. Effect of VASP on Steady State Levels of G-actin—The effect of VASP on the amount of G-actin present in steady state solutions of 1 μm actin in MKEI-100 buffer was determined in reactions containing varying amounts of VASP with or without 10 nm CP in MKEI-100 buffer. Samples were incubated for 16 h at room temperature to reach equilibrium. The reactions were overlaid on a 10% sucrose cushion and subjected to centrifugation for 20 min at 80,000 × g in a TLA 120.1 rotor at 20 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 15% gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The amount of G-actin present in the supernatant fraction was quantified from the Coomassie-stained gels using ImageJ software and gels containing known amounts of actin. Quantitation of Actin Filament Barbed Ends—To determine if barbed ends were created de novo, reactions containing VASP or EVH2 and either 1 μm actin (for VASP) or 0.5 μm actin (for EVH2) were prepared without pyrenyl-actin as described for seeded polymerization assays. Profilin (10 μm) was included as indicated. After 90 s, reactions were diluted 25-fold into 0.5 μm actin (5% pyrene-labeled), and fluorescence was monitored for 600 s. Actin Depolymerization Assays—F-actin (1 μm, 50% pyrene-labeled) was incubated with 17 nm CP and varying amounts of VASP for 5 min. Care was taken to minimize filament breakage during mixing by using wide-bore pipette tips, triturating a defined number of strokes, and transferring F-actin solutions slowly. Aliquots were diluted 20-fold into stirring MKEI-100, and fluorescence of pyrene-actin was monitored for 600 s. Phosphorylation of VASP by Protein Kinase A (PKA)—VASP at a final concentration of 2 μm was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 200 units/ml of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP. Mock-treated VASP was prepared similarly in a reaction without added PKA. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analyses—For velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, 4 μm VASP in 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT, was centrifuged at 40,000 × g at 20 °C in a Beckman Proteomelab XL-A rotor; 280 nm absorbance was monitored every minute by continuous scan at 0.003 cm. Protein partial specific volume, buffer density, and buffer viscosity were determined using Sednterp. 2D. Hayes, T. Laue, and J. Philo, personal communication. Scans 1-200 were analyzed using Sedfit87 (www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com). For sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, three concentrations of VASP (4, 2, and 1 μm) were centrifuged at 7,000, 10,000, and 14,000 × g for 15, 10, and 10 h, respectively, in an AN-60 rotor. Scans at 280 nm and 0.001-cm steps were recorded every hour. Winmatch, Winreedit, and Winnonln software were used to analyze and fit the data, assuming a single species. The resulting fit gave a σ of 7.99 and root mean square deviation of 0.00409 with no systematic deviation of residuals. Microscopy of Actin Filaments—Actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and prepared for light microscopy as described (21.Harris E.S. Li F. Higgs H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20076-20087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Samples for electron microscopy contained 4 μm G-actin (10% pyrene-labeled) and 6 μm VASP in F-buffer (2 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.02% sodium azide) with varying concentrations of KCl. At steady state, determined from observations of pyrene fluorescence, aliquots were diluted in F-buffer, applied to glow-discharged 400-mesh EM carbon-coated grids, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Low dose images (∼10 e-/Å2) were recorded with a Tecnai 12 G2 electron microscope (FEI Electron Optics) at 120 keV with nominal magnification of 52,000 and 1.5-μm defocus. Kodak SO-163 plates were developed for 12 min in full D19 developer (Eastman Kodak). The bundles were processed and analyzed using the EMAN (22.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Images were scanned at a raster of 6.4 μm pixel-1 using a SCAI scanner (Intergraph Corporation, Englewood, CO) with a final 2.45 Å pixel size on the image. The bundles were selected, boxed, and displayed with a modified version of Ximdisp (23.Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fourier transforms were calculated using the Brandeis helical imaging package (24.Owen C.H. Morgan D.G. DeRosier D.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). VASP Protects Actin Filament Barbed Ends from Capping—To understand how Ena/VASP proteins regulate actin filament assembly in the presence of barbed end-capping proteins, we studied actin polymerization from SAS in the presence of recombinant CP and His6-tagged VASP. We confirmed our previous findings that VASP increased the rate of actin polymerization from SAS in the presence of CP in a dose-dependent manner (9.Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). The ability of VASP to enhance actin polymerization in the presence of CP, defined here as anti-capping activity, also depended on the concentration of capping protein (Fig. 1C). The apparent inhibition of capping by VASP could occur by several mechanisms: 1) VASP could compete directly with CP for binding barbed ends; 2) VASP could promote formation of new filament barbed ends via de novo filament nucleation or severing; or 3) VASP could increase the rate of filament elongation. A fourth possibility that VASP binds CP and prevents its interaction with barbed ends was ruled out in previous studies (9.Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Loureiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 509-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). 3M. Barzik, unpublished data. To determine if VASP anti-capping activity involved enhanced filament elongation, we examined the effects of VASP on filament elongation in actin polymerization assays seeded by SAS. VASP increased slightly the initial rate of actin polymerization from SAS (Fig. 1D), suggesting that VASP enhances the rate of actin subunit association or decreases the rate of subunit dissociation. The increased rate of actin polymerization was apparent after a short lag period (∼30 s) indicated by the slight upward curvature in the reaction time courses. This lag period may reflect the fact that short actin filaments nucleated by SAS are required for VASP to associate with elongating filaments. The ability of VASP to increase the rate of actin polymerization did not result from de novo formation of actin filaments. Under the experimental conditions, spontaneous actin nucleation activity of VASP was negligible at concentrations below 150 nm (Fig. 1E). An increased rate of spontaneous actin polymerization was apparent at higher concentrations of VASP (≥200 nm) (Fig. 1E), however, this activity required a prolonged lag period and did not account for the increased initial rates of actin polymerization in reactions containing VASP. To confirm that VASP did not generate new actin filaments within the time required to determine initial rate measurements, aliquots of polymerization reactions containing SAS and varying amounts of VASP were removed at 90 s and diluted into 0.5 μm actin to observe filament elongation at barbed ends selectively. The rate of actin polymerization after dilution was independent of VASP (Fig. 1F), indicating that filament-barbed ends were not generated. These results confirm previous findings that VASP exhibits negligible actin nucleation activity at physiological salt conditions (3.Laurent V. Loisel T.P. Harbeck B. Wehman A. Grobe L. Jockusch B.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36143-36151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and rules out that the apparent competition between capping proteins and VASP in seeded polymerization assays results from spontaneous actin nucleation as suggested by Samarin and colleagues (13.Samarin S. Romero S. Kocks C. Didry D. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mammalian Ena/VASP proteins, Mena and Evl, also exhibited anti-capping activity and enhanced the rate of actin filament elongation under conditions where actin nucleating activity was negligible (data not shown). VASP anti-capping activity depended on the concentrations of VASP and CP (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that CP and VASP compete for binding barbed ends. VASP also protected barbed ends from two other proteins with barbed end capping activity: gelsolin-actin complex and CapG (Fig. 2, A and B). The ability of VASP to inhibit capping by several different barbed end-binding proteins suggests that VASP prevents capping by directly associating with barbed ends. In support of this hypothesis, VASP decreased the amount of G-actin present in actin solutions containing CP under steady state conditions, indicating that VASP blocked CP from binding barbed ends without interfering with actin subunit addition (Fig. 2C). VASP alone increased slightly the amount of G-actin at steady state (Fig. 2C), consistent with a low-affinity interaction of VASP and G-actin (28.Walders-Harbeck B. Khaitlina S.Y. Hinssen H. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). VASP also competed with CP for binding pre-formed actin filaments. Actin filaments capped by CP depolymerized slowly when diluted below the barbed end critical concentration, as expected. VASP competed with CP, resulting in increased rates of depolymerization upon dilution of F-actin incubated with both CP and VASP (Fig. 2D). VASP did not alter the rate of depolymerization of uncapped actin filaments, indicating that VASP does not sever filaments (data not shown). The EVH2 Domain of VASP Is Sufficient to Protect Barbed Ends from CP—The C-terminal EVH2 domain of VASP, which contains separate motifs that interact with G-actin (28.Walders-Harbeck B. Khaitlina S.Y. Hinssen H. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), F-actin (25.Huttelmaier S. Harbeck B. Steffens O. Messerschmidt T. Illenberger S. Jockusch B.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 29.Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and confer VASP tetramerization (29.Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), was more active than full-length VASP in enhancing actin polymerization in the presence of CP (Fig. 3, A and B). Actin nucleation activity by EVH2 was slightly higher than that of VASP (Fig. 3C), however, anti-capping activities of EVH2 and VASP could be compared in assays using 0.5 μm actin, where actin nucleation activity by both proteins was negligible. We confirmed that EVH2 did not promote formation of new filaments under these conditions using dilution assays that selectively monitor elongation at actin filament barbed ends (Fig. 3D). Thus, the VASP EVH2 domain contains the structural elements sufficient for anti-capping activity. The EVH2 domain of Mena similarly exhibited potent anti-capping activity (data not shown). Interactions via G-actin and F-actin Binding Motifs of VASP Are Required for Anti-capping Activity—The F-actin and G-actin binding motifs are required for Ena/VASP function during whole cell motility (14.Loureiro J.J. Rubinson D.A. Bear J.E. Baltus G.A. Kwiatkowski A.V. Gertler F.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2533-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine if VASP anti-capping activity depended on interactions via its G-actin and F-actin binding motifs, we examined the anti-capping activity of mutant proteins that either lack or alter these motifs. Mutant VASP with a deletion at the F-actin binding motif (VASP-ΔFAB, Δ256-273) did not protect barbed ends from CP, even when tested at concentrations exceeding 400 nm (supplementary materials Fig. 2A). Similarly, VASP with mutations that disrupt the G-actin binding site (VASP-GAB; R232E,K233E) (28.Walders-Harbeck B. Khaitlina S.Y. Hinssen H. Jockusch B.M. Illenberger S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) did not protect barbed ends from CP when used at concentrations up to 400 nm (supplementary materials Fig. 2B). To determine if VASP binding to free G-actin was required for anti-capping activity, we examined the dependence of anti-capping activity on the concentration of G-actin. VASP anti-capping activity was independent of the concentration of G-actin (supplementary materials Fig. 2C), indicating that anti-capping activity likely does not involve interactions of VASP and free G-actin. Instead, we suggest that VASP anti-capping activity requires interactions of the G-actin binding motif with actin subunits incorporated in filaments, possibly the terminal actin subunits situated at barbed ends. VASP Tetramers Are Required for Anti-capping Activity—VASP is predicted to assemble as a tetramer (29.Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 30.Zimmermann J. Labudde D. Jarchau T. Walter U. Oschkinat H. Ball L.J.

A. 2004; 101: 17027-17032Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We confirmed that full-length VASP is a tetramer using equilibrium sedimentation ultracentrifugation. A molecular mass of 173.2 kDa was calculated from the experimentally determined effective reduced molecular weight and partial specific volume of 0.7219 ml/g. The predicted molecular mass for His6-tagged monomeric VASP is 41.2 kDa, corresponding to a 164.8-kDa tetramer. No systematic deviation between experimental data and curve fit was present, suggesting that VASP is a stable tetramer. Sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation experiments for VASP showed a single peak at 4.7 S with a frictional coefficient (f/f0) of 2.02, consistent with VASP being an asymmetric, elongated molecule (supplementary materials Fig. 3A). To determine if VASP tetramers are required for anti-capping activity, we tested a mutant form of VASP lacking the C-terminal coiled-coil region involved in tetramer formation (VASP-ΔCoCo, Δ331-375). VASP-ΔCoCo neither exhibited anti-capping activity (supplementary materials Fig. 3B) nor enhanced actin assembly in the absence of CP (data not shown). Although deletion of the C-terminal coiled-coil motif may disrupt other features within the EVH2 domain required for anti-capping activity (29.Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23549-23557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), other experiments showed VASP-ΔCoCo stimulated Listeria motility in fibroblasts lacking Ena/VASP proteins (32.Geese M.

We have obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction of the IC showing IF2*GDPNP at the intersubunit cleft of the 70S ribosome. IF2*GDPNP contacts the 30S and 50S subunits as well as fMet-tRNA(fMet). IF2 here adopts a conformation radically different from that seen in the recent crystal structure of IF2. The C-terminal domain of IF2 binds to the single-stranded portion of fMet-tRNA(fMet), thereby forcing the tRNA into a novel orientation at the P site. The GTP binding domain of IF2 binds to the GTPase-associated center of the 50S subunit in a manner similar to EF-G and EF-Tu. Additionally, we present evidence for the localization of IF1, IF3, one C-terminal domain of L7/L12, and the N-terminal domain of IF2 in the initiation complex."

Recent studies demonstrated an immune modulatory function of this enzyme, since IDO-mediated depletion of trp hinders T cell proliferation, while its inhibition by 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-Mt) induces breakdown of immune tolerance in the placenta, leading to rejection of allogeneic concepti. Here, we tested IDO expression and function during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) actively induced in adult SJL mice by immunization with PLP139-151. IDO activity (determined by HPLC analysis of the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio) was increased in the spleen during the preclinical phase, and within the brain and spinal cord at the onset of symptoms. Immunocytochemistry revealed macrophages/activated microglia expressing IDO during EAE and in vitro experiments confirmed IDO induction in microglia upon IFN-gamma treatment with synergistic effects of TNF-alpha. Inhibition of IDO by systemic administration of 1-Mt at clinical onset significantly exacerbated disease scores. From these data, it is tempting to speculate that IFN-gamma from encephalitogenic Th 1 cells induces local IDO expression, thereby initiating a negative feedback loop which may underlie the self-limitation of autoimmune inflammation during EAE and multiple sclerosis."

The expression of MfpA, a member of the pentapeptide repeat family of proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis , causes resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. This protein binds to DNA gyrase and inhibits its activity. Its three-dimensional structure reveals a fold, which we have named the right-handed quadrilateral β helix, that exhibits size, shape, and electrostatic similarity to B-form DNA. This represents a form of DNA mimicry and explains both its inhibitory effect on DNA gyrase and fluoroquinolone resistance resulting from the protein's expression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2076459721,"Genomic rearrangements linked to aberrant recombination are associated with cancer and human genetic diseases. Such recombination has indirectly been linked to replication fork stalling. Using fission yeast, we have developed a genetic system to block replication forks at nonhistone/DNA complexes located at a specific euchromatic site. We demonstrate that stalled replication forks lead to elevated intrachromosomal and ectopic recombination promoting site-specific gross chromosomal rearrangements. We show that recombination is required to promote cell viability when forks are stalled, that recombination proteins associate with sites of fork stalling, and that recombination participates in deleterious site-specific chromosomal rearrangements. Thus, recombination is a “double-edged sword,” preventing cell death when the replisome disassembles at the expense of genetic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2110125737,"The mechanisms by which molecular chaperones assist quality control of cytosolic proteins are poorly understood. Analysis of the chaperone requirements for degradation of misfolded variants of a cytosolic protein, the VHL tumor suppressor, reveals that distinct chaperone pathways mediate its folding and quality control. While both folding and degradation of VHL require Hsp70, the chaperonin TRiC is essential for folding but is dispensable for degradation. Conversely, the chaperone Hsp90 neither participates in VHL folding nor is required to maintain misfolded VHL solubility but is essential for its degradation. The cochaperone HOP/Sti1p also participates in VHL quality control and may direct the triage decision by bridging the Hsp70-Hsp90 interaction. Our finding that a distinct chaperone complex is uniquely required for quality control provides evidence for active and specific chaperone participation in triage decisions and suggests that a hierarchy of chaperone interactions can control the alternate fates of a cytosolic protein."

https://openalex.org/W2118705880,"Wnt/MAPK signaling is a common variant of Wnt signaling in C. elegans and has been implicated in vertebrates. The sys-1 gene works with Wnt/MAPK signaling to control cell fates during C. elegans development. We report that the SYS-1 amino acid sequence is novel but that SYS-1 functions as β-catenin: SYS-1 rescues a bar-1/β-catenin null mutant, binds the POP-1/TCF β-catenin binding domain, and coactivates POP-1-dependent transcription. Moreover, we provide genetic and molecular evidence that SYS-1 levels are crucial to POP-1 activity. Our results suggest that Wnt/MAPK signaling promotes POP-1 export from the nucleus to accommodate the limiting availability of its SYS-1/β-catenin transcriptional coactivator. Discovery of SYS-1/β-catenin extends our definition of β-catenins and brings together aspects of the canonical mechanism for Wnt signaling with the noncanonical Wnt/MAPK mechanism. We discuss the idea that a similar pathway may be employed broadly in animal development."

No genes have been identified that regulate growth by contributing to this key developmental decision to terminate feeding. We show here that mutations in the DHR4 orphan nuclear receptor result in larvae that precociously leave the food to form premature prepupae, resulting in abbreviated larval development that translates directly into smaller and lighter animals. In addition, we show that DHR4 plays a central role in the genetic cascades triggered by the steroid hormone ecdysone at the onset of metamorphosis, acting as both a repressor of the early ecdysone-induced regulatory genes and an inducer of the βFTZ-F1 midprepupal competence factor. We propose that DHR4 coordinates growth and maturation in Drosophila by mediating endocrine responses to the attainment of critical weight during larval development."
https://openalex.org/W2051903847,"Integrin adhesion receptors can signal in two directions: first, they can regulate cellular behaviors by modulating cellular signaling enzymes (“outside-in signaling”); second, cells can regulate the affinity of integrins (“inside-out signaling”) by such pathways. Integrin β cytoplasmic domains (tails) mediate both types of signaling, and Src family kinases (SFKs) and talin, which bind to β tails, are important for integrin signaling. Here, we utilized “homology scanning” mutagenesis to identify β tail mutants selectively defective in c-Src binding and found that amino acid exchanges affecting a combination of an Arg and Thr residue in the integrin β3 tail control the binding specificity for SFKs but have no effect on talin binding. Using β tail mutants at these residues, we found that SFK binding to integrin β tails is dispensable for inside-out signaling but is obligatory for cell spreading, a marker of outside-in signaling. Conversely, we found that point mutations that disrupt talin binding abolish integrin activation, but they do not inhibit SFK binding to the β3 tail or the initiation of outside-in signaling once the integrins are in a high affinity form. Thus, we show that inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling are mediated by distinct and separable interactions of the integrin β tails. Furthermore, based on our results, it is possible to discern the relative contributions of the direction of integrin signaling on biological functions in cell culture and, ultimately, in vivo. Integrin adhesion receptors can signal in two directions: first, they can regulate cellular behaviors by modulating cellular signaling enzymes (“outside-in signaling”); second, cells can regulate the affinity of integrins (“inside-out signaling”) by such pathways.

Here, we utilized “homology scanning” mutagenesis to identify β tail mutants selectively defective in c-Src binding and found that amino acid exchanges affecting a combination of an Arg and Thr residue in the integrin β3 tail control the binding specificity for SFKs but have no effect on talin binding. Using β tail mutants at these residues, we found that SFK binding to integrin β tails is dispensable for inside-out signaling but is obligatory for cell spreading, a marker of outside-in signaling. Conversely, we found that point mutations that disrupt talin binding abolish integrin activation, but they do not inhibit SFK binding to the β3 tail or the initiation of outside-in signaling once the integrins are in a high affinity form. Thus, we show that inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling are mediated by distinct and separable interactions of the integrin β tails. Furthermore, based on our results, it is possible to discern the relative contributions of the direction of integrin signaling on biological functions in cell culture and, ultimately, in vivo. Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, mediated by integrin adhesion receptors, is essential to the development and functioning of multicellular organisms (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

In addition to supporting adhesion, these receptors are bona fide signaling receptors that inform the cell about the physical and biochemical nature of its environment, leading to regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar, 4Hynes R.O.

Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3846) Google Scholar). This process is frequently referred to as “outside-in signaling.” The ability of many integrins to bind ligands is regulated by cellular signaling mechanisms (8Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Humphries M.J. McEwan P.A. Barton S.J. Buckley P.A. Bella J. Paul M.A. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 2004; 29: 429-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This process, often called integrin “activation” or “inside-out signaling,” can arise through conformational changes in the integrin extracellular domain and/or changes in the physical distribution of these receptors on the cell surface (12Hato T. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1685-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, integrins can transmit information in both directions across the plasma membrane. A central question is to what extent each form of integrin signaling contributes to particular biological functions. Integrins are heterodimers of non-covalently associated α and β subunits. The N terminus of each subunit is extracellular, and a single transmembrane domain separates the ∼700-1200-residue extracellular domain from a usually short (5-65-residue) cytoplasmic domain, or tail (13Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9044) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of integrins play an essential role in bi-directional signaling processes, and intensive work has sought to identify cellular proteins that interact directly with these domains (14Liu S. Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have focused attention on two groups of proteins that bind to integrin β cytoplasmic domains and regulate integrin signaling: Src family kinases (SFKs) 1The abbreviations used are: SFK, Src family kinase; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and talin (16Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). SFKs are constitutively associated with integrins, and their activation is a proximal and early consequence of integrin clustering (17de Virgilio M. Kiosses W.B. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The presence of SFKs is obligatory for the majority of tyrosine phosphorylation events that follow integrin-mediated adhesion (19Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Cell spreading, a measure of integrin signaling into cells, depends on the presence of SFKs. We recently found that SFKs can bind directly to integrin β cytoplasmic domains via their SH3 domains (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This interaction requires the C terminus of the integrin β tail and promotes the activation of the SFKs (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and downstream transcriptional factors such as nuclear factor-κB (20Courter D.L. Lomas L. Scatena M. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12145-12151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of SFKs to integrin β tails is important for outside-in signaling; however, its role in integrin activation remains to be clarified. Talin 1 is required for many integrin functions (21Cram E.J. Clark S.G. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3871-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Monkley S.J. Zhou X.H. Kinston S.J. Giblett S.M. Hemmings L. Priddle H. Brown J.E. Pritchard C.A. Critchley D.R. Fassler R. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Brown N.H. Gregory S.L.

Cell. 2002; 3: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), in part because it is a pivotal connection between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton. However, recent studies have also implicated talin as a key regulator of inside-out integrin signaling. Overexpression of the N terminus of talin leads to integrin activation (24Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J.G. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 25Kim M. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and short hairpin RNA knockdown of talin expression in cultured cells (16Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) inhibits the activation of β1 and β3 integrins. Furthermore, in platelets and their megakaryocyte precursors, intracellular signals initiated by agonist binding to G-protein-coupled receptors result in integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Expression of talin short hairpin RNA, but not mismatched short hairpin RNA, blocked agonist-stimulated fibrinogen binding to megakaryocytes. Thus, talin is a downstream target of cellular signaling pathways that activate integrins. In addition, x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have indicated that a 96-residue F3 domain of talin interacts with multiple sites on the integrin β3 tail (26Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M.

Cell. 2002; 110: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Thus, binding of the talin F3 domain to the β3 cytoplasmic tail is a final common step in integrin activation; however, the role of talin binding to integrin β cytoplasmic tails in outside-in signaling is less clear. Relationships between inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling remain uncertain. Structural and immunochemical studies have suggested that the similar conformational rearrangements in the extracellular domain might lead to both forms of signaling (29Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In contrast, truncation of the last 3 residues of the β3 cytoplasmic domain can inhibit cell spreading, with less of an effect on integrin activation (31Xi X. Bodnar R.J. Li Z. Lam S.C.T. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting that the two processes might be separable, at least at the cytoplasmic face of the integrin. Furthermore, talin 1 deficiency impacts the force-dependent reinforcement of initial integrin-cytoskeleton bonds with little effect on cell spreading or SFK activation (32Giannone G. Jiang G. Sutton D.H. Critchley D.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the interaction of SFKs and talin with integrin β tails might have separable roles in integrin signaling in the two directions. Here we report that amino acid exchanges affecting a combination of an Arg and Thr residue in the integrin β3 tail control the binding specificity for SFKs but have no effect on talin binding. Using mutants at these residues and cells engineered to express only c-Src among SFKs, we find that SFK binding to integrin β tails is not required for inside-out integrin signaling but is obligatory for cell spreading. Conversely, we show that point mutations that disrupt talin binding abolish integrin activation, but they do not inhibit SFK binding to the β3 tail or the initiation of outside-in signaling by SFKs. Thus, we provide decisive evidence that inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling are biochemically distinct. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against the integrin β3 subunit (SSA6 and 8053) were described previously (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics at 37 °C with 6% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum and cultured for an additional 24 h before use in functional assays. The pCDM8 expression vectors encoding αIIb, β3, αIIbα5, and β3β1 chimera have been previously described (34O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C.

Point mutations and chimeric exchanges were generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mammalian expression vectors pRC-CMV/Src, pLNCX/Fyn, and pCMV5/Lyn encode murine c-Src, Fyn p59, and human Lyn, respectively. pEGFP-C1 was obtained from Clontech. GST expression vectors for the SH3 domains of SFKs and bacterial expression constructs for recombinant integrin tails were described previously (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The specific β tail mutations and chimeras were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Immunoprecipitation—Transfected cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and 500-800 μg of protein from the soluble fraction of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies to the β1, β2, or β3 integrin subunits and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Affinity Chromatography—Recombinant integrin cytoplasmic tail model proteins containing both a His6 and an in vivo biotinylation peptide at the N terminus were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli extracts as previously described (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). A scrambled sequence preserving the same amino acid composition of the integrin β3 tail sequence (KLATNEPTTAFIELGKHRTREKITNSYRWFTAEREFKILDATNKYA) was produced in the same manner and used as control for nonspecific binding. Affinity chromatography of cell lysates was performed using integrin tail model proteins immobilized on neutravidin-agarose (Pierce) as previously described (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Biotinylated recombinant integrin tails (200 ng) were bound at saturating concentrations (20 μg/ml) to wells of neutravidin-coated microtiter plates (Pierce). GST-SH3 domains of c-Src, Lyn, Fyn, and c-Yes were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys (Novagen, Inc.). Increasing concentrations of GST-c-Src SH3 (in 100 μl) were added to wells in triplicate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline-0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), mouse anti-GST antibody (0.4 μg/ml) was added and incubated for an additional hour, followed by another three washes with PBS-T and a final 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin before wash and color development with o-phenylenediamene substrate. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm. For competition assays, increasing concentrations of GST-c-src-SH3 were incubated with immobilized β3 tail in the presence or absence of 1 μm GST-talin F23 followed by incubation with mouse monoclonal antibody 327 (anti-c-Src-SH3). Loading density of the various cytoplasmic tail constructs onto neutravidin-coated plates was determined using mouse monoclonal anti-His6. Binding of GST-c-Src-SH3 to the β3 tail was determined using GraphPad Prism Software. Non-saturable binding was estimated by performing parallel binding curves with randomized β3 or by competition with an excess (150 μm) of peptide KGGRSLRPLPPLPPPG previously found to abrogate the binding of c-Src-SH3 to β3 (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). After subtraction of the non-saturable binding component, binding data were fit to a single site binding model in which Y = Bmax(X)/(Kd + X) by non-linear regression. Results were normalized to the percentage of maximal binding to account for fluctuations in maximal absorbance signal at saturation between experiments. Enzyme Activity of Purified c-Src—Purified active human c-Src (5 units/reaction; Upstate Biotechnology) was incubated with β cytoplasmic tail model proteins (20 μg) bound to neutravidin beads (Pierce) in the presence of 150 μm Src-specific peptide substrate. Reactions were carried out using a Src kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate peptide KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK by recombinant c-Src was measured by incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of beads. In the cases where the effect of talin F23 or c-Src-SH3 was measured, beads containing β3 tail were pre-incubated with 1 μm GST-talin F23 or 20 μm GST-c-Src-SH3 for 20 min prior to the addition of c-Src. Activity was calculated as the percentage increase over basal activity of c-Src in the absence of beads. SDS-PAGE gels of 5 μl of beads were run to monitor the tail content of the beads. Integrin Activation—SYF+c-Src cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding αIIbα5, native or mutant β3, and enhanced GFP (as a marker of transfection). After 72 h, binding of the activation-specific monoclonal IgM antibody PAC1 was assessed by flow cytometry as previously described (41O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PAC1 binding was only analyzed on a gated subset of live (propidium iodide-negative) and transfected (GFP-positive) cells. Integrin surface expression levels of each transfection were analyzed with αIIbβ3-specific monoclonal antibody D57. Samples were incubated in presence or absence of 200 μg/ml activating anti-β3 antibody anti-LIBS6 or 10 μm αIIbβ3 antagonist Ro44-9883 (42Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). PAC1 binding in the presence of Ro44-9883 was used to estimate nonspecific binding, and treatment with anti-LIBS6 was used to calculate maximal PAC1 binding. To obtain numerical estimates of integrin activation, we calculated an activation index defined as follows: 100 × (F - F0)/(Fmax - F0), where F is the mean fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding, F0 is the mean fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of Ro44-9883, and Fmax is the mean fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of anti-LIBS6. Cell Spreading—Coverslips were coated with 5 μg/ml fibrinogen overnight at 4 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. For the spreading experiments, transfected cells were resuspended at 106 cells/ml in Tyrode's buffer and incubated on coated coverslips at 37 °C for 15-60 min. After removal of unbound cells by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Platelets were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin and antibody PY20 followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Fluorescence images were acquired with a laser scanning confocal microscope (MRC 1024; Bio-Rad). The surface areas of transfected cells (GFP-positive) were measured using Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.). c-Src and Talin Bind to Distinct Sites in the β3 Cytoplasmic Domain—We sought to discern the relative biological roles of c-Src and talin binding to integrin β cytoplasmic domains. c-Src binding to integrin β3 involves the last 14 residues of β3 (15Arias-Salgado E.G.

To identify β tail mutants selectively defective in c-Src binding, we utilized a previously described (43Calderwood D.A. Huttenlocher A. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 12: 1060-1068Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar) homology scanning approach by creating chimeras between the β3 and β1A cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 1A). We had previously found that c-Src within platelet lysates binds to the β3 cytoplasmic tail, but not to the β1A or β2 tails, and that binding to the β3 tail is abrogated upon elimination of the 4 C-terminal amino acid residues (15Arias-Salgado E.G.

Upon exchanging the C-terminal 3 residues between β1A and β3 (Fig. 1B), we observed that whereas the β3 tail with the β1A substitution at positions 760-762 (β3β1(C3R)) lost its ability to bind c-Src, β1A containing the C-terminal 3 residues of β3 (RGT) (β1β3(C3R)) exhibited a gain of binding toward c-Src (Fig. 1B). We previously found that the related SFKs Yes, Hck, and Lyn bound to β1 and β3 (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, Fyn, which is β3-specific (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), exhibited an identical binding pattern to c-Src (data not shown). Individual β3 mutations, R760E or T762K, were incapable of suppressing c-Src binding to the β3 tail, and individual β1A mutations (E760R or K762T) were unable to promote c-Src binding to the β1A tail (data not shown). To routinely control for nonspecific binding, a randomized sequence version of the β3 cytoplasmic tail (rβ3) failed to interact with c-Src (Fig. 2B) orany of the other SFKs (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the binding of c-Src is dependent on the combined presence of the Arg and Thr residues of the C-terminal β3 RGT motif.Fig. 2Talin and c-Src bind to different regions of the β3 tail. A, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay binding curve for GST-talin-F23 and GST-c-Src-SH3 using neutravidin-bound biotinylated native or mutant β3 cytoplasmic tails (20 μg/ml). Binding was detected using mouse anti-GST antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. B, pull-down analysis from platelet lysates using native and mutant β3 cytoplasmic tails. Western blot was performed using monoclonal antibodies against c-Src and talin. Monoclonal anti-His6 was used to check for tail loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because c-Src interacts with β3 via its SH3 domain (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S.

A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of integrin β tail exchange on the binding of recombinant c-Src-SH3 to immobilized native or chimeric β1A and β3 tails (Fig. 1C). The β1β3(C3R) chimera bound c-Src SH3 with an EC50 similar to the native β3 tail (∼5-10 μm). Conversely, the β3β1(C3R) chimera showed complete loss of saturable binding to c-Src-SH3. Interaction of full-length c-Src with β3 activates c-Src (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Similarly, the β1β3(C3R) chimera gained the capacity to activate c-Src in vitro, whereas the β3β1(C3R) chimera lost this capacity (Fig. 1D). Thus, the last 3 residues of β3 and β1 control binding to c-Src and the capacity of the integrin tail to regulate c-Src activity. Having established that an exchange of 2 amino acid residues could regulate c-Src binding to and activation by integrins, we assessed the effects of this exchange on the binding of talin, which interacts with integrin β tails principally through its N-terminal F23 subdomain (44Calderwood D.A.

Whereas exchange of the last 3 residues of β1A with those of β3 (β3β1(C3R)) markedly reduced c-Src binding, it had no effect on the binding of the F23 fragment of talin (Fig. 2A) or full-length talin (Fig. 2B) to the β3 tail. Conversely, β3 mutations known to abolish talin binding (β3(W739A), β3(L746A/K748A)) (16Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A.

Moreover, saturating concentrations of the talin F23 fragment (26Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Critchley D.R. Ulmer T.S. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol.

Thus, the interaction sites in β3 integrins for talin and c-Src are distinct, and talin does not compete with c-Src for binding to the integrin. Certain Src Family Kinases Bind to Integrin β1 Cytoplasmic Tails—The foregoing results establish that exchange of the last 3 residues of β3 and β1 can regulate the binding and activation of c-Src. Most cells express multiple Src family kinases, and we previously found in pull-down studies with platelet lysates (15Arias-Salgado E.G. Lizano S. Sarkar S. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13298-13302Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) that Lyn and c-Yes kinases are capable of binding to integrin β1A, β2, and β3 tails. We now find that the purified SH3 domains of c-Yes and Lyn can bind to β1A, β2, and β3 tails (Fig. 4A), whereas Fyn binds only to β3. Furthermore, native Lyn and c-Yes associated with heterodimeric integrins bearing the β1 and β2 tails in cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that although exchange of the last 3 C-terminal residues between β1A and β3 can regulate the binding of c-Src, it would not change the binding of c-Yes or Lyn. Indeed, this proved to be the case (Supplementary Fig. 1, A and B). Biological Role of the c-Src-Integrin Interaction—To analyze the functional importance of the c-Src-integrin interaction, we sought a cellular system in which c-Src was the only SFK expressed. Klinghoffer et al. (19Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) have derived fibroblasts from c-Src, Fyn, and c-Yes triple knock-out embryos and showed that integrin signaling and cell spreading are dramatically depressed in these cells (SYF cells). They have also reconstituted these cells with c-Src (SYF+c-Src cells). Immunoblotting confirmed that all three kinases were absent from SYF cells and that c-Src was the only one present in the SYF+c-Src cells (data not shown). The SYF+c-Src cells were then transiently transfected with the αIIb subunit in combination with integrin β3 or with the talin binding-defective β3(L746A/K748A) mutant. Alternatively, the cells were transfected with αIIb and chimeras of β3 containing the β3 extracellular and transmembrane domains joined to either the β1 cytoplasmic domain (34O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 45Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T.

In contrast, no c-Src was associated with integrins bearing either the β1A tail or the β3β1(C3R) tail. Thus, these various SYF+c-Src cells provide us with a tool to examine the biological role of the c-Src-integrin interaction. The β3 Integrin-Talin Interaction, but Not the β3-c-Src Interaction, Is Required for Integrin Activation—Integrin activation is regulated by the interaction of talin with the integrin β tail. To examine the relative roles of talin and c-Src binding to the integrin β tail on integrin activation, we transiently transfected SYF+c-Src cells with plasmids encoding the integrin β3 subunit, a talin binding-deficient mutant (β3(L746A/K748A)), or a c-Src binding-deficient mutant (β3β1(C3R)). To produce an activated integrin, we cotransfected a chimeric integrin α subunit in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains of αIIb were joined to the cytoplasmic domain of α5 (41O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Integrin activation was assessed with the αIIbβ3 activation-specific monoclonal antibody, PAC1 (46Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The c-Src binding-deficient mutant supported specific PAC1 binding to the same extent as wild-type αIIbβ3 (activation index, 12.2 and 12.3, respectively) (Fig. 5). In sharp contrast and as expected, the talin binding-deficient αIIbβ3(L746A/K746A) mutant failed to support specific PAC1 binding. Importantly, all three integrins were equally well expressed, as judged by the binding of an αIIbβ3-specific antibody, D57 (data not shown). Thus, whereas talin binding is required, c-Src binding is dispensable for integrin activation. The β3 Integrin-c-Src Interaction, but Not the β3-Talin Interaction, Is Required for Integrin-mediated Cell Spreading— Integrin-mediated adhesion initiates the SFK-dependent spreading of cells. We exploited the fact that β3 integrins, but not the widely expressed β1 integrins, mediate cell spreading on fibrinogen-coated surfaces (47Ylanne J. Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). SYF+c-Src cells failed to spread on fibrinogen but did spread when transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the β3 integrin subunit (Fig. 6). Importantly, β3 transfection failed to induce spreading of the SYF cells (data not shown), confirming that the spreading was both β3- and c-Src-dependent. Transfection of SYF+c-Src cells with the β3β1 chimera or the β3β1(C3R) chimera failed to induce cell spreading beyond that seen in untransfected cells, indicating that c-Src binding to the integrin tail was required for spreading. Conversely, the gain of c-Src binding function in the β1β3(C3R) chimera enabled that integrin subunit to mediate cell spreading (Fig. 6). To quantify the results depicted in Fig. 6, the cell areas for 50-100 randomly sampled positively transfected cells were measured using Image Pro Plus software. The β3 integrins that promoted visual spreading (β3, β1β3(C3R)) on average resulted in a 2-fold increase in cell area relative to the chimeras that failed to promote visual spreading (β1, β3β1(C3R)) (Fig. 7). Thus, SFK binding to the integrin β tail is required for and mediates cell spreading. To analyze the role of talin binding to the β3 tail in cell spreading, we examined the behavior of cells transfected with β3(L746A/K748A) upon attachment to fibrinogen. As expected from the fact that deletion of the β3 tail only modestly inhibits adhesion to fibrinogen (47Ylanne J. Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Takada Y. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), cells bearing this mutant adhered; however, they failed to spread as judged visually and by quantitative image analysis (Fig. 7A). We hypothesized that the lack of activation of the β3 integrin could lead to reduced engagement of αIIbβ3, resulting in a secondary inhibition of cell spreading. Indeed, addition of the activating monoclonal antibody, anti-anti-LIBS6 (35Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C.T. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), restored cell spreading in β3(L746A/K748A)-expressing cells (Fig. 7B). By contrast, even in the presence of anti-anti-LIBS6, β3β1(C3R)-expressing cells spread poorly on fibrinogen, indicating that the reduced spreading of these cells was not due to a defect in integrin activation. These results establish that talin contributes to cell spreading by activating the integrin, but once the integrin is activated, talin binding to the integrin β tail is no longer required. Perspective and Conclusions—The studies described here provide unambiguous evidence that inside-out and outside-in integrin signaling are mediated by distinct and separable interactions of the integrin cytoplasmic domains. Talin binding is required for integrin activation, and the binding of c-Src kinases is required for the signaling events that lead to cell spreading. Thus, it is possible to exert precise mutational control over the vectorial direction of integrin signaling. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested that integrin activation could precede and regulate the ability of these receptors to generate intracellular signals (48Rose D.M. Grabovsky V. Alon R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2824-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 49Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The present studies directly establish this point by showing that the spreading defect caused by loss of talin binding (and hence, loss of activation) can be rescued by antibody-mediated increase in ligand binding affinity. This result also provides additional evidence that cells can undergo spreading even when talin binding to the integrin tail is blocked by mutation (present studies) or by lack of talin (32Giannone G. Jiang G. Sutton D.H. Critchley D.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Many studies have examined integrin signaling in development, the immune response, hemostasis, and a wide variety of pathological states. The present studies will provide a paradigm to dissect the relative contributions of the direction of integrin signaling on these processes in cell culture and, ultimately, in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2062041889,"Infection of eukaryotic cells by enveloped viruses requires fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular plasma or endosomal membrane. The actual merging of the two membranes is mediated by viral envelope glycoproteins, which generally contain a highly hydrophobic region termed the fusion peptide. The entry of herpesviruses is mediated by three conserved proteins: glycoproteins B, H (gH), and L. However, how fusion is executed remains unknown. Herpes simplex virus type 1 gH exhibits features typical of viral fusion glycoproteins, and its ectodomain seems to contain a putative internal fusion peptide. Here, we have identified additional internal segments able to interact with membranes and to induce membrane fusion of large unilamellar vesicles. We have applied the hydrophobicity-at-interface scale proposed by Wimley and White (Wimley, W. C., and White, S. H. (1996) Nat. Struct. Biol. 3, 842-848) to identify six hydrophobic stretches within gH with a tendency to partition into the membrane interface, and four of them were able to induce membrane fusion. Experiments in which equimolar mixtures of gH peptides were used indicated that different fusogenic regions may act in a synergistic way. The functional and structural characterization of these segments suggests that herpes simplex virus type 1 gH possesses several fusogenic internal peptides that could participate in the actual fusion event."

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether DNA binding events are critically involved in the progression of PAH-mediated atherogenesis. Apolipoprotein E knockout mice were orally (24 wk, once/wk) exposed to 5 mg/kg benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), or its nonmutagenic, noncarcinogenic structural isoform benzo[e]pyrene (B[e]P). 32P-postlabeling of lung tissue confirmed the presence of promutagenic PAH-DNA adducts in B[a]P-exposed animals, whereas in B[e]P-exposed and vehicle control animals, these adducts were undetectable. Morphometrical analysis showed that both B[a]P and B[e]P caused an increase in plaque size, whereas location or number of plaques was unaffected. Immunohistochemistry revealed no differences in oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG) or apoptosis in the plaques. Also plasma lipoprotein levels remained unchanged after PAH-exposure. However, T lymphocytes were increased > or =2-fold in the plaques of B[a]P- and B[e]P-exposed animals. Additionally, B[a]P and to a lesser extent B[e]P exposure resulted in increased TGFbeta protein levels in the plaques, that was mainly localized in the plaque macrophages. In vitro studies using the murine macrophage like RAW264.7 cells showed that inhibition of TGFbeta resulted in decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha release, suggesting that enhanced TGFbeta expression in the plaque macrophages contributes to the proinflammatory effects in the vessel wall. In general, this inflammatory reaction in the plaques appeared to be a local response since peripheral blood cell composition (T cells, B cells, granulocytes, and macrophages) was not changed upon PAH exposure. In conclusion, we showed that both B[a]P and B[e]P cause progression of atherosclerosis, irrespective of their DNA binding properties. Moreover, our data revealed a possible novel mechanism of PAH-mediated atherogenesis, which likely involves a TGFbeta-mediated local inflammatory reaction in the vessel wall."

When the initiator AUG codon is encountered, eIF2 is released in a GDP-bound form, with the subsequent formation of the 80 S elongating ribosome. The exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2 (to allow for further rounds of initiation) is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α can have a profound inhibitory effect on overall protein synthesis because phosphorylated eIF2α (eIF2α(P)) is a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, which is limiting in cells (9.Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). Concomitant with this global translation inhibition, eIF2α phosphorylation can lead to preferential translation of mRNAs encoding stress-related proteins. Thus, eIF2α phosphorylation can regulate both general and specific translation.There are four known eIF2α kinases in mammals (reviewed in Ref. 10.Dever T.E.

Its activation by high levels of uncharged tRNAs that accumulate under these conditions leads to eIF2α phosphorylation and thus to the translation of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of hundreds of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis (18.Natarajan K.

Mammalian GCN2 has been shown to be required for adaptation to amino acid deprivation in mice and is activated under conditions of low availability of amino acids (20.Zhang P. McGrath B.C. Reinert J.

Although there is no GCN4 ortholog in mammalian cells, the levels of a related transcriptional activator, ATF4, are induced by eIF2α phosphorylation through a mechanism of translation reinitiation similar to that described for yeast GCN4 (22.Vattem K.M.

Recently, GCN2 has been shown to be directly involved in the feeding behavior of mice. Phosphorylation of eIF2α in the anterior piriform cortex is observed immediately following intake of diets poor in essential amino acids (27.Gietzen D.W. Ross C.M. Hao S. Sharp J.W. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, contrary to wild-type animals, which tend to avoid meals lacking even one of the essential amino acids, GCN2–/– mice are deficient in this aversive behavior (28.Hao S. Sharp J.W.

Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). IMPACT was originally identified in a screen for imprinted genes in mice. Both YIH1 and IMPACT contain, in the C-terminal half, a conserved sequence (Ancient domain) found also in bacterial proteins (14.Kubota H. Sakaki Y. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20243-20246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30.Hagiwara Y. Hirai M. Nishiyama K. Kanazawa I. Ueda T. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9249-9254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Because of the similarity between the GI domains of YIH1 and GCN2, it has been proposed that YIH1 acts as an inhibitor of GCN2 activation mediated by GCN1 through competition with GCN2 for GCN1 binding. Indeed, recent data in yeast have demonstrated that the binding of GCN2 to GCN1 can be reduced by overexpression of YIH1 and that this leads to reduced eIF2α phosphorylation, indicative of impaired GCN2 activation (31.Sattlegger E. Swanson M.J. Ashcraft E.A. Jennings J.L. Fekete R.A. Link A.J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29952-29962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The in vivo evidence in yeast clearly indicate that YIH1 inhibits GCN2 activation. However, no condition was found in which this inhibitory action would be physiologically relevant to yeast cells because a deletion of YIH1 has no apparent phenotype. Because YIH1 was also found to bind to G-actin, it has been proposed that localized action of YIH1 in yeast cells might regulate the activity of GCN2 in regions where protein synthesis must be maintained at high levels, such as near the growing bud (31.Sattlegger E. Swanson M.J. Ashcraft E.A. Jennings J.L. Fekete R.A. Link A.J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29952-29962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Given the relevance of GCN2 in mammalian metabolism and behavior and the involvement of eIF2α phosphorylation in several pathological conditions, we decided to study the function of IMPACT. We show here that IMPACT is the mammalian functional counterpart of YIH1. IMPACT binds to GCN1 and acts as an inhibitor of mouse GCN2. We also demonstrate that IMPACT is preferentially expressed in the brain in mice and is especially abundant in the hypothalamus. The levels of IMPACT correlated inversely with the basal levels of eIF2α(P) in all tissues examined. Our results strongly suggest that IMPACT acts as an inhibitor of GCN2 in the mammalian brain. These findings have profound physiological implications in the control of phosphorylation of eIF2α and consequently in the expression of ATF4 in different brain areas and specific neuronal cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Methods—Standard yeast methods were employed (32.Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Yeast strain H1511 (MATα, ura3-52, trp1-63, leu2-3, leu2-11, GAL2+) (33.Foiani M. Cigan A.M. Paddon C.J. Harashima S.

The plasmid encoding YIH1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) for expression in yeast under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter has been described previously (31.Sattlegger E. Swanson M.J. Ashcraft E.A. Jennings J.L. Fekete R.A. Link A.J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29952-29962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding IMPACT fused to GST under the control of the GAL1 promoter was constructed by introducing BglII and HindIII sites by PCR into the cloned sequence of IMPACT present in plasmid pBE435 (see below) and cloning into the BamHI-HindIII sites of vector pES128-9-1 as described previously (13.Sattlegger E. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The response of yeast strains to amino acid starvation was studied either by scoring for growth on solid medium lacking histidine and containing 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) at the concentration indicated or by growing cells for 4 h in liquid culture containing 30 mm 3-AT and measuring the levels of eIF2α phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis as described previously (31.Sattlegger E.

All experiments used independent pools of extracts obtained from four animals.RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—Total RNA from mouse whole brain, cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus was obtained by TRIzol extraction as recommended by Invitrogen. For cDNA cloning, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using the following primer pairs: BC367 (5′-GGAATTCATGGCTGAAGAGGAAGTAGGGAACAGCC-3′) and BC382 (5′-GCGGCCGCTTAATGATCATTCTTCTTCTTGTCTTTC-3′) for IMPACT and BC456 (5′-GGGGATCCATGGCCGTTAAGAGCC-3′) and BC457 (5′-GGCTCGAGGCTGAGGATCATGTCC-3′) for mouse GCN1 (mGCN1; GenBank™ gi:51827542). For detection of transcripts in the brain parts, the following oligonucleotides were used: BC380 (5′-TGGGCTTCCTCATGAAGTTTCAGATCG-3′) and BC387 (5′-TGCTGGGCAGGCCAGCTTCC-3′) for mGCN1 and BC366 (5′-CAACATACCCAGATGTAGTTCCCGAAATAGA-3′) and BC378 (5′-GAGGATGTCACACGAGCCAGGAGAG-3′), for βGCN2.IMPACT and mGCN1 Cloning and Protein Purification—A 1-kb DNA fragment comprising the complete open reading frame of IMPACT was obtained by RT-PCR from whole brain RNA using the primers described above. The IMPACT cDNA was inserted as an EcoRI-NotI fragment into the pET28a plasmid (Novagen), generating plasmid pBE435. The N-terminal His-tagged recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells grown in LB medium with 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 23 °C overnight. Purification of the protein was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA; Qiagen Inc.) essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (10% sucrose, 0.2 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)), frozen, incubated with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice, and briefly sonicated. The cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to NiNTA equilibrated with binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 5 mm imidazole). The column was washed with washing buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 20 mm imidazole). The His-tagged protein was eluted with elution buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 m imidazole) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The mGCN1 sequence (GenBank™ gi:51827542) encoding residues 2204–2651 was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned as a 1.3-kb BamHI-XhoI fragment into plasmids pET28a and pGEX6p3. Expression was carried out in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for the His-tagged protein and in DH5α cells for the GST fusion. Extracts were prepared as described above. The insoluble recombinant proteins present in the bacterial extract pellet were solubilized by 8 m urea. The His6-mGCN1 protein used for immunization was purified on Ni-NTA in the presence of urea as recommended by the manufacturer, followed by preparative SDS-PAGE and elution from the gel. The GST-mGCN1 protein was purified from the urea-solubilized pellet by preparative SDS-PAGE, followed by elution of the protein from the polyacrylamide gel slice.Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF) Cell Transfection and Amino Acid Starvation Conditions—For overexpression of IMPACT in MEF cells, an EcoRI-NotI fragment encoding IMPACT was isolated from plasmid pBE435 and placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter in plasmid pCI-neo (Promega), which contains the SV40 origin of replication, originating plasmid pBE514. MEF cells immortalized by the SV40 large T antigen were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) supplemented with 1 mm nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (25.Jiang H.-Y.

The non-transfected and transfected MEF cells were subjected to amino acid starvation by culturing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without leucine (BioWhittaker, Inc.) for the indicated number of hours. Lysates were prepared as described, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific to eIF2α(P), CHOP, ATF4, or β-actin as described (25.Jiang H.-Y. Wek S.A.

Additionally, wild-type GCN2+/+ and GCN2–/– MEF cells were subjected to leucine starvation, and lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting.Preparation of Monospecific Antibodies against IMPACT and mGCN1— Polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant His6-IMPACT and His6-mGCN1 proteins. Monospecific antibodies were obtained by incubating the immune sera with His6-IMPACT or GST-mGCN1 immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane. One milligram of purified protein was submitted to preparative SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond-C membrane. A strip of the membrane containing the protein, as visualized by Ponceau staining, was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS, followed by incubation with antiserum at a 1:10 dilution in PBS for 3 h. After washing with PBS, bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and 1 mm EGTA for 10 min. The pH was immediately neutralized by adding an equal volume of 0.1 m Trizma (Tris base).Immunoblot Analysis—For immunoblot analysis of IMPACT expression and eIF2α phosphorylation, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the samples; and after boiling for 3 min, the proteins were separated 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham Biosciences) at 1 A for 1 h using the buffer conditions described previously (34.Towbin N. Staehelin T. Bordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44707) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS (for anti-IMPACT antibodies) or in Tris-buffered saline (for anti-eIF2α(P) antibodies; BIOSOURCE) and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-IMPACT antibodies (1:500 dilution in PBS, 5% nonfat milk, and 0.1% Tween 20) or anti-eIF2α(P) antibodies (1:1000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20). After three washings with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS or Tris-buffered saline, bound antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:4000 in PBS or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:2000 for anti-IMPACT and anti-eIF2α(P) immunoblotting, respectively. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature and washing with PBS or Tris-buffered saline, the bound antibodies were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). After stripping the membranes by incubation with 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min, the same membrane was incubated with anti-actin antibodies (1:300 dilution; Sigma) or anti-eIF2α antibodies (1:1000 dilution; BIOSOURCE) and processed as described above. eIF2α(P) levels in yeast whole cell extracts were determined as described (31.Sattlegger E.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6622-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). GST-yeast GCN1 (yGCN1)-(2052–2428) and GST-yGCN1-(2052–2428)(R2259A) fusion proteins and GST were purified from E. coli cells carrying plasmids pES123-B1, pES164-2A, and pGEX2T, respectively (31.Sattlegger E.

Briefly, E. coli DH5α cells carrying the specified plasmid were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to 0.8 A600 nm, and the induction of recombinant protein expression was carried out by incubation with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. Cells were collected and resuspended in PBS, and the extract was prepared as described above. The GST fusion proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of the cell extract on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. For the pull-down assays, the purified proteins (20 μg) were immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 500 μg of brain extract prepared as described above in a total volume of 200 μl in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min, and proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After transfer to a Hybond-C membrane, the proteins were stained with Ponceau S. Western blotting using anti-IMPACT antibodies was performed as described above.Co-immunoprecipitation of mGCN1 and IMPACT—Brain extracts (5 mg) were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-a"

Currently, all PR agonists used clinically are steroids. Because of their interactions with other steroid receptors, steroid-metabolizing enzymes, or other steroid-signaling pathways, these drugs can pose significant side effects in some women. Efforts to discover novel nonsteroidal PR agonists with improved biological properties led to the discovery of tanaproget (TNPR). TNPR binds to the PR from various species with a higher relative affinity than reference steroidal progestins. In T47D cells, TNPR induces alkaline phosphatase activity with an EC50 value of 0.1 nm, comparable with potent steroidal progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and trimegestone (TMG), albeit with a reduced efficacy (∼60%). In a mammalian two-hybrid assay to measure PR agonist-induced interaction between steroid receptor co-activator-1 and PR, TNPR showed similar potency (EC50 value of 0.02 nm) and efficacy to MPA and TMG. Importantly, in key animal models such as the rat ovulation inhibition assay, TNPR demonstrates full efficacy and an enhanced progestational potency (30-fold) when compared with MPA and TMG. Furthermore, TNPR has relatively weak interactions with other steroid receptors and binding proteins and little effect on cytochrome P450 metabolic pathways. Finally, the three-dimensional crystal structure of the PR ligand binding domain with TNPR has been delineated to demonstrate how this nonsteroidal ligand achieves its high binding affinity.

The molecular mechanism of PR actions has been extensively studied in the last decade. It is now generally accepted that binding of P4 causes the PR to undergo conformational changes, phosphorylation, dimerization, and interaction with its target genes (15.Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y.

Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). The conformational change induced by P4 binding also facilitates the interactions between the PR, coregulators, and basal transcriptional factors, eventually leading to altered gene expression (19.McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar, 20.McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that PR conformational changes conferred by different PR ligands will lead to various biological responses. In addition to its genomic action, PR has been shown to elicit biological effects through other signaling pathways. It has been demonstrated that PR can interact with the Src/Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to modulate cellular activities in a ligand-dependent manner (21.Leonhardt S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Edwards D.P. Steroids. 2003; 68: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22.Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L.

Reproduction. 2003; 125: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ligand-independent PR actions involving other signaling cascades have been shown in vitro and in vivo (24.Aronica S.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 25.Power R.F. Mani S.K. Codina J. Conneely O.M. O'Malley B.W.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2237-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 30.Zhu Y. Rice C.D. Pang Y. Pace M. Thomas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Furthermore, P4 and/or steroidal progestin metabolites have been shown to interact with a variety of non-PR pathways such as the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (31.Bitran D. Dugan M. Renda P. Ellis R. Foley M. Brain Res. 1999; 850: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 32.Bitran D. Klibansky D.A. Martin G.A. Psychopharmacology. 2000; 151: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33.Winneker R.C. Bitran D. Zhang Z. Steroids. 2003; 68: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, PR ligands have the potential to elicit a wide variety of biological and pharmacological responses. PR agonists, i.e. progestins, have many therapeutic uses in women's health, such as in oral contraception and hormone therapies and for the treatment of certain reproductive disorders. In the past few decades many progestins have been developed. Most of them and all of those in clinical usage are steroidal compounds. Even though these compounds are effective in achieving their intended efficacy endpoints, such as inhibition of ovulation in contraception and suppression of estrogen-induced uterine epithelial proliferation in hormone therapy, they also carry unwanted side effects due to interactions with other closely related steroid receptors, steroid-metabolizing enzymes, or other signaling pathways. As a first step to circumvent some of these drawbacks, we set out to identify novel nonsteroidal structures of PR ligands that would maintain the required biological activity while reducing the side effects often associated with steroidal progestins. In this report we describe the biological and molecular characterization of a novel PR agonist, tanaproget (TNPR; Fig. 1), which demonstrates improved pharmacological properties as compared with those of traditional steroidal progestins. We also have delineated the first crystallographic structure of a PR ligand binding domain (PR-LBD) with a nonsteroidal ligand.

All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and in Vitro Assays—The human breast carcinoma cell lines T47D and MCF-7, the human lung carcinoma cell line A549, the mouse skin fibroblast cell line L929, and the monkey kidney cell line COS7 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). T47D and MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12, A549 cells in DEF/NPM, L929, and COS7 cells in DMEM, all with 10% FBS. Cells were passed 2–3 times every week. T47D Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—The effect of TNPR and reference steroids on alkaline phosphatase activity in T47D cells was determined as described (34.Zhang Z. Lundeen S. Zhu Y. Carver J. Winneker R.C. Steroids. 2000; 65: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 35.Zhang P. Terefenko E.A. Fensome A. Zhang Z. Zhu Y. Cohen J. Winneker R.C. Wrobel J. Yardley J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at 50,000 cells/well in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS. After overnight culture, the medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM/F12 containing 2% charcoal-stripped FBS (experimental medium). The next day, cells were treated with a test compound in the absence (agonist mode) or presence (antagonist mode) of 1 nm progesterone in the experimental medium. Twenty-four hours after treatment, cellular alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Optical density measurements were taken at 5-min intervals for 30 min at a test wavelength of 405 nm. PR Binding Assay—Uterine tissues from the rat, monkey, and rabbit were homogenized in 10 mm Tris buffer (1.5 nm EDTA, pH 7.4) with 20 mm sodium molybdate and 1 mm dithiothreitol, whereas T47D cells were homogenized in 20 mm HEPES buffer (1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) with protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C), the supernatant containing PR was collected and measured for protein concentration. The PR competition binding assay was done with 100 μg of cytosolic protein, 3 nm [3H]R5020, and increasing concentrations of test compounds. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, free [3H]R5020 and bound [3H]R5020 were separated by using 0.5% charcoal and 0.05% dextran (molecular weight 69,000) in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.4). Total [3H]R5020 and bound [3H]R5020 were counted in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Protease Digestion Assay—The protease digestion analysis was performed essentially as described (15.Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37.McDonnell D.P. Clemm D.L. Hermann T. Goldman M.E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The plasmid pT7BPRB, kindly provided by Dr. B. W. O'Malley (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), was used to generate 35S-radiolabeled PR-B using a TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). After the translation reaction, an aliquot (30 μl) of the lysate was incubated for 10 min in the absence or presence of ligands at a final concentration of 100 nm. Aliquots (5 μl) of the ligand-treated receptor mixture were then incubated with a trypsin solution (Worthington Biochemicals) giving various final concentrations of the enzyme (0, 25, 50, and 75 μg/ml). After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the digestion reaction was terminated with the addition of 20 μl of gel-denaturing buffer and boiling for 5 min. The digestion products were separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis, the gel was treated with a 50% (v/v) methanol and 10% acetic acid (v/v) solution for 30 min and immersed in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The gel was then dried under vacuum, and the radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography. PR/SRC-1 Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—COS7 cells were transfected with PR-LBD in the GAL4 DNA binding domain plasmid pM (Clontech), full-length SRC-1 or SRC-3 in the VP16 activation domain plasmid pVP16 (Clontech), and a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter (5× GALuas) using Lipofectamine 2,000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with test compounds for 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured on a Victor2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). Adenovirous Hormone Response Element-Luciferase Reporter Assays—Luciferase reporter assays using cell lines expressing endogenous steroid receptors (MCF-7 cells for the estrogen receptor (ER), A549 cells for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and L929 cells for the androgen receptor (AR)) were used as described previously (34.Zhang Z. Lundeen S. Zhu Y. Carver J. Winneker R.C. Steroids. 2000; 65: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to examine potential cross-interactions between TNPR and these steroid receptors. SHBG Competition Binding Assay—An SHBG competition binding assay was run based upon published methods (38.Winneker R.C. Wagner M.M. Shaw C.J. Snyder B.W. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39.Cheng C.Y. Bardin C.W. Musto N.A. Gunsalus G.L. Cheng S.L. Ganguly M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1983; 56: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, human blood was collected in Vacutainer SST tubes (BD Biosciences) and kept at room temperature for 30 min before centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min (4 °C). The serum was aliquoted and stored at -76 °C. Human serum was diluted 20–60 times with TG buffer (10 mm Tris and 10% glycerol, pH 7.4, at room temperature), depending on the source of the serum, for a total [3H]dihydrotestosterone ([3H]DHT) binding of ∼3,000 cpm. Seven hundred μl of dextran-coated charcoal (0.5% charcoal and 0.05% dextran (molecular weight 69,000) in Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 7.4) was added to every 1,000 μl of diluted serum and incubated on ice for 1 h, followed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min. The SHBG competition binding assay was performed with 100 μl of the supernatant, 8 nm [3H]DHT, and increasing concentrations of test compounds. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, free [3H]DHT and bound [3H]DHT were separated by using 0.5% dextran-coated charcoal. Bound [3H]DHT was counted in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Cytochrome P450 3A4 Induction Assay in DPX2 Cells—The induction potential of the CYP3A4 enzyme by TNPR was evaluated in a DPX2 cell line by Puracyp, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA). The DPX2 cell line is a stably transformed tumor cell line. The enhancer of CYP3A4 (PXRE) and human PXR are stably integrated into the tumor cells. The incubations were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a high throughput manner. TNPR and 3-KDG were incubated at 1, 5, 10, and 25 μm concentrations in DPX2 cell line. Rifampicin, a known inducer of CYP3A4, was used as positive control. Induction of CYP3A4 was assessed by monitoring reporter gene activity and comparing the results to analogous cells treated with solvent. Rat Ovulation Inhibition Model—All animal studies were conducted under approved Wyeth Research Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. Animals were housed under a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed casein-based Purina laboratory rodent diet 5K96 and water ad libitum unless otherwise indicated. Ovulation inhibition experiments were run as described (40.Lundeen S.G. Zhang Z. Zhu Y. Carver J.M. Winneker R.C. J. Steroid Biol. Mol. Biol. 2001; 78: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, random cycling mature female Sprague-Dawley rats (∼200 g) were obtained from Charles River Laboratory (Boston, MA). Rats were synchronized for estrus with 2 μg of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) administered subcutaneously per rat at 0900 h and again at 1600 h. Animals were allowed to rest for 8 days before the administration of test compounds. Animals were then grouped, with 8–9 rats per treatment group. The morning of the 9th day following luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone treatment the rats were treated with test compounds once daily, by gavage, for 4 consecutive days. The animals were euthanized the morning following the last treatment. Oviducts were removed, placed between two glass slides, and viewed through a dissecting microscope to count ova. The number of animals presenting ova in the oviduct from each treatment group and the number of ova in the oviduct of each animal were recorded. Gene Construct for Expression of the PR-LBD—PR-LBD was expressed in E. coli from a plasmid carrying the LBD coding sequence (residues 675–933, GS... KK) as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). A thrombin cleavage site separates the GST and LBD regions. The construct is essentially the same as that described by Williams and Sigler (41.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Cell Growth and Induction of Expression for PR-LBD—Growth and expression were performed in a B. Braun Biotech Biostat C 10-liter fermenter. A 100-ml preculture was used to inoculate 10 liters of fermenter salts, glucose, ampicillin, trace metals, and yeast extract media. Cells were grown overnight at 25 °C. Fifteen minutes prior to induction, the vessel temperature was dropped to 15 °C, and 5 ml of 66 mm P4 was added. Cells were induced with 2.4 g of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1.0 mm final concentration) at an A600 value of 5.4. Five ml of 66 mm P4 was added at induction and every 15 min after induction throughout the entire expression (4 h total; 660 μm final concentration of P4). After 4 h of induction, a final A600 value of 8 had been obtained. The expression yielded ∼160 g of wet cell weight, and the protein of interest was approximated at 5–7% of total cell protein by SDS-PAGE. Purification of PR-LBD (Complexed with TNPR) Cell Lysis and Isolation of Soluble Protein—Twenty grams of frozen cells were suspended in 300 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol with 0.33 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (a protease inhibitor), 0.3 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog number 8849), and 5 μm P4. P4 or TNPR was added to solutions from stocks of 50 mm dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were broken by passage through a Microfluidizer™ from Microfluidics (Newton, MA). Cell debris and aggregated GST·PR-LBD were removed by centrifugation (Sorvall RC5B centrifuge, SS34 rotor) at 5 °C for 2.5 h at 18,500 rpm (40,000 relative centrifugal force), CHAPS was added to 1.5%, and the solution was filtered (0.45-μm cellulose nitrate filter) and stored overnight. Isolation of GST·PR-LBD—The solution was passed over two 5-ml columns (in tandem) of GSTrap FF at ∼1 ml/min. Resin was washed with 50 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and then with 50 ml of the same solution containing 50 μm TNPR. GST·PR-LBD was eluted with 12 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% octyl-β-glucoside, and 50 μm TNPR. Fractions of 5 ml were collected and pooled after location of the GST·PR-LBD by SDS-PAGE (generally a pool of 30–40 ml). Thrombin was added to 25,000 NIH units/ml, and the solution was stored overnight. Isolation of PR-LBD—The solution was diluted with 4 volumes of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% octyl-β-glucoside, and 50 μm TNPR. The solution was passed over 1-ml column of SP FF at 1 ml/min. The column was washed with 5 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% octyl-β-glucoside, and 1 μm TNPR. PR-LBD was eluted from the column with a 15-ml gradient of sodium chloride running from 20 to 220 mm (other components are described directly above). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and PR-LBD was located by SDS-PAGE, and those fractions containing PR-LBD at 1–2 mg/ml were used directly for crystallization. Crystallization—Crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C in drops containing 2.0 μl of protein stock solution (5 mg/ml protein, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, ∼100 mm NaCl, 0.1% octyl-β-glucoside, and 1 μm TNPR) mixed with 1 μl of well solution (8% polyethylene glycol 3350, 300 mm MgSO4, 50 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, and 10% glycerol) and 0.5 μl of 40% 1,3-propanediol (v/v) and equilibrated against 1 ml of well solution. Diamond-shaped crystals grew in 2–6 weeks, measuring ∼50 μm across. Data Collection and Processing—Crystals belong to the space group P21 (unit cell parameters: a = 57.52 Å; b = 64.50 Å; c = 70.41 Å; and β = 95.76°) and contain two molecules of PR-LBD in the asymmetric unit, resulting in a solvent content of 44%. Crystals were drawn through a solution of 20% ethylene glycol and 80% well solution and cooled rapidly in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator and recorded on a Raxis4 detector. Intensities were integrated and scaled using the programs Denzo and Scalepack (42.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the PR-LBD/P structure (41.Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) as the search model. After several iterative cycles of refinement using CNX (43.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L.

https://openalex.org/W1979122083,"Extracellular ATP (ATPe) binds to P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) expressed on the surface of cells of hematopoietic lineage, including murine thymocytes. Activation of P2X7R by ATPe results in the opening of cation-specific channels, and prolonged ATPe exposure leads to the formation of non-selective pores enabling transmembrane passage of solutes up to 900 Da. In the presence of ATPe, P2X7R-mediated thymocyte death is due primarily to necrosis/lysis and not apoptosis, as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase indicative of a loss of plasma membrane integrity. The present study is focused on the identification of P2X7R signaling mediators in ATP-induced thymocyte necrosis/lysis. Thus, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation was found to be required for cell lysis, and both events were independent of ATP-induced calcium influx. P2X7R-dependent thymocyte death involved the chronological activation of Src family tyrosine kinase(s), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinaseErk1/2 module, and the proteasome. Although independent of this signaling cascade, non-selective pore formation may modulate ATP-mediated thymocyte death. These results therefore suggest a role for both activation of MAP kinaseErk1/2 and non-selective pore opening in P2X7R-induced thymocyte death.

Extracellular ATP interacts with P2 purinergic receptors that are expressed on a wide spectrum of tissues. Two classes of P2 receptors have been identified, the G-protein-coupled seventransmembrane P2Y receptors and the P2X ligand-gated cation channels (1Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Seven members of the P2X receptor family have been cloned, which share the same predicted structure with two transmembrane-spanning domains, an extracellular loop and intracellular N- and C-terminal tails. The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) 1The abbreviations used are: P2X7R, P2X7 receptor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; Erk, extracellular-signal regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PI4K, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase; o-ATP, oxidized ATP; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; PP2, 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1 protein; MEK, MAP kinase kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody. differs from the other P2X receptors; in particular, its C-terminal domain is 200 amino acids longer and it does not heteropolymerize with other members of the P2X family (2Torres G.E.

Brief exposure to millimolar concentrations of ATP in its fully dissociated tetra-anionic form, ATP4-, opens cation-specific ion channels. Prolonged triggering of P2X7R results in the formation of non-selective membrane pores permeable to molecules of molecular mass up to 900 Da. Formation of the non-selective pore is dependent on the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of P2X7R (3Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol.

The physiological significance of cell death mediated by the ligation of P2X7R by ATP remains to be determined. A potential role for ATP in programmed cell death underlying positive and negative selection of immature thymocytes during thymus development has been suggested by Chvatchko et al. (27Chvatchko Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T. Buell G. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1996; 5: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In in vitro dexamethasone- or in vivo superantigen-induced apoptosis, P2X1R is up-regulated and P2X1R antagonists inhibit thymocyte death, suggesting that the elimination of self-reactive thymocytes may be mediated by the P2X1R (27Chvatchko Y. Valera S. Aubry J.P. Renno T. Buell G. Bonnefoy J.Y. Immunity. 1996; 5: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, death by neglect may be due to one or more pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid-sensitive receptors, i.e. P2X1R, -2R, and/or -7R (28Freedman B.D. Liu Q.H. Gaulton G. Kotlikoff M.I. Hescheler J. Fleischmann B.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the role of P2X1R in negative selection has been challenged by Koshiba et al. (29Koshiba M. Apasov S. Sverdlov V. Chen P. Erb L. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), who reported that mouse thymocytes treated with dexamethasone or anti-CD3 mAb respond by up-regulating P2Y2R mRNA expression but not modifying P2X1R mRNA transcripts. Thus, the potential role of ATP in programmed cell death in the thymus still remains elusive. P2X7R stimulation triggers several intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, in macrophages (30el-Moatassim C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23664-23673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thymocytes (31Le Stunff H. Auger R. Kanellopoulos J.

However, the relationship between these biochemical events and cell death has not been fully characterized. A role for caspase-1 in P2X7R-mediated cell death has been established for macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. In this model, brief exposure of macrophages to ATP leads to death by two different pathways, one of which is lipopolysaccharide-independent, and the other, lipopolysaccharide-induced and requiring caspase-1 (24Le Feuvre R.A. Brough D. Iwakura Y. Takeda K. Rothwell N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3210-3218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In murine thymocytes, P2X7R activation by ATP leads to death via both caspase-dependent apoptosis, albeit a minor component of cells dying, and, predominantly, via necrosis/lysis (31Le Stunff H. Auger R. Kanellopoulos J. Raymond M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16918-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms of death have not been elucidated. We therefore focused our study on the intracellular signaling events occurring during thymocyte death following in vitro ATP treatment. We show that stimulation of P2X7R in thymocytes induces the activation of the three mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase modules, extracellular-signal regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 (JNK1/2), and p38 kinases. However, only the MAP kinaseErk1/2 module is necessary for calcium-independent necrosis/lysis of thymocytes. Using specific inhibitors of various enzymes, we determined that thymocyte death requires the sequential activation of one or more Src family tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2, and the proteasome. Formation of the non-selective pore is independent of this signaling pathway, and in particular, of the activation of the MAP kinaseErk1/2 module, but both pore formation and the signaling pathway contribute to thymocyte death.

Measurement of LDH Release—In most experiments, mouse thymocytes were preincubated in culture medium without fetal calf serum for 1 h with inhibitors, unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, before addition of 1 mm ATP for 2 h. Cell lysis was quantified by measuring the release of LDH or HMGB1. Mouse thymocytes (5 × 106) were incubated in 0.5 ml RPMI containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for various lengths of time. Cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were tested for LDH release using the oxidation reaction of β-NADH in the presence of pyruvate (Sigma kit for LDH). The initial rate of absorbance decrease was measured in an automatic readout spectrophotometer at λ = 340 nm (38Etore F. Tenu J.P. Teiger E. Adnot S. Lonchampt M.O. Pirotzki E. Le Doan T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Ten million thymocytes were lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 30 mm sodium pervanadate, at 4 °C. Cells were incubated 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated overnight with anti-Lck or anti-Fyn at 2 μg/ml. To precipitate immune complexes, Protein-G-Sepharose was added for 2 h. Immune complexes bound to Protein-G-Sepharose were washed three times and resuspended in loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Western Blot Analyses—Lysates or immunoprecipitates from mouse thymocytes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37 °C. Blots were immunostained with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and probed with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Specific bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of Proteasome Activity—To measure proteasome activity in intact thymocytes, 2.5 × 106 cells were suspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μmd-glucose and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a flat bottom 96-well plate. Cells were incubated or not with inhibitors for 1 h at 37 °C and treated with 1 mm ATP for 2 h. The fluorogenic peptide substrate for chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, was then added at 20 μm, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Substrate conversion was measured with a spectrofluorometer (Wallac 1420), using an excitation wavelength of 390 nm, and measuring fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Non-selective Pore Formation—Thymocytes were incubated 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of ATP (1 mm) and YO-PRO-1 (2 μm) in assay buffer containing 280 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine, 5.6 mm KCl, 10 mmd-glucose, 1 mm CaCl2 (39Michel A.D. Chessell I.P. Humphrey P.P. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted for 10 min at 200 × g and incubated with propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) in assay buffer at 4 °C. Cell suspensions were then analyzed by flow cytometry. For EtBr uptake experiments, 2.5 × 106 thymocytes were suspended in 100 μl of the same assay buffer containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide in a flat bottom 96-well plate. ATP (1 mm) was added, and fluorescence was monitored for 40 min at 37 °C in the spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 615 nm. Real-time PCR Assays—Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA, extracted from thymocytes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). The quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPlus SYBR Green I mix (Roche Applied Science) in a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science). P2X7R RNA expression data were normalized to that of actin. The following mouse P2X7R and actin primers were used: P2X7R forward, 5′-TTCCAGGAAGCAGGAGAGAA-3′; P2X7R reverse, 5′-ATACTTCAACGTCGGCTTGG-3′; actin forward, 5′-GCTACAGCTTCACCACCACA-3′; actin reverse, 5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGC-3′. ATP-induced Thymocyte Death—ATP-treated thymocytes undergo cell lysis and apoptosis, as assessed, respectively, by the release of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Fig. 1A) (31Le Stunff H. Auger R. Kanellopoulos J. Raymond M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16918-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and caspase-dependent DNA fragmentation (31Le Stunff H. Auger R. Kanellopoulos J. Raymond M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16918-16926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the basis for cell lysis, we took advantage of two assays that discriminate between the two types of cell death, namely, the release of HMGB1, a chromatin-associated nuclear protein that is liberated into the cytosol of necrotic but not apoptotic cells (40Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3362) Google Scholar); and the cleavage of PARP, a nuclear protein that is a specific substrate of caspase-3 and is an indicator of apoptotic cell death. We thus determined the kinetics of these two events in thymocytes exposed to an optimal dose of ATP. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, HMGB1 is detected as early as 2 h following ATP stimulation, and increases until 5 h of culture. In comparison, dexamethasone, a known apoptotic agent for thymocytes, induces a significantly reduced level of HMGB1 release during the same time. Cleavage of PARP is detected between 4 and 5 h following ATP treatment, and though to a greater extent than the untreated control, is much diminished compared with dexamethasone-treated thymocytes (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the effector phase of thymocyte lysis is well underway 2 h after ATP treatment. The involvement of various death effector molecules and signaling pathways in subsequent experiments on thymocyte ATP-induced lysis was therefore determined at the 2-h time point. Activation of the MAP KinaseErk1/2 Pathway Is Required for ATP-induced Thymocyte Death—The role of the various MAP kinase pathways in thymocyte lysis elicited by ATP was defined using specific inhibitors of the Erk1/2, p38 or JNK modules. Strong inhibition of LDH release was only observed after pre-treatment of thymocytes with 20 μm U0126, a MEK1/2 pharmacologic inhibitor. At the same dose, U0124, a negative control for U0126; SB 203580, an inhibitor of p38 kinase; and SP 600125, an inhibitor of JNK kinases, did not modulate cell death (Fig. 2A). ATP stimulation of thymocytes led to phosphorylation of Erk1/2, and the MEK inhibitor efficiently prevented this activation (Fig. 2C). Phosphorylation of Erk1/2 peaked at 15 min after ATP addition, then decreased rapidly at 30 min (Fig. 2B). The p38 and JNK1/2 kinases were also activated, and their phosphorylation increased over time (Fig. 2B). Although unable to inhibit LDH release from thymocytes treated with ATP, the specific inhibitors of the p38 and JNK pathways blocked anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of the two kinases (data not shown). Stimulation of thymocytes by ATP thus leads to cell death requiring activation of only the Erk1/2 pathway. The protein phosphatases 1 and 2A are not involved in ATP-mediated thymocyte lysis, because pretreatment with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of both phosphatases, not only did not prevent cell death but instead increased it (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that, although okadaic acid alone increased significantly Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), cell death remained at the level of control untreated thymocyte cultures (12% LDH release). ATP stimulation of okadaic acid-treated thymocytes potentiated Erk1/2 phosphorylation by 20%; this value was calculated with a shorter time of exposure by densitometry (data not shown). Using the inhibitor of MEK1/2 activities, U0126, we found that ATP-induced LDH release was much diminished, whether or not okadaic acid was present (Fig. 3A). As expected, U0126 strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, demonstrating that these MAP kinases are key mediators in ATP-induced cell death. ATP-induced Erk1/2 Phosphorylation Is Mediated through the Purinergic Receptor P2X7—Mouse thymocytes express several P2X receptors, including P2X1R, -2R, -6R, and -7R (28Freedman B.D. Liu Q.H. Gaulton G. Kotlikoff M.I. Hescheler J. Fleischmann B.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify which P2X receptor may be linked to Erk1/2 activation, we showed that pretreatment of thymocytes with the P2X7R antagonist, o-ATP, blocked the appearance of phosphorylated Erk1/2 following stimulation with ATP (Fig. 4A). Importantly, we found no activation of Erk1/2 in P2X7R-deficient thymocytes treated with ATP (Fig. 4B). This was not related to a P2X7R-dependent default in the Erk1/2 pathway itself, because phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate could still activate Erk1/2 at identical levels in thymocytes from wild type or P2X7R-deficient mice (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, we determined by reverse transcription-PCR that, as in wild type animals, thymocytes from P2X7R-deficient mice express P2X1R, -2R, and -6R (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that Erk1/2 phosphorylation in murine thymocytes results from the ligation of P2X7R by ATP. Role of Calcium in Thymocyte Death Elicited by ATP—The opening of ion channels leading to a rapid influx into the cytosol of divalent cations (in particular, Ca2+) is characteristic of P2X7R activation (41Bianchi B.R. Lynch K.J. Touma E. Niforatos W. Burgard E.C. Alexander K.M. Park H.S. Yu H. Metzger R. Kowaluk E. Jarvis M.F. van Biesen T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 376: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The role of Ca2+ in ATP-mediated P2X7R effects was therefore assessed. As shown in Fig. 5A, the level of ATP-induced LDH release was not affected by the absence of extracellular calcium, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation was identical in thymocytes whether or not calcium was present (Fig. 5B). Thus, stimulation of P2X7R by ATP leads to both thymocyte lysis and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in a calcium-independent way. Src family Tyrosine Kinase(s) and PI3K Are Necessary for P2X7R-dependent Thymocyte Death—Because Src kinases are involved in T-cell receptor-dependent signal transduction in thymocytes (reviewed in Ref. 42Anderson S.J. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 151-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their involvement in the P2X7R signaling pathway was investigated. The effect of inhibitors of Src kinases on thymocyte death was evaluated, and the phosphorylation state of Src kinases in cell lysates was determined, using rabbit anti-Src (pY418) phosphospecific antibodies. Genistein, a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and PP2, a selective inhibitor of the Src family tyrosine kinase(s), significantly diminished ATP-induced thymocyte lysis (Fig. 6A). Src phosphorylation increased in ATP-stimulated thymocyte lysates, and phosphorylation could be blocked by PP2, providing additional support for a role of Src family tyrosine kinase(s) in P2X7R-induced thymocyte death (Fig. 6B). To identify the Src family tyrosine kinase(s) involved in P2X7R signaling, thymocyte lysates were precipitated with mAb specific for p56lck and p59fyn, and the immunoprecipitates were subsequently analyzed with rabbit anti-Src phosphospecific antibodies. Significantly, the two Src-tyrosine kinases p56lck and p59fyn are known to be recruited during T cell receptor-mediated signal transduction in thymocytes (reviewed in Ref. 42Anderson S.J. Levin S.D. Perlmutter R.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 151-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no phosphorylation of either kinase was revealed in lysates of ATP-stimulated thymocytes (Fig. 6C). It thus appears that neither p56lck nor p59fyn play a role in the transduction pathway activated by ligation of the P2X7R by ATP. PI4K has been identified by proteomic analysis to be 1 of 11 proteins associated with the purinergic receptor P2X7 (43Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI4K or related kinases participate in the P2X7R signaling pathway, we treated thymocytes with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI4K and PI3K, or with LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI3K, and measured ATP-triggered LDH release. A significant decrease in thymocyte lysis was observed for both inhibitors (Fig. 7A). The phosphorylation status of Akt, one of the target enzymes downstream of PI3K, was then examined. As shown in Fig. 7B, ATP did not activate Akt, unlike okadaic acid, and the phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid was inhibited by the selective inhibitor of PI3K. The lack of effect on thymocyte lysis of rapamycin, a highly specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, a substrate of Akt, confirms the inability of ATP to trigger the phosphorylation and activation of Akt (Fig. 7C). These results show that, although PI3K is involved in the P2X7R biochemical death pathway, the effective downstream protein kinases do not include Akt.

https://openalex.org/W2063266428,"One important factor in fabricating protein microarray is to immobilize proteins without losing their activity on a solid phase. To keep them functional, it is necessary to immobilize proteins in a way that preserve their folded structural integrity. In a previous study, we developed novel Calixarene derivatives for the immobilization of proteins on the surface of a glass slide (1). In this study, we compared the sensitivity and the specificity of the linker molecules with those of five other protein attachment agents on glass slides using a prostate-specific antigen and its antibodies as a model system. The Calixcrown-coated protein chip showed a superior sensitivity and a much lower detection limit than those chips prepared by other methods. When we tested the capability of Calixcrown to immobilize antibody molecules, it appeared that Calixcrown makes arrangement of antibody be more regular with the vertical orientation than the covalent-bond agent. We also observed that the Calixcrown chip could be used for the diagnostic application with clinical samples from prostate cancer and HIV patients. Finally, we applied the Calixcrown chip using an antibody microarray to identify up- or down-regulated proteins in specific tissue and detected several up- or down-regulated proteins from a rat liver by administering toxin. Thus, the Calixcrown chip can be used as a powerful tool with a wide range of applications, including protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and an enzyme activity assay."

Intriguingly, a water-filled channel is observed between the two monomers. Residual dipolar coupling measurements indicate that the structure of the MVL dimer in solution is identical to that in the crystal. Man3GlcNAc2 binds to a preformed cleft at the distal end of each domain such that a total of four independent carbohydrate molecules associate with each homodimer. The binding cleft provides shape complementarity, including the presence of a deep hydrophobic hole that accommodates the N-acetyl methyl at the reducing end of the carbohydrate, and specificity arises from 7-8 intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

Very recently, another cyanobacterial protein known as MVL, originally isolated from a laboratory culture of Microcystis viridis NIES-102 (14Yamaguchi M. Ogawa T. Muramoto K. Kamio Y. Jimbo M.

Cyanovirin and MVL are unusual in that they bind oligosaccharides with very high affinity in the absence of multivalent interactions. Cyanovirin specifically recognizes the disaccharide Manα(1→2)Manα located at the terminal branches of mammalian high mannose oligosaccharides (7Bewley C.A. Otero-Quintero S. J. Am. Chem.

In contrast MVL is distinct among oligomannose-binding proteins in that it exhibits fine specificity for the Manα(1→6)Manβ(1→4)GlcNAcβ(1→4)GlcNAc tetrasaccharide core found in N-linked oligomannosides (15Bewley C.A.

The culture was induced at an A600 nm of ∼1 with 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 2-3 h and harvested by centrifugation at 7800 × g for 15 min. The pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 100 ml of 20 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, lysed by three passages through a microfluidizer, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was subjected to fractionation by ammonium sulfate precipitation with the serial addition of 10 and 15 g of NH4SO4/100 ml of supernatant, incubation on ice for at least 4 h, and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The final pellet (25% w/v NH4SO4) was resuspended in 8 ml of 20 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA and loaded onto a Superdex 75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. The fractions containing MVL were identified by SDS-PAGE, pooled, diluted 4-fold with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), loaded onto a HiLoad™ 10/10 MonoQ anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted with a 0-1 m NaCl gradient.

Soc. 1999; 126: 2923-2938Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The values of DaNH and η obtained by singular value decomposition are 7.4 Hz and 0.63, respectively, when best-fitting the dipolar couplings to the coordinates of the free monomer; 7.5 Hz and 0.61, respectively, for the free dimer; 7.2 Hz and 0.63, respectively, for the complexed monomer; and 7.5 Hz and 0.62, respectively, for the complexed dimer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCrystal Structure of MVL—Native MVL crystallized in space group P21 and diffracted to 1.9 Å. A SeMet derivative of MVL crystallized under identical conditions in the same space group and diffracted to 1.85 Å. The initial phases were determined by single isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering, and the structure was refined with data to a final resolution of 1.9 Å. The final structure was well defined with an R-factor of 17.7% and a free R of 21.6% (Table I). A total of four homodimers of MVL were present in the asymmetric unit, leading to eight unique copies of the MVL monomer in the final structure.MVL is a 13-kDa polypeptide of 113 amino acids that contains two highly homologous 54-residue domains with 50% sequence identity between them (15Bewley C.A. Cai M. Ray S. Ghirlando R. Yamaguchi M. Muramoto K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 901-914Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the following descriptions the secondary structure elements and residue numbers are given for the N-terminal domain (residues 1-54), whereas the equivalent elements and residues in the C-terminal domain (residues 60-113) are provided in parentheses. Each domain contains a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet in a -2X,1 topology with strand β3 (β6) hydrogen-bonded to strands β1 (β4) and β2 (β5) (Fig. 1A). The single α-helix α1 (α2) is located between strands β1 (β4) and β2 (β5) and is packed against one face of the sheet (Fig. 1A). Three bulges in the β-strands, between residues 34-35 (93-94), 40-41 (99-100), and 44-45 (103-104), distort the normal twist of the β-sheet such that it wraps around the α-helix and forms a cleft at the distal end of each domain that constitutes the carbohydrate binding pocket (Fig. 1C). The Cα backbone r.m.s. difference between the N- and C-domains is ∼0.8 Å. The N- and C-domains form a boomerang-shaped structure connected by residues 55-59. The long axes of the two domains are oriented approximately orthogonal to each other; and the C-domain can be superimposed on the N-domain by an ∼180° rotation about an axis that bisects the angle between the two domains (Fig. 1, A and D). There are very limited contacts between the N- and C-domains of the monomer; the interface buries only 156 Å2 of surface-accessible area, and there is a single interdomain hydrogen bond between the side-chain amide group of Gln-30 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Thr-112.MVL forms a homodimer such that the boomerang-shaped monomers interlock, and each domain from one monomer contacts both domains from the second monomer (Fig. 1, B and C). The α1 and α2 helices of the first monomer contact and lie approximately orthogonal to the α2 and α1 helices, respectively, of the second monomer, whereas the first strand of each β-sheet (β1 or β4) contacts the same strand in the second monomer. The two monomers interact extensively resulting in 3930 Å2 of buried accessible surface area with 70% of the buried surface involving nonpolar atoms. The gap volume index (defined as the ratio of gap volume to interface buried accessible surface area) for the interacting surfaces is 1.28, indicative of a tight, complementary interface (30Jones S. Thornton J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). Three intermolecular hydrogen bonds stabilize the dimer including those between the N-ϵ2 atom of His-29 of one monomer and the hydroxyl group of Ser-87′ of the other monomer, the side-chain hydroxyls of Thr-64 and Thr-64′, and the hydroxyl group of Thr-64 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asp-65′. At least eight (4 × 2) water molecules form hydrogen bonds that bridge the interface between the two monomers (Fig. 1B); a single water molecule bridges the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Ala-9 and Pro-11 and the side chain of Gln-83′. A similar network is formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Pro-70 and Lys-24′ and the side chain of Glu-76, between the backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Asn-6 and the same atoms of Asn-6′, and between the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Lys-24 and Ala-68′.Residual dipolar couplings provide long range orientational information in solution, thereby providing a simple and accurate means of ascertaining whether the structure in the crystal reflects that in solution (26Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The relative orientations of the N- and C-domains within the monomer and of the two monomers within the dimer are the same in solution and in the crystal state, as evidenced by the excellent agreement between the measured backbone N-H residual dipolar couplings recorded on the MVL-Man3GlcNAc2 complex in a diluted liquid crystalline medium (of polyethylene glycol/hexanol) and those calculated from the crystal coordinates of both free and carbohydrate-bound MVL. The values obtained for the dipolar coupling R-factors (29Clore G.M. Garrett D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 126: 2923-2938Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) are 16.6% for the monomer and 17.3% for the dimer using the coordinates of free MVL, and 16.9% for the monomer and 17.9% for the dimer using the coordinates of MVL complexed to Man3GlcNAc2. These values for the dipolar coupling R-factors are within the range expected for 1.5-2-Å resolution crystal structures (26Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 31Williams D.C. Cai M. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1449-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), indicating that the structures in solution and in the crystal are the same.Intriguingly, despite the tight intermonomer interaction, water molecules fill a channel that extends from the surface adjacent to the linker region of one monomer to the surface adjacent to the linker region of the second monomer (Fig. 1D). This channel also contains ethylene glycol molecules from the cryopreservative solution such that the N-δ1 atom of His-29 (from each monomer) is hydrogen-bonded to an ethylene glycol molecule near the center of the channel. The presence of a reactive group such as histidine near the center of a solvent-accessible channel may suggest a potential catalytic or ion-pumping function; however, no such activity has been identified for MVL to date (14Yamaguchi M. Ogawa T. Muramoto K. Kamio Y. Jimbo M. Kamiya H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Bewley C.A. Cai M. Ray S. Ghirlando R. Yamaguchi M. Muramoto K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 901-914Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar).A search of the Protein Data Bank using the program DALI (32Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar) reveals that the topology of the individual domains of MVL (a triple-stranded β-sheet on top of which lies an α-helix) represents a fairly common motif with several proteins having stretches of around 50 residues (with no significant sequence identity) that can be superimposed onto the individual domains of MVL with Cα atomic r.m.s. differences of 2.5-3.5 Å. However, the combination of the sequential N- and C-domains found in the monomer of MVL and their configuration in the MVL dimer is not observed in any other known protein structure. Moreover, this structural motif has not been reported to be involved in carbohydrate recognition.Crystal Structure of MVL-Man3GlcNAc2—MVL saturated with Man3GlcNAc2 (1:2.2-3.0 molar ratio) co-crystallized under the same conditions as free MVL. The complex formed crystals in space group P1 that diffracted to 1.8 Å. The initial model was generated by molecular replacement with the structure of free MVL and refined using data to a final resolution of 1.8 Å. Similar to the free MVL crystals, the asymmetric unit contains four MVL dimers. Clear electron density (Fig. 1E) demonstrates the presence of four Man3GlcNAc2 ligands bound to each MVL dimer (for a total of 16 ligands in the asymmetric unit). The final model was well defined by the data with an R-factor of 19.2% and a free R of 22.1% (Table I).The presence of eight unique MVL monomers per asymmetric unit that were refined independently (without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints) provides an opportunity to assess the conformational variability of MVL within the crystal environment (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the variation between monomers is smaller for MVL in the complex than for free MVL; the average r.m.s. deviation to the mean coordinate positions for free MVL is 0.19 Å for backbone atoms and 0.41 Å for all heavy atoms, and the corresponding values for the MVL-Man3GlcNAc2 complex are 0.12 and 0.31 Å, respectively (and 0.32 Å for the carbohydrate heavy atoms). This observation suggests that binding of Man3GlcNAc2 restricts the conformational variability of the MVL protein even though the free structure is already well ordered. In terms of side chains, this phenomenon is particularly evident for Trp-72 in the C-domain and to a lesser extent for the equivalent residue Trp-13 in the N-domain, which both exhibit a sizeable spread among the eight molecules in free MVL but are fixed in a narrow region of conformational space in the complex (Fig. 2). With one exception, MVL undergoes no significant conformational change upon binding carbohydrate, as evidenced by the observation that the r.m.s. difference between the average coordinates of free and complexed MVL (0.09 Å for backbone atoms and 0.18 Å for all atoms) is smaller than the values for the average r.m.s. deviations to the mean coordinates among the dimers from either structure given above. One residue located in the carbohydrate binding pocket, Thr-38, however, does change its rotameric state from g- in the free state (for seven of the eight molecules) to t in the complex (Fig. 2A), thereby permitting the hydroxyl group of Thr-38 to participate in an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the bound carbohydrate (see below).Fig. 2Comparison of the carbohydrate binding pockets in MVL free and complexed to Man3GlcNAc2. The backbone of the binding pocket and side chains involved in protein-carbohydrate hydrogen-bonding interactions is displayed, and each panel shows a best-fit superposition of the eight MVL monomers in the asymmetric unit in the free and bound states. A, N-domain; B, C-domain. Free MVL, red; complexed MVL, blue; Man3GlcNAc2 (one of the eight molecules bound to each domain), yellow, with oxygen atoms in red and nitrogen atoms in blue. Note that the O-6 hydroxyl group of the Man4 unit is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Thr-38 in the N-domain pocket (A); in the C-domain pocket (B) the equivalent residue is Arg-97, and hence no such hydrogen bond can be formed. This difference leads to a 180° rotation about the O-5-C-5-C-6-O-6 dihedral angle of Man4 such that the C-6-O-6 bond points in the opposite direction in the N- and C-domain pockets.View Large Image"

Expression of the ivy desaturase in Arabidopsis resulted in the accumulation of 16:1Δ4 and its expected elongation product 18:1Δ6 (petroselinic acid). Expression in Escherichia coli resulted in the accumulation of soluble, active protein that was purified to apparent homogeneity. In vitro assays confirmed Δ4 desaturation with 16:0-ACP; however, with 18:0-acyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturation occurred at the Δ9 position. The ivy desaturase also converted 16:1Δ9-ACP and 18:1Δ9-ACP to the corresponding Δ4,9 dienes. These data suggest at least two distinct substrate binding modes, one placing C4 at the diiron active site and the other placing C9 at the active site. In the latter case, 18:0 would likely bind in an extended conformation as described for the castor desaturase with 9-carbons accommodated in the cavity beyond the dirron site. However, Δ4 desaturation would require the accommodation of 12 carbons for C16 substrates or 14 carbons for C18 substrates. The amino acids lining the substrate binding cavity of ivy and castor desaturases are conserved except for T117R and P179I (castor/ivy). Paradoxically, both substitutions, when introduced into the castor desaturase, favored the binding of shorter acyl chains. Thus, it seems likely that Δ4 desaturation would require a non-extended, perhaps U-shaped, substrate conformation. A cis double bond may facilitate the initiation of such a non-extended conformation in the monounsaturated substrates. The multifunctional properties of the ivy desaturase make it well suited for further dissection of the determinants of regiospecificity.

This reaction is the penultimate step in the ACP track of fatty acid biosynthesis in the plastid and represents the major source of monounsaturated fatty acids in plant tissues (4.Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). The resulting monounsaturated fatty acids are required to maintain membrane fluidity and in storage tissues are directed into storage triacylglycerols either directly or after additional desaturation steps. Plant acyl-ACP desaturases belong to a distinct sequence class composed of soluble globular proteins, whereas most fatty acid desaturases, found in fungi and animal and plants, are integral membrane proteins (5.Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). All desaturases identified to date that recognize monoene, diene, and polyene substrates are members of the integral membrane class of desaturases. The archetypal Δ9-18: 0-ACP 2For fatty acid nomenclature, x:y, x is the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid chain, and y is the number of double bonds.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25072-25080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Each monomer of the castor enzyme homodimer contains a boomerang-shaped cavity capable of binding a stearoyl moiety in a gauche conformation adjacent to the active site diiron cluster. Although a crystal structure of the desaturase-substrate complex has yet to be published, modeling the substrate into the existing crystal structure suggests that when the methyl group of the stearate is in contact with the bottom of the cavity, C9 and C10 are positioned with their pro-R hydrogens facing the diiron active site (6.Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This structural model is consistent with the Pro-R Pro-R stereochemistry reported for the desaturase reaction (8.Behrouzian B. Savile C.K. Dawson B. Buist P.H. Shanklin J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the location of azide, a peroxo mimic, complexed with the desaturase diiron site (7.Moche M. Shanklin J. Ghoshal A.

In addition to the archetypal 18:0-Δ9-ACP desaturase described above, an increasing number of variant desaturases have been isolated from plants that contain unusual fatty acids in their storage lipids. These desaturases exhibit a variety of combinations of chain length and regiospecificity; for instance, for 16:0 desaturases Δ4, Δ6, and Δ9, regiospecificities have been reported (9.Cahoon E.B. Dormann P. Ohlrogge J.B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 10.Cahoon E.B. Cranmer A.M. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol.

Together, these enzymes represent a valuable resource for determining the molecular basis for desaturase specificity. For instance, chimeras of the ∼360 amino acid sequences of the mature castor Δ9-18:0- and the Thunbergia Δ6-16:0-ACP desaturases led to the identification of five residues that when substituted from castor sequence into the corresponding positions in the Thunbergia sequence converted the Thunbergia Δ6-16:0-ACP desaturase into Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase (16.Cahoon E.B. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis selection experiments on the castor enzyme revealed individual determinants of chain length specificity (17.Whittle E. Shanklin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21500-21505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); similar attempts to resolve the determinants of regiospecificity have failed. Δ4 desaturases show the largest difference in desaturation position, 5 carbons distant from that of the archetypal Δ9 desaturases, making them good candidates for dissecting the determinants of regiospecificity (18.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11184-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation of a cDNA and characterization of a Δ4-16:0-ACP desaturase from English ivy. Unlike the previously described coriander enzyme, the ivy homolog expresses in E. coli as a soluble and active enzyme suitable for biochemical analysis. In vivo and in vitro evidence confirm its Δ4-16:0-ACP specificity. In presenting a panel of acyl-ACPs to the ivy desaturase, we discovered that it is multifunctional, desaturating 18:0-ACP to 18:1Δ9. In addition, it displays the ability to desaturate monoene-ACP substrates, 16:1Δ9-ACP to 16:2Δ4,9, and 18:1Δ9-ACP to 18:2Δ4,9 in a manner similar to that seen for integral membrane front end desaturases. Preparation of cDNA Library from Developing Hedera helix Seeds— Developing seeds at approximately early to mid-maturity were dissected from fruits of H. helix L. (English ivy), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until further use. Total RNA was isolated from the developing seeds using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and poly(A)+ RNA was enriched by two passes of the total RNA through oligo(dT) columns using a QuickPrep mRNA isolation kit (Amersham Biosciences). A unidirectional cDNA library was subsequently prepared from the poly(A)+-enriched RNA with inserts cloned 5′ to 3′ in the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pBluescript SK(–), and the library was maintained in plasmid form in E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen). The methods used for cDNA library construction were as previously described (19.Cahoon E.B. Carlson T.J. Ripp K.G. Schweiger B.J. Cook G.A. Hall S.E. Kinney A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12935-12940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Isolation of a Divergent Acyl-ACP Desaturase cDNA from H. helix Seeds—Partial acyl-ACP desaturase cDNA sequences were amplified from the library by using fully degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino acid sequences GDMITEE and EKTIQYL, which are conserved among the majority of known acyl-ACP desaturases. The oligonucleotide sequences and PCR amplification methodology were the same as previously described (10.Cahoon E.B. Cranmer A.M. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27519-27526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR reaction products (∼215 bp) were subcloned into the pAMP1 vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A nucleotide sequence was subsequently obtained for 10 of the subcloned PCR products. The resulting cDNA class encoding a partial polypeptide of highest identity with the coriander Δ4-palmitoyl-ACP desaturase (18.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11184-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was chosen for further characterization. The complete 5′- and 3′-coding sequences for this cDNA class were amplified from the library by using vector-specific primers in combination with primers specific for the partial H. helix cDNA. The primer combinations were T3 primer and 5′-CTTATTGAGAAGGTCACCATG-3′ (for amplification of 5′ end) and T7 primer and 5′-ATGGTATTAAGGATGAGACTG-3′ (for amplification of 3′ end). PCR reactions were conducted using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and the longest products were subcloned and sequenced. Based on the sequence information obtained from the PCR products, the following pair of oligonucleotides was designed for amplification of the complete H. helix acyl-ACP desaturase cDNA from the developing seed library: 5′-ATTCTAGAAGAAGAAATGGCTTTGAAGC-3′ (contains an added XbaI restriction site) and 5′-ATGAGCTCCCTTCCTGTTCATATCTTC-3′ (contains an added SacI restriction site). Three independent PCR reactions were conducted with Pfu polymerase and ∼350 ng of the H. helix developing seed cDNA library as template. Products from each reaction were subcloned and determined to have identical sequence. Expression of Ivy Desaturase in Arabidopsis—Ivy desaturase was fused with the castor transit peptide with the use of overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (21.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6821) Google Scholar). The castor desaturase transit peptide was amplified with the following primers: casmaf, AAGGTAAGAAAACCCGGGATGGCTCTCAAGCTCAATCCT, and casivyr, GGAGTTAGAGTTGACAGTGGAAGCCATGTAGAACTTAGGAGATCTGGTACTGGCC. The mature portion of the ivy desaturase was amplified with the use of the following primers: casivyf. GGCCAGTACCAGATCTCCTAAGTTCTACATGGCTTCCACTGTCAACTCTAACTCC, and ivysacr, CCCTTCCCTTCGAGCTCATATCTTCAACTCCCGATTGAAAATCCAGC. The two gene fragments were fused by amplification with the use of the casmaf and ivysacr primers described above. The resulting fragment was subjected to restriction digestion with SmaI and SacI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the Agrobacterium binary vector pDATNAP, a derivative of pRD410 (22.Datla R.S.S. Hammerlindl J.K. Panchuk B. Pelcher L.E. Keller W. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), to direct seed-specific expression from the napin promoter (23.Kridl J.C. McCarter D.W. Rose R.E. Scherer D.E.

The vectors were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 pMP90 by electroporation and used to transform Arabidopsis thaliana plants by the floral dip method (24.Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1993; 316: 1194-1198Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Analysis—Seeds were methylated (1 ml of 1 n HCl, methanol, Supelco, 80 °C for 1 h), extracted with hexane, and trimethylsilylated (100 μl of BSTFA-TMCS (bis(treimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamidetrimethylsilane), Supelco, 90 °C for 45 min). The BSTFA-TMCS was removed by evaporation, and the sample was resuspended in hexane. Samples were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5973 mass selective detector (GC/MS) and a Supelco SP-2340 cyano capillary column (60 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). The injector was held at 225 °C, the oven temperature was varied (100–240 °C at 15 °C/min followed by 240 °C for 5 min), and the helium flow was 1.1 ml/min. Double-bond positions of monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters were located by GC-MS of dimethyl disulfide (25.Yamamoto K. Shibahara A. Nakayama T. Kajimoto G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 60: 39-50Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26.Andersson B.A. Holman R.T. Lipids. 1973; 9: 185-190Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and pyrrolidine derivatives (27.Andersson B.A. Christie W.W. Holman R.T. Lipids. 1974; 10: 215-219Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Expression of the Divergent H. helix Acyl-ACP Desaturase cDNA in E. coli—The coding sequence for the mature H. helix acyl-ACP desaturase (minus predicted plastid transit peptide) was amplified by using Pfu polymerase and the subcloned full-length cDNA as template. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides used for the PCR reaction were: 5′-TTTTCATATGGCTTCCACTGTCAACTC-3′ (contains an added NdeI restriction site) and 5′-TTTTAGATCTCTTCCTGTTCATATCTTCAAC-3′ (contains an added BglII restriction site). The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and BglII and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of vector pET24a (Novagen). The plasmid was transformed into BL21 DE3 Gold (Stratagene) and grown in LB media at 37 °C until A600 ≈ 0.5 at which time IPTG was added to 0.1 mm. The temperature was lowered to 30 °C, and the culture was shaken at 275 rpm for a further 4 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C until further use. Cells were resuspended in 5 volumes of 7 mm Hepes, 7 mm Mes, 7 mm sodium acetate, 4 mm MgCl2, and 6 Kunitz units per ml of DNase I, pH 7.4, per g of cells and lysed by passage through a French pressure cell with a 104 p.s.i. pressure drop. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a 1.6-ml Poros 20 CM column equilibrated with 7 mm Hepes, 7 mm Mes, 7 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.4 (equilibration buffer). After loading, the column was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer before elution with a linear gradient of 0–600 mm NaCl in equilibration buffer. The resulting desaturase was judged to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE. The resulting enriched desaturase was concentrated and subjected to HPLC size exclusion chromatography with the use of a preparative G-300SW (Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, PA) developed with 20 mm Hepes, 70 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Substrate Specificity and Specific Activity—Desaturase preparations were assayed with [1-14C]16:0-, [1-14C]18:0-, [1-14C]16:1Δ9-, or [1-14C]18:1Δ9-ACP substrates with the use of recombinant spinach ACP-I (28.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Methyl esters of fatty acids were analyzed by argentation TLC, and radioactivity in the products was quantified as previously described (11.Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S. Shanklin J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 18.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11184-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). GC/MS Desaturase Assays—For analysis of double bond positions, assays were performed with the use of unlabeled fatty acid substrates as follows. A typical assay contained ∼1 nmol of purified desaturase that was incubated with 10 nmol of 14:0-, 16:0-, 16:1Δ9-, 18:0-, 18:1Δ9-, or 18:1Δ11-ACP substrates, respectively, in a 5-fold scale up (total reaction volume 750 μl) of the previously described standard 1-14C-labeled reaction mix (28.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) except that bovine serum albumin was omitted to prevent the introduction of additional fatty acids. After incubation the mix was saponified with 0.9 ml of 2.35 m NaOH at 90 °C for 1 h and then neutralized with 2.2 ml of 4 m H2SO4. Free fatty acids were extracted into 3 ml of hexane and dried under a nitrogen stream before esterification in 1 ml of BCl3-methanol at 90 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl fatty acids were extracted into 2 ml of hexane. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters were concentrated by evaporation under a stream of nitrogen before being subjected to GC-MS analysis. Double bond positions were determined as described above (25.Yamamoto K. Shibahara A. Nakayama T. Kajimoto G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 60: 39-50Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26.Andersson B.A. Holman R.T. Lipids. 1973; 9: 185-190Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27.Andersson B.A. Christie W.W. Holman R.T. Lipids. 1974; 10: 215-219Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis was performed by quantitation of TLC data obtained for assays performed with the use of various substrate concentrations as previously reported for the castor desaturase (17.Whittle E. Shanklin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21500-21505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Ivy Desaturase Is a Close Homolog of a Previously Described Δ4-16:0-ACP Desaturase from Coriander—A desaturase cDNA was cloned from a library representing mRNA isolated from developing English ivy seeds that accumulate 16:1Δ4 and 18:1Δ6 fatty acids. A BLAST search of the amino acid sequence of the ivy desaturase identifies a coriander16:1Δ4-ACP desaturase as its closest match (83% amino acid identity) and somewhat lower identity (74%) to archetypal Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturases such as that characterized from castor. A lineup of the sequences of ivy, coriander, and castor enzymes can be seen in Fig. 1. All three sequences are collinear, with ivy and coriander showing a short deletion close to the N terminus and ivy showing a two-residue insertion near the C terminus. The high levels of sequence identity together with the observed collinearity imply that the enzymes share a common three-dimensional fold. We therefore compared the identities of amino acids at positions within the ivy and coriander sequences equivalent to those that had previously been shown to affect substrate specificity in the castor desaturase. We identified sequence changes at positions 117 and 179 (numbered according to the mature castor desaturase sequence (6.Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)) that were previously shown to be important for chain length specificity for the castor desaturase (17.Whittle E. Shanklin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21500-21505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (see residues marked ^ in Fig. 1). The sequence differences T117R and P179I (castor/ivy) previously shown to increase 16-carbon substrate specificity in the castor desaturase along with the similarity of the ivy and coriander sequences suggested that the ivy desaturase is likely a homolog of the coriander Δ4-16:0-ACP desaturase and that further investigation of the ivy desaturase was warranted. Arabidopsis Seed Expressing the Ivy Desaturase Accumulate 16:1Δ4 and 18:1Δ6—Evidence for the involvement of the coriander desaturase in the accumulation of petroselinic acid (18: 1Δ6) was previously provided by its expression in tobacco tissue culture (18.Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11184-11188Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrated that the accumulation of 18:1Δ6 was the result of the coriander enzyme desaturating 16:0 at the Δ4 position followed by elongation to 18:1Δ6. To determine the specificity of the ivy desaturase we placed it under the control of a seed-specific promoter and used Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to introduce the construct into Arabidopsis. GC analysis of methyl esters from transgenic Arabidopsis seeds revealed two new fatty acids corresponding to the expected elution times of the Δ4 and Δ6 isomers of 16:1 and 18:1, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). The 16:1Δ4 and monoene elongation products accumulated a total of ∼4% of total fatty acids in transgenic Arabidopsis seed. Positional analysis of dimethyl disulfide adducts of the two monoenes show fragmentation patterns (215 and 147 atomic mass units for 16:1 and 215 and 175 atomic mass units for 18:1), confirming their identities as 16:1Δ4 and 18:1Δ6, respectively. These data are consistent with a role for the ivy desaturase in petroselinic acid biosynthesis. Expression of Ivy Desaturase in E. coli Resulted in the Accumulation of Active Enzyme—Fig. 3A shows the ivy desaturase accumulates to high levels in E. coli. It remains in solution after clarification by high speed centrifugation and is purified to apparent homogeneity by HPLC cation exchange chromatography followed buy size exclusion chromatography. UV-visible spectroscopy of the purified desaturase reveals the presence of absorption features in the 300–400 nm region, characteristic of ligand-to-metal charge transfer bands arising from the diiron active site (Fig. 3B) (29.Fox B.G. Shanklin J. Somerville C. Munck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2486-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Ivy desaturase expression in a soluble and active form in E. coli is in contrast to the behavior of the coriander Δ4-16:0-ACP desaturase, which resulted in the accumulation of inactive protein (data not shown). Thus, the ivy desaturase represents a Δ4-16:0-ACP desaturase that is amenable to biochemical investigation. It also provides a system to perform comparative structure-function studies on Δ4 and Δ9 desaturation to gain insights into enzymatic control of regiospecificity with respect to saturated substrates. To verify the specificity inferred from in vivo expression experiments, in vitro desaturase reactions were performed with the use of 14C-labeled fatty acyl-ACPs and purified ivy desaturase preparations, in which the products separated by argentation TLC (see Fig. 4). As expected from the seed expression data, 16:0-ACP was converted to a product with mobility corresponding to that expected for 16:1Δ4 (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). GC/MS analysis of the dimethyl disulfide adduct of reaction product methyl ester from assays carried out with (unlabeled) 16:0-ACP (Fig. 5, A–C) confirmed the expected mass ion at 362 atomic mass units and the position of the double bond to be at the Δ4 position (ions at 215 and 147 atomic mass units) (Fig. 5C). We also synthesized the pyrrolidide derivative of the product and subjected it to mass spectral analysis (Fig. 5D) and identified the mass ion of 307 atomic mass units in addition to the diagnostic fragmentation pattern (126/139/152 atomic mass units) previously reported for Δ4 double bond-containing fatty acids (27.Andersson B.A. Christie W.W. Holman R.T. Lipids. 1974; 10: 215-219Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mobility of the desaturation product of 18:0-ACP was consistent with its location at the Δ9 position as confirmed by GC/MS analysis as described above for the 16:1 product (data not shown). In reactions incubated for extended periods of time (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 7), we consistently observed that desaturation of 16:0-ACP gave a single product, whereas desaturation of 18:0-ACP gave two products, one with a mobility indistinguishable from 18:1 formed by the castor desaturase (Fig. 4, band marked M, compare lanes 6 and 7 with lane 8) and a second lower mobility product marked D that is clearly visible in lane 7. We note that, as expected, the well characterized castor 18:0-ACP desaturase converted 18:0 to a single 18:1 product, i.e. without further metabolism even during extended incubations. Below we describe experiments to determine the identity of product D.Fig. 5In vitro conversion of 16:0 to 16:1Δ4 by the ivy desaturase.

https://openalex.org/W2107362928,"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-mediated vascular inflammation is a prominent characteristic of atherogenesis and restenosis. We noted that angioplastic injury to carotid artery elicited two phases of NF-kappaB activation characterized by an early activation in the arterial media and a late activation coupled with high levels of inhibitor of IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity in intima. These findings prompted us to elucidate the role for the different phases of NF-kappaB activation and IKK in the progress of vascular repair. Our results show that blockade of the early NF-kappaB activation by perivascular administration of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate transiently attenuates the expression of proinflammatory genes in the injured vessels but does not affect intimal formation. Interruption of IKKbeta by overexpressing a dominant-negative IKKbeta in the injured artery effectively inhibited the late phase of NF-kappaB activation, resulting in down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression in conjunction with a 36% reduction in intima size, albeit with a lack of inhibitory effect on the early NF-kappaB activation. Collectively, these findings show that the IKKbeta-mediated late-phase NF-kappaB activation contributes to intimal hyperplasia and the accompanied vascular inflammatory responses."

NAD is an essential and ubiquitous coenzyme that plays a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. Besides its direct action on redox equilibrium, it was recently shown to play important roles in DNA repair, calcium-dependent signaling, and life span extension (1Anderson R.M. Bitterman K.J.

NAD biosynthesis is accomplished through either de novo or salvage pathways that differ substantially in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (4Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Mehl R.A. Osterman A. Dorrestein P.

In prokaryotes, the de novo pathway proceeds through a condensation reaction between l-aspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; LAO, l-aspartate oxidase; QS, quinolinate synthase; QA, quinolinate; MIRAS, multiple isomorphous replacement with an anomalous scattering; NA, nicotinic acid; NAPRTase, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; LAO, l-aspartate oxidase; QS, quinolinate synthase; QA, quinolinate; MIRAS, multiple isomorphous replacement with an anomalous scattering; NA, nicotinic acid; NAPRTase, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase.that is catalyzed by two enzymes, l-aspartate oxidase (LAO; nadB gene product), and quinolinate synthase (QS; nadA gene product). LAO catalyzes the oxidation of l-aspartate to iminoaspartate, while QS catalyzes the condensation of iminoaspartate with DHAP to produce quinolinate (QA), which is then converted to NAD via a metabolic sequence common to all organisms. Until now, efforts to understand the catalytic mechanism of QS have been hampered by the chemical instability of iminoaspartate (t½ = 140 s at pH 8.0 and 25 °C) (7Nasu S. Wicks F.D. Gholson R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 626-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It may be that iminoaspartate is directly transferred from LAO to the QS active site (6Rizzi M. Schindelin H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but there is no evidence that QS and LAO function as a multienzyme complex. Moreover, nothing is currently known about the structure of QS. Recently, we observed the presence of LAO in Pyrococcus horikoshii, an anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon (8Sakuraba H. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Yamamoto S. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Ohshima T. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is the first example of the occurrence of LAO either in the Archaea or in obligate anaerobic organisms. In addition to the oxidase reaction, the enzyme catalyzed l-aspartate dehydrogenation in the presence of fumarate. The genes that encode the homologue of all other enzymes involved in the de novo NAD biosynthesis were identified in the P. horikoshii genome. Thus, we proposed that the de novo pathway functions in the organism under anaerobic conditions. To elucidate the entire aspect of the pathway in P. horikoshii, we have undertaken the structural and functional analysis of these gene products (9Sakuraba H. Kanai K. Goda S. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohshima T. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2003; 23: 273-279Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In this study, the crystal structure of QS from P. horikoshii was determined in the presence of malate, a substrate analogue of iminoaspartate. Knowledge of the structure of QS should yield information about the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—The gene encoding QS (open reading frame ID: PH0013, the gene information is available at www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/Top) was amplified by PCR. The following set of oligonucleotide primers was used to amplify the QS gene fragment: one is the primer (5′-GGATGTTCATATGGATTTAGTTGAAGAAATTTTGAGG-3′) containing a unique NdeI restriction site overlapping the 5′ initiation codon, and the other (5′-CCGGATCCTCATTTGCTCATCTCCAGCATTCTT-3′) contained a unique BamHI restriction site proximal to the 3′-end of the termination codon. The chromosomal P. horikoshii DNA was isolated as described (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.23Google Scholar) and used as the template. The amplified 0.9-kb fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated with the expression vector pET11a (Novagen) linearized with NdeI and BamHI to generate pEQS. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL (Stratagene) was transformed with pEQS. The transformants were cultivated at 37 °C in 500 ml of a nutritionally rich medium as described previously (11Sakuraba H. Tsuge H. Shimoya I. Kawakami R. Goda S. Kawarabayasi Y. Katunuma N. Ago H. Miyano M. Ohshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10799-10806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. The induction was carried out by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the medium, and cultivation was continued for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml lysozyme from egg white, and 1 mg/ml DNase I from bovine pancreas), incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and lysed by sonication. The crude extract was heated at 90 °C for 15 min in the presence of 0.2 m Na2SO4 and clarified by centrifugation. The protein was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, after which the resulting protein solution was concentrated to 60 mg/ml by ultrafiltration. Determination of Enzyme Activity—The QS activity was determined by measuring the formation of QA from iminoaspartate and DHAP with high performance liquid chromatography. The iminoaspartate was provided by LAO reaction (12Ceciliani F. Caramori T. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Mortarino M. Galizzi A. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The recombinant P. horikoshii LAO was prepared as described previously (8Sakuraba H. Satomura T. Kawakami R. Yamamoto S. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Ohshima T. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm l-aspartate, 2 mm DHAP, 80 units of catalase, 2.3 μg of P. horikoshii LAO, and 1.5 μg of purified QS in a total volume of 0.4 ml. After incubation for the appropriate time at 50 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μlof0.4 m ice-cold perchloric acid and then neutralized with 60 μl of 0.2 m K2CO3. After leaving on ice for 5 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant solution was passed through a cellulose acetate filter (pore size 0.2 μm, Advantec). An aliquot of each filtrate was subjected to a column (4.6 mm × 15 cm) of TSK gel ODS-120Ts (Tosoh). K2HPO4 (70 mm, pH 2.6) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The effluent from the column was monitored by a UV detector at a wavelength of 254 nm. QS was separated on a column at a retention time of about 9.1 min. Crystallization and Data Collection—Stura Footprint Screens (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) were used to screen for crystallization conditions. Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, in which 2 μl of protein solution (60 mg/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution. Initially, a rodclustered crystal was grown from reagent 1-1 (15% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 600, 0.2 m imidazole malate, pH 5.5), but because this crystal was difficult to reproduce, it was crushed and suspended in the reagent 1-1, and a new drop was inoculated with microseeds from the slurry. After several cycles of seeding, diffraction quality crystals were obtained after 3 days in the presence of 0.2 m imidazole, 0.1 m malate, and 18% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 600 (pH 5.3 at 20 °C). It is noteworthy that no crystals were obtained when malate was removed from the reservoir solution. The crystal belongs to the hexagonal space group P63, with unit cell parameters of a = b = 94.6 Å and c = 62.6 Å and diffracts to 2.0 Å. Before cryo-cooling, crystals were stirred gently in Paratone-N (Hampton Research). We collected all diffraction data at 100 K on beamline BL5 at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using monochromatized radiation at λ = 1.0 Å and an ADSC CCD detector. The data were processed using HKL2000 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Phasing and Refinement—Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in reservoir solution containing 1 mm mercury acetate for 10 h or 1 mm HAuCl4 for 11 h. Phase calculation was carried out using the multiple isomorphous replacement with an anomalous scattering (MIRAS) method using SOLVE (14Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The MIRAS map at 2.1 Å was subjected to maximum likelihood density modification, followed by autotracing using RESOLVE (14Terwilliger T. J.

A malate molecule was clearly visible in both σA-weighted 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc density maps and was included in the latter part of the refinement. The R factor and Rfree values of the final model were 21.7% and 26.8%, respectively (supplemental Table I). The final structure exhibits good geometry without Ramachandran outliers. Molecular graphics figures were created using PyMOL (www.pymol.sourceforge.net/). Enzyme Activity—The predicted amino acids sequence of the P. horikoshii QS showed 35% identity to that reported for the E. coli QS (supplemental Fig. 1) (12Ceciliani F. Caramori T. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Mortarino M. Galizzi A. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The formation of QA from l-aspartate, O2, and DHAP in the presence of the E. coli QS and LAO has been demonstrated (12Ceciliani F. Caramori T. Ronchi S. Tedeschi G. Mortarino M. Galizzi A. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed the determination of QA formed by the P. horikoshii QS and LAO and found that QA is produced in a time-dependent manner within 30 min under the used conditions. The specific activity was estimated to be 2.2 μmol/min/mg. This provides direct proof that the PH0013 gene product is actually QS. Detailed characteristics of the enzyme will be described elsewhere. Overall Structure—QS from P. horikoshii is a monomer comprised of 300 amino acid residues. We found that its overall structure includes a central region plus N- and C-terminal helical segments (α1 and α14, respectively) (Fig. 1a). The central region forms a unique triangular convexo-concave structure that is ∼50 Å along each edge and 20 Å thick and is composed of three analogous domains, which relate to a pseudo-3-fold symmetry and exhibit similar folds (Fig. 2a, Domains 1, 2, and 3): a four-stranded parallel β sheet flanked by two α helices on either side, forming a three-layer (αβα) sandwich. Domain 2 contains two right-handed αβαβ motifs; the first is formed by α5-β5-α6-β6 and the second by α7-β7-α8-β8. The strand order of the β sheet is 6-5-7-8. Domain 3 is formed by α9-β9-α10-β10 and α11-β11-α12-β12 in the same manner as in Domain 2. Domain 1, by contrast, is formed by α13, β1-α2-β2, and α3-β3-α4-β4. In our present model, three surface loops (amino acids 79–90, 165–175, and 257–260), which separate the three domains, plus two residues at the C terminus (amino acids 299 and 300) are disordered and are not visible in electron density maps.Fig. 2The 3-fold repeat of QS. a, structure comparison of the three domains presented with similar orientations. b, superimposed Cα traces of the three domains. Domains 2 (cyan) and 3 (green) are superimposed on Domain 1. The arm extending from Domain 3 to the C terminus is shown in red.

This suggests QS evolved through a process involving two gene duplications. Fig. 2c shows the amino acid alignment of the three repeats, which are related by 20–30% sequence identity. The folds of the three repeats are consistent with one another, except that helix α1 of repeat 1 extends away from the β sheet in Domain 1 (Fig. 2a), and helix α13 presents in an arm extending from Domain 3 to helix α14 at the C terminus to complete the three-layer αβα sandwich of that domain (Fig. 2b). Superposition of the three domains yields root mean square deviations of less than 1.5 Å for 47 equivalent Cα atoms (residues 15–43/53–70 in Domain 1, 103–131/141–158 in Domain 2, and 190–218/226–243 in Domain 3) (Fig. 2b). At the interfaces between adjacent domains, we detected only one to four pairwise interactions based on hydrogen bonding. On the other hand, we found striking hydrophobic interactions around helices α13 and α14: Ile262, Leu264, Ile267, Leu271, and Met274 in helix α13 and its vicinity were buried in a large hydrophobic cluster formed by Ile7 (α1), Leu10 (α1), Ala16 (β1), Ile18 (β1), Val28 (α2), Ile31 (α2), Val52 (β3), Val54 (β3), Ala56 (β3), Val73 (β4), Leu75 (β4), Ile76 (loop), and Pro77 (loop) of Domain 1; and Val280, Ile284, Ala285, Ala288, and Ile292 in helix α14 and its vicinity formed a hydrophobic core with Ile67 (α4) and Leu68 (α4) of Domain 1 and Ala114 (α6) and Ala118 (loop) of Domain 2. With these interactions, the arm extending from Domain 3 to the C terminus appears to fix the three domains and could be essential for formation of the tripartite structure of QS. Structural Homologues—When we searched the structural databases using DALI (18Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar), we found that the structure of the Domain 1 is most closely related to that of the N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide mutase (PurE) monomer (Protein Data Bank entry 1QCZ) (19Mathews I.I. Kappock T.J. Stubbe J. Ealick S.E. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1395-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar), having a Z-score of 6.6 and an root mean square deviation of 2.2 Å over 70 Cα positions. The central domain of PurE consists of a five-stranded parallel β sheet flanked by three α helices on one side and two on the other and adopts a fold akin to the dinucleotide-binding domain found in many nucleotide-binding enzymes (20Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Domains 2 and 3 are most similar to sulfurtransferase (GlpE; Protein Data Bank entry 1GN0) (21Spallarossa A. Donahue J.L. Larson T.J. Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 1117-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which adopts a fold typical of a single α/β rhodanese domain. Still, the overall structure of QS shows no similarity to any known protein structures. By contrast, the degree of sequence conservation among QS homologues is extremely high. Apparently, the unique overall structure of P. horikoshii QS is a common feature of the QS family. Active Site—The active site of QS is located at the interface of the three domains on the concave side of the molecule and is centered on the pseudo-3-fold axis. The active site cavity is ∼10 Å deep with a narrow opening and a wide inner space. The electrostatic potential surface shown in Fig. 1b highlights the negative patches at the bottom of the cavity, which is lined by amino acids from loop 1 (His21, Tyr23), loop 2 (Asp37, Ser38), loop 3 (Tyr109, Asn111), loop 4 (Thr125, Ser126), loop 5 (His196, Glu198), and loop 6 (Ser212, Thr213) (loop numbers in Fig. 2a were used). These residues are completely conserved in all QS homologues listed in the data bases, as well as in the E. coli QS (supplemental Fig. 1). Our initial experimental electron density map showed extra density within the cavity, and after construction and refinement of the peptide chain, a malate molecule could be modeled unambiguously into that density. The map clearly defined the precise orientation of the malate (Fig. 3a): two oxygen atoms from the C-1 carboxylate of malate form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of His21, His196, and Thr213 and the main chain amide proton of Thr213; the oxygen atoms of the C-4 carboxylate are within hydrogen bonding distance of the side chains of Tyr109 and Ser126, the backbone amide protons of Ser38 and Ser126, and a water molecule (W1); and the oxygen atom of the C-2 hydroxyl group is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Tyr109 and His196. With these bonds, the malate is tightly held near the bottom of the cavity (Fig. 1b). Insight into the QS Reaction—The formation of QA from iminoaspartate and DHAP involves the removal of an inorganic phosphate and two water molecules (7Nasu S. Wicks F.D. Gholson R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 626-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling studies previously showed that the phosphate-bearing carbon of DHAP is incorporated into C-4 of QA (22Wicks F.D. Sakakibara S. Gholson R.K. Scott T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 500: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and that in the presence of both QS and LAO the aspartate nitrogen and carbon are incorporated directly into the pyridine ring of QA (23Gross D. Feige A. Stecher R. Zureck A. Schutte H.R. Z. Naturforsch. B. 1965; 20: 1116-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Those results provide definitive information on the direction of approach and orientation of DHAP in the catalytic site. With that information, we were able to estimate the positions of C-1 and C-2 of the bound DHAP and the pyridine ring of QA from the orientation of malate. But we were unable to find a space to accommodate the DHAP phosphate group in our structure nor were we able to model both DHAP and malate bound to a single QS active site. For that reason, we built our model of the catalytic state during the first condensation step of the QS reaction without phosphate (Fig. 3b). Nasu et al. (7Nasu S. Wicks F.D. Gholson R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 626-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed the following reaction mechanism for QS based on the aforementioned labeling studies (Fig. 4, Pathway 1): 1) the electron-withdrawing groups of iminoaspartate facilitate removal of a proton from C-3, and the resulting molecule carries out a nucleophilic attack on C-3 of DHAP accompanied by the elimination of inorganic phosphate; 2) the condensation product formed undergoes a keto-aldo isomerization; and 3) the loss of a proton from the resulting molecule produces an amino aldehyde that undergoes a Schiff-base formation followed by dehydration to produce QA. This mechanism differs substantially from the pathway recently proposed by Begley et al. (4Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Mehl R.A. Osterman A. Dorrestein P. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 103-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, Pathway 2): 1) initially DHAP is isomerized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in a reaction analogous to one catalyzed by triose phosphate isomerase; 2) subsequent imine formation precedes the elimination of phosphate; and 3) electrocyclic ring closure of the resulting molecule followed by tautomerization and dehydration yields QA. The second mechanism certainly requires formation of a condensation product with a phosphate group; thus our binding model without phosphate suggests the first mechanism is more feasible. That mechanism is also in good agreement with the observation that QS does not utilize glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as a three-carbon precursor (24Suzuki N. Carlson J. Griffith G. Gholson R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 304: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). That said, when we placed QS crystals in a reservoir solution containing DHAP, x-ray diffraction quality quickly deteriorated, which could mean that DHAP binding causes a large conformational change in the structure of the enzyme-malate complex. The structure of the tertiary complex with DHAP bound will be the focus of further investigation. It has been suggested that QS is one of the potential targets for the development of novel antibacterial agents (25Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. D'Souza M. Bernal A. Baev M.V. Farrell M. Kurnasov O.V. Daugherty M.D. Mseeh F. Polanuyer B.M. Campbell J.W. Anantha S. Shatalin K.Y. Chowdhury S.A. Fonstein M.Y. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4555-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), as well as LAO (26Bossi R.T. Negri A. Tedeschi G. Mattevi A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3018-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), because the two-step conversion of aspartate to quinolinate is not present in humans, in whom de novo NAD biosynthesis occurs via degradation of tryptophan (5Magni G. Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1999; 73: 135-182PubMed Google Scholar). Besides de novo synthesis of NAD, a salvage pathway exists that enables NAD to be recycled. This pathway usually proceeds via degradation of NAD to nicotinic acid (NA), followed by conversion of NA to nicotinic acid mononucleotide by nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase). Unlike most organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a tubercular pathogen, lacks NAPRTase activity and cannot recycle NA to NAD (27Foster J.W. Moat A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 83-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, analysis of the genome of Helicobacter pylori, a major cause of gastroduodenal disease, showed it to lack NA salvage genes, including that encoding NAPRTase (25Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. D'Souza M. Bernal A. Baev M.V. Farrell M. Kurnasov O.V. Daugherty M.D. Mseeh F. Polanuyer B.M. Campbell J.W. Anantha S. Shatalin K.Y. Chowdhury S.A. Fonstein M.Y. Osterman A.L. J.

https://openalex.org/W2080215841,"This paper presents a study of the role of positive charge in the Pi binding site of Escherichia coli ATP synthase, the enzyme responsible for ATP-driven proton extrusion and ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. Arginine residues are known to occur with high propensity in Pi binding sites of proteins generally and in the Pi binding site of the βE catalytic site of ATP synthase specifically. Removal of natural βArg-246 (βR246A mutant) abrogates Pi binding; restoration of Pi binding was achieved by mutagenesis of either residue βAsn-243 or αPhe-291 to Arg. Both residues are located in the Pi binding site close to βArg-246 in x-ray structures. Insertion of one extra Arg at β-243 or α-291 in presence of βArg-246 retained Pi binding, but insertion of two extra Arg, at both positions simultaneously, abrogated it. Transition state stabilization was measured using phosphate analogs fluoroaluminate and fluoroscandium. Removal of βArg-246 in βR246A caused almost complete loss of transition state stabilization, but partial rescue was achieved in βN243R/βR246A and αF291R/βR246A. βArg-243 or αArg-291 in presence of βArg-246 was less effective; the combination of αF291R/βN243R with natural βArg-246 was just as detrimental as βR246A. The data demonstrate that electrostatic interaction is an important component of initial Pi binding in catalytic site βE and later at the transition state complex. However, since none of the mutants showed significant function in growth tests, ATP-driven proton pumping, or ATPase activity assays, it is apparent that specific stereochemical interactions of catalytic site Arg residues are paramount.

ATP synthase is the terminal enzyme of oxidative phosphorylation and photophosphorylation, which synthesizes ATP from ADP and phosphate (Pi). The energy for ATP synthesis comes from transmembrane movement of protons down an electrochemical gradient, generated by substrate oxidation or by light capture. Initially, as the protons move through the interface between a and c subunits in the membrane-bound F0-sector of the enzyme, the realized energy is transduced into mechanical rotation of a group of subunits (γϵc10-14), which comprise the “rotor”. A helical coiled coil domain of γ projects into the central space of the α3β3 hexagon, in the membrane-extrinsic F1-sector. α3β3 hexagon contains three catalytic sites at α/β interfaces. In a manner that is not yet understood, rotation of γ vis-à-vis the three α/β subunit pairs brings about ATP synthesis at the three catalytic sites using a sequential reaction scheme (1Senior A.E. Weber J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 110-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). “Stator” subunits b2 and δ are present to prevent co-rotation of α3β3 with the rotor.

Recent studies of the rotational mechanism have begun to illuminate which steps in the enzymic pathway of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis are likely coupled to the two substeps (80° and 40°) of subunit rotation and which steps occur in the intervening stationary dwells (12Yasuda R.

While it has not yet been possible to directly correlate the step of Pi binding/release with a specific mechanical event or an intervening dwell, it seems likely that this will soon be achieved. Thus we can foresee that it may be possible in the near future to correlate molecular features of Pi binding, derived from mutational and biochemical studies, with mechanical function in this nanomotor system.Studies of molecular aspects of Pi binding in ATP synthase have been held back by lack of a suitable system to which both mutagenesis and a Pi binding assay were applicable.

X-ray crystal structures of catalytic sites containing the Pi analogs AlF3 (27Braig K. Menz R.I. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) were valuable in suggesting residues within the Pi binding pocket that were suitable targets for mutagenesis. Finally it may be noted that Penefsky (29Penefsky H.S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2250-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) has recently confirmed, using purified [32P]Pi, that Pi binding to E. coli F1 is not detectable by the centrifuge column procedure but that a pressure ultrafiltration method did detect Pi binding, with a Kd(Pi) in the range of 0.1 mm, consistent with data obtained from the NBD-Cl inactivation assay. It is apparent that Pi dissociates more rapidly from E. coli F1 than it does from mitochondrial F1, unfortunately rendering the convenient centrifuge assay inapplicable with the E. coli enzyme.In proteins, arginine residues show the highest propensity for occurrence and functional interaction at Pi binding sites (30Copley R.R. Barton G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 321-329PubMed Google Scholar). Our earlier work established that natural Arg residues at positions α-376, β-182, and β-246 were important for Pi binding in the βE catalytic site of ATP synthase, with the latter playing a key role (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of βArg-246 to Ala, Gln, or Lys abolished Pi binding (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Residue βAsn-243, although totally conserved and located very close to bound Pi, was found to be not directly involved in interacting with Pi. Rather it was found to be necessary for correct organization of the transition state complex (25Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46057-46064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, if Asp was introduced at this position it prevented Pi binding, presumably because it nullified the positive charge of the neighboring βArg-246 (25Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46057-46064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore balance of charge in the Pi binding pocket also appeared important.After binding, Pi must be condensed with MgADP via a chemical transition state, for which a molecular mechanism has been proposed in (3Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 188-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The transition state analog MgADP- AIF4− trapped in catalytic sites has been visualized by x-ray crystallography (28Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and it is clear that the fluoroaluminate group occupies the position of phosphate in the transition state complex. Contribution of different residues to stabilization of the transition state complex can be compared by assay of inhibition of ATPase activity by MgADP-fluoroaluminate (or MgADP-fluoroscandium) in mutant and wild-type enzymes (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 25Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46057-46064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By comparing effects on Pi binding and transition state stabilization one can further infer roles of each potential Pi residue at early and later steps of the catalytic pathway.In this paper we modulated charge within the Pi binding site by introduction of extra Arg at residues β-243 and α-291, both in presence of the natural βArg-246 and in its absence (βR246A mutant). We also combined βArg-243 and αArg-291 with the natural βArg-246 to test effects of excess positive charge. Pi binding and transition state stabilization were assessed in each of the new mutants.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of E. coli Membranes; Measurement of Growth Yield in Limiting Glucose Medium; Assay of ATPase Activity of Membranes; Measurement of Proton Pumping in Membrane Vesicles; SDS-gel Electrophoresis; Immnunoblotting—E. coli membranes were prepared as described previously (31Senior A.E. Langman L. Cox G.B. Gibson F. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It should be noted that this procedure involves three washes of the initial membrane pellets, once in buffer containing 50 mm TES, pH 7.0, 15% glycerol, 40 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mmp-aminobenzamidine, then twice in buffer containing 5 mm TES, pH 7.0, 15% glycerol, 40 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mmp-aminobenzamidine, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA. Prior to the experiments, membranes were washed twice more by resuspension and ultracentrifugation in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgSO4. Growth yield in limiting glucose was measured as described previously (32Senior A.E. Latchney L.R. Ferguson A.M. Wise J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured in 1 ml of assay buffer containing 10 mm NaATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.5 at 37 °C. Reactions were started by addition of membranes and stopped by addition of SDS to 3.3% final concentration. Pi released was assayed as described previously (33Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For wild-type membranes (5-10 μg of protein), reaction times were 2-10 min. For mutant membranes (20-100 μg of protein), reaction times were 30-120 min. All reactions were shown to be linear with time and protein concentration. ATP-driven proton pumping was measured by following the quench of acridine orange fluorescence as described previously (34Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels was as described previously (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205936) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-F1-α and anti-F1-β antibodies was as described previously (36Rao R. Perlin D.S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Densitometry of immunoblots was performed using software from Scion Corp. (Scion Image Release Beta 4.02, www.scioncorp.com/).E. coli Strains—The wild-type strain was pBWU13.4/DK8 (37Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mutant strain βR246A/DK8 was as described previously (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). New mutant strains were constructed as below.Construction of Mutant Strains of E. coli—Mutagenesis was by the method of Vandeyar et al. (38Vandeyar M. Weiner M. Hutton C. Batt C. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For βN243R/βR246A and βN243R mutants, the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was M13mp18 containing the HindIII-XbaI fragment from pSN6. pSN6 is a plasmid containing the βY331W mutation from plasmid pSWM4 (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) introduced on a SacI-EagI fragment into pBWU13.4 (37Ketchum C.J. Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which expresses all the ATP synthase genes. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were as follows: βN243R/βR246A, GCTGTTCGTTGACCGCATCTATGCATACACCCTGGCCG (where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new Nsi1 restriction site); βN243R, GTGTTCGTCGACCGCATCTATCGTTAC (where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new SalI restriction site). DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of mutations and absence of undesired changes in sequence, and the mutations were transferred to pSN6 on SacI-EagI fragments, generating the new plasmids pZA8 (βN243R/βR246A/βY331W) and pZA15 (βN243R/βY331W). Each plasmid was transformed into strain DK8 (39Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a deletion of ATP synthase genes for expression of the mutant enzymes. For αF291R, αF291R/βR246A, and αF291R/βN243R mutants, the template for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was M13mp18 containing the SphI-SalI fragment from pSN6. The mutagenic oligonucleotide for αF291R was: CGGGCGACGTCCGCTACCTCCACTCTCG (where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new Aat2 restriction site). DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of mutations and absence of undesired changes in sequence. The mutation was transferred to pSN6 on a XhoI-PmlI fragemt generating the new plasmid pZA10 (αF291R/βY331W). For new plasmid pZA9 (αF291R/βR246A/βY331W) a XhoI-PmlI fragment was transferred to pZA7 (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For new plasmid pZA16 (αF291R/βN243R/βY331W) a SacI-EagI fragment was transferred from plasmid pZA15 to plasmid pZA10. Each plasmid was transformed into strain DK8 (39Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing a deletion of ATP synthase genes for expression of the mutant enzymes. It may be noted that all of the new mutant strains contained the βY331W mutation, which is valuable for measurement of nucleotide binding parameters (18Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not affect function significantly. While it was not utilized in this work, the Trp mutation was included for possible future use.Inhibition of ATPase Activity by NBD-Cl and Protection by MgADP or Pi—NBD-Cl was prepared as a stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and protected from light. Membranes (0.2-2.0 mg/ml) were reacted with NBD-Cl for 60 min in the dark, at room temperature, in 50 mm Tris/SO4, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgSO4, then 50-μl aliquots were transferred to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer to determine ATPase activity. Where protection from NBD-Cl inhibition by ADP or Pi was determined, membranes were preincubated 60 min with protecting agent at room temperature before addition of NBD-Cl. MgSO4 was present, equimolar with ADP or Pi. Control samples containing the ligand without added NBD-Cl were included. Neither Pi (up to 50 mm) nor MgADP (up to 10 mm) had any inhibitory effect alone. Where reversal of NBD-Cl inhibition by DTT was measured, membranes were first reacted with NBD-Cl (150 μm) for 1 h at room temperature, then DTT (final = 4 mm) was added and incubation continued for 1 h at room temperature before ATPase assay. Control samples without NBD-Cl and/or DTT were incubated for the same times.Inhibition of ATPase Activity by Fluoroaluminate or Fluoroscandium—Membranes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris/SO4, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaADP, and 10 mm NaF at a protein concentration of 0.2-1.0 mg/ml in the presence of AlCl3 or ScCl3 added at varied concentration (see “Results”). 50-μl aliquots were then added to 1 ml of ATPase assay buffer and activity measured as above. It was confirmed in control experiments that no inhibition was seen if MgSO4, NaADP, or NaF was omitted.RESULTSGrowth Properties of New Mutants of E. coli ATP Synthase—A series of mutants was generated to modulate charge in the proximity of residue βArg-246, which was shown earlier to be a key residue for binding of Pi into the catalytic sites on the F1-sector of ATP synthase (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mutation of βArg-246 to Ala abrogates Pi binding (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We introduced Arg at two residues located close to βArg-246, namely βAsn-243 and αPhe-291, to generate the new mutants βN243R, βN243R/βR246A, αF291R, and αF291R/βR246A. These mutants are designed to test the effects of introducing one extra Arg close to βArg-246 and to find out whether loss of βArg-246 can be compensated by introduction of another Arg close by. Mutant αF291R/βN243R tests the effect of having Arg at all three locations: αPhe-291, βAsn-243, and the natural βArg-246.Growth yields on limiting glucose medium and growth on succinate plates are shown in Table I. It was evident that introduction of a new Arg residue at α-291 or β-243 was debilitating either in combination with or in absence of the β246A mutation, although it may be noted that the βR246A mutation alone consistently displayed even lower growth. Similar results were seen in αF291R/βN243R. Therefore oxidative phosphorylation is defective in each of the mutants containing Arg at α-291 or β-243 or both.Table IEffects of mutations on cell growthMutationaWild type, pBWU13.4/DK8; null, pUC118/DK8.

Open table in a new tab SDS-gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting of Membrane Preparations—Previous work (11Ahmad Z. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31505-31513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) had established that Pi binding by mutant and wild-type ATP synthase can be assayed using either membrane preparations or purified F1. For a series of mutants, as studied here, it was more efficient to use membrane preparations. However, the possibility existed that the mutations may have compromised assembly and/or oligomeric stability, leading to membrane preparations with low ATP synthase content. This could account for the low growth yields in Table I. We therefore performed SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting experiments.Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-gels of mutant and wild-type membranes (with purified wild-type F1 as reference) established that all the mutant membrane preparations had bands running at the position of F1-α and F1-β subunits, with similar intensities to the α and β bands seen in wild-type membranes (data not shown). Immunoblotting and densitometry was performed with anti-α subunit and anti-β subunit antibodies (36Rao R. Perlin D.S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments using purified wild-type F1 revealed that the response was linear in the range 0.1-0.4 μg of protein, and further tests showed that 4 μg of wild-type or mutant membrane preparations gave a response that fell within this range. An immunoblot using anti-F1-α subunit is shown in Fig. 1A. Purified F1 (0.1-0.4 μg) is run in lanes 1-3 for reference. Membranes (4 μg) from null mutant strains DK8 and pUC118/DK8 are run in lanes 4 and 5, respectively, and show no α subunit, as expected. Lane 6 shows wild-type membranes, and lanes 7-12 show the mutant membranes. A densitometric scan of each lane is presented in Fig. 1B, using the same numbering system. Wild-type membranes (lane 6) are set arbitrarily at 100 (area under the curve), and the density in other membrane preparations (null, lanes 4 and 5; mutants, lanes 7-12) are presented relative to wild type. Three different experiments gave similar results. It is evident that the mutant membranes were similar in ATP synthase content to wild type. Immunoblotting using anti-F1-β antibody (data not shown) confirmed this conclusion.ATPase Activity and Proton Pumping Activities of Mutant ATP Synthase Enzymes in Membranes—Table II shows the ATPase and proton pumping activities of the mutant ATP synthase enzymes in membranes compared with wild type and with two different null controls. It may be noted that the membrane preparations were washed extensively before assay. Data from the null controls showed that this removed virtually all contaminating ATPase activity. The following conclusions are evident. First, insertion of one or two new Arg residues close to the Pi binding site (αF291R, βN243R, αF291R/βN243R) in otherwise wild-type background (i.e. with βArg-246) reduced membrane ATPase activity to a very low level. ATPase activities were far too low to support ATP-driven proton pumping. Second, insertion of βArg-243 in presence of βAla-246 (βN243R/βR246A) did not restore ATPase activity. Third, insertion of αArg-291 in presence of βAla-246 (αF291R/βR246A) did significantly restore ATPase activity (by 10-fold over βR246A alone), and in this case there was detectable, although low, ATP-driven proton pumping. It is apparent that the effects seen on ATPase and proton pumping are consistent with growth characteristics described in Table I; in the case of αF291R/βR246A the partial “rescue” of βR246A was apparently not substantial enough to translate into significant growth.Table IIATPase activity and proton pumping in mutant membranesMutationATPase activityaMeasured at 37 °C"

Here we describe and characterize a novel enzyme, CYP3A7.1L, encompassing the CYP3A7.1 protein with the last four carboxyl-terminal amino acids replaced by a unique sequence of 36 amino acids, generated by splicing of CYP3A7 with CYP3AP1 RNA. The corresponding CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA had a significant expression in liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract, and its presence was found to be tissue-specific and dependent on the developmental stage. Heterologous expression in yeast revealed that CYP3A7.1L was a functional enzyme with a specific activity similar to that of CYP3A7.1 and, in some conditions, a different hydroxylation specificity than CYP3A7.1 using dehydroepiandrosterone as a substrate. CYP3A7.1L was found to be polymorphic due to a mutation at position -6 of the first splicing site of CYP3AP1 (CYP3A7_39256T→A), which abrogates the pseudogene splicing. This polymorphism had pronounced interethnic differences and was in linkage disequilibrium with other functional polymorphisms described in the CYP3A locus: CYP3A7*2 and CYP3A5*1. Therefore, the resulting CYP3A haplotypes express different sets of enzymes within the population. In conclusion, a novel mechanism, consisting of the splicing of the pseudogene CYP3AP1 to CYP3A7, causes the formation of the novel CYP3A7.1L having a different tissue distribution and functional properties than the parent CYP3A7 enzyme, with possible developmental, physiological, and toxicological consequences.

The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P450; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; GC/MS, gas chromatography mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. of families 1–3 are the most prominent enzymes catalyzing the biotransformation of exogenous compounds in the liver and have a major role in drug metabolism. The CYP3A subfamily has a special relevance because CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 metabolize a large number of therapeutic drugs and are the most abundant CYPs in fetal and adult liver, respectively. The human CYP3A locus is located on chromosome 7q21-q22.1 and contains four genes, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43, and three pseudogenes, CYP3AP1, CYP3AP2, and CYP3AP3 (1.Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 2.Gellner K. Eiselt R. Hustert E. Arnold H. Koch I. Haberl M. Deglmann C.J. Burk O. Buntefuss D.

The CYP3A genes were acquired by gene duplications and divergence of the proteins during evolution, generating enzymes with different functions and expression patterns. The pseudogenes probably represent recombination events followed by deletions resulting in a non-functional combination of exons: exons 1, 2, and 13 (CYP3AP1), exons 1 and 2 (CYP3AP2), and exon 1 (CYP3AP3) (1.Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Developmental- and tissue-specific mechanisms regulate the expression of the CYP3A enzymes. Among adults, CYP3A4 is the dominant CYP in liver and intestines, being involved in the metabolism of more than 50% of currently used therapeutic drugs (3.Bertz R.J. Granneman G.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1997; 32: 210-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). CYP3A5 can be present at relevant levels in both fetal and adult liver, although in a polymorphic manner (4.Kuehl P.

Genet. 2001; 27: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). The low expression of CYP3A43 and improper folding in mammalian systems rule out any significant contribution of this enzyme to CYP3A activity (5.Westlind A. Malmebo S. Johansson I. Otter C.

The important role of CYP3A7 in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, added to the fact that most drug-metabolizing P450 genes are not expressed during fetal stages, results in a well conserved gene with few allelic variants (18.Rodriguez-Antona C. Rane A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 77: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, the adult liver contains multiple CYPs with different substrate specificities to facilitate the metabolism and elimination of a wide range of compounds. Here we describe a mechanism that generates a novel CYP3A7 enzyme (CYP3A7.1L) by splicing between the pseudogene CYP3AP1 and CYP3A7. The novel mRNA, containing 13 exons of CYP3A7 and 2 additional exons from CYP3AP1 at the 3′ end (CYP3A7-3AP1, GenBank™ accession number AF315325) (1.Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), is found at relevant amounts in several tissues and encodes a functional enzyme. Materials—Protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Applied Science. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, glucose, galactose, and NADPH were purchased from Sigma. [1,2,6,7-3H(N)]DHEA (specific activity 74Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Liver Tissue—A panel of 9 fetal and 15 adult human liver pieces frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C was used to isolate total RNA and genomic DNA and to prepare microsomes by subcellular fractionation. Fetal human liver pieces were obtained from legal abortions on sociomedical indications. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. The characteristics of the adult livers and the data concerning gestational ages of the fetal livers have been described previously (18.Rodriguez-Antona C. Rane A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 77: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19.Westlind A. Lofberg L. Tindberg N. Andersson T.B. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Human liver microsomes were prepared by subcellular fractionation as described elsewhere (20.Ernster L. Siekevitz P. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1962; 15: 541Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the 15 human adult livers and from the 9 fetal human livers using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an oligo(dT14) primer. Quantitative real-time PCR assay was carried out with the ABI Prism 7700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and using the SyberGreen PCR master mix (PE Applied Biosystems). The following primers were used: CYP3A7, forward 5′-CTATGATACTGTGCTACAGT-3′ and reverse 5′-TCAGGCTCCACTTACGGTCT-3′ primers; CYP3A7-3AP1, forward 5′-TGTAGATATGGAGCCCATT-3′ and reverse 5′-GTCTCTGGTGTTCTAGGT-3′ primers; β-actin, forward 5′-CGTACCACTGGCATCGTGAT-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTGCG-3′ primers. Aliquots of the PCR reactions were subjected to electrophoresis for size and purity confirmation. Standard curves were constructed with serial 10-fold dilutions of an accurately determined concentration of a DNA fragment containing the cDNA of interest. Normalization for variation in reverse transcriptase efficiency and small differences in the amount of RNA added to each reaction was carried out with the internal standard β-actin. Sequencing of CYP3AP1 and Genotyping—The region of CYP3AP1 with high similarity to CYP3A7 intron 1-exon 2 was analyzed by direct sequencing using forward 5′-TCAGTGACTTACCAGCCCCC-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCAACTGAGGCAAACCTGA-3′ primers and the ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit and analyzed on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A T → A change in CYP3AP1 (CYP3A7_39256 T→A, the number indicating the position of the polymorphism with respect to the CYP3A7 translational start site in the GenBank™ reference sequence AF280107, was detected in the two fetal livers that did not have CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA. A method for genotyping CYP3A7_39256 A was set up using the primer pair: forward 5′-TCAGTGACTTACCAGCCCCC-3′ and reverse 5′-TTCAACTGAGGCAAACCTGA-3′ in a PCR reaction starting with 1 min at 95 °C followed by 36 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 40 s at 72 °C, and a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C and amplification of a 369-bp DNA fragment. This PCR product was diluted 100 times and served as a template for a subsequent PCR reaction that introduced a RcaI restriction site in the A-allele (CYP3A7_39256 A) using 5′-TCTATAAAGTCACAATCCCTGAGACCTGATTCATG-3′ forward primer, with the two mismatches introduced underlined, and 5′-GCCAAAGAGTGAGCTCAAAAA-3′ reverse primer. These primers amplified a 170-bp DNA by a PCR of 1 min at 95 °C followed by 27 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 55 °C, 40 s at 72 °C, and a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. Ten μl of this PCR fragment were incubated with RcaI overnight at 37 °C and separated by electrophoresis in a 3% high resolution agarose gel. The CYP3A7_39256 T allele resulted in the 170-bp undigested PCR fragment, whereas CYP3A7_39256 A resulted in two DNA fragments of 136 and 34 bp. Genotyping of CYP3A7*2 was performed as described previously (18.Rodriguez-Antona C. Rane A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 77: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Subjects—Allelic frequencies were determined using genomic DNA from unrelated individuals from different populations. Sixty-five volunteers from the Zaragoza area in the north of Spain (21.Bernal M.L. Sinues B. Johansson I. McLellan R.A. Wennerholm A. Dahl M.L. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Bertilsson L.

The genomic DNA was isolated from blood except for the Swedish population where it was extracted from liver samples using the QIAamp tissue kit (Qiagen). The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet. CYP3A7-3AP1 Expression Pattern Analysis—cDNAs from different tissues were obtained from BD Biosciences (human MTC panel I and II, human fetal MTC panel, and human digestive system MTC panel) and were subjected to PCR amplification using the primers CYP3A7, 5′-TTCCAAGCTATGTTCTTCAT-3′ and 5′-CATTTCAGGGTTCTATTTGT-3′ and CYP3A7-3AP1, 5′-TGTAGATATGGAGCCCATT-3′ and 5′-GTCTCTGGTGTTCTAGGT-3′ with 1 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 40 s at 72 °C, and a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. Heterologous Expression of CY3A7.1 and CYP3A7.1L in Yeast—Full-length CYP3A7 and CYP3A7-3AP1 coding regions were PCR-amplified from human liver cDNA using Elongase (Invitrogen). The forward primer was the same for CYP3A7 and CYP3A7-3AP1:5′-AAGGGGATCCAAAATGGATCTCATCCCAAACTTGGCCG-3′ and introduced three A residues in front of the translation start to increase the expression efficiency in yeast (24.Krynetski E.Y. Drutsa V. Kovaleva I.E. Luzikov V.N. Pharmacogenetics. 1995; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and a BamHI site at the 5′ end. The reverse primers contained a KpnI site at the 5′ end: CYP3A7, 5′-CTTAGGTACCTCAGGCTCCACTTACGGTCT-3′ and CYP3A7-3AP1, 5′-AAGCGGTACCTCAGCGGGATCTGATGGTAG-3′. The underlined nucleotides correspond to the restriction enzyme sites. After double digestion of the amplified DNA with BamHI/KpnI, the fragments were cloned into the pYeDP60 expression vector (25.Urban P. Cullin C. Pompon D. Biochimie. (Paris). 1990; 72: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Plasmids from positive transformed bacterial colonies were isolated, and the sequence of the insert was examined using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W(R) was constructed by substitution of the natural promoter of the cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR1) gene by the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressed promoter GAL10-CYC1 in the strain W303-1B: MATa ade2-1 his3-11-15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1 (26.Truan G. Cullin C. Reisdorf P. Urban P. Pompon D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27.Bellamine A. Gautier J.C. Urban P. Pompon D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the strain INVSc1-HR: MAT a his3Δ1 leu2 trp1-289 ura3-52 (pFL-35 human reductase) expressing human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was a gift from the LINK project (a program of the University of Dundee/Biotechnology and Biology Research Council/Department of Trade and Industry/Pharmaceutical Industry). Both strains W(R) and INVSc1-HR were used to express CYP3A7.1 and CYP3A7.1L, essentially as described elsewhere (26.Truan G. Cullin C. Reisdorf P. Urban P. Pompon D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28.Bylund J. Hidestrand M. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, the yeast cells were transformed with the pYeDP60 expression vectors containing a galactose-inducible promoter in front of the cDNA encoding CYP3A7.1 or CYP3A7.1L. To achieve high expression levels, the yeast cells were grown to high density with glucose as the main energy source; thereafter, galactose was added to induce expression. After expression, the cells were harvested and mechanically disrupted as described previously (28.Bylund J. Hidestrand M. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21844-21849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Microsomes containing the recombinant enzyme were thereafter prepared by differential centrifugation (20,000 × g for 10 min plus 100,000 × g for 60 min), and protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (29.Bradford M.M. Cell. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Production of active CYP3A7.1L in W(R) cells proved to be difficult, and different growth and induction conditions were tested. A successful CYP3A7.1L overexpression was achieved at 28 °C and 7 h of galactose induction. The W(R) data in Table II was generated using this preparation of CYP3A7.1L and the parallel preparations for CYP3A7.1 and control yeast transformed with empty vector.Table IICatalytic activity of CYP3A7.1 and CYP3A7.1L expressed in different yeast strains after incubation with DHEAYeast strainaThe S. cerevisiae strains used for heterologous expression are described under “Experimental Procedures.” W(R) overexpress the yeast NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, and INVSc1-HR overexpress the human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductaseCYP3A7.1 expr. levelCYP3A7.1 activity (DHEA hydroxylation)bDHEA hydroxylation is expressed as pmol of metabolite/min/nmol P450.

Both antibodies, A254 and 458223, recognize CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A7.1L (this latter, according to our data using heterologous expression systems). A254 is a monoclonal antibody, and 458223 is polyclonal antibody produced by using rat CYP3A2 as immunogen. After washing, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody, and the proteins were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence method (Pierce) and scanned using LAS-1000 (Fujifilm, Dusseldorf, Germany). The relative intensity of each band as determined by Image Gauge V3.6. The CYP3A7.1 and CYP3A7.1L content was determined from standard curves derived from a microsomal sample quantified with respect to the apo-CYP3A7 content determined by peptide-specific antibody and peptide-conjugated lysozyme, kindly provided by Robert J.

Dehydroepiandrosterone Hydroxylation Assay and Identification of Metabolites—Measurements of DHEA activity were performed in a final volume of 0.5 ml with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 15–70 nm [3H]DHEA and between 250 and 500 μg of yeast microsomal protein. The reaction mixtures were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 2 mm. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30–60 min and stopped by the addition of 5 ml of dichloromethane, and the extraction of the metabolites was carried out by vortexing for 20 min, 10 min of centrifugation at 5000 × g, and separation and drying of the organic phase under a stream of N2 gas. Dried extracts were dissolved in 100 μl of mobile phase and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A 5 μm 4 × 250 mm LiChrospher-100 RP-18 column (Merck) using a 64:36 methanol:H2O (v/v) isocratic mobile phase was used to separate the hydroxylated products. Radioactive peaks were detected by an in-line Berthold radioactivity monitor LB506C-1, and a Berthold LB5035 pump was used for the scintillation liquid at a 1.5 ml/min flow rate (Quicksafe Flow 2, Zinsser Analytic). Values greater that 0.1 pmol of metabolite were accurately detected with this method. Linearity with protein and time was observed for the production of DHEA metabolites. It should be noted that the 3H label in position C-7 of DHEA will result a somewhat diminished signal of the 7-hydroxylated metabolites. For identification of the DHEA metabolites by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), corresponding incubation mixtures contained 50–150 μm unlabeled DHEA, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of FOLCH solution (CHCl3:MeOH, 2:1). After vortexing, the organic phase was collected and dried under a gentle stream of N2. The residue was then dissolved in 3 ml of methanol followed by the addition of 2 ml of water. The solution was passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge containing octadecylsilane-bonded silica (Waters Associates Inc., Milford, MA) followed by 5 ml of water. The total effluent was collected, and the organic solvent was removed in vacuo. The remaining aqueous phase was then passed through the same unwashed Sep-Pak C18 cartridge again, prior to a wash with 5 ml of water. Steroids were then eluted with 10 ml of 75% aqueous methanol. This solution was passed through a column (40 × 4 mm) of the strong lipophilic anion exchanger, triethylaminohydroxypropyl Sephadex LH-20, in bicarbonate form (30.Axelson M. Ellis E. Mörk B. Garmark K. Abrahamsson A. Björkhem I. Ericzon B.G. Einarsson C. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After elution with an additional 5 ml of methanol, the total effluent from the column was taken to dryness in vacuo. The residue was then transferred with methanol to a stoppered tube and dried under N2, and steroids were trimethylsilylated in 0.2 ml of pyridine/hexamethyldisilazane/trimethylchlorosilane, 3:2:1 (by volume), by heating at 60 °C for 30 min. The reagents were removed under N2, and the derivatives were redissolved in 50 μl of hexane. GC/MS was performed using a Finnigan SSQ 710 instrument housing a fused silica column (25 m × 0.32 mm) coated with a 0.17-μm layer of cross-linked methyl silicone (Ultra 1, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) ending in the ion source. An on-column injection device was used. The oven temperature was 50 °C during the injection and, after 3 min, it was rapidly increased to 185 °C and then programmed to 280 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. The electron energy was 50 eV, and repetitive scanning (30 scans/min) over the m/z range of 50–800 was started after a suitable delay. The identification of a steroid was based on the retention time and complete mass spectrum, which were compared with those of the authentic steroid. The retention indices (Kovats) for DHEA, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxy-DHEA, and 16α-hydroxy-DHEA were 2515, 2590, 2670, and 2725, respectively, and mass spectra of the two 7-hydroxylated DHEA metabolites showed one intense ion (m/z 358, molecular ion minus 90), whereas the major significant ions in the spectrum of 16α-hydroxy-DHEA were m/z 448 (molecular ion), 304, 214, and 129. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using GraphPad InStat version 3.00 for Windows 95, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. Statistical analysis was done by the Mann-Whitney test. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences were considered significant when p values were less than 0.05. Expression of CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA in Human Liver—To search for polymorphic variants, a forward primer corresponding to CYP3A4/3A7 exon 12 and a reverse primer in the 3′-untranslated region CYP3A4 were designed to amplify CYP3A4 cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR in a panel of 15 adult and 9 fetal human livers. However, a DNA fragment of a different molecular weight was unexpectedly amplified. Sequencing of this DNA revealed that it was a CYP3A7 splicing variant that consisted of two fragments of the pseudogene CYP3AP1, which are highly similar to exons 2 and 13 of CYP3A7, joined to CYP3A7 RNA at exon 13 in an alternative splice site, similarly to the one described by Finta and Zaphiropoulos (1.Finta C. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 260: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). All exons of this novel transcript are flanked by canonical splicing sites, which strongly suggests that it is the result of an RNA splicing event. CYP3A7, similarly to the other CYP3A genes, contains 13 exons, whereas the novel CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA contains 15 exons, resulting in a longer CYP3A7 protein (CYP3A7.1L). The translational stop codon is located seven nucleotides downstream in the last exon from the pseudogene. In addition, the reading frame of the pseudogene regions is shifted, and the last four amino acids of CYP3A7 are replaced by a unique 36-amino-acid sequence (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 2, the expression levels of CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA, as determined by a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR technique, was higher in fetal than in adult livers, with the exception of two fetal samples (FL61 and FL65) having extremely low CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA levels. Using two CYP3A-specific antibodies, CYP3A7.1L was detected by Western blotting in liver samples with CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A, inset; FL65, which lacks CYP3A7.1L, is used as a negative control). To explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the alternative splicing, CYP3A7 mRNA levels were measured and compared with the expression of CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA. The correlation between CYP3A7-3AP1 and CYP3A7 mRNA of 22 livers, all with exception of FL61 and FL65, was high (r2 = 0.94; r = 0.97; p < 0.00001). On average, the CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA levels were 1% of those of CYP3A7 mRNA, but substantial differences were noted between fetal and adult livers, with mean ratios of 0.5 and 1.2%, respectively, indicating that the splicing of the pseudogene was favored in the adult livers. Interestingly, the two fetal livers with extremely low CYP3A7-3AP1 mRNA expression (FL61 and FL65) had intermediate to high expression of CYP3A7 mRNA, suggesting a genetic defect preventing the splicing of CYP3A"
https://openalex.org/W2040947758,"Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is a serine protease that catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. The plasminogen/plasmin system includes the uPA, its receptor, and its inhibitor (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Interactions between these molecules regulate cellular proteolysis as well as adhesion, cellular proliferation, and migration, processes germane to the pathogenesis of lung injury and neoplasia. In previous studies, we found that uPA regulates cell surface fibrinolysis by regulating its own expression as well as that of the uPA receptor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In this study, we found that uPA alters expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in Beas2B airway epithelial cells in both a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These effects do not require uPA catalytic activity because the amino-terminal fragment of uPA lacking catalytic activity was as potent as two chain active uPA. Single chain uPA also enhanced p53 expression to the same extent as intact two chain active uPA and the amino-terminal fragment. Pretreatment of cells with anti-β1 integrin antibody blocked uPA-induced p53 expression. uPA-induced p53 expression occurs without increased p53 mRNA expression. However, uPA induced oncoprotein MDM2 in a concentration-dependent manner. uPA-induced p53 expression does not require activation of tyrosine kinases. Inactivation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 inhibits both basal and uPA-induced p53 expression. Plasmin did not alter uPA-mediated p53 expression. The induction of p53 expression by exposure of lung epithelial cells to uPA is a newly recognized pathway by which urokinase may influence the proliferation of lung epithelial cells. This pathway could regulate pathophysiologic alterations of p53 expression in the setting of lung inflammation or neoplasia.

Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), and is implicated in stromal remodeling that may occur in either lung inflammation or neoplasia. Pathologic overexpression of uPA has been linked to a wide range of inflammatory and neoplastic lung diseases (4Sprengers E.D. Kluft C.

For example, high levels of uPA as well as PAI-1 and uPAR in lung tumor tissue correlate with poor prognosis (6Soff G.A. Sanderowitz V. Gately S. Verrusio E. Weiss I. Brem S. Kwaan H.C. J. Clin.

Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In certain tumors, neoplastic growth can be effectively attenuated by PAI-1, presumably through its interaction with uPA (18Seiffert D. Wagner N.N. Luskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to its proteolytic properties, recent data from our laboratory has demonstrated that uPA enhanced expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in Beas2B cells (19Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol.

Elaboration of these molecules influences two major features associated with lung neoplasia, including excessive proliferation of neoplastic cells and their capacity to invade normal tissues. It is now clear that the pathogenesis of lung neoplasia prominently involves expression of tumor suppressor protein p53 (22Greenbaltt P. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C.

Among the plethora of potentially useful markers of tumor virulence that have been identified to date, both uPA and p53 appear to be promising (24Lane D. N. Engl. J.

The prognostic value of uPA and p53 accumulation has been reported in primary breast cancer patients (8Kirchheimer J.C. Wojta J. Christ G. Binder B.R. Eur. J.

However, no direct relationship between tumor suppression and extracellular matrix degradation has been established to date. Stimulation of the lung epithelium by uPA elicits proliferative responses via signaling mechanisms that are incompletely characterized at present. Expression of growth factor activity has been attributed to uPA stimulation and suggests activation of such signaling processes (8Kirchheimer J.C. Wojta J. Christ G. Binder B.R. Eur. J.

Reich R. Miskin R. Mol. Cell.

We now report a new paradigm by which p53 expression by lung epithelial cells is regulated by uPA. We also characterize the responsible mechanism. This pathway could influence alveolar p53 expression and thereby modulate uPA-mediated responses of lung epithelial cells in lung injury or neoplasia. Materials—Culture media, penicillin, streptomycin, and fetal calf serum were purchased from Invitrogen; tissue culture plastics were from Discovery Labware. Herbimycin A, genistein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin, Tris base, aprotinin, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, silver nitrate, ammonium persulfate, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were from Sigma. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and nitrocellulose were from Bio-Rad. Recombinant high molecular weight two chain (HMW) uPA was a generous gift from Drs. Jack Henkin from Abbott. The low molecular weight (LMW) amino-terminal fragment (ATF), anti-uPA, and anti-uPAR antibodies were obtained from American Diagnostics (Greenwich, CT). Anti-integrin antibodies were from Calbiochem. Anti-p53 and anti-MDM2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphoserine 15 and serine 20-p53 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Å5 and B428 compounds were from Angstrom Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). XAR x-ray film was purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Cell Cultures—Human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas2B) were obtained from the ATCC. These cells were maintained in LHC-9 or RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% antibiotics as described previously (19Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of human small airway epithelial (SAE) cells were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego) and cultured in the same media, as described previously (19Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Total Protein Extraction and Western Blotting—Cells were grown to confluence and were serum-starved overnight with RPMI 1640 media. The cells were then treated with or without recombinant human two chain uPA or other agents for selected times in serum-free media supplemented with 0.5% BSA. Following these treatments, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 15% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3-10 μg of aprotinin per 100 ml). The cell lysates were prepared using three cycles of freezing and thawing. Proteins from Beas2B cell lysates (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% BSA in wash buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight hybridization with anti-p53 monoclonal antibody in the same buffer at 4 °C and washed, and p53-immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The membranes were stripped with β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to Western blotting with a β-actin monoclonal antibody. Overexpression of uPA, Transfection of Beas2B Cells with uPA cDNA—uPA cDNA (28Axelrod J.H. Reich R. Miskin R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was subcloned to eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV2 (Invitrogen) containing the CMV promoter at HindIII/NotI sites. The orientations and sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Beas2B cells were transfected with the prepared plasmid constructs by lipofection using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Stable cell lines were created by treating Beas2B cells with neomycin over 3 months. Cells carrying plasmid DNA that survived neomycin treatment were scraped from 6-well plates and grown in T75 flasks, and the presence of plasmid DNA was confirmed by PCR using specific primers. The overexpression of uPA by cDNA-transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting of Beas2B cell lysates as well as conditioned media using a uPA monoclonal antibody. The effect of endogenous uPA overexpression on p53 induction was then measured by Western blot, as described above (19Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Expression—The catalytically inactive mutants of SHP-1 and SHP-2, designated SHP (C-S) and SHP-2 (C-S), were prepared as described previously (29You M. Zhao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23376-23381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Zhao Z. Tan S. J Wright H. Diltz C.D. Shen S.H. Krebs E.G. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11765-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding SHP-1 (C-S) and SHP-2 (C-S) were inserted into adenovirus transfer vector pACCMV.pLpA (31Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenovirus was generated by co-transfection of 293 cells with pACCMV.pLpA construct and pJM17 adenovirus genome DNA with ubiquitin-activating enzyme and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase deletions by using FuGENE 6 cell transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). The resulting recombinant viral clones were purified by soft agar plaque assay and then amplified in 293 cells according to a standard procedure (31Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected based on expression of SHP-1 (C-S) and SHP-2 (C-S) in infected 293 cells. Subconfluent cells were infected with the above replication-defective recombinant or control vector cDNA containing adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10-20 plaque-forming units/cell for 36 h. The cells were later treated with phosphate-buffered saline or 50 ng/ml uPA for 24 h. The total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for p53 as well as phospho-SHP-2 and total SHP-2 expression by Western blot as described above. To further confirm that SHP-2 regulates p53 expression, in a separate experiment SHP-2 cDNA was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1. The Beas2B cells were transfected with vector cDNA or vector DNA containing SHP-2 cDNA using Lipofectamine, and stable cell lines were created by treating Beas2B cells with neomycin over 3 months as described above. The effect of SHP-2 overexpression on p53 induction was confirmed by Western blot. Plasmid Construction—Plasmid p53/pGEM was obtained by PCR amplification of a human lung cDNA library. The cDNA corresponding to the coding region (0.5 kb) was subcloned to pGEMR-T vector (Promega), and the sequence of the clones was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The p53 insert was released by NcoI and PstI, purified on 1% agarose gels, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and used as a cDNA probe for Northern blotting. Random Priming of p53 cDNA—The cDNA template of p53 was released with NcoI/PstI, purified on 1% agarose gels, and labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Rediprime labeling kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Passage through a Sephadex G-25 column removed unincorporated radioactivity. The specific activity of the product was 6-7 × 108 cpm/μg. p53 mRNA Assessment by Northern Blotting—Northern blotting was used to assess the level of p53 mRNA. Confluent Beas2B cells were serum-starved overnight in RPMI/BSA media and treated with two chain human recombinant uPA for varying times (0-24 h) in the same media. Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent, and RNA (20 μg) was separated on agarose/formaldehyde gels. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to Hybond N+ according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Prehybridization and hybridization were done at 65 °C in NaCl (1 m), SDS (1%) and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed with p53 cDNA probes (1 ng/ml) labeled to ∼6-7 × 108 cpm/μg of DNA overnight. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice for 15 min at 65 °C with 2× SSC, 1% SDS, 1× SSC, 1% SDS, and 0.1% SSC, 1% SDS, respectively. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film at -70 °C overnight. The intensity of the bands was measured by densitometry and normalized against that of β-actin. Assessment of Apoptosis—In order to determine whether uPA induces apoptosis, we treated Beas2B cells with varying concentrations (0-1000 ng/ml) of uPA. The cells were assayed for internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and laddering using the isolation reagents (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The isolated DNA was size-fractionated by gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide. Alternatively, we also determined the programmed cell death by measuring the annexin V-phosphatidylserine interaction using BD ApoAlert kit (BD Biosciences) followed by flow cytometry analysis as described by the manufacturer. DNA Synthesis—Beas2B cells treated with or without tcuPA for 48 h were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 8 h. After labeling, cells were washed once with cold 15% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid followed by four subsequent washes with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The cells were lysed, and cell associated radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Time- and Concentration-dependent Induction of p53 by uPA—We found previously that lung carcinoma-derived cells differentially express uPA in vitro (25Shetty S. Idell S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13771-13779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because uPA induces its own expression in Beas2B cells (20Shetty S. Penduthiri U. Halady P.K.S. Azghani A. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L319-L328Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we initially sought to determine whether uPA regulates p53 expression in Beas2B cells, a nonmalignant lung epithelial cell line. We therefore treated these cells with the high molecular weight, two chain form of uPA for varying lengths (0-24 h) of time. Total proteins from cell lysates were used for Western blotting by using an anti-p53 antibody. To our surprise, uPA, instead of inhibiting p53 expression, induced expression in Beas2B cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). The induction is detectable by 30 min after the addition of uPA and increases modestly for up to 24 h. Identical uPA treatment also induced p53 expression in primary SAE cells (Fig. 1b). We next treated Beas2B cells with varying amounts (0-1000 ng/ml (0-20 nm)) of uPA for 24 h and then measured p53 expression by Western blotting. The data shown in Fig. 1c indicate that uPA induced p53 expression by Beas2B cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect is apparent at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml (0.2 nm). Maximum p53 expression was observed at a uPA concentration of 1 nm. At higher uPA concentrations beyond 5 nm, uPA inhibited p53 expression in Beas2B cells. To rule out that contaminating lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the high molecular weight uPA (HMW uPA) preparation we used was responsible for the induction of p53, we measured the LPS content of this preparation by the Limulus amebocyte lysate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. We found that this HMW uPA preparation contains very negligible amounts (about 1 pg/ml) of LPS, making it unlikely that LPS could be responsible for the induction of p53 in these experiments. Induction of p53 by Endogenous uPA—To confirm independently that the LPS content of the HMW uPA preparation did not account for the induction of p53, we next prepared uPA-overproducing Beas2B cells and vector-containing controls by transfecting these cells with the eukaryotic expression vector pRc/CMV2 containing uPA cDNA or pRc/CMV2 cDNA using lipofection. We analyzed the p53 expression of the stable cell lines by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, Beas2B cells transfected with uPA cDNA expressed 3.5-fold more p53 in comparison to vector-transfected or nontransfected control cells. We also found a comparable increase in p53 protein expression by uPA cDNA-transfected cells compared with vector cDNA or nontransfected control cells by metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Induction of p53 mRNA Expression by uPA in Lung Epithelial Cells—By having determined that uPA mediates time-dependent p53 protein expression in Beas2B cell, we next sought to evaluate whether the increased expression of p53 was attributable to an increased level of P53 mRNA. We measured the steady state levels of p53 mRNA in uPA-treated Beas2B cells by Northern blotting using a p53 cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 3, uPA failed to induce p53 mRNA in Beas2B cells. These data demonstrate that uPA increases p53 protein expression by Beas2B cells, as determined by Western blotting without altering expression of p53 mRNA. Effect of uPA on Phosphorylation of p53 and MDM2 Expression—Because uPA did not induce p53 mRNA expression and p53 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites both in vitro and in vivo (32Meek D.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar, 33Milczarek G.J. Martinez J. Bowden G.T. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), we asked whether uPA regulates p53 expression through phosphorylation at serine 15 and 20 on p53, which leads to reduced interaction with its negative regulator oncoprotein MDM2 (34Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with varying amounts of uPA (0-1000 ng/ml) for 24 h at 37 °C, and we analyzed the cell lysates for phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-20 by Western blotting using phosphospecific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4a, uPA (50 ng/ml; 1 nm) induced Ser-15 phosphorylation. However, at higher concentrations beyond 250 ng/ml (5 nm), uPA failed to induce Ser-15 phosphorylation. uPA did not induce Ser-20 phosphorylation to any significant extent in Beas2B cells. We next treated Bas2B cells with uPA (50 ng/ml) for 0-24 h and analyzed for the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, and we found that uPA induced Ser-15 phosphorylation as early as 10 min after the treatment, and this elevated level was maintained up to 24 h (Fig. 4b). We next wanted to test whether uPA regulates p53 expression by altering MDM2 expression, an oncoprotein that prevents the accumulation of p53 by targeting it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (35Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13777-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 36Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). We initially treated Beas2B cells with two concentrations of uPA (50 and 1000 ng/ml) for 0-24 h and analyzed for the expression of MDM2 protein by Western blot using anti-MDM2 antibody. At concentrations of 50 ng/ml, uPA induced MDM2 expression around 3 h followed by a sharp decline to basal level around 24 h (Fig. 4c), whereas at higher uPA concentrations, MDM2 expression was induced, and this elevated level was maintained up to 24 h (Fig. 4d). We next treated Beas2B cells with varying amounts of uPA and found that uPA induces MDM2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4e). Effects of Phosphatase and Phosphotyrosine Kinase Inhibitors on uPA-mediated p53 Induction—To address our strong inference that uPA-mediated p53 expression involves cellular signaling, we pretreated Beas2B cells with herbimycin A and genistein separately or in combination with uPA. As shown in Fig. 5a, herbimycin A and genistein alone did not induce p53 expression nor did either inhibitor reverse uPA-media"

Hydropathy analysis and sequence comparison predicted a mature protein with nine transmembrane-spanning segments, consistent with the structural topologies of other known mammalian and teleost NCX isoforms. Overall sequence comparison shows high identity to both trout NCX-TR1.0 (∼81%) and mammalian NCX1.1 (∼73%), and phylogenetic analyses confirmed its identity as a member of the NCX1 gene family, expressing exons A, C, D, and F in the alternative splice site. Sequence identity is even higher in the α-repeats, the exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP) site, and Ca2+-binding domains, which is reflected in the functional and regulatory properties of tilapia NCX-TL1.0. When NCX-TL1.0 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and the currents were measured in giant excised patches, they displayed both positive regulation by Ca2+ and Na+-dependent inactivation in a manner similar to trout NCX-TR1.0. However, tilapia NCX-TL1.0 exhibited a relatively high sensitivity to temperature compared with trout NCX-TR1.0. Whereas trout NCX-TR1.0 currents displayed activation energies of ∼7 kJ/mol, tilapia NCX-TL1.0 currents showed mammal-like temperature dependence, with peak and steady-state current activation energies of 53 ± 9 and 67 ± 21 kJ/mol, respectively. Using comparative sequence analysis, we highlighted 10 residue positions in the N-terminal domain of the NCX that, in combination, may confer exchanger temperature dependence through subtle changes in protein flexibility. Tilapia NCX-TL1.0 represents the first non-mammalian NCX to exhibit a mammalian temperature dependence phenotype and will prove to be a useful model in defining the interplay between molecular flexibility and stability in NCX function.

The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) 1The abbreviations used are: NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; XIP, exchanger inhibitory peptide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TMS, transmembrane segment(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; XIP, exchanger inhibitory peptide; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TMS, transmembrane segment(s); MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. is a polytopic membrane protein that belongs to the cation/Ca2+ antiporter superfamily of Ca2+ transporters. Catalyzing the electrogenic exchange of three Na+ ions for one Ca2+ ion, the NCX plays a key role in regulating cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in many different cell types. The NCX is present in a wide array of species, with high overall sequence identity and conservation of ion transport and regulatory components (1Cai X. Lytton J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2004; 21: 1692-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Marshall C.R. Fox J.A. Butland S.L. Ouellette B.F. Brinkman F.S. Tibbits G.F. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, knowledge of the molecular function of the NCX is based primarily on examination of mammalian isoforms and is therefore restrictive from a phylogenetic perspective. Examination of non-mammalian isoforms has previously provided valuable insights into NCX function (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J.

Physiol. 1996; 108: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The NCX gene family consists of three cloned members present in vertebrates, NCX1 (6Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), NCX2 (7Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NCX3 (8Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that these exchanger isoforms arose from separate gene duplication events occurring before the emergence of vertebrates, as evidenced by the presence of all three NCX genes in fish species (2Marshall C.R. Fox J.A. Butland S.L. Ouellette B.F. Brinkman F.S. Tibbits G.F. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, a putative fourth member of the NCX family present only in fish species was derived from genomic data, but has unknown function and expression patterns at this time (2Marshall C.R. Fox J.A. Butland S.L. Ouellette B.F. Brinkman F.S. Tibbits G.F. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The relative expression of the NCX among tissues varies greatly and is generally correlative with the need for a high degree of transmembrane Ca2+ flux regulated in a precise manner. Whereas NCX2 and NCX3 are found exclusively in the brain and skeletal muscle, expression of NCX1 is virtually ubiquitous, with the highest levels present in excitable tissues (9Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, differential expression of exons from the alternative splice site yields an array of NCX splice variants that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (9Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kofuji P. Hadley R.W. Kieval R.S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1241-C1249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The highest exchange activity is in the heart, where the role of cardiac NCX1.1 in excitation-contraction coupling has been studied extensively (11Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 12Hilgemann D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1167-C1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). NCX1.1 serves as the prime mechanism of Ca2+ extrusion from the cardiomyocyte and is therefore an important contributor to relaxation (14Bers D.M. Bassani J.W. Bassani R.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Bridge J.H. Spitzer K.W. Ershler P.R. Science. 1988; 241: 823-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that reverse mode exchange can contribute to cardiac contraction via Ca2+ influx (16Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 17Leblanc N. Hume J.R. Science. 1990; 248: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 18Wasserstrom J.A. Vites A.M. J.

Schlotthauer K. Li L. Yuan W. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 23Pogwizd S.M. Bers D.M. Trends Cardiovasc.

Cardiol. 1993; 21: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Imahashi K. Kusuoka H. Hashimoto K. Yoshioka J. Yamaguchi H. Nishimura T. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1401-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind NCX function is crucial to understanding and manipulating its role in the heart.Previously, we used temperature as a probe to gain insight into the molecular function of the NCX (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marshall C. Elias C. Xue X.H. Le H.D. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C512-C520Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in Ca2+ active transport and regulation in the mammalian heart, such as NCX1.1, are highly temperature-dependent (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Homologous proteins in cold-adapted species have evolved differently to maintain adequate cardiac function under conditions that are cardioplegic to mammals. Using both native (29Tibbits G.F. Philipson K.D. Kashihara H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C411-C417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proteins, it has been shown that the temperature dependence of NCX1 from cold- and warm-adapted species varies substantially. Comparison of peak outward exchange currents from cloned trout NCX-TR1.0 and canine NCX1.1 gave Q10 values (-fold change in activity/10 °C change in temperature) of 1.1 and 2.4, respectively (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, these disparities in temperature dependence are not due to differences in inactivation kinetics or NCX regulatory properties. At the amino acid level, these isoforms exhibit high overall identity (∼73%), which is significantly higher in the α-repeat region (∼92%), the exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP) site (∼85%), and regulatory Ca2+-binding domains (95%). Construction of trout and canine NCX chimeras revealed that the region responsible for the differential temperature dependence between isoforms is within the N-terminal transmembrane domain (27Marshall C. Elias C. Xue X.H. Le H.D. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C512-C520Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This region composes approximately one-third of the protein, including the first five transmembrane segments up to the end of the XIP site. Further attempts to define specific areas or substitutions responsible for the temperature dependence of the exchanger have proven difficult and given equivocal results. 2C. R. Marshall, H. D. Le, A. Omelchenko, L. V. Hryshko, and G. F. Tibbits, unpublished data. 2C. R. Marshall, H. D. Le, A. Omelchenko, L. V. Hryshko, and G. F. Tibbits, unpublished data.Despite the high overall identity between trout NCX-TR1.0 and canine NCX1.1, the species are separated by ∼450 million years of evolution (30Hedges S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). To make a more accurate comparison between NCX proteins adapted to high and low temperatures, examination of more closely related NCX isoforms may reduce the number of substitution permutations required to confer the temperature dependence phenotype. Teleosts successfully populate habitats over a large temperature range, and as such, their proteins have evolved to function accordingly. Tilapias (Oreochromis sp.) are euryhaline teleosts that inhabit environments ranging from freshwater to seawater of high salinity and can withstand temperatures as high as 42 °C (31Wilson P.J.

Costa-Pierce B.A. Rakocy J. Tilapia Aquaculture in the Americas. 2. World Aquaculture Society, Baton Rouge, FL2000: 1-20Google Scholar). Due to their tolerance of relatively extreme environments, tilapias have gained important roles as model organisms in the laboratory (31Wilson P.J. Wood C.M. Walsh P.J. Bergman A.N. Bergman H.L.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this study, we have chosen the Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) as a model system because the cardiac NCX from this species has likely adapted to function at temperatures similar to those in the mammalian heart, but lethal to trout. We report here the cDNA cloning and characterization of tilapia NCX-TL1.0 and demonstrate, for the first time, a non-mammalian NCX with mammal-like temperature dependence of Na+/Ca2+ exchange.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Cultured tilapias (O. mossambicus; weighing 40∼50 g) were maintained at the Institute of Zoology (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan) in freshwater (local tap water) at 27 °C under a 14-h light/10-h dark photoperiod.RNA Extraction—Tilapias were killed with a sharp blow to the head. An appropriate amount of heart tissue (∼0.5 g) was collected and homogenized in 4 ml of solution containing 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 1.25 m sodium citrate, 35% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. Tissue homogenates were mixed with 0.4 ml of 2 m sodium acetate, 0.8 ml of chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (49:1), and 4 ml of phenol and shaken thoroughly. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. Pellets were precipitated by another centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with 70% alcohol, and stored at –20 °C prior to use. The amount and quality of the total RNA were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm with a Hitachi U-2000 spectrophotometer and by running RNA-denatured gels.cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—For cloning and sequencing, mRNA was purified from the total RNA of three tilapia hearts using an Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). The cDNA used for all subsequent PCR cloning was prepared by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). A partial cDNA fragment was amplified by PCR using forward (5′-AARCARAARCAYCCNGA-3′) and reverse (5′-ACRAAYTGYTCNCKCCA-3′) degenerate primers based on conserved domains within the intracellular loop of canine NCX1.1 (GenBank™ accession number M57523). The forward primer corresponds to a region just downstream of the XIP site (nucleotides 1018–1035), whereas the reverse primer matches a region just before transmembrane segment (TMS)-6 (nucleotides 2248–2265). For PCR amplification, 2 μl of cDNA was used as template in a 50-μl final reaction volume containing 0.25 mm dNTP, 2.5 units of Ex Taq™ DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and 0.2 μm each primer. For PCR, the reaction conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were purified and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Nucleotide sequencing was determined with an ABI 377 Automated DNA Sequencer. From these partial sequences, specific 5′- and 3′-RACE primers were designed and used for subsequent PCR steps. PCR products were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. The full-length tilapia NCX-TL1.0 clone was covered by three overlapping fragments, each ∼1 kb in length. These three fragments were ligated together to produce the full-length clone.Expression of Tilapia NCX-TL1.0 in Xenopus Oocytes—Full-length tilapia NCX-TL1.0 was subcloned from the original sequencing pGEM-T Easy vector into the expression vector pBSTA. To do this, BglII sites were introduced at the start and stop codons of tilapia NCX-TL1.0 in the pGEM-T Easy vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pBSTA vector contains the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin, which, in the final construct, replaced the endogenous tilapia untranslated regions and flanked the coding region. The pBSTA vector containing full-length tilapia NCX-TL1.0 was linearized with SacII, and cRNA was synthesized in vitro using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The cRNA amount was assessed spectroscopically, whereas cRNA purity was determined using RNA-containing 1% agarose gel. Oocytes were prepared as described previously (36Longoni S. Coady M.J. Ikeda T. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C870-C873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and injected with 46 nl of cRNA diluted to 0.5 ng/nl. Tilapia NCX-TL1.0 exchange activity was assessed 3–7 days after injection using the giant excised patch technique (see below).Electrophysiology—Using the giant excised patch technique, we measured outward Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents as described previously (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marshall C. Elias C. Xue X.H. Le H.D. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C512-C520Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes with the vitellin layer removed were placed in a solution containing 100 mm KOH, 100 mm MES, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgCl2, and pH was adjusted to 7.0 at room temperature (∼22–23 °C) with MES. Borosilicate glass pipettes were polished (inner diameter of ∼20–30 μm) and coated with a Parafilm/mineral oil mixture. Suction was used to form gigaohm seals, and membrane patches were excised by moving the pipette tip. The pipette (extracellular) solution contained 100 mm N-methylglucamine/MES, 30 mm HEPES, 30 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 16 mm sulfamic acid, 8 mm CaCO3, 6 mm KOH, 0.25 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm niflumic acid, and 0.1 mm flufenamic acid, and pH was adjusted to 7.0 with MES. The bath (cytosolic) solutions contained 100 mm sodium or lithium aspartate, 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 20 mm CsOH, 10 mm EGTA, 0–7.3 mm CaCO3, and 1.0–1.13 mm Mg(OH)2 (pH 7.0) with MES or LiOH. MAXC software (37Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) was used to adjust Mg2+ and Ca2+ to yield free concentrations of 1 mm and 0, 1, or 10 μm, respectively. Outward Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents were activated by switching from Li+- to Na+-based bath solution and were recorded at 30, 14, and 7 °C. To account for current rundown within a single patch, multiple current traces at all three temperatures were measured. Hardware and software from Axon Instruments, Inc. were used for data acquisition and analysis.Current Trace Analyses and Statistics—Inactivation kinetics and temperature dependence parameters for the tilapia NCX-TL1.0 currents were calculated as described previously (3Elias C.L. Xue X.H. Marshall C.R. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C993-C1000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inactivation rate constant (λ) was obtained by fitting current-time traces to a single exponential. The energy of activation (Ea) and temperature coefficient (Q10) were calculated as indices of temperature dependence as described by Marshall et al. (27Marshall C. Elias C. Xue X.H. Le H.D. Omelchenko A. Hryshko L.V. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C512-C520Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All values are displayed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance of the results was determined by mean comparison using Tukey's test and one-way analysis of variance performed with Microcal Origin and GraphPad software. Unless indicated otherwise, a p value <0.05 was considered significantly different.Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic Analysis—Sequence and phylogenetic analyses were performed as described previously (2Marshall C.R. Fox J.A. Butland S.L. Ouellette B.F. Brinkman F.S. Tibbits G.F. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sequence data were acquired from either the NCBI Non-redundant Protein Database or derived from whole genome sequences. The following sequences were obtained from the NCBI Protein Database: human NCX1.1 (GenBank™ gi:10863913), human NCX2.1 (gi:10720116), human NCX3.3 (gi:22087483), rainbow trout NCX-TR1.0 (gi:6273849), and green spotted pufferfish NCX (gi:47219419). NCX1, NCX2, NCX3, and NCX4 from Fugu rubripes (Japanese pufferfish) and Danio rerio (zebrafish) were derived from whole genome sequences (2Marshall C.R. Fox J.A. Butland S.L. Ouellette B.F. Brinkman F.S. Tibbits G.F. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Acquired NCX sequences were aligned with ClustalX (Version 1.83) (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69138) Google Scholar) using the default parameters. The alignment was then imported into GeneDoc (Version 2.6.002) (39Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield II, D.W. embnet. news. 1997; (http://www.embnet.org/download/embnetnews/embnet_news_4_2.pdf)Google Scholar) for manual editing and creation of figures. Neighbor-joining trees were generated using ClustalX, followed by tree evaluation with bootstrap re-sampling (1000 times). The program TreeView (Version 1.6.6) (40Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) was used to examine and display the resulting phylogram and was rooted with invertebrate CALX (gi:2266953) from fruit fly. The variable alternative splice site of the NCX was not included in subsequent phylogenetic analyses due to the high potential for homoplasy in this region.RESULTSTilapia NCX-TL1.0 cDNA and Deduced Protein Topology—A 3106-bp cDNA clone was isolated from the heart of Mozambique tilapia (GenBank™ accession number AY283779) using a combination of RT-PCR and 5′- and 3′-RACE. An open reading frame of 2871 bp is initiated by a methionine at nucleotide 59 associated with a partial Kozak initiation site, ACCATGA (with the start codon in italics). This open reading frame encodes a protein of 957 amino acids (designated NCX-TL1.0) with a deduced molecular mass of 107 kDa. The 174-bp 3′-untranslated region (excluding the stop codon) does not contain a polyadenylation signal.The deduced amino acid sequence for tilapia NCX-TL1.0 is shown in Fig. 1. The only other teleost NCX to be cloned and characterized, trout NCX-TR1.0 (GenBank™ accession number AF175313), is aligned for comparison of the sequences. The topology of tilapia NCX-TL1.0 is similar to that of trout NCX-TR1.0 (41Xue X.H. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Tibbits G.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C693-C700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and canine NCX1.1 (6Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) based on hydropathy analysis (42Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17007) Google Scholar) and prediction of secondary structure using PSI-PRED (43Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4386) Google Scholar) (data not shown). For tilapia NCX-TL1.0, an N-terminal signal peptide with a cleavage site between residues 31 and 32 was predicted both through homology to experimentally determined NCX signal peptides (44Durkin J.T. Ahrens D.C. Pan Y.C. Reeves J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 45Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1151: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and by the prediction program SignalP (Version 3.0) (46Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5608) Google Scholar). In the N-terminal region of mature tilapia NCX-TL1.0 (between the signal cleavage site and TMS1), there are two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 10 and 15 (aspargines). If glycosylation of tilapia NCX-TL1.0 and mammalian NCX1 is similar, then Asn10 in NCX-TL1.0 would be glycosylated; however, this requires experimental conformation. In addition, the cysteines at positions 19 and 25 are homologous to positions 14 and 20 in mammalian NCX1, which are thought to be involved in a disulfide bond with Cys792 (47Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This latter cysteine is located in the extracellular loop between TMS6 and TMS7 and corresponds to Cys780 in tilapia NCX-TL1.0.Overall sequence comparison of full-length tilapia NCX-TL1.0 and trout NCX-TR1.0 shows ∼81% identity at the amino acid level. As expected, identity is especially high in the α-repeats (∼95%), the XIP site (90%), and Ca2+-binding domains (100%). Phylogenetic analysis confirmed NCX-TL1.0 as a member of the NCX1 gene family, expressing exons A, C, D, and F in the alternative splice site. The phylogram in Fig. 2 shows the evolutionary relationship of all known NCX isoforms from fish.Fig. 2Phylogeny of NCX from fish species. Shown is a neighbor-joining phylogram of the fish species NCX gene family constructed with bootstrap re-sampling (1000 data sets). The sequences of rainbow trout NCX-TR1.0 (ncx1 trout) and green spotted pufferfish NCX (ncx4 gr puffer) were obtained from the NCBI Non-redundant Protein Database. The sequences of NCX1, NCX2, NCX3, and NCX4 from F. rubripes (ncx1–4 fugu) and D. rerio (ncx1–4 danio) were derived previously from whole genome sequences (2Marshall C.R. Fox J.A. Butland S.L. Ouellette B.F. Brinkman F.S. Tibbits G.F. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The tree is rooted with the CALX exchanger from fruit fly, and tilapia NCX-TL1.0 is shown in boldface (NCX1 tilapia). Percent identities to tilapia NCX-TL1.0 are indicated in brackets.
